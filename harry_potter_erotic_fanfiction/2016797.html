 disclaimer written before the hbp this tale presents an alternate sixth year in which dumbledore lives draco is more than a foil to harry and blaise zabini is a girl think of her as the other bz d i hope readers who ship draco ginny will enjoy the story which includes dancing with faeries celtic and norse mythology school holidays in london and spain and loads of fantasy and romance chapter 1 matchmaker matchmaker if i squint just so the dust motes twirling in the sunlight look rather like faeries smiling dreamily at the thought luna lovegood turned her attention back to the professor prosing on about some play called much ado about nothing i like that title the ravenclaw fifth year mused sounds like my friends love lives she made an effort to really listen muggle studies was one of luna favourite classes today professor hands was explaining the vagaries of the muggle author shakespeare and how the man had carefully adapted stories from the works of others adding clever dialogue and characters to make them his own the ravenclaws in the classroom cawed in approval well perhaps not cawed exactly but it would have suited their inquisitive natures she thought from her father the editor of the quibbler luna had inherited the tendency to embellish the truth a bit only sometimes however and only unimportant details that begged to be made more interesting she would never actually lie about anything tuning back in to the professor lecture luna wrapped a long strand of dirty blonde hair around her finger idly she watched the digit slowly turn blue from lack of circulation wrongly thinking that a girl who was playing with her hair could not possibly be paying attention the professor said miss lovegood please tell the class what you have learned so far about this play blinking in a deceptively sleepy manner she replied the claudio and hero part of the story is the adapted element of the play probably from belleforest translation of his histoires tragiques that couple isntvery interesting the other couple that shakespeare created himself beatrice and benedick is much livelier the play wouldntbe worth reading without the quarrelling couple the plot revolves around them while professor hands stood speechless luna casually released her now purple finger from its wrapping of hair she noticed ginny weasley giving her the standard you are so weird look purposefully sending a misty look and smile in return she was gratified when ginny eyes widened with alarm and she hastily turned back around in her seat the professor had recovered sufficiently from his surprise to rattle off the instructions for the class assignment it appeared that they would be paired up to write an essay of their choice about whatever aspect of the play they liked most most of the boys partnered together right away it wasnta shock that several pairs chose the blundering watchmen as the subject of their essays luna didntexpect anyone to voluntarily pick her as partner she usually got stuck with whoever was left after all the other choices were made it didntbother her she met loads of interesting people that way thinking about the play and what kind of essay she might like to write the oddballs she was left with always let her choose luna said audibly i wish there was some way to test the she outwardly loathes him inwardly loves him and vice versa theory why dontyou partner up with me then the girl sitting behind her drawled challengingly great minds thinking alike and all i know the perfect couple to test the theory on blaise zabini had been bored out of her skull until she heard loony luna say her fateful thoughts aloud the lone sixth year slytherin stuck in a class with a bunch of fifth year ravenclaws and gryffindors she had been slumped down in her seat snidely counting the number of times the pedantic professor said indeed when the otherworldly voice had spoken those brilliant idea inspiring words she wouldnteven be in the asinine class if her mother wasntsuch a snob edina wouldnthear of her pureblood daughter learning about nasty muggles last year when the rest of her friends took the class eddy zabini had been so sure that the course would never be made mandatory she thought sourly thanks a lot mother dearest fat lot you knew now i have to study nasty muggles without a single friend to make it bearable because only this bloody class fits into my schedule i ll be wasting a year learning much ado about nothing hey that sounds like draco droning on about harry potter blaise had been indifferently watching the weasley girl stare at lovegood while thinking about the self proclaimed prince of slytherin when she d heard luna wish there was a way to test shakespeare theory the idea had burst forth fully realised like venus from the waves see there i already know loads of muggle tosh mother wouldntyou be shocked and dismayed she curled her lip at the mental image of her mother passed out from shock luna was now staring at her with those big bug eyes other than her eyes the rest of the girl looked normal medium height fair skin and hair normal number of fingers and toes those clear blue eyes though would unnerve her if she believed in any of that sixth sense precognition crap thankfully years of divination with dotty trelawney had put her wise to the fact that most of that mumbo jumbo was pure gobshite raising her brows and thinking save it for the gullible blaise waited to hear what the loony girl would say hmm blaise might be the most interesting oddball partner yet taking her time before replying luna studied the slytherin currently sneering at her she d seen the girl sitting with malfoy group in the great hall blaise zabini had clear olive skin brown hair and brown eyes it was easy to see what started the rumours with her short curls tall slim frame striking features and habit of never wearing jewellery or makeup someone unobservant could easily mistake the girl for a boy during blaise first year pansy parkinson had the pug faced girl had gone around telling everyone she was going to kiss that gorgeous boy blaise under the mistletoe before christmas break when pansy cornered blaise as promised she got a bloody nose instead of a kiss the humiliation was worsened by draco malfoy cruel retelling of the story to all their mutual friends who then ensured the whole school knew the story still made the rounds every christmas malfoy had known about pansy mistaken idea and done nothing to correct it that would ve ruined his fun since then he d made a point of mockingly complimenting blaise and asking pansy if she agreed pansy had retaliated by spreading rumours not about draco who deserved it but about blaise who didn t i would be narky too if everyone speculated which sex i was and which sex i liked luna thought sympathetically she supposed blaise hung out with malfoy group because they were her only option that was incredibly sad deciding to become the prickly girl friend she said what and who did you have in mind the wicked smile spreading across the girl face made luna wonder who she could pair blaise up with she took a moment to contemplate the boys she knew neville too scared justin finch fletchley believed rumours too easily terry boot a definite maybe the ravenclaw sixth year was wise enough not to listen to rumours and witty enough to appreciate zabini snarky humour even better terry was tall forcing herself to shelve the idea for a later time luna returned her attention to the student staring at her with a sardonic brow raised was the ability to raise a single brow common to every slytherin or just the ones she knew wait pansy couldntdo it but then she was more like malfoy pet pug wasntshe giving a half smile in acknowledgement of her drifting train of thought luna widened her eyes to show that she was listening attentively to what the other girl was saying alright we do a blah blah essay on the contrasting lovers i ll toss off a half scroll of parchment and give it to you next class for your input that class stuff the real partnership will be us taking the play to a hogwarts level you will convince our beatrice blaise said lowering her voice conspiringly ginny weasley and i will convince our benedick draco malfoy that the other has the hots for them then we step back and see if real life imitates art blaise became serious it wontbe lying because i think its true or it could be with a little help from us intense brown eyes became searching donttell me that the thought of pulling this off taking those two down a peg in their best interest of course isnttempting professor hands was telling the students to wrap up their conversations class was over luna thought the idea was brilliant and said i in where can we meet and go over the plan she frowned if we have a plan do we have a plan blaise answered after dinner under the dragon claw willow and after i read the bloody play we will definitely have a plan ignoring ginny s soon to be beatrice s odd looks luna said a cheery goodbye to the girl who merely smirked a farewell pretending to listen to pansy whine about some girl who had said something to someone about her draco malfoy slouched on the bench chin in hand gazing up at the enchanted ceiling of the great hall lips pursed slightly in displeasure he fervently wished that either a shooting star would descend to blast the blathering twit or someone would put him out of his misery ask and ye shall receive blaise zabini stood by the slytherin table smiling shove over goyle draco waited for his hulking associate to push his way further down the bench and casually gestured to the now vacant spot have a seat zabini and tell me what the blazes you re talking about you looked like you were asking the heavens for deliverance here i am his eyes narrowed as draco considered the cheeky girl beside him something was different about zabini tonight instead of asking what she thought he needed to be delivered from he changed tact and jeered gone off the androgynous look have we his insolent gaze lingered on the slight amount of brown eyeliner and the hint of powder and lip gloss the girl wore you re looking very girly he gave a look of icy approval blaise laughed i ve gone off wanting to torment pansy about her little mistake back in first year it too boring to be fun anymore she sneered across the table at the pug faced girl indignant screech i do hope some pathetic confused girls she said with a derogatory glance at the now sputtering pansy wontbe too devastated to know i only interested in boys a smile of true amusement spread across draco face ha good one he paused to nod in smiling emphasis blaise thanks draco the girl said smilingly ignoring parkinson incoherent sounds of rage to concentrate on her dinner after a few moments of eating in silence while impatiently listening to inane conversations he caught his neighbour eye and jibed if you re not going to help me torture pansy anymore blaise what good are you as expected the girl rose immediately to the bait you need me to tell you no you ve got too many boot licking arse kissing girls clinging like leeches malfoy you dontneed a yes woman you need a no woman a no woman he repeated with amused incredulity no one in slytherin says no to draco malfoy except the one you want to say no no to being the flavour of the week no to letting you copy her notes no to laughing at a joke when its not funny and if you dontask nicely no to telling you what interesting thing i heard in moronic muggles today draco turned to straddle the bench to look this slytherin goddess full on he always knew zabini was a deep one but this was unexpected and intriguing too bad she didntwant to be a flavour of the week he smiled when the irreverent girl put a hand on the bench and leaned slightly away to meet his gaze she might have lasted a month he looked through thick blond lashes girls gave him anything he wanted when he did that and drawled by all means do tell what interesting thing was said running a finger down her cheek he whispered seductively blaise draco restrained the urge to smile victoriously at the slight blush on the girl cheeks all the ladies loved him a glimpse of bright red hair from the corner of his eye made him scowl well all ladies love me except one weaselette who wouldntbe half bad if she wasntsuch a fury i see you looking cantresist can you draco smiled inwardly while covertly watching ginny glare temper temper you ll never get a boyfriend other than that creevey looking like that red the smug teen decided to do something to make the girl even happier he d find out about zabini teaser but he wanted to give his watcher something she could really glare about her disapproval was so entertaining draco started tracing blaise full lips with a finger trying to decide which patented malfoy move to try next for ginny viewing pleasure he challenged with a cool smile sooo if you re going to be girly now when are you getting rid of the baggy robes blaise c mon let the world in on what you re hiding under there he gaped when she promptly slid off the bench and stood before him grinning the girl opened her robes to flash what was underneath a white tank and black jeans hugged her fit body quickly closing her robes as the students around them burst into whistles and whispers blaise leant down to say i d better go before someone tattles to snape i ll tell you what i heard later but i ll leave you with a hint it about someone who is glaring daggers at us right this minute looking over at the gryffindor table while blaise sauntered from the room he saw ginny weasley glaring at him so furiously he was relieved that looks couldntkill draco laughed his arse off at the ridiculousness of the entire situation how dare that horrid malfoy have such an infectious laugh ginevra weasley thought angrily she tried to continue giving her glare of death stop twitching you disobedient lips it isntfunny in the least no one will wonder if zabini a girl now will they how dare she flash that arrogant git and waltz out leaving him laughing like a hyena i thought she was the one of the few decent people in the entire slytherin house but obviously she as big a shameless hussy as that cow pansy parkinson did you just call blaise zabini a shameless hussy harry potter green eyes were filled with laughter ginny looked down the table to the smiling boy did i say that aloud sorry one of mum favourite expressions i afraid are you going to call her a scarlet woman next hermione giggled beside her are you going to keep bringing that up for as long as we both shall live on the other side of hermione ron seemed to bitterly regret that he had ever used his mum phrase in a row with the amused girl sounds like a marriage vow brother something you re not telling us in the uproar following that comment ginny escaped the unwanted attention everyone had been giving her own slip she glanced casually back to the slytherin table malfoy was smirking at her tossing her hair ginny refused to even acknowledge the disgusting prat existence she would not look not even out of the corner of her eye or in the reflection of colin goblet that malfoy stupid girls slobbering all over him constantly must have driven him spare he really thought he was some slytherin god of love what a laugh lust was more like it malfoy hard heart loved no one which was a dear happiness to girls like her girls too smart to fall for a cold fish like him even if he did look gorgeous when he smiled for real instead of giving one of his usual smirks even if his laughter did make her want to laugh with him who cared sirius as a dog had been more attractive to her than that git really she d rather hear a dog bark than draco whatever over at the ravenclaw table luna observed ginny stabbing her defenceless meat with fury and then saw draco smirking with satisfaction lowering mini omnioculars luna smiled at them fondly they were the best christmas present her father had ever given her last year informing her roommates that she was off to do a bit of research luna left the great hall with the wonderful feeling that she was embarking on a marvellous adventure once the doors closed behind her she looked around to see if anyone was watching only slightly disappointed the coast was clear she began skipping down the corridor merrily singing off key weasley is our king a n march 23 2007 matchmakers is completely edited although the story was always brilliant lol it needed to be changed to uk spelling and polished up not only because i started posting it on sites like mugglenet fictionalley and the fire ice archive but because i love this story and want to present it to ff readers in the best light special thanks to die loreley whose review to tell me she had re read the fic made me want to go back and edit and new readers who provided the impetus for me to put thought into action chapter 10 one step forward two steps back why would zabini want mousse but no spoon it was the evening following what gossips termed the chocolate scandal but ron was still clueless about what had actually happened harry wide eyed look told ginny not to expect him to explain the facts of life to the boy who acted thicker than mousse she smiled wryly wondering if her brother had fallen on his head as a baby mum loved to tell stories of how fred and george so loved to tote their ickle ronnikins about what if whenever they wandered out of parental view the twins had also loved to play toss the ronald she caught hermione eye and smiled sympathetically although inwardly ginny wondered if her friend wasntobtuse when it came to romance the girl had spent ages with ron in the astronomy tower and the only thrill she had received was standing next to the oblivious boy oh wait there was that magical moment when ron had brushed hermione hand while he reached to adjust the telescope for his friend how sad grim and pathetic that she d packed more romance into ten minutes with malfoy under the bloody slytherin table than the hapless pair had during hours gazing at the stars here was proof that romance came from the brain and needed no external stimuli thoughts of draco lead to glancing over at the slytherin table ginny bit her lip he was looking at her oh gods he was so and smiled so and she wanted so much to play exploding snap ginny ron might be dense at times but he was a good brother smiling at him she shook her head and turned to face draco who was watching her with a lifted brow ginny said clearly i going to the library i not stupid ginny you donthave to enunciate like that she laughed enunciate huh i guess not brother dear later ginny sulkily contemplated her finished homework scattered across the library table she should leave he wasntcoming and why she cared her mood lifted when draco arrived he sat across from her and opened up a heavy tome his agile looking fingers flipped through the pages until he stopped read for a while and then unrolled a parchment and began writing with a quill draco worked steadily without glancing up once she was piqued he hadnteven said hello ginny shrugged and packed away her things before deciding to enjoy the view she spent several dreamy minutes attempting to catalogue every striking feature hair like something out of the seelie court eyes quicksilver or rain or clouds nose classical arrogant perfect skin pale like porcelain mouth soft but firm chiselled tempting smiling like what you see red as long as he kept his attention on work she refused to dignify that remark even though the answer was yes his behaviour was maddening what was he up to i up to the last sentence of an essay enumerating the important dates during the goblin rebellion of 1776 it seems that england lost her colony as a result wizard preoccupation on the goblin front left the muggles on their own in the war effort dull stuff oh gods did i just say that aloud she startled when draco looked up his lips twitched at the corners no ginny you didntsay that aloud i read your mind through wandless legilimency oh gods i ve been thinking about how perfect looking and tempting he is that was a joke ginevra i could feel you staring and then you did say what is he doing aloud other than that you are extremely easy to read is that a gryffindor trait letting every thought and emotion show so boldly he gave her considering glances saying with a half smile your reaction to the thought of my reading your mind was very interesting having naughty thoughts about me were you her blush to rival her hair colour must have answered that question because draco smile widened into something even more sinfully appealing will you feel better if i confess to thinking naughty things about you too ginny yes why do you keep repeating my name draco so you do remember our little bargain made under the table i remember everything abruptly draco rolled his parchment before stowing his things and rising to his feet stretching like a great cat coming round and pulling her chair back he gestured for her to follow ginny brows drew together what was he up to he answered her unspoken question by lifting the heavy tome and saying care to help me shelve it she nodded and followed him up the stairs to the deserted third floor draco headed to the back where he re shelved the text hands free he reached out and pulled her close ginny shivered as he brushed strands away from her ear her pulse leapt when he whispered thanks for the help with my homework bemused she asked how did i help her gaze focused on draco mouth you gave me reason to finish quickly he murmured before parting her lips in a kiss ginny melted into the embrace this was what she d longed to feel with harry with michael with dean but never had she surrendered to the need to touch his hair and explore his mouth happily aware the library would remain open for another glorious hour the dimming of the library magicked candles and torches brought draco back to himself he smiled at the girl dazedly opening her eyes desire was weighing down her lids and it was all for him he felt something unfamiliar it was as though every negative emotion he had ever experienced had drained away bizarrely he wanted to shout with laughter and spin ginny around in circles until she was dizzy he kept his composure but inwardly chuckled at the fanciful thought of waltzing her out of the library and carrying her away somewhere private what are you thinking he cradled her face with his hands and softly pressed kisses to her eyelids and her lips struck by a brilliant idea i thinking you should go with me to hogsmeade tomorrow soft brown eyes widened in surprise it was a bold idea more suited to a gryffindor than a slytherin he smiled at the radical notion of a malfoy and a weasley strolling through town together what will people think draco laughed who cares we re the only ones who matter c mon i ll buy you sweets little girl ginny didntsmilingly agree as he d expected she looked stricken my friends would care my family i donteven want to imagine everyone in gryffindor would care i cantjust throw you in their face they wontunderstand they will eventually he said persuasively look i promise to ignore potty and weasel your brother i will be civil i ll bite my tongue if i have to i ll do it for you lifting her downcast face he said i want to spend time with you ginny get to know you and let you know me he took hope from her smile we can do that i want that we can just go separately and meet up somewhere draco grew tense what you go with your friends i go with blaise and we sneak off to be together because you re ashamed to be seen with a slytherin is that it her face turned pink i not ashamed i realistic i have ranted about how much i loathe you for years i cantjust go swanning into the three broomsticks with you he stroked her cheek sure you can it like that play you re reading in muggle studies much ado about nothing dontthey start off loathing each other but in the end they re together that a play draco fiction make believe not reality this is real and and what you want to keep meeting on the sly snogging under tables and in the back of the library she bit her lip it not like that i just want to wait awhile until what potty weasel and granger give their blessing and welcome a malfoy into their charmed circle when will that happen do you suppose days months years malfoy realised that his tone was becoming louder sharper how long red tears were shining in her eyes i dontknow i dontknow anything not even why i thought this would ever work you must really be a love god malfoy a few of your kisses and i insane enough to believe that he felt his stomach twist as ginny face crumpled it not going to work no one i love will ever accept you and nothing is going to change that what about our feelings they wontchange either he said roughly part of him recoiling from the emotion implied salazar slytherin had he actually admitted to having feelings feelings for an instant he thought she would give in but her eyes and expression grew hard know what shakespeare says about love malfoy what is love tis not hereafter present mirth hath present laughter what to come is still unsure draco couldntbelieve his ears how had everything gone so wrong that shakespeare stuff it sounded right but there was something important left out his face twisted bloody hell who cared about some old dead muggle anyway he had to say something ginny that was another bad idea malfoy the library will be closing in five minutes if you wish to check out please bring your books to the librarian desk madam pince spell amplified voice broke the heavy silence between the two draco allowed his customary mask of indifference to fall into place after years of use it felt natural and so much more comfortable than emotionality he drawled coolly see you around then weasley a single tear rolled down red cheek before she dashed away was it supposed to be a comfort that she shared his misery outwardly impassive draco made his way out of the library and turned toward his house nearing the slytherin corridor he saw crabbe who exclaimed i ve been looking everywhere for you goyle brother sent him a bottle of firewhisky draco forced his lips into a slight smile nodding his acceptance of the unspoken invitation to get royally pissed bitterly he decided that alcohol was a fine way to forget the look on ginny s no weaselette face that said more plainly than if she d spoken the words aloud not if i see you first hours later the prince of slytherin had banished his court from the common room he presided over the chamber alone with an almost empty bottle of firewhisky draco sneered at crabbe and goyle passed out on sofas across the room some people couldnthold their liquor he rose unsteadily he d removed his socks and shoes long ago and now swayed as he threw his robes on top of the other items on the floor slouching down on the sofa he looked around the room through the last inch of amber fluid left in the bottle bloody boring as ever morose as he was draco did have one happy thought snape had used the elf slinky to return the robes without any reprimand whatsoever good ole snapey he and lorelei are probably slithering around the sheets right this minute his lips quirked roguishly over the thought of professor lorelei and then grimaced at the thought of lorelei and snape stomach churning he took a swig from the bottle he was considering trying to drag his sorry arse up the stairs when blaise came back from her romantic rendezvous squinting he blearily noticed that her mouth without a speck of lipstick was red and swollen she walked towards him brows drawn in concern there was a small mark on her elegant neck he d been careful not to leave one on ginny feeling vicious he leered congratulations the whole school talking about your little chocolate incident with boot dark brown eyes evaluated his mussed hair bare feet and the drunken snores echoing in the deserted chamber warily she said i haventheard anything but even so who cares what people think he laughed shortly oh you d be surprised blaise darling people care some people care so much what other people think that they breaking off with a scowl draco took another swig empty damn what are you talking about she was sitting beside him now holding his hand and peering worriedly into his face how nice someone cared he liked how her caring soothed his battered ego he had never used the sympathy card but it was really starting to appeal something happened you said you were going to the library earlier did you see ginny did she say something oh yes that note of outrage was good to hear it felt good too inside where it smoothed over his rough emotions allowing his melancholy to show malfoy admitted i asked red to go to hogsmeade with me but she just wanted to sneak around snog under the table some more under the table merlin no wonder you spat in parkinson face you said no to sneaking around is that it yeah so she said no to me and we re back to calling each other by our last names again said calling her ginny was another bad idea draco knew he was pouting unhappily and didntcare oh draco you thought firewhisky would make things better he d thought it a bloody fine idea at the time now the whisky was gone he stared sadly into her eyes nothing going to make me feel better drunkenly introspective he pondered the paradox of tears one girl tears made him feel so bad while another girl tears made him feel better blaise pulled him to his feet and slid an arm around his waist c mon i putting you to bed draco smiled crookedly as she led him up the stairs to his room inside his dorm blaise stared in amazement draco your bed a double he ran a shaky hand through his hair while she pulled apart the green velvet bed curtains and turned down the covers yeah when peter what s his face left on account of the pustules crabbe wondered why i didntjust transfigure the beds into one vincent has rare flashes of sytherin brilliance i bought him a skivving snackbox for that one she smiled he stepped forward thinking crabbe and goyle are downstairs and i upstairs alone with blaise how for fortu lucky she stiffened when he put his arms around her dontlook nervous just because i standing so close you gorgeous girl i only giving you a lil hug stepping out of the embrace blaise pushed him gently onto the bed sleep it off draco he grabbed her wrist refusing to let her go stay with me there plenty of room i promise to be good bluntly he admitted i dontwant to be alone his sorrowful tone had the desired effect blaise took off her boots and robes and lay down beside him out of habit draco began to take off his shirt a slender hand pulled it back down keep your clothes on big boy even nice girls get bad ideas when faced with temptation lying on his side to face his friend draco smiled tempt you do i she rolled her eyes yes it one of the perks of being a love god best mate becoming serious blaise said i dontforget that while i love you i love terry his lips curved in an ironic smile he d lost a girlfriend and found a best mate in the same night figure the odds draco rested his head against a soft chest and sighed when blaise stroked his hair in a soothing fashion he murmured this is one of the rewards of being your best mate and allowed caring fingers to caress him to sleep crikey crabbe malfoy in bed with zabini blaise opened her eyes to see crabbe and goyle standing beside the bed staring down in slack jawed fascination it was like that muggle tale where the girl falls asleep and wakes up to hear bears say someone been sleeping in my bed and she still here each boy was large enough to be a bear certainly sleepy eyed she lifted her head to say go get draco a couple of potions morning after and nauseous no more have slinky send up a couple bowls of porridge and a pot of tea be quick about it and for merlin sake donttell anyone i here but fiona and morrigan are asking if anyone seen you said goyle she sighed tell them we ll meet up at zonko at eleven got it good go the boys backed out and shut the door she looked down draco was pretending to sleep but she had felt his silent laughter blaise tugged white blond tendrils watching the incorrigible wretch pretend he had just awakened ow my aching head what happened last night why are you in my bed and why arentwe naked she pursed her lips to restrain laughter that would give passers by something to talk about blaise narrowed her eyes although inwardly she was relieved to see draco acting himself again she accused you know bloody well how and why we re here roguishly smiling eyes became searching did you mean that best mate bit last night at her nod he asked when did that happen blaise shook her head i dontknow our mum are best friends we ve spent every holiday together since we came to hogwarts we study together hang out she shrugged you can be a bastard but oh bloody hell you re my bastard okay i care about you tell you things i donttell anyone else seems like ruddy best mate shite to me what are you laughing at you re language really goes into the gutter when you re embarrassed zabini she pretended to smother him he grabbed the pillow and awkwardly confessed that stuff you said yeah me too a bark of laughter escaped except for you being a bastard since you re a girl do i get to call you my bitch instead if you want to die a slow and painful death here re your potions said crabbe barrelling into the room slinky stepped from the fireplace i will be putting young sir tray here i told fiona eleven o clock blaise morrigan said ah ight tell girlfriend we re down with that said goyle entering the room behind crabbe blaise playfully shoved draco away and slid off the bed she thanked the three who came bearing potions food and messages shooed them out and closed the door turning around she found her friend ravenously eating a bowl of porridge those potions sure worked fast what up with morrigan asked draco she handed over her unwanted bowl of porridge and accepted a cup of tea sitting beside him on the bed to explain yank boyfriend the ripple effects are just starting to be felt smiling over the idiosyncrasies of friends they sat in companionable silence blaise ignored draco smirk until she got ready to leave she checked to make sure the corridor was clear and demanded go ahead say it get it out of your system so you can take the secret to your grave a dazzling white smile was her reward fine i always knew you d end up in my bed again zabini he doubled over roaring with laughter over her rolled eyes and sour expression what a prat making holiday sleepovers sound pervy determined to have the last word blaise taunted as she opened the door if you d asked i would ve done it sooner later waiting outside the bludger she checked her appearance in the restaurant glass window hip hugging black jeans cropped red top and collarless black leather jacket would terry like her outfit were the raven earrings too much nice earrings nice everything spinning around she threw herself into terry arms and kissed him until they were both gasping for air excuse me i hate to intrude but if you could shuffle to the right a bit the couple broke apart luna lovegood was standing behind them blaise realised they had been blocking the door with a cheeky smile she teased party of three already waiting dontworry mate we ll be sure to sit in an opposite corner terry greeted luna with a smile and held the door as the girls went inside blaise followed her guy over to a booth admiring the brown leather jacket he wore with a jumper the exact colour of his eyes she grinned when he caught her eyeing his rear view as he slid onto the bench beside her she reached out to touch his long brown hair and said have i told you how gorgeous you are today his face lit up at her breathy words and his eyes gleamed wickedly before he could speak the server came to take their orders when they were alone again he slipped one hand down to run his fingers along the skin left exposed by her top and used the other to position blaise head just so he kissed her softly and whispered why dontyou show me instead luna sat at a table with harry ron and hermione watching them eat dessert and listening to them chat she felt this had been a very successful venture the boys had spent most of lunch discussing quidditch she had paid close attention although she didnttruly care for it except the flying and cheering harry potter was awe inspiring on a broom the look on his face as he chased the snitch was so intense luna always made sure she got a front row seat at every game just to see it up close of course there was that danger of leaning too far out to watch him thank heaven for strongly knitted scarves that all she had to say about it her housemates had grabbed hers countless times to keep her from tipping out of the stands it was becoming something of a joke asking who got the job of holding the end of lovegood scarf she didntmind too terribly one paid a price for what one wanted after all like this lunch luna would have preferred to have harry to herself but the boy wasntready for that kind of stress in addition ron and hermione bickering like courting bandersnatches was very entertaining her eyes drifted to harry he looked like he was trying not to laugh as ron pointed to the couple across the room and said no harry i mean it they ve got dodgy names that could be either for a boy or a girl and she got short hair while he got long dontthey get confused luna stared at ron smiling at the image of him being force fed worms like the male bandersnatch that wouldntreally happen he was human hermione would likely claim him by pinning him down and feeding him grapes she turned her smile on harry when he said dryly it doesntlook like they re confused to me everyone at the table looked over to blaise booth she and terry were currently snogging away androgynous names and hairstyles aside the slytherin looked very much a girl the ravenclaw was more masculine than any other male in the room except harry who was currently giving her that amused look again emerald eyes were so attractive a few minutes later luna noticed that the couple was walking their way likely headed for the loo what a toned abdominals the girl had terry hand looked pale against her darker skin blaise paused to say hi luna hello ron spoke up um erm can i ask you a question zabini luna pale brows rose what was this ronald weasley was starting a conversation with a slytherin she darted a glance at harry his eyes were huge behind his glasses and he had a peculiar look on his face horrified amusement hermione just looked horrified blaise smiled sure weasley go ahead luna wasntthe only one blinking in surprise when ron blurted why did you want mousse but no spoon i dontget it and no one will tell me red lips parted in a sultry smile the girl bent down and said how bout i show you ronnie dipping a fingertip into the slack jawed boy ice cream she put it in her mouth and sucked it clean in a way that made poor ronald blush a truly impressive shade of red winking blaise sauntered away using the excuse of needing to powder something luna followed she was unsurprised to hear ron cry out in pain and then say plaintively aw hermione what d i do now female bandersnatches were territorial inside the ladies room luna washed her hands and said i think you ve just corrupted the last innocent at hogwarts blaise laughing as she applied more lip gloss the girl replied if anybody ever needed to be shown the light it that one i did it for weasley good his unbeknownst to him girlfriend is going to do him bodily harm if he doesntsnog her soon after a pause they asked simultaneously how your date going mutual laughter filled the small space blaise nodded to luna who said serenely very well harry likes my sense of humour that very encouraging and yours you probably saw for yourself that terry and i gods it so good it scares me to death i afraid that something will happen roger everything up blaise shook her head as if she was shaking off fears and changed the subject our matchmaking not going so well luna waited patiently for an explanation biting off her lip gloss the girl said when i came back to the common room last night i found draco plastered and really really upset seems he asked our beatrice if she d go to hogsmeade and she told him no broke everything off and told him not to use her first name anymore he was really gutted they probably should have expected something like this ginny was no juliet promising she would no longer be a capulet all they could do was wait and see if true love really conquered all something about blaise account made luna curious though she asked casually as possible i suppose crabbe and goyle dragged malfoy off to bed last night brown eyes widened and then looked off to the left didntprofessor tonks tell them in dada that people who were preparing to be deceptive did that it seemed that blaise could look everywhere but straight into luna eyes oh yeah i he draco got to bed all right he at our house right now supervising the arrangements for the party tonight he okay with a bright smile the girl reapplied her gloss and said i d better go terry and i are going to wander around good luck with harry luna offering information unasked didntdodgy individuals do that when questioned by aurors realising all the worry in the world wouldntchange a thing luna ran a brush quickly through her long blonde hair and silently wished her friend luck in return she had a feeling blaise was going to need it with a last glance in the mirror she returned to the table and harry a n dontflame me for making draco and ginny road to true love bumpy they make me do it lol is it teasing too much to say things will get worse for everyone before they get better it is good my work here is done muahahaha ha author notes i dontinclude the name of the song blaise and draco danced to in the chap because the song that inspired wasntfrom 1997 d but if you want to hear it in your head while you read the song is franz ferdinand take me out also this wasnta chapter that lent itself to an insertion of shakespeare but it did bring to mind lines from romeo and juliet when benvolio is chiding they ll be late to the masque and romeo responds i fear too early for my mind misgives some consequence yet hanging in the stars shall bitterly begin his fearful date with this night revels chapter 11 good girls and a bad bad boy luna sat by the statue of gregory the smarmy dipping her quill into a pot of ink defacing school property for shame miss lovegood she looked up to see blaise smiling but it looked brittle and false luna asked calmly how was hogsmeade great after we saw you in the bludger terry and i shopped a bit and walked down by the shrieking shack it was surprisingly romantic blue eyes narrowed you dontsound very happy i happy why wouldnti be happy donti look happy no unless slytherins look troubled when they re happy do they no you loony and no i mean yes i guess i am troubled and not happy about it one bit what could possibly be the problem blaise and terry were perfect for each other hadntshe thought so that first day in muggle studies and had blaise just said something about a party so terry says sorry baby i promised to organise the music spin the orbs and rushes off he didnteven think about asking me luna replied should he have yes he should have i did the chocolate mousse thing for him couldnthe do this for me what why are you smiling like that i was just thinking how kind and selfless you are sacrificing yourself by offering to lick chocolate off a gorgeous ravenclaw how you must have suffered shut up you i should ve asked him if i could go but i wanted him to ask me you know luna smiled i know harry didntask me to the bludger remember yeah a girl gotta do what a girl gotta do and all that tosh shrugging blaise said enough about me how d lunch go with potter and his pals i think i making progress small progress perhaps but progress all the same and i happy with it the other girl was looking at her sympathetically dramatic types were only happy with dramatic progress waving farewell to the edgy girl luna felt concerned blaise had hid her emotional streak very well under an act of indifference and baggy robes but now more than her figure was revealed she didntseem to be handling terry equanimity over spending the evening apart very well hopefully nothing imprudent would come from it after what little blaise had told her about that incident with malfoy last night luna was very much afraid that putting two slighted slytherins together at this time was a very bad idea draco eyes closed while he relaxed in the large roman styled prefects bath a slight smile curved his lips when he thought about the party soon to begin crabbe and goyle were encouraging fourth years to help push the common room furniture to ring the walls afterwards they would pull back and carry away the rolled carpets to create a dance floor in the centre of the space third years would be helping bullstrode lay out the food and drink parkinson would be ordering second years to arrange the lighting pansy might be a right bitch but she was brilliant at illumination charms later the chamber would be luminous with colour changing radiant orbs flickering in perfect synchronisation with the music zabini flint and macduff were sorting through the music spheres wizards paid a high price for the magicked globules that stored and projected the owner favourite tunes most slytherins had galleons to spare so the amount of orpheus orbs contributed for tonight bash was varied and extensive thinking about blaise brought a smile of satisfaction only fifth through seventh years were invited to attend slytherin revels and last year the obstinate wench had refused every invitation to participate a bark of laughter escaped blaise had been so amusing sneering at what she derided as bacchanalian blow outs even then draco had wondered how his prickly friend would move on the dance floor tonight he would find out terry boy had promised to mind the music at his own house party good thing girly locks was too dim to suggest that his girlfriend crash the house barrier and join him zabini would have braved the entire flock of disapproving ravenclaws if the nancy had been man enough to ask just went to show intelligent didntmean smart the happy couple was spending the night apart and draco planned to ensure that his close friend didntget lonely his laughter echoed throughout the tiled chamber ooohhh sounds like you re planning something naughty malfoy his eyes opened to see moaning myrtle floating above the bath with a hopeful expression on her morosely plain face pale brows arching draco levered himself out of the water the ghost admiring moan while she watched water droplets trickle down his frame caused his lips to quirk even dead girls thought he was hot disregarding the apparition avid gaze he grabbed a thick white towel and casually began to dry himself have you been working out you re very defined and toned and mmm muscular deciding that the spirit had been given enough of a thrill draco wrapped the towel around his waist and padded over to the mirror to use a drying spell and then a comb on his hair he deemed myrtle question too inane to answer snubbed the spectre accused huffily before zooming back through the wall and heading to her own bathroom well you may be more handsome but you ll never be as nice as harry potter dispassionately considering his reflection draco pulled on black trousers and a musculature revealing black tee the handsome teen smiled and it was anything but nice he did work out because girls admired defined muscles and he enjoyed their admiration his outfit flaunted every one draco hoped blaise appreciated the striking contrast of fae pale hair and skin against demon black clothing red sure had scowling briefly he refused to remember the time under the table and in the library how ginny no weaselette had tried to crawl into his skin in her eagerness to get closer locking unwanted memories and emotions firmly away he determined that nothing else existed tonight except his plan to be a bad bad boy with a nice slytherin girl a short while later he smiled slightly when he heard looks good huh crabbe blunt features were creased in a goofy grin gazing around the transformed common room draco raised a brow and nodded his approval bloody good the romantically dimmed room was streaked with tiny flashing green lights slytherins decked out in their best black milled around eating and drinking the nice girl he was seeking was nowhere in sight who orpheus tonight he asked idly curious to know who would be spinning the musical orbs mathers he calling himself slim slytherin now merlin the amused imprecation was for the ridiculous name as well as the sight of goyle rushing to his side carrying a gigantic platter of food gonna be fun tonight huh draco zabini promised to dance with me with us goyle crabbe corrected eyeing the platter of food yeah right us goyle agreed quickly trying to protect his food from crabbe poaching the room filled with music as slim chose a sphere and spun it to activate the music projection charm the song had a fast pounding dance beat the sound drew cheers from the crowd ready to party slytherins began to pack the dance floor no hufflepuff slow dances for us eh draco damn right goyle no poncing about to classical music or whatever boring tunes ravenclaws flop their feathers to either raucous laughter reminded him that his minions were good for something other than muscle they also appreciated his snide humour of course the dolts broke down at the lift of an eyebrow like trained dogs but that was beside the point tonight the duo chortles fell on benevolent ears pansy sidled up cooing they re playing our song draco darling we donthave a song he said with a frown noticing the black mini dress made her legs look even more stumpy than usual she d slathered her face with cosmetics too the look didntentice him but maybe if pansy waited until the wee hours and sidled up to a drunken fifth year on his way back from the toilet the unlucky boy would ignore the girl thick ankles and give her a snog the ploy had worked several times last year several sixth years still gagged at the sight of her dontbe mean darling let dance let not encouraged by the indifferent refusal the pug faced girl chatted happily with crabbe and goyle undoubtedly waiting around for another rejection scanning the crowd draco wondered if pansy piggy faced mother had ever truly taught her daughter the meaning of the word no he saw blaise descend the staircase and moved to intercept her silver serpent hoops glinted against dark curls as she laughed with her friends eyes sparkling full lips parted in a smile draco smirked appreciating the curves displayed in a halter that bared arms and midriff above trousers that rode low on slender hips her back was bare except for two thin ties vowing to run his hands all over terry boy girlfriend before the night was through draco met the trio at the bottom of the stairs glad you decided to join the bacchanal blaise does pretty boy know you re here her gaze looked him over and lingered before she smiled in rueful appreciation when the second part of his comment registered a defiant look accompanied blaise explanation terry didnthang around to ask what my plans were tonight he rushed off to arrange the music for his own house he should ve invited you to his party said fiona flint was right and draco hoped to give the ironically stupid ravenclaw a reason to regret his mistake i sure terry wishes he was dancing with you instead of morrigan macduff bit her lip visibly dismayed at the implication of her words draco laughed inwardly merlin how kind these lovely girls were to do his dirty work for him he didnthave to do anything but be sympathetic work his malfoy magic and watch zabini fall right into his waiting hands not right away of course he would be a mate encourage her to dance have fun but first he needed to bait the trap save a dance for me blaise he almost reconsidered his plan at the sight of innocent dark eyes lighting up in pleasure at his request but he didn t why should he be alone knowingly or not blaise was quite willing to comfort him what was so bad about wanting a dance anyway what happened in slytherin house stayed in slytherin house no one would ever have to know mingling with his housemates dancing with every pretty girl who asked draco kept track of his quarry she had danced with crabbe and goyle and several other slytherins who were smart enough to stay at a respectable distance several times he caught her watching him his partners often commented that he had incredible rhythm for a white boy or compared him to a serpent a high compliment blaise obviously thought so too her smiling glances of admiration soothed his ego after several hours he left the floor and stood watching blaise fiona and morrigan prepare to dance macduff had hooked up with some yank over the summer and was now announcing that she was had taught the girls some steps hearing a new song start draco waited to see blaise in action mouths dropped as the girls demonstrated that they had indeed learned some new steps morrigan macduff had choreographed a routine to match the fast paced rhythm every part of each limber body was used to cross step slide bounce move sway and shake legs apart blaise slid her hands down her thighs while bending her knees to slither down before sinuously swaying upwards again draco wiped his sweaty brow with the back of his hand need a towel catching the towel tossed by goyle draco pulled off his tee and wiped his face and chest he saw blaise staring her movements changed from athletic to sensual as she stopped dancing for herself and started dancing for him smiling promisingly he pulled his shirt back on watching the roll of her abdomen the quick movements of slender arms and shoulders and seductively swaying and shaking assets the crowd cheered and whistled at the end of the songhis quarry looked away biting her lip did she regret her provocative dance too bad if so he was off to arrange the music so he could accept her unspoken invitation with pleasure holding up an orpheus orb malfoy turned steely eyes on slim you re going to play this one next and i want the bass to pound mathers sauntering over to where blaise was drinking a glass of water and brushing off the compliments of the people around her her gaze skittered away from his until the music started she laughed surprised when he held out a hand and sang teasingly that if she was lonely he was there waiting when blaise took his hand he backed up swaying in sync they reached the centre of the floor he dropped her hand to sway faster she was with him all the way draco smiled in triumph as blaise sang along with him dancing with a slytherin love god probably wasnta good idea but she had promised and he had picked one of her favourite songs about a couple that know they arentleaving together who are just having a dance blaise had wanted to dance with him all night he moved so temptingly when draco sang the lyrics to her she could resist everything except temptation around them slytherins gathered loudly singing the words and clapping in encouragement swaying a few feet away from each other blaise and draco moved to the compelling rhythm drawing closer and closer until they were dancing back and forth into each other space hands that began lifted above heads moving in time to the beat and the swaying of torsos and hips lowered until her hands clutched his firm shoulders and his slid around her waist pale strong fingers caressed her darker skin slid around to roam her back hips as their bodies brushed together and drew apart blaise gasped when he slid down her body to place an open mouthed kiss against her abdomen rising in a fluid motion he turned her deftly and rocked her body with his they moved sinuously as one the end of the song found blaise pressed back against draco chest his pale fingers splayed across her midriff the crowd was chanting kiss kiss kiss a bright flash caused her to close her eyes and turn her head shite some blighter took pictures i couldntcatch him little rat bastard took off goyle shouted blaise trembled with shock watching draco expression harden pulling her with him to the door he directed crabbe to look for the photographer down one corridor while he searched the other grabbing goyle shirt he ordered shut this party down and have flint and macduff help you question everyone someone let that little sneak in and it your job to find out who going to regret it with a nod and an apologetic glance her way the hulking pair parted to attend their separate tasks blaise caught draco by the arm and pleaded i need you to tell me the password to gryffindor i know you keep track of that sort of thing i have to find colin creevey he a photographer he can tell me where to look eyes like granite shifted away and then fixed on hers fortune favours the bold be careful and put on a cloak for merlin sake clinging to the thread of hope blaise smiled tremulously see you soon yeah see you draco headed down the corridor at a swift pace grabbing the first black cloak she could find blaise followed him out the door and ran swiftly toward the gryffindor tower upon reaching the entrance the girl brought the hood up to cover her face fortune favours the bold she murmured feeling the curious gaze of the fat lady rove over her shrouded figure hide if you want to sweetie but i wouldnttell anyone even if i did know who you are i not a gossip like some portraits i could name slipping into the common room she found that even after midnight the party was still going strong scanning the chamber blaise looked for colin but couldntsee his blond head anywhere she was starting to attract unwanted attention so she moved inside a bit more and continued her visual search who are you and what with the cloak the questioner was given a quick peek at her face freckles stood out against pale skin as ginny weasley said incredulously zabini shhh i trying not to advertise the fact that a slytherin has slinked her way into the gryffindor tower thanks i just need to speak to colin can you find him for me please the tears thickening her plea must have convinced that she was serious ginny said all right wait beside the bookcase i ll be back in a minute soon ginny and colin followed her out of the common room rounding a corner to move away from the portrait curious gaze blaise turned to face the pair she blurted colin i need to know where someone would go to develop a picture quickly donttell her not until she tells us why she wants to know ginny cut in glaring blaise shot back someone took pictures at the slytherin party and ran off i think he going to develop and spread them round school that why i have to know satisfied what kind of pictures colin asked at the end of her rope blaise held her cloak open so the younger boy could get a good look at her outfit photos of me dancing with someone other than my boyfriend get the picture now who c mon colin who do you think of course it malfoy zabini wouldntbe so frantic otherwise would you blaise afraid terry will dump you for two timing him is that it tears silently rolling down her cheeks blaise admitted yes i am but i didnttwo time my boyfriend it was just a dance that got out of hand and i m afraid he wontbelieve me if he sees those bloody photographs covering her face blaise suppressed her sobs as best she could colin patted her back awkwardly it okay there only one place i can think where a photographer could develop film quickly the third dungeon storeroom is a darkroom and it not locked anybody can go there anytime ginny placed her hand briefly on blaise arm what are we waiting for then we ll get those photographs and if i catch the sneak who took them i ll give him a bat bogey hex malfoy can tell you how much fun they are wiping her eyes blaise gave the pair a watery smile she refused shed any more tears there would be plenty of reason to cry if terry got a package of photographs the three students ran for the dungeon only once did they have to duck into a classroom when filch and mrs norris were heard coming down the corridor sitting on the floor pressed against the wall near the door ginny whispered i sorry i acted so hateful draco asked me to come to hogsmeade to your party and i told him no and we should go back to calling each other by our last names colin looked astounded go back you called malfoy by his first name when did that happen after detention oh blaise could hardly confess draco got pissed after that happy conversation in the library and looked to her for comfort she didntwant to break the fragile peace with the volatile girl she and luna called beatrice to draco benedick she found herself confessing terry didntask me to his party i was pretty upset about it and everybody was egging us on did you kiss him colin and ginny asked simultaneously no they looked relieved so blaise remained prudently quiet about innocently spending the night if draco and ginny ever straightened things out she didntwant to lose her best mate because his girlfriend didnttrust them alone together after the coast was clear the trio hurried down the corridor and to the dungeon blaise caught a glimpse of black robe and ran full out the sneak photographer had enough time to snatch a single dry photograph before escaping into a secret passageway for a quarter of an hour ginny tried every spell she knew to open it and follow but nothing worked blaise and colin had given up long before that and were taking down photographs hung up to dry all three looked up as draco burst into the chamber his face was a study of surprise and uneasiness blaise looked at ginny her heart sinking when she saw the girl who had turned draco down was now holding evidence that he had consoled himself with blaise in her hand staring down at the photograph ginny felt curiously detached the couple was moving together like two graceful snakes which was fitting she supposed blaise was really limber meeting stormy grey eyes she joked feebly i wouldnthave been near this good a partner ginny fanned the other photographs out on the table clinging to her detachment if she put them in order like so she could see the progression of the dance from beginning to end that was the downside to wizard photography you sometimes saw a lot more than you wanted to like an angelically handsome face sliding down to kiss a smooth abdomen or pale hands that made you feel like the most beautiful girl in the world stroking someone else skin colin was trying to hide the last photograph ginny gave him a steady look holding out her hand reluctantly with an expression of mixed admiration and apology to blaise he gave it over wow this was something if there was a photograph more damning than this zabini was right to cry maybe she would join her the photograph suddenly turned to ash in ginny hand the powder drifting down to join the incinerated remains of the others had she done that through unfocussed magic no malfoy had his wand out he looked away ginny eyes were stinging and it was hard to swallow blaise asked colin to escort her back to her house she wanted to know more about photography and if the remaining photograph could be duplicated they left talking quietly ginny blinked furiously bloody ashes she must be allergic i dontcare if you can dance or not well that was nice of course he could probably have her moving like blaise in one easy lesson ginny would have melted like butter over him too given half the chance blaise had held out a lot longer than she would maybe the two were just friends quietly spoken words broke the silence you may not have noticed but slytherins donttake rejection too well i noticed she had rejected draco and blaise felt terry rejected her when he didntinvite her to his party was it entirely their fault if they used each other to feel better remembering the crowd encircling the couple cheering and clapping ginny privately admitted it was easy to see how things got out of hand may i walk you back nodding stiffly ginny moved past draco together they walked down the passage and up the steps to the main corridor she noticed he deliberately slowed his pace to hers he d done that before and she had never appreciated it she was too used to looking for the worst in draco malfoy she never acknowledged her own faults reaching the gryffindor corridor ginny stopped in the same place blaise had stood crying earlier tears welled she looked up into troubled grey eyes strong arms encircled and drew her up against a warm masculine chest without robes she felt every muscle and nothing had ever felt so good i sorry draco she whispered tears spilling down her face i sorry too ginny she held him tightly wondering where to go from here disclaimer feel like bart simpson scribbling writing harry potter fanfiction does not make you j k rowling on the blackboard d chapter 12 truth and consequences to sleep perchance to dream aye there the rub slumbering upon the curtain enclosed bed luna head tossed restlessly upon her pillow her sleeping body twitched violently in response to a vivid dream high on a cliff overlooking a stormy sea two serpents slithered toward each other upon meeting the snakes began to twine together sliding and undulating in a sinuous rhythm that was sensually compelling far above in the lightning streaked sky an eagle shriek of anger pierced the silence the serpents ceased their writhing huddling entwined talons extended the eagle dove down and hovered over the snakes powerful wings outstretched snatching up the smaller snake the predatory avian gave a cry of triumph carrying the reptile away body jerking luna came awake with a gasp that eagle in her dreams with the brown and white feathers his eyes had been blue the snake he had seized had been golden and the other serpent white in colour merlin her heart was still pounding pushing long hair away from her face the girl breathed deeply trying to analyze her vision luna didntneed to consult the text unfogging the future to interpret the dream somehow she knew that blaise and draco had done something imprudent last night and terry would soon behave like the eagle in the vision he would carry his girl off and do what talk it out forgive and forget or light flooded into the space when the drapery pulled apart hey you awake cindy conjured brunch if you want to join us mindy pale face surrounded by reddish blonde hair peered between the opened curtains you look strange she smiled stranger than usual that is thank you leaving her bed luna drew on a gold robe with a gryffindor crest and joined the girls at a table in the middle of the chamber the drop leaves raised to form a circle had become a display of culinary and decorative brilliance luna sat on the edge of a dainty chair and touched a rosebud in the centre floral arrangement she smiled you outdo madam puddifoot cindy a happy smile made the other girl look even more like a cherub thanks lindy i do like to make things pretty mmm and the food brill too said bindy whimsically trying to decide whether fairies would consider the term fairy cakes flattering or demeaning luna half listened to her roommates chatter when mindy said something about last night ravenclaw party her wandering attention snagged say again raising her brows the other girl responded sure i said last night when i was trying to chat up terry he has a girlfriend i aware of that luna it was just a chat yes because he turned down her invitation to dance bindy teased causing mindy to redden guiltily cindy said i thought it was sooo romantic our orpheus pining away for his what was the name of that girl in the underworld eurydice bindy informed helpfully i love greek myths and greek food mindy was shifting around appearing uncomfortable beneath lindy s assessing stare suddenly she blurted oh please terry way too good for that zabini girl she obviously just another slytherin slut ignoring the others gasps luna said what do you mean obviously i was standing nearby when some guy on the quidditch team handed terry a photograph and said you wouldntbelieve zabini having it off with malfoy so we got you proof boot eyes glittering mutinously mindy continued terry looked like he was going to cry he shoved his way out and as far as i know never came back oh poor terry cindy sentiment was echoed by bindy who stopped chewing to nod sympathetically luna said i hope terry talks to blaise before calling a cat a kneazle after all a picture may be worth a thousand words but what if they re nonsense ones anyway where did that photo come from she tapped her chin thoughtfully i dontbelieve there such a thing as spontaneous manifestation of photographs so someone must have arranged for it to be taken she picked a daisy out of the arrangement and began pulling the petals off one by one it was obvious the thought had never occurred to the other girls they stared in consternation luna felt no such anxiety she held up the stem with a single petal remaining and announced he loves her reaching for a scone she took a large satisfying bite draco considered what to write and then put quill to parchment ginny if you re willing to give us a chance i willing to keep quiet about it slytherins are used to keeping secrets meet me at the dragon claw willow after breakfast draco strange that he would be using zabini favourite spot for meeting terry boy to hook up with ginny stranger still that being bad last night had led to something so good he wasntthrilled about red wanting to be with him on the sly but he would accept it for now anything was better than the cold darkness he had plunged into after that scene in the library if blaise hadntbeen there the gods only knew what he might have done draco shrugged away uncomfortable thoughts and glanced over at the bed dominating the room it had been beyond pleasant cradled against softness whilst gentle fingers tenderly stroked his hair perhaps he should feel badly about manipulating the kind hearted girl into comforting him but he didn t they had a unique friendship and as long as certain lines werentcrossed he felt free to take any support and affection blaise cared to give he smirked imagining the horror on dear old dad face when he found out his only son best mate was a girl folding the parchment and sealing it draco walked over to the room fireplace and called slinky he waited for the house elf to appear the moment the elf bowed in subservience he handed over the sealed message ordering the elf to deliver it personally to ginevra weasley in gryffindor tower but that is dobby tower young sir slinky is not liking to go there dobby is angry when others go there very jealous he is i didntask you to like it slinky i asked you to do it if you want the coast cleared give the sot winky a butterbeer and get her sobbing about master after that dobby will be occupied taking care of his pathetic friend and you can be off to gryffindor tower young master is so slytherin slinky is proud to serve you with a grin that made his protuberant eyes glow slytherin green the elf travelled back through the floo to complete his assigned task warding the trunk and desk against anyone foolish enough to invade his privacy draco flung a denim jacket on over his gray jumper how shocked father would be to see him in casual attire and bounded down the steps to the common room blaise was sitting curled up on a sofa staring into a teacup he sat and leaned against her shoulder to look in her cup bloody hell no wonder she was staring there was a circle and a cross inside the cup that phoney trelawney would be in alt over the very rare very inauspicious occurrence but he could tell blaise wasn t her dark eyes were worried do you believe in tasseomancy draco what does this mean my love in trouble or is troubled or will bring me trouble what i dontlook to soggy bits in the bottom of a cup to decide my fate if that what you re asking if you re wondering if boot was given that photograph i dontknow if he has it means all three of those draco wrapped an arm around her and looked around for something anything to distract him from feeling that twinge of something uncomfortable like guilt luckily crabbe and goyle showed their faces before he broke down and volunteered to do something asinine like apologise raising his head draco said in relief look blaise breakfast is served smiling happily the hulking teens nodded in unison and put their trays on the table in front of their friends crabbe explained yeah we didntthink you d want to go to the hall this morning zabini not after what the ravenclaws hey why d ya hit me goyle cause you re a bloody prat that why blaise dontwant to hear that everybody saying terry boy got pictures of her doin the dirty with malfoy ow why d ya hit me draco catching sight of the girl face he said glumly oh sorry for an instant draco hoped the humongous arse stuffing an entire scone into his maw would choke as if following an unheard order goyle started gasping for air draco reached around the lummox to perform the heimlich manoeuvre rationalising he was only saving the bloody pillock because his father wouldntwant him to he ignored gregory apologies and damned pangs of guilt to ask what can i do blaise please dontask me to go see terry boy anything but that give me your advice should i try to find him talk it out that was better but not much than having a heart to heart with girly locks he decided for once truth was the best answer yeah if you donttalk to him now you might never get the chance again he put his arms around her and squeezed gently you need to find terry and work it out hugging him tightly his friend gave a pitiful smile she headed for the girl staircase saying over her shoulder say hi to red for me at the bottom of the gryffindor girls staircase ginny looked around to find the best route for leaving without drawing notice near the common room fireplace harry and ron were playing wizard chess while hermione completed an assignment that probably wasntdue until after christmas holiday the studious girl had tried to explain the concept of time management to the boys but they were hopeless cases they actually did homework the day before it was due like most other normal students unfortunately for ginny hermione noticed her friend before she made the door and called out ginny come here and tell ron he should be doing his homework it due next friday sorry hermione i a person in a glass house who cantthrow stones i haventdone all my work either and refuse to even look at a book until tomorrow are we still on for shopping in hogsmeade after lunch i going for a walk be back soon bye ginny waved and ducked through the portrait hole the fat lady as usual had to make a comment my dontyou look pretty in that green jumper why i remember when i was first painted quickly escaping before she had to hear how bright and fresh the fat lady had been back in the day ginny draped her black cloak around her shoulders and strode briskly in the direction of the dragon claw willow once there she could see why no one would bother them it was very dangerous looking superstitiously murmuring an apology to the tree as she brushed the intimidating fronds aside she reached the small open area screened by drooping claw tipped greenery a small shriek escaped her as strong arms wrapped themselves around her middle and pulled her back against a muscular chest i am the guardian of the willow pay the forfeit or face the dragon claw shivering delightedly as the dramatic voice made its demands above her sensitive ear ginny pleaded breathily oh please not the claw i ll pay the forfeit i ll pay anything anything dontyou know what dragons like me do to tasty morsels like you the seductive menace in his voice was doing something already melting her bones and setting butterflies to fluttering in her stomach how could she have been so foolish as to think this wouldntwork it had to work she reached up to stroke his unseen face and smiled i know your scales are smooth and your talons are gentle her voice became husky i know what i want you to do to me behind her the powerful body stilled tensed talons tightened their grip hotly he breathed tell me turning into draco embrace she clutched his hair and commanded devour me dragon after he thrilled her by fulfilling her request with hungry kisses ginny rested against his chest while he sat lounging with his back supported by the trunk of the willow she angled her head to look up into his face and ask however did your parents decide to name you draco his silent laughter made her smile he smirked and drawled not many have asked me that mother claims she named me for a constellation between ursa major and cephus and father well he insisted the name was in honour of an ancient greek ancestor who oppressed his downtrodden people with severe laws i agree with your mother you re as bright and beautiful as a star a pleased smile gave draco face the look of an angel his gaze turned devilish as he said your name fits you too ginevra she said in amused indignation white as foam thanks a lot gray eyes became smoky and intense not that the welsh meaning welsh i never heard any what does it mean dragon lover ginny stared draco erupted into laughter she laughed with him before asking what does the name blaise mean wary eyes blinked before he offered dragon friend pulling his head down ginny said seriously good keep it that way blaise went to the great hall at lunchtime looking for terry when a ravenclaw came up to her with a note she took it and left immediately in the entry she paused to unfold the note dungeon 3 storeroom somehow the short message was more terrifying than a scroll of accusations and anger making a quick stop at slytherin house blaise made her way down to the dungeons anxiety increasing with every step she took several deep breaths grabbing hold of her courage as well as the cloak nervously twisted in a fist she opened the storeroom door shut the door behind you her eyes took a few moments to become accustomed to the gloom terry was sitting against the back wall one leg drawn up to support a hand dangling a photograph between two fingertips his eyes gleamed dangerously behind a veil of long brown hair without expression he said not very smart coming here but i figured slytherin nerve would bring you slithering down to me stricken blaise tried to reason i dontknow what that picture like but i saw the others and i know it looks bad bad interrupted by his bitter laugh she started again it was only one dance and i promise whatever your pals told you was a bloody damned lie after a moment of tense silence terry bent his head to look at the photo still gazing downward he said i couldntlook at this for ages just let it burn a hole in my pocket while i walked and walked and walked finally made it down here and decided to take a good long look really opened my eyes about you and malfoy never been kissed did you two have a good time laughing at me the stony recitation brought desperate tears to her eyes blaise pleaded no terry it not like that we re just friends i swear i swear i ve never kissed anyone but you please please listen to me raising his head he slowly rose to his feet and walked over to extend the picture i d like to listen to you try and explain this jittery fingers dropped the picture bending she picked the photograph back up and stared down at the moving images captured a swell of relief shook her this wasntthe worst by far upon the magicked photograph were two figures surrounded by a circle of clapping slytherins while she watched malfoy hands grasped her waist pale fingers splaying over her stomach as they rocked together with her back against his chest they stopped the song had ended draco looked down at her she stared ahead and then closed her eyes from the camera flash thank merlin this was the only picture grabbed if terry saw the one ginny did i think i d be dead a slytherin at loss for words shaking her head miserably blaise said i sorry terry you didntask me to your party and it was just a dance it looks awful and i shouldnthave done it but it not what you think masculine fingers raked back long hair from a shadowed face dontknow bout that blaise after awhile i took a few hours and really studied that photo i think it very revealing no yes take a closer look at malfoy if ever a bastard was planning on he smiled in grim satisfaction as she flinched at the obscene word continuing a girl it him look at his hands how they re pulling you back terry eyes blazed in anger suddenly the photograph burst into flames from the unfocused magic of his rage encircling blaise upper arms with his fingers he put his face close to hers and rasped you cantexplain that photograph away it burnt into my brain he let her go and turned away get out of here before i do something you ll regret too hurt to cry blaise watched terry back heave with suppressed emotion pressing her lips together firmly she wasntgoing anywhere reaching into her cloak she brought out a sphere and walked over to the side table holding photography equipment blaise stacked two trays to make room behind her terry said roughly what do you think you re doing she took off her cloak and let it drop holding up the object i thought you of all people would recognize an orpheus orb since i cantexplain anything i ll just have to show you wonti placing the sphere on the table she gave it a spin to activate the charm music came flowing into the space this is the song malfoy and i danced to although i was wearing a little less blaise drew off her tee exposing a black satin bra she tossed the shirt and began to move her hips terry face may have been impassive but his eyes burned moving toward him while swaying back and forth she said conversationally not the romantic slow song you thought huh his electric blue gaze roamed her body if that the way you danced how d you end up terry started to look away before her movement caught and held his attention she came close and turned around to brush back against his chest lifting his hands to her hips she said firmly while moving to the beat rocking dancing not what you thought turning to face him as the song ended she searched for a reaction his face creased unhappily if you didntdance so damn sexy he thought that was sexy stepping back blaise laughed shortly at his baffled look she explained in a low voice that was dancing i could do in front of my mother baby putting a slender hand upon the orb she smiled in a way that had terry unconsciously licking his lips since you dontlike explanations i ll just give you something else to burn into your brain his jaw was set his eyes stormy as she began to move dancing for draco blaise had held part of herself back knowing he wasnthers to keep now she held nothing back terry reached for her the song played on as he held her tight blaise terry i love you only you believe me love me please he held her face in his hands i believe you i love you let me love you meeting his lips blaise poured her soul into the embrace they moved together kissing passionately hands exploring and possessively claiming blaise tugged at his shirt terry took it off with a heavy lidded smile her curves pressed against his paler firmer flesh she caressed his chest and back revelling in the feel of firm muscles beneath her fingertips she sighed at the feel of her body aligned with his terry lips moved down her throat caught up in the way he made her feel blaise was shocked to hear a sardonic voice say from the doorway now this i afraid is indecent ms zabini clothe yourselves and come to my office immediately staring up into terry face after professor snape departure blaise couldntstop nervous laughter from escaping after a moment of looking as though she were mental the humour of the situation struck her boyfriend as well he said with a smile i dontcare if he gives us detention for the rest of the year as long as i spend it with you her heart melted after throwing her arms around him for another fervent kiss she grinned maybe lorelei will have love potions to test holding hands the teens left the room on the table the forgotten orb began to play a love song a n opening shakespeare from hamlet always wanted to re write parts of that play so the dane would get the girl and live happily ever after but then i have a thing for gothic guys happy sigh over love sweet love chapter 13 affection and aftermath blaise stood outside snape office near the dungeons consumed with a crazy urge to run run along the cold passageway to the stone staircase up to the main corridor and then dash to slytherin house she would leap into bed pull the covers over her eyes and refuse to get out ever terry looked nervous at the thought of facing snape too his eyes were dark with concern he cupped her cheek with a warm palm dontworry it ll work out somehow slight stubble gave her boyfriend face a mature look that was incredibly attractive blaise gave in to impulse and kissed him terry kissed her back and then reluctantly pulled away wouldntwant to get caught being indecent perhaps you should have thought of that before mr boot blaise startled guiltily and looked at the professor standing in the doorway he must have said enter while they were distracted bollocks a satiric eyebrow arched while the intimidating teacher waved them inside strange how she d always enjoyed watching snape use that brow on others it wasntnear as pleasing when she was the object of ridicule she met the man enigmatic gaze and quickly glanced away blaise could feel her cheeks heating embarrassed the girl kept her eyes off the professor as he shut the door and strode over to seat himself behind the imposing desk she glanced around the office the floating specimens were gross if snape kept them just to terrorize students it was really effective she jumped when a pink blob wiggled in its jar a few feet away the silence in the room escalated tension to a painful level professor snape made sure he had the attention of each teen before informing them i am not unaware of certain rumours he continued i have verified the exact nature of last night incident as photography without consent is strictly prohibited at hogwarts and because there were no other witnesses to your inappropriate behaviour i will mitigate the penalty to detention for the rest of the month blaise stared in shock she knew professor snape was much more lenient with the students of his house but this was almost too good to be true maybe he hadntseen anything in the darkened room as if in answer a sardonic glint appeared in fathomless eyes if ever you are found in such a position again the headmaster and your parents will be apprised blaise and terry both fell over themselves to nod frantically and assure him yes sir thank you sir professor snape dismissed them with the direction to report to lorelei the following night while they exited he warned if you betray my trust and fail to restrain yourselves i assure you current rumour and consequence will seem trivial in comparison to what will ensue blaise followed terry down the passage looking back to see snape watching them from his doorway his steady regard unnerved her it reminded her of the brief glance slanted her way when he d warned them that dark flicker shot in her direction let her know that someone likely crabbe and goyle had spilled the whole story to the professor and he was really cautioning her against being unrestrained with draco as much as terry she hurried to catch her guy holding his hand while they ascended the stairs students in the main corridor stared merlin only knew what rumour was circulating now maybe terry was being said to have strangled her for infidelity her muggle studies professor would like that very shakespearean blaise frowned if othello had been half as forgiving as terry the jealous bastard wouldnthave killed poor desdemona let go this way surprised blaise allowed her boyfriend to lead her toward his house the guardian of the ravenclaw common room depicted a raven flying into a library through an opened window the shadowy form of a man sitting in a chair in a darkened corner queried who goes there terry asked blaise to step away and cover her ears she did as he asked feeling a thrill of apprehension the raven in the portrait cawed nevermore as the canvas lifted to expose the oval entrance to the room beyond c mon you had the nerve to slither down to the dungeon i ll hold your hand and protect my beautiful snake from the other eagles a teasing grin lit the face she d feared might never look at her with a smile again terry was right going to see him in dungeon 3 had been much scarier blaise tucked her hand into his lead on my good man her man led her into a common room that was almost as big as slytherin but instead of a large gathering area full of sofas and comfortable chairs mostly study tables and chairs and large bookshelves overflowing with books filled the room the few sofas were occupied by students they gaped at the sight of the pair entering the space a boy blaise recognized as a chaser on the ravenclaw quidditch team came over and demanded what she doing here boot my girlfriend going to wait in my room while i take a shower got a problem with that the boy shook his head and backed away blaise walked up the stairs with terry in his dorm she looked around while he took clean clothing from a trunk no roommates were present which emboldened the girl to take off her cloak and lie on her guy bed she patted the mattress comfy terry dropped the shirt and jeans in his hands and leapt on top of her she giggled looking into blue eyes that were intense in a good way she smoothed strands away from his face and reached up to meet his mouth thanking whatever wizard had invented cleaning flossing mints she spent long moments savouring masculine lips and tongue and mouth to the utmost blaise slipped one hand beneath terry shirt to caress his back and used the other to slide through his hair while bold male lips and tongue started working their magic on her ear and throat and happy though i am to see you interested in something other than quidditch boot you really should be taking that shower a laughing voice said from the doorway everyone in the common room has been counting the minutes since you brought your lady up here so perhaps you d better make that shower a cold one wouldntwant give gossips something more to talk about terry rolled to the side and pulled her up to sit beside him blaise peeked over her boyfriend shoulder while listening to their conversation wesley i hate to ask but i will what the word about last night about me and blaise well knowledge being power let me try and phrase this kindly the boy managed to look elegant sprawled in a chair by his desk across the room the blue eyed blond haired wesley linked his hands behind his head and said last night buzz had it that our heroes of the quidditch pitch gave you a photo of zabini and malfoy which drove you to leave possibly to do yourself violence his look of perpetual amusement reminded blaise of a certain faery who said what fools these mortals be wesley said this morning rumours started flying in the hall when ms zabini showed up the flames of gossip were fanned into an inferno of speculation donttell me what they said terry warned i won t but crass individuals were even taking bets on what kind of bodily harm you would do your lady in a fit of jealous passion but not you terry said with a grin a pleased smile flashed across the other boy face i bet against the house and said you d make love not war wesley brought his arms down in order to rub his hands together saying happily i ll be able to get that firebolt now thanks to you two love birds terry laughed and introduced wesley roberts blaise zabini before asking his friend to order tea and some food while he hit the shower blaise watched the other boy summon the ravenclaw house elf thinky order a substantial tea and return to lounging in his chair with quirking lips wesley said you might want to close the curtains and fix your top the tee seems to be on inside out and on backwards blaise stared down at the small tag showing where it shouldntand lunged to draw the drapery merry laughter filled the room the foolish mortal took off her shirt and put it back on properly pulling aside the bed hangings blaise smiled shyly at the boy across the room hmmm much better twinkling eyes approved the correction blaise went to sit at terry desk and took her time looking at the things spread over the surface the room was comfortably silent she dipped the quill into the pen pot drawing a sketch of an eagle in its nest a slender serpent peeked out from under the avian wing that quite a talent you have there she returned the dimpled smile of the boy who d wandered over to look over her shoulder blaise demurred it all right but nothing compared to dra her eyes closed briefly appalled at almost saying the d word i can only judge what i see wesley said however i think it rather brilliant dontyou agree mate winking he handed her sketch to terry who had returned towelling his hair while his friend helped thinky arrange the tea things on a table brought to the centre from its place against the wall her boyfriend took a long look at the drawing he grinned before setting it aside to kiss her really i must insist you cease displaying affection in front of me makes me jealous and cross come have tea cantlive on love people wesley shook his head chuckling blaise sat by terry scooting her chair close a feeling of happiness warmed her more than the pale afternoon sun shining into the room she listened absently to their conversation until she realised two sets of blue eyes were staring at her tentatively she said yes how agreeable she is mate i approve your good taste wesley teased lucky i wasntrequesting you dance on the table zabini a golden eyebrow rose i merely asked if you d bring a friend along when you meet us in the library later sure pleasantly surprised she asked which friend fiona flint think she d be interested she pretended to give the good looking wesley a considering look she might say yes after the tea things were cleared away blaise picked an item off terry desk that had captured her attention earlier it had given her a fantasy she was glad she hadntsketched she sat on the bed and patted the space in front of her saying i ve been longing to brush your hair please he dived onto the bed in answer terry shut the curtains and sat with his back to her kneeling behind him blaise slowly drew the brush through silky hair over and over across the room wesley grumbled dontmind me i ll just sit here with the door opened playing chaperone leafing through horrible hexes for randy roommates i ll be fine as long as i hear no suspicious sounds terry back shook with contained mirth blaise tossed the brush aside running her fingers through his hair he turned and rose to his knees cradling her face long slow sweet kisses turned into long deep passionate ones until a book slammed shut okay that enough break it up sounds people jealous cross affection deprived roommates should not be forced to listen to bloody sounds with a last lingering kiss and caress the couple parted wesley took one look at their disordered hair and stated firmly that he was playing chaperone when terry walked her back to slytherin house luna sat on a sofa near the fireplace in the ravenclaw common room waiting patiently for blaise to descend the boys staircase with terry the indies were sitting at a nearby table pretending to do homework she frowned slightly they werentdoing a very good job mindy was staring at the stairs in frank envy next to her cindy held a book but she never turned a page bindy was the only one of the trio that seemed to be working are you writing an essay bindy luna asked yes for herbology the girl replied writing furiously it very interesting really about the ways to grow juicier and more magical passionata fruits passionata fruits sounded tropical luna stared into the fireplace thinking about sandy beaches and tropical fruit after awhile the flames started to arrange themselves into figures she smiled that one looked like a flobberworm and that looked like a boy with round glasses being fed passionata fruit by a girl with long blonde hair luna blinked and leaned forward now the boy was starting to lick the juice from the girl fingers one by one slowly sharply indrawn breaths drew the luna meandering attention to the school latest most scandalous couple now descending the steps the matchmaking girl felt quite chuffed over getting the two together if blaise hadntbeen half of the former most scandalous pair with malfoy a mere week ago and last night too she supposed things would ve been perfect hey luna want to go for a walk blaise was standing by her sofa a wandering mind was a paradox good and bad at the same time smiling luna agreed with a glance at her friends after she heard wesley roberts was going along to slytherin house too mindy shot daggers tipped with sour grapes during the house party hadntluna told her that a wesley at hand was better than a terry at the turntable her advice not to turn wesley down just because mindy was hoping his roommate would ask her to dance had been ignored now mindy regretted her hasty decision being the sort of person who was above saying i told you so luna waggled her fingers cheerfully as she waved goodbye in the outer corridor wesley said let walk behind those two lovegood i donttrust them not to shock first years with public displays of affection have your wand ready if they start snogging hit zabini with a cold water charm i ll blast boot luna nodded with a smile how droll he was mindy had been very silly to pass him up they followed terry and blaise who were walking with their arms around each other waists luna thought that if the eagle in her dream had carried his snake away intending on ripping her to shreds it looked as though all was forgiven now several times wesley paused to accept galleons from other students he noted her curiosity never bet against love luna i ve done those boys a service taught them an important lesson i deserve a reward he laughed oh wait i buying myself a firebolt goodness really is its own reward she felt the matchmaking urge wesley roberts had cute dimples and bright blue eyes surely there was a girl equally attractive and mischievous to pair him with luna decided she d ask blaise her opinion when the other girl wasntdistracted by the blue gaze of a different boy at that moment her friend glanced back and smiled while terry hand drifted down and squeezed blaise paid her boyfriend back in kind luna shook her head dear dear roberts was right about those two terry was now dragging his girlfriend into a dark doorway one hand firmly on her aaahhh you bastard terry didntlook like he appreciated that blast of cold water the boy promptly returned fire luna blinked as wesley stepped behind her and she received a splash in the face hearing the other girl snickering she raised her wand to share the joy shaking her wet curls blaise hit the ducking and bobbing wesley in the back with a jolt of cold liquid a full fledged water fight broke out only after all four were soaked and shivering was truce called they hurried on to avoid trouble at the beginning of the corridor to slytherin house terry and blaise embraced like they were about to be parted for eternity instead of a few short hours wesley rolled his eyes and pulled his roommate away impulsively hugging her friend luna darted after the boys she enjoyed the jealous stares of her roommates after she returned to the common room too much to describe in mere words while she made her way up to change out of wet clothes luna hummed weasley is our king all ruddy day ginny had heard talk about the love triangle and she was thoroughly sick of it her time spent with malfoy under the dragon claw willow was the only bright spot in the whole day who knew being devoured by a dragon could feel so good no wonder those maidens in old paintings didntlook unhappy to be carried off she smiled at the thought of being carried off by draco and ravished did you say you were famished colin asked as they walked side by side toward the hall speaking thoughts aloud was going to get her in trouble some day luckily that time wasntnow yes i really hungry in the great hall ginny eyes were drawn by the magnetic gaze of a slytherin holding court at another table the steamy look he flickered over her face told her the love god might be feeling the same way our kisses are like faery food the more we devour the hungrier we get so famished we d do anything for another taste becoming consumed with need ravenous ravenous harry eyes were so green when he laughed how silly she d once been over them sending a dwarf with a horrid poem comparing them to pickled toads one valentine day she laughed at herself then and now harry laughed too covertly slanting a look toward the next table her heart skipped a beat draco wasntlaughing he was scowling and his eyes merlin the serpent was steamed about his dragon lover having a laugh with perfect potter would he scorch her for it later oh she hoped so ginny slid onto the bench in between colin and hermione dinner plates started to appear on the table she reached for a basket of rolls surprised to hear blaise voice over her shoulder hi ginny what was this since when did zabini stop for a chat on the way to her table she was alive so boot hadntkilled her that was good but why come over the other girl read the question on her face and smiled like that cat in the alice in something muggle book i was wondering if you re going to be in the library after dinner would you help me with act iv we ll be going over that in muggle studies next class why should a gryffindor help a slytherin ron demanded dryly the tall girl replied because we re two households both alike in dignity ron and harry were giving the girl a what the look of confusion hermione was looking questioningly because she got the reference and was still confused but ginny knew who really wanted to see her in the library mischievously she responded sure for my part i am so attired in wonder i know not what to say act iv i presume blaise gave her an impressed look and challenged i looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this passage she quoted o what men do what men may do what men daily do not knowing what they do smiling that some kind of shire cat grin blaise winked at ron and glided off disregarding her brother cry of pain hermione huffy retort and harry laughter ginny watched terry boot stand and stride down the aisle between the two house tables he lifted his girlfriend hand and kissed it she caressed his cheek students whispered furiously another ravenclaw boy stood up and announced all those owing money may pay me in the entrance hall immediately following dinner bowing ironic thanks the puckish teen sat down by the spot boot had vacated grinning in response to the chorus of boos sent his way the couple reached the middle of the slytherin table where blaise usually sat a hand raised by draco had crabbe and goyle sinking back onto the bench malfoy continued to eat paying no attention to the pair whose hands slowly and reluctantly parted faces looking so bereft that hermione of all people sighed and murmured parting is such sweet sorrow ginny watched draco roll his eyes while blaise took her seat the dragon friend bumped his shoulder smiling first at the smirking blond and then over at ginny smiling back the girl ate as quickly as she could there were so many things she looked forward to learning at the library draco finished the last line of an essay rolled up the parchment and tidied his desk he wasntgoing to the library to study for merlin sake unless a prolonged and thorough snogging of ginny weasley could be considered studying after dinner he d holed up in his room to avoid the sight of his formerly level headed mate giggling with those friends of hers blaise was ecstatic that students now called them romeo and juliet was that supposed to be an improvement that smart mouthed pal of boot was a mercutio if ever there was one though if the bastard thought he was getting five galleons from a malfoy he d find himself at the wrong end of a wand draco frowned in thought if roberts was mercutio what did that make him the fat friar he exhaled noisily honestly all that shakespeare nonsense draco checked his reflection and headed downstairs thank the stars blaise had floated off to see lover boy he didntwant to hear about girly locks he wanted to count every freckle on red face and kiss each one smiling he took a shortcut to the library through a little used corridor he saw something move from the shadows a moment too late well well well malfoy said boot watching him lie immobilized on the floor he clapped roberts on the shoulder go watch the other corridor while the love god and i have a word make it a word and a blow laughing at his own meagre wit the buffoon sauntered off after a salute squatting down terry bared his teeth feeling cold you snake freezing quickly is always painful the menacing smile widened at the other boy involuntary flinching glacialis dolor frozen pain reptiles hate being cold probably why a serpent like you tries to get into the pants of any warm bodied girl you can draco could only shudder as terry said if i ever catch you looking at blaise like you did in that photograph touching her like that a low growl sounded what was the animal going to do rip out his throat sneering in defiance was impossible but draco managed to project insolence in his stare terry boy rose to his feet and taunted in a way that was almost slytherin the hex is temporary but i hope you feel just as bad as you look the pain supposed to be comparable to playing in the snow for a long time without a warming charm when you thaw too quickly feeling returns to your extremities in stabbing needles of anguish he made to leave maybe you ll think twice before you mess with me or mine malfoy the agony subsided just enough for draco to gasp marvelous reluctant humour laced terry words dontlike alliteration eh well if you dontlike getting your arse kicked keep your distance from my girlfriend blaise may think you re two poor little rich kids friends against the world but i know your type you donthave friends ready to go lovely ladies at the library and all that prat roberts was back enjoying the sight of a helpless slytherin terry boy mouth twitched let leave meeting the eyes of the boy on the floor he smiled slightly drawing back an ironic boot he kicked his victim in the ribs a word and a blow wasntthat what you said wesley draco was left shivering on the stone floor while the pair of prats alliterative arseholes arrgghhh strolled off chuckling when the timed spell expired draco dragged himself over to the wall and propped his back against it after a few moments passed he raised his hands amazingly although they felt like they should be red and blistered his hands showed no signs of the frostbite feeling that had wracked them a short time ago light footsteps echoed down the corridor ginny was running toward him cradling him in her arms she touched the cheek that still twitched in reaction to the hex blaise found me told me what terry did to you i came as fast as i could her tender embrace and gentle kisses brought more relief than the cessation of pain the thought that blaise had gone running to send him comfort made his lips quirk boot was wrong about him not having friends ginny misread his smirk brown eyes gave a lovingly stern look you are not going to retaliate because you deserved that hex instead you will now behave properly and everyone will get along fine yes ma am oh shut up you gorgeous bad boy you soft lips ensured compliance strength returning draco arms slid around ginny he pulled her onto his lap quickly he unfastened her robes and slid a cold hand to warm itself against creamy skin he ignored his aching side blaise would be a mate and rub a healing unguent over it later right now he was going to bask in the radiant warmth of the girl in his arms just like the serpent terry boy had accused him of being bird brained ravenclaw what else would a slytherin be giving a hiss of pleasure as slender fingers stroked his back draco let go of every thought except giving a kiss for each freckle a n princess bride fan and proud of it i did indeed create wesley roberts out of westley alter ego the dread pirate roberts he a great mercutio isnthe and no sad ending for this one i also had too much fun putting the word and a blow merc line in as well as the couple of much ado bits and the two houses line from romeo and juliet now i ve got the urge to watch shakespeare in love for some odd reason d chapter 14 happy hallowe en luna stood on the front steps of hogwarts watching students use spells to carve hagrid giant pumpkins she was relieved that the rain had finally departed the lake had risen dramatically and certain love birds meeting under the dragon claw willow had feared their nest would be flooded she smiled imagining the couples making out in a boat floating under the tree good idea this contest nodding her agreement luna smile grew dreamier as she gazed at the boy who d made the comment of course harry would think so his favourite professor had suggested it lorelei had proposed to an enthusiastic dumbledore that teams from each house carve a giant gourd in a school contest individual house teams consisted of the two best carvers from each year which gave gryffindor and the others fourteen able bodies each to execute their designs the four heads of houses dumbledore hagrid and professor lorelei would judge the results the winning house would have their name emblazoned on the trophy as champions of the event and would win the right to keep the great pumpkin until the following year the trophy was charmed to act as a disco ball so the stakes were high and competition was fierce hello harry luna the pumpkins are going to look amazing arentthey professor lorelei stood beside harry left hand slightly raised as though she were fighting the urge to smooth down unruly black hair luna didntblame her she felt similar urges all the time the sight of snape rippling black robes drew the attractive woman attention away from the students bidding them farewell lorelei floated over to the potions master like a moth to a dark flame harry watched her go not even trying to hide his admiration of the curves displayed by the woman clinging black trousers and tunic it made luna tetchy really just because it was late friday afternoon on halloween weekend did that mean teachers should traipse about looking like sirens instead of educators want to go round and see how the carving going harry asked not one to hold a grudge especially after seeing snape and lorelei wander in the direction of hagrid pumpkin patch luna smiled and nodded the teens headed for the gryffindor pumpkin ron and ginny both chosen to compete in the carving competition were hard at work carving a rampant lion into the gourd other gryffindor students were carving fleur de lis into the other three sides the work was very impressive when harry and luna praised the work ron said thanks gin and i must ve carved hundreds of pumpkins over the years fred and george would make mum buy loads so they could scare muggles with them on halloween ginny grinned at her brother remember that muggle tale dad read every year legend of sleepy hollow the boys loved playing headless horseman and throwing the burning charmed pumpkin at retreating muggles i miss those idiots yeah ron said we ll dedicate the trophy to them do a victory dance at the house party tomorrow in their honour we haventwon yet looby red hair fanned as ginny shook her head in exasperation luna agreed that ron seemed to be counting his chickens before they hatched she imagined him watching eggs intently and smiled at the thought as the brother and sister returned to their carving harry and luna strolled on past the hufflepuffs mundane stars and moons design to stop beside the immense ravenclaw gourd ravens and eagles in flight encircled the pumpkin and the artistry was every bit as good as the gryffindor effort look terry they re rendered speechless by our genius wesley roberts lowered his wand to flash a charming smile luna way harry didntseem to find the rascal very amusing he frowned during the entire conversation with the flirtatious boy dontwaste your talent on non judges mate save the charm for mcgonagall and sprout they re going to be tough to sway from house loyalty terry had pulled his hair back which brought attention to his masculine features harry stony expression disapproved of him too how delightful luna smiled as she gently teased it must be tough to concentrate when your girlfriend the competition the boy jaw tightened while his eyes darkened it isntblaise i want to beat it that bastard malfoy he smiled slightly pardon the language luna shouldntsay malfoy in the presence of a nice girl like you harry was smiling now nothing like the enemy of your enemy he added his own thoughts i dontcare who wins as long as it not that arrogant prat git thinks slytherin so superior that meant no double dates with ginny and draco in the future she supposed oh well terry and blaise would be excellent company too luna was in the midst of imagining such a date when she became aware all three boys were staring at her she had no clue why wesley blue eyes gleamed mischievously as he repeated come back and let us know if there anything we can do to one up the competition okay luna sorry you re on your own she said smilingly luna hadntmeant to smile so widely roberts dimples made her do it they also enticed her fingers to waggle goodbye as she followed harry toward the final pumpkin harry sharply indrawn breath and sudden halt brought her gaze to the work of beauty in front of them luna sighed it was a masterpiece the slytherin team had just finished carving blaise hugged draco and then saw her friend bounding over to say hey luna potter let me give you the first look at the winning pumpkin when the way was blocked the girl snapped move it firsties they jumped out of the way blaise said draco and i spent hours on the design isntit amazing c mon luna tell me what you think it brilliant luna smiled as blaise laughed happily and squeezed the breath out of her with an enthusiastic hug she listened to the girl chatter about how fiddly a design and how this and that had been done admiring the sight before her the slytherins had chosen to carve a band of celtic knotwork patterns alternating over and under in an intricate design to encircle the gourd at the top and bottom on each side a complicated interlace of knotwork pattern formed a circle inside each circle was a diamond each one of the four diamonds contained a carving of a celtic beast one for every house the front panel diamond contained a celtic serpent one side depicted the gryphon and the other a badger the back knotwork encircled diamond had a celtic eagle carved into the pumpkin flesh when the sky darkened the illuminated gourd would make the gripping beasts appear to come to life luna lightly ran her fingers over loops and knots and complimented her friend poor harry was silent there was nothing to say except congratulations and he d kiss you know who before praising anything slytherin harry told luna goodbye and walked back to his fellow gryffindors she watched him go with a sympathetic smile an hour later the student body thronged the area admiring the pumpkins glowing softly in the twilight luna noticed harry standing in a group with ron hermione ginny colin and neville she glided over to join them as they listened to dumbledore award the great pumpkin to slytherin house draco held up the trophy and grinned triumphantly as his housemates cheered blaise and two friends did a victory dance around him merlin its worth losing just to see those girls move like pagan priestesses wesley irreverent laughter as he and terry walked up brought reluctant smiles to gryffindor faces his fellow ravenclaw said grimly if snake boy wants to stay healthy he d better keep his hands off my priestess terry menacing words were followed by hermione sharp ones all that writhing and undulating is indecent dumbledore should put a stop to it this minute luna thought hermione sounded a lot like mcgonagall sometimes she idly wondered if the girl ever wore tartan ron as usual added pyrotechnic powder to the fire of hermione indignation yeah they should stop shaking their you know too it not right for girls to be that sexy sexy did you just call those slytherins sexy ronald only half of luna attention was concentrating on listening to ron frantic back pedalling as he assured hermione that he didntfind sleazy erotic dancing at all hot er attractive erm anything the other half focused on harry eyes gleaming with amusement behind glasses that reflected light from the giant pumpkins nearby draco stood with his hands resting on either side of the great pumpkin trophy on the slytherin fireplace mantel feeling the same sense of victory he had the night before he and blaise had worked like house elves over the design for that bloody contest it was only fitting they should win his friend was always nattering on about celtic traditions and had sketched out her idea before presenting and asking him to draw the plans to implement it the moment he d seen the drawings draco knew slytherin would win they spent the hours outside quidditch practice the library and her social life disguised as detention finalizing plans looking over housemates drawings and choosing the most talented to help students had practiced carving the complicated turning and contorting patterns and creatures on more normal sized pumpkins than he cared to count good thing mr zabini came through with the wagon load of pumpkins those weeks of effort and practice had made perfect ginny had certainly thought so sometime after the award ceremony she stayed behind to look at his work up close draco had given his lioness a personal tour after explaining the exterior carvings he d taken her inside through a concealed panel and shown her the initials he had carved on the interior wall her fingertips had traced the letters d m g w and the heart around them then she d turned and pounced pressing him into the pumpkin wall oh my gods draco that so sweet kiss me blaise had smirked while picking pieces of stringy pumpkin off his back during dinner malfoy had smirked returning the favour he d seen the other heart filled with letters on the opposite side of the gourd terry boy must ve carried her off immediately after the award ceremony zabini little happy dance obviously brought out boot animalistic you my woman tendencies forget romeo and juliet those two were tarzan and jane still gloating over our triumph blaise was sitting on the middle cushion of a nearby sofa leaning forward to fix him a cup of tea he accepted it sinking down beside her she had just drizzled honey over a bowl of porridge taken from the loaded breakfast tray just the way he liked it when crabbe and goyle bumbled down the boys staircase snatching the bowl before one of the trolls could inhale it draco listened to the boys effusively thank the girl for inadvertently starting the saturday breakfast tradition weeks ago fiona and morrigan pranced down the girls staircase and squeezed onto the sofa blaise conjured more tea and a plate of croissants fiona pinched off a piece of flaky bread and asked what are you going to do while we all go to hogsmeade blaise spend some time in the library and you know do stuff yeah right he knew what kind of stuff the chit made a decent effort to keep the innocent act going but in the end she caved and gave a wicked smirk blaise was slytherin after all he told everyone his plans to accompany the boys to zonko and then wander around on his own big dark eyes sparkled cheeky knew he wouldntbe alone for long want me to get slinky to pack a picnic and a blanket blaise asked he graciously allowed his friend the honour of doing him the favour the witches she called roommates cackled over his chauvinist piggery malfoy ignored the wenches he expected they were jealous ginny met him at the shrieking shack where he showed her a secret entrance inside the shack was dusty and grimy except in the room where he had used charms to clean and soften the hard wooden floor romance was good but romance in comfort was better magicked candles floated over the large blanket and his girlfriend pretty face lit up as she unpacked the food draco prudently took the credit for everything lying with his head in her lap feeling pleasantly satisfied he looked up and tried to say casually i suppose you ll be dancing with potter tonight why those lovely lips curved into a smile was beyond him he wasntjealous he was concerned for her feet potty was bound to step on them i suppose you ll be dancing with zabini tonight ha he had her there no i won t terry boy finally got goolies and asked her to his party good for him so who will you dance with now every girl who asks no only the pretty ones but somehow he knew that wouldntbring her face down to smother him with kisses draco realized it would be worth depriving slytherin girls if he could also deny gryffindor boys looking down to conceal his sly trap he said offhand if you dontlike the thought of me dancing with other girls we could make a deal soft brown eyes narrowed while pink lips curved he had a feeling that his clever gambit had been more transparent than opaque i like the thought of you with another girl just as much as you like the thought of me with harry so let not dance with anyone else deal lips that had been compared to a god s pick a god any god except the ugly ones pursed in consideration fine if it makes you happy but i need an act of good faith from you to finalize demanding lips gave him what he hadntfinished asking for bold gryffindor well two could revert to house type rising and twisting in a sinuous motion draco pinned ginny and settled down to thoroughly enjoy his dessert later the boy whistled cheerfully while returning to his house reaching the painted lady in the slytherin house portrait he winked she looked especially pretty in the late afternoon sunlight the woman smiled back over a bare shoulder as the serpent under the apple tree hissed who goesss there echis the portrait swung up to reveal the house entrance inside her friends were asking blaise please sing the chorus just once so fiona can get the hang of it draco hung back wanting to hear what she would sing it was some song about a baby boy he hadntheard that particular phrase for a long time it brought back memories something was in her voice an undercurrent of tension moving further into the room draco could see blaise controlled expression she looked as though she were trying to hurry up and get out of there her eyes met his as she sang baby boy again she broke eye contact telling her friends to spin an orb if they wanted to hear the words again smiling briefly blaise told him snape sent word for them to meet him in the headmaster office surprise held draco immobile just long enough for blaise to start up her staircase he decided to do an experiment calling baby girl blaise froze and then turned sideways to ask what baby girl this time instead of freezing she just stood and said why are you calling me that dontyou know no and i donthave time to play games i need to change clothes before i see the headmaster if you dontneed to change go on ahead and i ll meet you there i ll wait fine draco watched his friend walk up the stairs unsure how to read her response did she remember it was impossible shaking off the unsettled feeling he sat down to wait after a change of clothes a mental pep talk and several deep breaths blaise descended the girls staircase and accompanied her best mate to the headmaster office sure you re okay she smiled reassuringly yes i fine speaking the password everlasting gobstoppers the pair entered the secret stairway and waited for the stairs to rise to dumbledore office before stepping onto the landing and knocking the moment blaise stepped inside she knew something was terribly wrong oh sweetie oh darling oh gods sweetie sweetie sweetie dressed in the most expensively atrocious outfit money and bad taste could buy edina zabini hugged her daughter frizzy reddish brown curls shaking with every breathy word eddy greeted her while exclaiming over her daughter finally fashionable new clothes overwhelmed by her mother effusive welcome and the stench of too much designer perfume blaise stepped back to see draco getting a more reserved greeting from his parent you look gorgeous darling if a little careless in your attire denim and malfoy dontmix sweetie give your mother a kiss dutifully the tall youth pecked the icily attractive cheek his mother took such care to maintain white blonde hair piled high narcissa malfoy impassively admired the face she saw as a masculine version of her own blaise thought her friend looked as taken aback as she was what in the name of merlin was going on here dumbledore the twinkling old blighter was waving them into chairs interrupting eddy exclamation of what a day i ve had sweetie darling darling darling sweetie your parents have petitioned for you to be allowed to attend the fire festival in hogsmeade this evening all eyes turned to the dark corner and professor snape he continued in a voice that made the silly women shiver although his cold drawl dripped with sarcasm the headmaster and i concede that it would be unduly punitive to deprive mothers of their children company you are hereby allowed off school grounds until midnight i can t i have detention until the end of the month i dontdeserve to go desperately blaise tried her darnedest to make her eyes big like something soft cuddly something he wouldntwant to kick it only made the potions master smile oh what an evil smile snape had inside he must be laughing his arse off dumbledore interjected professor lorelei has given such a glowing report of your helpfulness my dear that detention is now considered served go enjoy the evening with your mother with our blessing no imprecation was low enough for that wily old so and so he knew damn his merry eyes that she and draco would rather scrub tubeworms off desks with their fingernails and sort stinky jobberknoll feathers with their teeth her mother chose that moment when darling girl s hand twitched with the urge to blast someone with her wand to make the farce complete tilting her head like a curious bird at her daughter mutinous expression she waved her hands in an ineffectual attempt to remember something she d forgotten cissy doesntblaise face remind you of their first year at hogwarts that first yule we spent together do you remember what we called our little sweetie darlings do i narcissa sneered her upper lip the only muscle in her face not immobilised by years of beauty treatments baby girl gave you that bitch troll from hades look when we caught her and baby boy playing healer after their birthday party malfoys have always been precocious gripping her short curls with both hands blaise jumped to her feet and shouted oh my gods that was years ago and if either of you says one more bloody word about it mother i owling drinky and having him make a bonfire out of your shoes ignoring eddy sputters of horror blaise threatened manolo blahniks jimmy choos chanels fendis gone forever i swear it snape and dumbledore were making suspicious choking noises if only they d do it for real unable to look at draco blaise headed for the door behind her narcissa said coolly i thought you took away baby girl memory of that naughtiness with a charm eddy glaring back at her wide eyed silent parent blaise said venomously she was too bloody pissed to steer the broomstick home much less put a charm on me mumsie passed out on the neighbour lawn and didntremember a damn thing the next day she sneered at both women you want to go to dinner we ll go meet us at the three broomsticks in two hours remember mother dear not one bloody word as the door closed behind her blaise could hear her mother gush in an attempt to smooth everything over oh dear my dear dear distraught daughter takes after her father family dangerously passionate people unwise mixture of spanish conquistadors and borgia s very scary actually poor darling i preferred her quiet and frumpy narcissa contempt travelled down to the girl rapidly descending the stone stairway the sound of footsteps soon echoed draco caught up to blaise in the outer corridor and grabbed her arm forcing her to stop you let me think you didntremember all this time baby girl why her eyes filled with tears and spilled over c mon baby boy we werentplaying healer and you know it that just what you told our mothers because the truth would ve really freaked them out i let you think i d forgotten because all i wanted was to be your friend you are my friend strong arms encircled her shaking body and hugged her tight she returned the hug oh look cissy our baby girl and boy are having a touching moment yeah right c mon eddy let leave before blaise goes after your handbags i need a drink blaise stepped away from draco laughing shakily as she asked are they the worst mothers in the world or does it only seem like it they do their pitiful best i suppose draco silvery eyes ruefully followed the departure of the women who would have several drinks before their children arrived for dinner he slipped a companionable arm around blaise shoulder so mate how re we going to get you from hogsmeade to terry boy after a moment thought a brilliant slytherin idea formed smirking up into the handsome face smiling down at her in anticipation blaise whispered first we go to the library and sneak into the restricted section and then i send a package to a certain redhead following dinner with eddy and cissy draco grinned like a fallen angel while she explained in detail the bout of rule breaking lifted their spirits as they made their side trip to the library and prepared for the night ahead later returning to the castle beneath a cloak of invisibility blaise smiled in expectation her note to ginny along with the dress and the challenge had worked like a charm the other girl had borrowed the cloak met her in the village and traded places without a hitch eddy and cissy would be happy their darling children were enjoying the fire festival together and their darlings would be happy too blaise giggled as she snuck into her chamber where her friends were waiting fiona took the cloak and ran downstairs the house elf slinky was waiting to spirit it back into potter trunk after trying on a dress she thought would be appropriate blaise modelled it for morrigan and fiona oh oh no hell no girlfriend you got to represent and no slytherin girl is gonna be seen in that fiona laughed what morrigan means is that dress is nice demure and boring and not going to be worn tonight she tossed an outfit into blaise arms commanding go change the midriff baring sleeveless top in ravenclaw blue went with a short black wrap skirt splashed with streaks of the same colour as the blouse blaise slipped into heels charmed for comfort and safety however did muggles dance in mundane shoes and was ready to go dontforget these morrigan held out bronze hoop earrings after a last check of hair and makeup the girls walked their friend around the throng of partying slytherins to the entrance you could come with me dance with wesley blaise tempted fiona maybe next time if he keeps up the sweet talk maybe waving goodbye blaise ignored advice not to do anything they wouldntdo what was that swinging from a chandelier the nervous girl made her way to the ravenclaw portrait once upon a midnight dreary blaise told the shadowy man in the painting inside the room looked very different from before the tables and chairs had been removed and boys and girls were doing some kind of line dance on the centre dance floor across the room terry was preparing to spin another orb a girl was smiling at him and flipping her shoulder length tresses back flirtatiously the orpheus didntseem to notice as he leaned over to check how much playing time was left on the currently spinning orb terry eyes met hers across the room her guy wolfish smile flashed white in the dimmed chamber and blaise was suddenly very very glad she wasntwearing something nice and boring like that witch trying to chat up someone else man disregarding curious stares including the blonde s blaise sashayed over and melted into her boyfriend arms silence broke the kiss the song had ended while the orpheus was occupied and now everyone was staring terry hurriedly spun an orb and told her i on for another half hour then wesley taking over can you dance to this kind of music recognizing the opening to one of her mother favourite disco songs dancing queen blaise said watch me lovegood and a friend of hers brocklehurst were standing nearby so she grabbed their hands and pulled them onto the floor they stared at her dubiously blaise spoke loudly so they would hear over the music look bindy you and luna just follow my lead it easy step back right left right touch left next to right and clap good now forward by the end of the next song night fever she had the girls doing disco points and the hustle after leaving the floor blaise stood behind terry and slid her hands around to stroke his chest she rested her cheek against his warm back it felt like she was sinking into his skin he felt so good swaying back and forth that her lids began to close i think you put eurydice to sleep orpheus old pal blinking sleepily she smiled at wesley who shooed them off after asking about fiona while terry led her onto the floor wesley droll voice filled the silence between songs by announcing the next tune would be a dedication from a slytherin to a ravenclaw familiar music started to play blaise smiled knowing her friends had sent wesley the orb she swayed close to brush fine brown strands away from terry face moving her body to the beat how do i dance to this terry said as the singer asked how his girl got so fly he caressed her back and swayed watching blaise drop and pivot her hips her sinuous upwards and downwards half turns achieved the desired result he pulled her tight against him she smiled when the words of the song made him laugh he asked are you my superfly chick yeah baby after the music ended wesley facetiously sexy tone described the next song as being a dedication from a ravenclaw to a slytherin dreamy music filled the air how do i dance to this terry hair brushed her face when he moved her arms around his neck and started to sway leaning into his body blaise moved with him and listened to yellow a dreamy romantic tune their swaying grew slower and slower until they were in an unashamed embrace softly terry said along with the singer i love you so she silenced him with an expression of love that went beyond words the rustling of leaves hooting of owls and scraping of one tree branch against another were normal sounds but as ginny walked the path to hogsmeade she reflected that this was no ordinary night it was one of the three nights at the end of summer a time of transition between one season and another when night became longer than day and the veil between the world she knew and the fabled otherworld became thin in between times like twilight and this time at summer end seemed to belong to neither world and yet somehow remained in both she knew her gran stories of faery mischief were responsible for her startling at shadows and rustling in the underbrush ever since they d seen real faeries ginny had wondered what other stories told by her beloved gran had been true as well she felt the same feelings walking into hogsmeade as farmers in days gone by must have felt about the coming winter a mixture of anticipation and dread she anticipated seeing draco feeling the rush of attraction and yet she dreaded becoming more emotionally involved where could this relationship lead ginny wended her way through the fire festival celebrated by the village determined to throw off questions and doubts like the trees shedding their leaves she reached the meeting place in the alley beside the robe shop a slytherin couple sat on a cloak quietly talking the sight of blaise dark head leaning against draco shoulder gave ginny a pang until she threw off her invisibility cloak and saw how eagerly the other girl greeted her about time you got here i ve got to change out of this ridiculous dress and get my party started if you know what i mean not really but it sounded fun the girls exchanged cloaks and blaise hurriedly explained draco and i snatched up olde and beste forgotten bewitchments and charms from the restricted section i remembered using a spell from that once she grinned dontask and i wonttell anyway it a simple blood magic glamour charm as long as you wear my cloak people will think you re me except malfoy who gave blood for immunity blaise put on the cloak be good and dontlet our mums catch you snogging they ll start sending out invitations to the wedding dress looks fabulous on you by the way keep it oooh i invisible the girls voice drifted softly from the entrance to the alley bye sweetie darlings sweetie darlings a favourite expression of blaise mum she a unique person which is probably why she and my mother are best mates draco shrugged curving masculine lips were too tempting to resist ginny backed draco against the shop wall kissing him with the pent up emotion she was afraid to express in words he slid wickedly clever fingers through her hair and did that wonderful sliding shifting move that fluidly changed their positions now he was pressing her against the wall and moving in a way that had her gripping his shoulders and gasping lovely sweetie darlings sin is in against a building though not really what purebloods should do is it i am sorry sweeties but i must insist you go get a room about to tell the frizzy headed hag to go to hades ginny was grateful draco read her face and quickly said we were just about to look around the festival mrs zabini sorry you misunderstood our little kiss misunderstood eh i ll be the judge of that i say our baby girl and boy were about to play draco interrupted the icy blonde who joined her shorter reddish haired friend mother i in the mood to buy blaise some obsidian at one of the booths care to help me pick it out immediately distracted by the thought of shopping the two older women led the couple from booth to booth from one end of the festival to the other sneering and dismissing all the wares of inferior quality zabini jewelers had shops around the wizarding world so mrs zabini knew what she was about a vendor selling from a rickety table under a tattered awning caught the women eyes come try this necklace on sweetie it almost without flaw just like you blaise mum was horribly funny or funnily horrible it was hard to decide which draco mother was just awful telling vendors they could drop the attitude pick up better merchandise out of muggle skips or goblin rubbish bins and so on sneering at everyone and everything except her baby boy and what was that about calling a sixteen year old baby ginny was starting to wish she d never come the witches were leeching all the magic out of the evening with their demands and complaints perceptive as ever draco manoeuvred the women back to the three broomsticks ordered them a bottle of something that will knock them out and pulled ginny out of the pub they walked until the inn and the mothers were far behind thank you for the necklace it beautiful ginny said softly a short laugh burst forth it small payment for putting up with those two it was nice of blaise to give me a dress draco smiled you look lovely in it black velvet makes your skin glow makes your hair shine brighter than that bonfire the talented fingers that had drawn the plans for the slytherin pumpkin now moved over her features making ginny forget his mother and his friend everything but him look his finger pointed to the bonfire in a nearby field young men were lighting torches from the flames and running away in all different directions amused grey eyes studied her dreamy smile do you know what they re doing ginny nodded my gran told me fire running the village boundaries protect the people in it from mischievous faeries and malevolent forces that roam at night during the end of summer smirking draco assured her that he was all the protection she needed tonight he slid an arm around her waist and together they walked toward the bonfire a goblin band was playing a tune a woman voice sung in gaelic it was lorelei the professor swayed as she sang and around the fire couples danced a lone figure off in shadow watched the proceedings arms crossed and impassive it was professor snape she asked should we go draco shook his head slowly no i want to dance with you celebrate the end of summer like the celts did hold you in my arms as the old year dies and the new year begins again touched by the sincerity in his compelling voice ginny held draco hand and led him to the outer edge of those dancing around the fire circling and twirling first in a dignified waltz and then in a more and more free spirited movement filled with laughter and delight in each other the couple ended up spinning together as the song ended kisses and caresses celebrated each other as well as the magic of music and dance and life hand in hand they walked back to the castle with the faint chime of faery laughter drifting upon the night air if we shadows have offended think but this and all is mended that you have but slumb red here while these visions did appear and this weak and idle theme no more yielding but a dream a n thanks to nazgulgirl for quoting that in a review seemed perfect to use here had to give a long chap treat for halloween a short chap would have been a trick worthy of a flaming review did you like the great pumpkin charlie brown lol found loads and loads of interesting celtic summer end beliefs and traditions online and paraphrased and pieced together all the ones i liked to use in the chap celtic interlace knotwork is really amazing and any pumpkin carved in that style would win my vote yes darlings the snape lorelei bits throughout was a more transparent than opaque bid to entice you over to read my other fic dontyou find the thought of snape lorelei at halloween simply irresistible lol also did indeed have abfab girls return as blaise and draco mums they ll show up again at christmas holiday you ll be looking forward to yule with eddy and cissy wontyou lol remember to be a sweetie darling and treat your author to a review chapter fifteen love and quidditch november at hogwarts was like a fickle woman it could blow hot or cold drench in rain blast with icy wind or blanket in snow sometimes capriciously moving through all conditions within thirty calendar days ginny was glad that today the first monday of the month the weather woman was in a good mood quidditch practice when the sky was a gleaming white that filtered the sun and maximized visibility was a fine thing almost as fine as draco who watched the practice with a group of slytherins elegantly sprawled he was leaning back against the girl on the bench behind him shaking her head in an effort to concentrate ginny flew a complicated pattern to get the quaffle in lookin good weasley blaise zabini impudent drawl sounded as though she spoke from the air nearby instead of across the pitch the projection charm was a good one because ron startled violently upon hearing the coolly suggestive voice her brother desperate grab for his broomstick gave the slytherins reason to break into laughter blaise amusement was evident when she said i was referring to ginny ronald but you dontlook half bad either mr freckles the gryffindor team joined the slytherin students in laughing at ron violent blush ron was in for some major heckling over being called mr freckles ginny smiled no need to wonder where freckles came from draco had murmured it that night in the corridor before trying to give a kiss for each one ow bloody damn bludger rubbing her arm where the ball had hit her ginny glared at the distracting group the prince of smirks got a special i ll take care of you later scowl she didntneed to see classic features to know that flash of white meant he was grinning in anticipation her stomach felt like her broom had just dropped out from under her merlin how she looked forward to taking long thorough care of him later ginny dragged her gaze away following harry shouted advice on leaning into the final turn before scoring practice continued hi ginny said blaise leaning against the wall outside the changing rooms she smiled in a way that had the gryffindor keeper hurrying to brush past his sister and escape the disturbingly attractive slytherin contemptuous laughter drew ginny attention several metres away crabbe and goyle were having a laugh over ron hasty retreat draco was smiling enigmatically before she could ask the cheeky girl what she wanted a clipped voice asked what do you want zabini uncrossing the long legs that alarmed ron so much blaise straightened none of your business potter harry liked hearing that about as much as draco liked seeing the other boy hovering over ginny shoulder funny how draco could lean on his friend and not think twice but if ginny friend stood even a bit close she could practically feel the steam pouring from her dragon smiling at the eerily similar look of wrath on both male faces she said dontover react harry blaise and i study for muggle studies together we ll go talk where the sight of a gryffindor and a slytherin getting along wontoffend people who want to hang onto grudges for dear life gin ignoring harry sputtering and the other girl smirking ginny stormed over to a tree away from seekers of both houses blaise followed nice job you did back there weasley too bad it ll take more than a why dontwe all just get along speech to bring gryffindors around to you having a slytherin boyfriend you actually sound like you mean that the exotic looking girl smiled ruefully looking down as she admitted i do i want draco to be happy which requires you since my friend is your boyfriend dontyou think we should try being friends too i thought we already were or do you usually spend so much time helping and giving dresses to acquaintances no oh gods it was so weird being friends with this particular slytherin ginny supposed after falling for draco anything could happen perhaps a white rabbit would come bounding up and say it time for tea zabini c mon hurry up we re starving over here both girls laughed at crabbe loud complaint blaise smiled and said oh yeah i forgot to tell you during all that touchy feely stuff and by the way we are not hugging ever draco wants to meet you later ginny said fine while we re making rules dontever call me girlfriend like you do flint and never refer to my brother as mr freckles again ron canthandle any more of your teasing blaise backed away one of those cheshire cat grins on her face ginny knew because she d looked alice in wonderland up after the last time she d seen that smile she narrowed her eyes at the feline look of amusement when and where does he want to meet the other girl giggled the answer before sauntering off toward draco who smiled wickedly before leading his little band away ginny entered the girls locker room tossing her robes huffily thought it was funny did they as she headed for the shower ginny began to smile maybe it was a little bit funny that draco wanted to meet in that particular place hand poised to open the door to the trophy room later ginny paused she should feel awful about sneaking around behind everyone backs it was very un gryffindor to stretch the truth as far as she did to have what she wanted blaise had told her you wontbe lying if you touch the library door on the way back you ll have gone to the library just like you told them no one needs to know about your little side trip that self serving slytherin logic should ve disgusted her but it didn t ginny admired it resolved to use it whenever she needed and hoped to need it lots and lots a month ago if anyone had been foolish enough to tell her that she would one day return to this place in the hope of finding draco malfoy what a jinx she would ve given them ginny took a deep breath ignored the little voice of doubt that said he wontbe there he laughing at you and planning to tell filch right this minute and turned the handle inside the torches were extinguished but magicked candles gave the room a romantic glow ginny gaze fell on draco he was sitting against the wall on a blanket his intent stare reminded her of a jungle cat fixed on prey resisting the urge to press a hand to her fluttery stomach ginny sat beside him and accepted a glass of sparkling liquid sipping it she exclaimed its cider draco gave her a look of superior amusement did you think i d try to get you drunk and take advantage of you no but if he didntstop smirking adorably she d take advantage of him draco smiled and set their glasses aside he pulled her down to lie atop the muscular body that looked and felt way too good whispering feel free red it seemed her habit of thinking aloud was finally getting her into trouble good thing trouble was a gorgeous blond and into his arms was where she most wanted to go ginny looked down into his face thinking he was the only boy worth compromising every moral her mother ever tried to teach he asked what are you thinking crazy about draco but not that crazy she said the first thing that came to mind i was thinking how you resemble a jungle cat looking at his prey but i cantdecide what what that smile of yours should be considered a dark art what were we talking about right her voice was breathy whether you re going to devour me or just play ginny fingers clenched reflexively in draco hair as his predatory smile widened what do you want me to do the feel of wickedly talented lips moving up her throat caused her to gasp both after wednesday quidditch practice draco could almost see a red film appear before his eyes montague was an utter bastard and every practice under his never ending stream of criticism became harder and harder to tolerate the captain constantly berated and belittled everyone but saved his crudest and most spiteful remarks for the boy who would never be a harry potter that phrase and all the hateful variations spouted by montague during every practice at each imagined fault and flaw was driving draco spare during the halloween feast the ogre like chaser and quidditch captain had gone too far swaggering over to say no wonder zabini needs two boyfriends to satisfy her if you re as lousy in bed as you are on a broom malfoy maybe you should ask potter for tips to improve your game on and off the pitch if blaise hadnthit the wanker with rictusempra causing montague to double over in laughter and be dragged out gasping for breath merlin knew what draco would ve done father might be an amoral bastard but he was brilliant at creating nasty hexes lucius taught his son several before being dragged off to azkaban the hex affecting private areas would ve been first on the list to try after the feast draco remembered sitting in the dark common room long after the last student had gone to bed he d stared into the fire feeling as though a firestorm of anger was consuming him as much as i enjoy watching you brood baby boy i d enjoy seeing you getting even a whole lot better blaise sat down beside him montague has got to be stopped really i never thought of that i so enjoy taking abuse you know what are you going to do about it i thought i d hex him where it d hurt the most but that wouldnthelp the quidditch team me especially since i no harry bloody potter roger harry potter yeah that just what montague thinks you re going to do since i probably as lousy in bed as i am on a broom draco gritted bastard if i wanted to feel like shite i could re read one of father letters blaise had a dangerous look in her eye that reminded draco of the macbeth woman he d read about in muggle studies it gave him hope she smiled so deviously he knew she d thought of something that would be bad for the captain and good for him slender fingers held up a piece of parchment i came across this on terry desk it a list of memory charms out of a book from the restricted section one of them memoria falsus is used to create false memories montague could be made to remember how awful he feels over treating everyone so badly he would be compelled to confess to the team become a model chaser after making someone better suited captain the internal firestorm became embers that warmed draco smiled at his lady macbeth and began to talk about how the plan could be put into action when blaise seemed surprised he wanted to pull the thing off after mid week practice he thought of a line from shakespeare play and quoted if it were done when tis done then twere well it were done quickly a doubt struck he asked if we should fail his conspirator grinned at him we fail but screw your courage to the sticking place and we ll not fail following wednesday practice montague made things easy by being as big a windbag off the pitch as on he spent so much time blowing hot air that the other quidditch team members were showered and gone before the bully had done more than toss his robes into a bin for cleaning beefy arms crossed over a hairy chest the captain said why are you still hanging round malfoy want to hear me list all the ways you ll never be half as good as potter the cold smile on draco face removed the one on montague s one short spell later the brawny teen had a new attitude thirty minutes after that the slytherin went to find the rest of the team the new quidditch captain strutted through corridors deserted by students spending the time before dinner in their common rooms draco saw his favourite redhead and made a beeline for her he dragged ginny into a deserted classroom and pushed her back against the closed door laughing he kissed her enthusiastically she smiled dazedly you seem so pleased did something good happen draco laughed again and impulsively spun his girl in circles until she laughed with him he gave ginny another kiss you are looking at the new slytherin quidditch captain montague resigned and yours truly is now in charge which means gryffindor better watch out i always watch out for you malfoy cantkeep your eyes off me can you shut up and kiss me captain yes ma am when draco kissed ginny goodbye he headed for the common room looking to share the whole story with blaise a timid first year noticed him scanning the chamber and stammered that zabini and some other girls were doing something in the empty classroom around the corner from the slytherin corridor curious draco made his way to the room and silently opened the door five girls dressed in trainers very short pleated skirts and sleeveless midriff baring tops stood listening to another girl whose back was to the door she was reminding them to practice coordinating their motions until they did them in unison the girl warned that unless their arms were stiff their muscles tight and the transitions smooth and snappy the routine would be sorry instead of slammin whatever that meant one of the girls listening was morrigan she noticed him right off and mischievously winked before asking the instructor to show them one more time how to correctly pick up things referred to as pom poms obligingly the girl dropped the green and silver shakers saying alright remember you bend your knees and go down to pick them up dontever bend forward like this unless you want the gryffindor section to get a good look at your aaahhh the upside down face staring in horror at him through long legs was no girl s it belonged to professor lorelei bloody hell he d just seen a professor backside was morrigan trying to get him detention the witch the girls were snickering over the prank played on their sponsor the professor immediately straightened and pulled on her teaching robes she reminded the still giggling wenches you wontbe laughing if you dontput time and effort into your endeavour ladies you have the movements and motions down but loads more practice is needed to blend the two together into something that will wow the quidditch crowd this saturday she stuffed her shakers into a bag i ll be checking back friday to give you your tights and jumpers yes miss flint jumpers it november and heaven only knows how chilly the day will be she paused to listen to a question then answered no miss macduff the sweaters wontbe dorky they ll hug your body yes i promise all right if there nothing else i ll be off professor fair skin now showing only a tinge of pink embarrassment lorelei looked at one of the blonde greengrass twins mary kate or ashley who could tell as the girl asked when will we get our house points professor hands will award the one hundred points after the match one hundred dark eyes twinkled yes mr malfoy one hundred the muggle studies professor really wants the student body to see what muggle cheerleading is all about right i bet a raised brow and a smirk were the professor only acknowledgement that yes hands was a dirty old man who wanted to see some pretty girls shake their pom poms the woman exit was halted again by the other greengrass girl did professor snape say it was alright for us to do this the professor smiled reassuringly at ashley or mary kate whoever i going to show uh i mean explain the cheerleading concept to your head of house as soon as possible i sure he ll have no problems with it whatsoever the cheering is only for one match and it for educational purposes so just keep practicing and i ll see you friday after the woman left the girls burst into giggles oh my gods did you see her face she was totally embarrassed that malfoy saw her arse morrigan made a comment that stopped everyone in their tracks did you hear lorelei little slip she said she was going to show snape the routine the boy observing the girls laughed at the expressions of disgust made after that remark fiona morrigan and blaise groaned oh my gods that so gross i cantbelieve i didntsee it before the greengrass girls were shocked and said together as if they shared a brain no she said explain she wouldn t they arent the three sixth years looked at the two fifth years blaise the most diplomatic of the lot agreed sure they re just friends yeah you re right dontworry about it you can go we ll see you two same time tomorrow okay after the twins left the three girls who remained cackled like witches over the thought of lorelei and snape malfoy said does anyone want to say hello to the new captain of the quidditch team blaise face lit up screaming yes she and the other girls hugged him before swaying and shaking their ridiculous pom poms in celebration happier than he d been in ages draco danced with them saturday sky was a clear sunny blue that took the chill out of the air and made the atmosphere for the opening game of the quidditch season sparkle brightly as the sunlight following the crowd headed across the grounds to the stadium luna received several dubious glances from her fellow students perhaps it was because she was wearing a pin of a rampant lion on her cloak or maybe it was because her earrings didntmatch one ear had a raven dangling from a silver hook and the other sported an eagle on a golden one conceivably the strange item that rustled and shook as she held it in her hand was the true object of interest considering the variety of probabilities passed the time as she climbed the stairs to reach the high bleachers arentyou sitting with us luna the indies had stopped by their usual section it was between the slytherin and gryffindor segments of the stands gryffindor and slytherin students were separated by other houses and the quidditch pitch it was a very good arrangement for several obvious reasons luna said no i sitting with gryffindor today since hufflepuff and slytherin are playing ravenclaw doesntneed my support oh okay see you lindy smiling over the nickname luna drifted on hey lovegood want to sit with us i could use some decent company the guys keep talking quidditch strategy and boot here only wants to stare at the slytherin section i beside myself with boredom the blue and bronze striped scarf made wesley merry eyes look even more appealing the smile on his handsome face revealed that he would never really be bored he found his fellow students much too amusing luna couldnthelp smiling at him sorry i sitting with ginny i dontthink you ll be bored for long though blaise told me slytherin has something special planned wesley eyes gleamed with curiosity luna sternly reminded herself that she preferred amethyst blue orbs oops i mean emerald emerald emerald emerald dimples and a flirtatious smile flashed hmmm i wondered why that front section of their stands was cleared and a long platform put there instead what going to happen terry boot turned to look at his friend luna thought it unfair boys like him had such lovely long hair and eyelashes when they didntappreciate them nearly as much as a girl would well she corrected inwardly i suppose their girlfriends appreciate them he said blaise told me some girls asked her to help put together some cheer thing just for today she said the muggle studies professor wants everyone to see how muggles lead cheers to encourage their teams frowning the boy admitted i was working out a new offensive flight pattern for the team when she was telling me about it so i didntlisten like i should ve now i starting to worry muggle cheering you told your girlfriend okay to muggle cheering wesley laughter rang out infectiously his friend smiled as he asked do you know what it means that muggle cheering thing snickering the puckish boy nodded his head i half muggle mate i ve got relatives with satellite telly back home and yeah i know what cheerleaders do and what they wear doing it what do you mean what they wear what did i agree to wesley eyes met luna s her steady glance must have told him that yes she too knew what cheering meant and was now glad she wouldntbe nearby when terry got an eyeful of what he d thoughtlessly agreed his girlfriend should do the mischief maker winked at her as she waved goodbye and moved on behind her she could hear the snorting imp tell his friend it not something i can explain mate you ll just have to see for yourself reaching the gryffindor section luna made her way to the bottom bleacher where a lively group sat talking about the upcoming match dontknow why we even bothered to come really you know slytherin will win before a half hour over ron said yes but it always good to see the enemy in action we play slytherin in two weeks said harry ginny looked up luna i saved you a seat she patted the spot between her and harry luna smiled as she sat down the crimson stripe in his scarf made harry pale skin glow forgetting the object in her hand luna reached up to touch his cheek the shaking sound saved her from making an embarrassing move harry looked curiously at the item green and silver strands what that then i dontknow exactly blaise said all the slytherins were getting them for the game today you hold the stick and shake it so the strands rustle and encourage your team hermione leaned around ron to give the shaker a suspicious look i ve seen something like that before girls called cheerers or something use them why are they at hogwarts trying to appear as innocent as possible luna replied the muggle studies professor promised to award house points if some slytherin girls would learn muggle cheering and give an exhibition of it today hermione said you re not telling me they re going to dress up in skimpy costumes and shake their shakers are you smiling nervously luna looked at harry and then ginny green eyes and brown were equally amused at the idea and neither looked willing to save their friend from hermione interrogation luckily the redhead peering across the pitch with his omnioculars distracted everyone by exclaiming merlin those slytherin girls are half naked everyone in hearing distance whipped out their omnioculars and stared eagerly over to where five slytherin girls were entering the stands the slytherin crowd erupted into whistles and cheers waving their streaming shaker things wildly luna could see why each girl wore tan tights with low white socks and trainers a body hugging green sweater with a silver snake and trim on it and a very short green and silver pleated skirt turning her magnified gaze toward the ravenclaw section luna saw terry standing frozen in place staring with his mouth open wesley was grinning like a gorgeous fool beside him suddenly a music projection charm activated and the stadium quieted as music filled the stands blaise was having the time of her life the shocked silence that engulfed the fans soon changed to a roar of approval from slytherin house at least the entire green and silver section was a mass of dancing students laughing waving and shaking as the girls moved together in a tight unit the movements high v and low bow and arrow daggers punches diagonals and more that had seemed so silly when first practised flowed together in a snappy routine that was definitely giving spectators something to talk about morrigan had coordinated some bounce and cross steps along with the hip shaking that seemed to go naturally with muggle cheering blaise morrigan and fiona spun on their heels to face the gryffindor section blaise couldntsee luna or the group she was sitting with but she could imagine their faces the thought of ron gaping while watching avidly through omnioculars brought a sparkle to her eyes and an amused smile to her face she added an extra snap to her shake for the repressed mr freckles pivoting back to face the enthusiastic slytherin crowd in the next part of the routine blaise saw the quidditch teams walk out onto the pitch out of the corner of her eye the girls transitioned from a tight routine to one that was more of a dance with pom poms for the final chorus a sideways glance confirmed that every quidditch player except one was standing still as they stared at the cheerleaders only draco was swaying to the music in a way that had girls pointing and giggling merlin only knew what the teams thought of the cheerleading and the muggle music the end of the song brought an end to the routine but the fans were still shaking their streamers as the announcer introduced the teams and the quidditch match began the girls began to rally the crowd with a cheer c mon fans donttry to fake it stand up now and lemme see you shake it shake sha shake sha the roar of the crowd totally distracted the hufflepuff team one chaser even dropped the quaffle when he flew by side shaking girls when we say green you say silver green silver green silver when we say beat those you say hufflepuffs beat those hufflepuffs beat those hufflepuffs the poor hufflepuffs were a sorry team on a good day and today had to have been among the worst their keeper always let the quaffle in bludgers constantly hit the chasers and the beaters hit their own team mates while gawking at the cheerleaders even their seeker attention was diverted leaving the snitch to be captured by malfoy after only twenty minutes of play morrigan led the ecstatic crowd in a victory cheer let hear all the first years yell sly ther in let hear all the second years yell shaking her pom poms together above her head blaise saw draco fly up to the stands she broke away to admire the wiggling snitch in his hands he grinned blaise that cheerleading is the best weapon our team ever had too bad you girls cantdo it every game a voice behind her said damn you zabini i sick of you throwing yourself at malfoy why dontyou just jump him right here and now blaise had been leaning over the railing to admire the snitch at the word jump a maddened pansy parkinson pushed her blaise toppled out of the stands straight toward the shocked boy on a broomstick clinging to him in terror the frightened girl shrieked as the broom dropped from the sudden addition in weight draco shouted wrap your legs around me bugger it i cantsee with you choking me lean back against the broomstick trust me you wontfall hold onto my arms i ve got to stop this bloody dive the broomstick dive was pulled out and the sound of cheering caused blaise to open her eyes draco face was inches from her own as her friend leaned over her to steer the broom with hands gripping the handle above her head pale lips twitched meeting her eyes caused his to crinkle as he began to shake with laughter boot is going to kill me if creevey or anyone else takes a picture of this laughing openly now draco gasped between howls can you imagine the headline for this photograph blaise couldnthelp laughing with him relief was making her giddy releasing his arms she stretched her own out and said look mum no hands which caused them both to crack up again only when draco returned her to the stands and the girls helped her roll off the broom and stand shakily on the platform once more did the thought of how that little scene might have looked sink in before she could turn to look for her guy strong arms lifted and slung her over a broad shoulder dangling head down against terry back blaise automatically kicked her legs a firm hand smacked the part of her anatomy sticking into the air quit wiggling it hard to carry you and try and keep this indecent skirt covering your arse at the same time terry shut the hell up okay uh oh malfoy delighted laughter didnthelp things neither did his parting words no need to thank me ape man it was my pleasure to save jane from that angry native see you jane good luck with tarzan terry set her down when they reached the stairway encircling her wrist in an inescapable grip he tugged her down the stairs as they crossed the grounds to the school blaise jogged to keep up with strides that grew faster and faster her boyfriend was ominously silent while they climbed flights of stairs to the seventh floor he finally halted at a section of bare wall across from a moth eaten old tapestry the hanging depicted trolls clubbing a wizard holding large ballet slippers in his hands if he d been trying to get trolls to learn ballet barnabas had deserved the name the barmy terry let go of her wrist walking three times past a particular part of the wall blaise gasped as a large door with a brightly polished brass handle appeared in what had been stone opening the door he nodded for her to enter she took a deep breath and walked inside the door closed unnoticed while blaise stared in wonder her brain assured her this was just a magical room but her eyes said differently they told her she was in a tree house and beyond the balcony railing was a vast green jungle flowering vines perfumed the warm air a table and chairs and a low cushioned area took up the large round space that looked as though it had grown out of the tree it was built into she stood on the balcony watching nervously as terry removed his cloak and stripped off his jumper and shirt behind a veil of silky hair his eyes blazed blaise backed away until she was trapped between the bamboo rail and a muscular body terry voice was husky i concentrated on the room being what you wanted blaise is this what you want me to be a jungle man claiming his woman me tarzan you jane his smile was lopsided i have to admit i feel pretty wild right now after seeing you fall off that bloody platform and hearing the guys make jokes about you wrapping your legs around that he paused to make a growling sound deep in his throat a slight smile told her he noticed her reaction malfoy lucky he saved you and didnttry anything he gets to live you though what do you get blaise leaned away dragged off her sweater and threw herself into terry arms her hands caressed every inch of skin she could reach after ravenous kisses softened into loving ones she pulled away for a moment to smile me blaise me get terry blaise love terry so much a smile transformed her man face from wild to beloved terry love blaise too a gentle finger tapped against her lips no more talk more kissing a n walking a fine er vine here want to stress love and romance w out making it too erm adult trying for a slight lime flavour like that water where you can just taste it ya know in my other fic lorelei and snape are adults so their relationship is naturally more like limeade watered down to suggestive implication cause i like it like that will pick key lime over lemon any day lol and if you re now going to read my simply irresistible fic for that reason alone good for you naughty reader thanks to my beta half who keeps me on the straight and narrow but not too narrow road of fanfic romance loads of thanks to the great reviewers who make my day with every kind word to channel terry in tarzan mode no read more review now chapter 16 snow day luna hummed softly as she stirred the cauldron spewing thick black smoke catching the eye of the girl watching her she said you ve seen students do this before haventyou the pig tailed ghost named moaning myrtle said well i would never tell someone else secrets but i will say that it all due to me that a certain chamber was found and the entire wizarding world saved from dire peril i feel honoured to be in your presence murmured luna the dry tone was ignored i wish more students felt that way malfoy for example always ignores me whenever i take a peek if he didnthave the tightest ahem the apparition blushed faded back to grey and then went pink again as she said you know what i mean nervous nellie and i watched that water fight you had with those ravenclaw boys with an envious moan myrtle floated through a wall and vanished how sad to be a hormone driven teenager for eternity luna thought especially when all ghosts like myrtle and nellie could do was watch students enjoy theirs year after frustrating year luna did wish the tittering spirit hadntbrought up the water fight she felt vaguely adulterous for even noticing wesley ahem after all she wanted harry didntshe she nodded her head vigorously causing radish earrings to swing back and forth of course she did roberts just had an extremely appealing face with gorgeous blue eyes the most adorable dimples and a charming smile noticing meant nothing if blaise could be mates with draco she could be friends with wesley couldntshe of course she could one could never have too many friends or flobberworms happy her little mental world was now in proper order harry love of life wesley friend luna stirred the potion for the final time she extinguished the magical fire with a wave of her wand remembering a scene from macbeth amusing herself she hunched over the cauldron like a crone and began reciting in a witchy voice the weird sisters hand in hand posters of the sea and land thus do go about about thrice to thine and thrice to mine and thrice again to make up nine peace the charm wound up she cackled softly and then decided to count the number of cobwebs in the room to pass the time until her friends showed up is the potion almost ready ginny eager voice interrupted luna train of thought had she counted thirty three or thirty four cobwebs she tried not to let her annoyance show as she replied all it needs is to be put into a flagon with the special ingredient did you get it ginny handed over a fine blond hair watching luna fill a flagon add the hair and then another bit of something she asked what that you added charmed chameleon skin is what makes this potion polyjuice maximus the effect lasts four hours four hours exclaimed blaise striding into the lavatory i have to hang out with colin creevey for all that time what will we do luna remarked while taking the strand of hair blaise offered at least colin will look like draco when you re hanging out so no one will think you re dating him blaise said terry not threatened by creevey nudging luna ginny said colin told me he used to have a crush on you blaise now we re giving him a gorgeous body maybe terry should cancel the quidditch strategy session to protect your virtue all three girls laughed at the thought of colin making a move blaise pointed to the extra flagons being filled what are you going to do with those save them i inherited a stasis box from mum that will keep the potion viable indefinitely we started this thinking you and ginny would trade places so these extra potions are bound to come in handy sooner or later said luna two sets of brown eyes gazed at her admiringly luna placed the flagons into her mother box thinking how much nicer it was to be admired than pitied she smiled handing a wide mouthed container to each girl both flagons contained mud thick liquids that would transform the drinker appearance when should the boys drink this ginny was looking dubiously at the potion wrinkling her nose at the smell of over cooked cabbage luna checked her timepiece it was her favourite this week a tiny cuckoo bird sprang out on the hour and tweeted she thought it was darling but her roommates were always hiding it under pillows and blankets for some odd reason it is seven thirty now luna said so if the boys drink it at eight in the lavatory near the great hall draco and ginny will have from breakfast until lunch to be together she saw the look on blaise face and added the weather changed again last night it snowed more than half a metre there re all sorts of fun things you and colin can do outside in the snow make snow men snow angels said ginny blaise nodded with a smile that grew as she teased dontgo kissing colin whilst making snow angels red or you ll be the next most scandalous couple the school talks about ginny shot back unlike you and tarzan jane some people want to spend time getting to know their boyfriend and i dontmean physically dontact like you know nothing about animal attraction dragon lover confess draco looking like colin is the only thing that going to save him from a roll in the snow what do you mean save him ginny said placing a hand on her hip a couple of ghosts poked their heads through the wall nearby look nellie i told you my loo was where all the good stuff happened are you girls going to fight how exciting moaning myrtle and a regency era ghost with bobbed curls and a habit of biting her nails floated into the room and drifted up to the ceiling watching avidly the three girls below giggled ginny rolled her eyes and said no myrtle we were joking not fighting luna reminded her friends of the passing time she smiled amused when they hugged her but not each other before each rushed off to their own house in the ravenclaw common room she paused at the bottom of the girls staircase when wesley approached he smiled persuasively hello luna my best mate is crazy enough to stay inside this morning since i all on my lonesome i was wondering would you like to go tobogganing with me after breakfast luna began twisting a strand of hair around her finger he wasntasking her on a date wesley was at a loose end and only wanted to toboggan with her she smiled all right the indies hadntmade any firm plans so she was free to do anything she liked who knew maybe harry would see her with wesley and think he was more than a friend suddenly the cold saturday sunlight seemed warmer and brighter waggling her fingers in farewell luna drifted upstairs to change i still cantbelieve i going to voluntarily become colin bloody creevey draco muttered blaise had the nerve to laugh as she handed over a flagon full of some sour smelling gook and nodded toward the nearby boys lavatory four hours with ginny keep saying that to yourself whenever you feel like jinxing someone you know you ve been dying to spend more than an hour or two together so stop stalling and go get creevey fied draco couldnthelp smirking at his friend he only had to look like the little potter groupie she had to endure the runt tagging after her all morning he d feel bad for blaise if he didntfeel so good for himself a sudden thought made him grin remember he only borrowing my body so no matter how incredibly sexy he looks while he appears to be me he still creevey on the inside and the reason you re blathering is i remember how he stalked you third year could be he been waiting for his chance so keep your guard up mate blaise curled her lip ha ha very funny not why dontyou get in there and get geeky and if i see you outside well there going to be a snowball with your creevey looking name on it still laughing draco walked into the lavatory and came face to face with himself it was damned odd and he was even better looking than he d thought get out of my way before someone sees two of me creevey dontcall me that i you for the next four hours so dontslip and call me anything but malfoy creevey draco laughed shortly got a god complex along with the body eh well enjoy it while you can but keep your hands off blaise i ve seen you looking you little pervert his double sneered bloody hell it was creepy how much the blighter looked and sounded like him after creevey strolled out the door draco went into the third stall and found the polyjuice the concoction smelled so foul he had to hold his nose to drink it down draco groaned and clutched his stomach the gut wrenching skin melting feeling was one he never wanted to experience again dancing like a snake was one thing but having snakes writhe about in his innards was quite another instantly he felt himself become smaller his clothes bagging like a boy dressing up in his father things reaching for the bundle of clothes creevey had left on the floor the slytherin in gryffindor body grimaced at the sight of cold weather clothing that all but had an m for muggle made on them once he was dressed the new colin gaped at his reflection in the mirror he wasnta love god anymore he was a ruddy cupid how the mighty had fallen the look of disgust on his face made the girl waiting outside laugh now colin it not that bad that blue jumper matches your eyes really you look if you say cute i going to throw up she pressed her lips together before saying i wasntgoing to say that the reindeer on the front didntmake me think cute it made me think adorable sneering with creevey lips was hard to do but draco managed ginny was really having a laugh over this whole fiasco reluctantly seeing the humour he smiled and followed his girl into the great hall ginny halted his instinctive move toward the slytherin table by calling where are you going colin our table is this way damn he d been about to go sit with blaise wouldntthat have caused a riot with a sigh that caused his girlfriend to giggle again he stalked over to the gryffindor table and waited for lightning to strike when he remained breathing draco slid onto the bench by ginny and glanced around curiously the gryffindors were a chatty bunch potter looked his way and frowned are you all right colin you look like you re in a bad mood today double damn now he had to be polite to potty trying to make himself sound as nice and creevey as possible draco replied headache i ll be fine once i get outside i cantwait to play with ginny in the snow his girlfriend choked on a piece of melon pounding her on the back with one of his girly looking hands draco murmured i so looking forward to being with you mate she had a very pretty blush thinking naughty thoughts was she well he wasnt doing anything naughty until he had his body back the last thing draco wanted to do was give ginny ideas about creepy creevey that malfoy up to his old tricks with zabini again boot looks ready to jinx his arse weasley said in a gloating tone draco looked over at the slytherin table he saw blaise trying to scoot away from the boy whispering something in her ear crabbe girth kept her from moving too far malfoy ran a finger down blaise cheek as she gave him a glare the pretend slytherin smiled making draco wonder if he really looked that wicked he shot a glance at ginny her amused nod told him that he did he grinned no wonder she couldntresist him a loud exclamation drew attention in the hall ouch damn it who gave me a stinging hex malfoy demanded angrily laughter erupted increasing when boot stalked over with a menacing expression and pulled his woman away looking like the king of the jungle blaise smilingly went along with her grunting savage draco lips twisted tarzan dragging jane off into the bushes to prove she his woman i expect the gryffindors around him chuckled at creevey s snide remark ron weasley snickered good one colin now draco choked the grinning redhead pounded him on the back making his skin crawl the boy sister was giggling like crazy which was exactly what they both were certifiable for pulling this stunt hunching his temporarily skinny shoulders draco said thanks uh ron i okay really no problem dontknow what boot sees in zabini other than the obvious draco snapped what do you mean obvious the weasel forehead was creased in a frown he probably wasntused to colin sounding so dangerous but he d better get used to it for the next few hours creevey wasnttaking shite from anyone ron said defensively i know you used to have a thing for her but you have to admit the way zabini slithers around malfoy and boot and merlin knows who else she obviously no better than she should be gryffindors stared in shock as colin lunged to his feet and grabbed ron by his ratty maroon jumper draco demanded harshly take that back before i ram your teeth down your throat colin colin let him go ginny put her hand on draco arm calming him with her touch as she said ronald one of those repressed types who thinks a girl is either an untouchable angel or a whore ginny ron began she overrode him no better than she should be where did you get that phrase from brother dear mum how pathetic why dontyou get a life and stop judging people or do you want to be like percy ginny tugged on draco arm c mon colin let get out of here draco forced his slender creevey fingers to release their grip on the arsehole jumper he and ginny moved to leave ron followed ginny colin i sorry i shouldnthave said that i dontknow why i did the last thing i want to be is like percy draco inwardly scowled aw shite was he expected to shake weasel hand and say that okay mate roger that his gaze fell on ginny she was giving him the look that made him do things he didntwant to do closing his eyes draco took a deep breath and released it when he opened his eyes he made a heroic effort to be creevey and didntshow his inward grimace while he shook ron hand okay mate just donttalk about people when you dontknow them all right agreed ginny red gave her brother a punch in the arm the feisty wench i forgive you this time smiles were shared his was forced but the gryffindors were too simple to know the difference except granger who looked at him strangely and said you dontstill like zabini do you colin trust nosy granger to ask a question that got everyone attention even ginny was raising her brow in that slytherin way draco liked so well his creevey facade cracked none of your business granger if i were you i d be asking weasley why he so interested in girls he thinks are no better than they should be smiling in satisfaction draco slung an arm around ginny shoulders as they left behind them he could hear hermione ask well ronald outside draco told ginny i ve got three hours and 27 minutes to be with you i dontwant to waste a minute determined to make the best of being creevey he grabbed a toboggan from the many lined up by the front steps and pulled his girl by the hand to go play in the snow ginny was having a hard time keeping her hands off her friend only the knowledge that draco would be jealous if she kissed him while he looked like colin kept her from acting on her feelings she smiled to herself blaise had been spot on about that being the only thing keeping draco safe from a roll in the snow ready draco asked she nodded and sat behind the slender boy as they prepared to toboggan down the hill clasping her arms around his narrow chest ginny couldnthelp giving her boyfriend a quick hug how anyone could look at his face and not see draco spirit shining through colin baby blue eyes it was so obvious to her in the great hall when draco took up for his friend even though ron could mop the floor with him in his present condition she had sighed in admiration for her quixotic black knight sliding down the hill ginny wondered for a moment if ron really did have some strange good girl bad girl hang up was that what was keeping him from getting closer to hermione the sound of colin s laughter made ginny shake off thoughts about her brother love life or lack of one smiling to hear draco so carefree she hugged her partner tightly as the toboggan gained speed down the long hill after climbing to the top again she saw that gryffindor house seemed to have staked a claim on their hill harry neville ron and hermione were about to descend the slope when colin shouted ginny and i are king and queen of this mountain and we challenge you to a race to prove it faces alight with eagerness to compete the five gryffindors and one slytherin in gryffindor body mounted their toboggans marvelling how intense colin face looked when draco personality was the one inhabiting it ginny sighed and held on tight the three toboggans were neck and neck until halfway down the hill when draco and ginny began to pull ahead they were so attuned their bodies naturally leaned and moved together to get the maximum downhill glide at the bottom the couple did a victory dance that had the other gryffindors staring in amazement ron asked where did you learn to move like that colin ginny mouthed an answer to draco that made him laugh i muggle born mate i ve seen music telly vision colin threw himself into snow play with a boyish enthusiasm that tugged at ginny heartstrings even looking like a christmas angel his slytherin nature shone through the snow fort they constructed with the other four friends to defend against another bunch of gryffindors in an upcoming snow battle was the best constructed and most decorative she had ever seen did we really need to make it a castle asked harry the raised eyebrow should have clued harry in that colin wasntquite who he thought but it didn t people really did see what they expected to see ginny thought amused she listened to the boys plan battle strategy thomas is a good shot harry so stay away from their right side said ron yeah but finnegan isn t so hit him hard in the first few minutes and victory will soon be ours ginny and i will make a surprise attack from behind colin said ron and harry both looked astounded at this un gryffindor approach matching nods and smiles lit their faces that bloody brilliant creevey cried ron harry grinned if you were like this every snow day we d never lose colin s lips were twitching madly ginny dragged draco away before he laughed and ruined everything together they pulled a blanket loaded with snowballs through the trees toward the unguarded back of the opposing snow fort while they were waiting for the signal to attack ginny saw two figures snowshoeing through the woods when the pair came closer she saw it was blaise and colin the two were talking quietly and laughing at some joke draco crouched down low and made his way toward them with ginny following as they neared he demanded where are you two going grey and brown eyes widened in surprise before blaise smiled and gestured with the skates in her hand we re going to the small pond on the other side of that stand of trees the lake not quite frozen yet the tall boy with her narrowed his eyes who are you to question a slytherin you grotty little gryffindor go back to making snowballs and leave your betters alone ginny covered her mouth to stifle laughter colin had draco drawl down pat it was hilarious to everyone except the slytherin currently looking like a gryffindor fine after we win the battle we ll drop by i donttrust a snake like you malfoy ginny again stifled laughter it was so weird to watch colin as draco walking with blaise while draco as colin looked at her with an expression that was so slytherin it was unnerving he said blandly thought my impostor was funny did you the snow in his slender hands killed any urge to laugh no of course not erm what are you planning on doing with that what do you think i planning to do the november wind was cold but his silky tone made ginny cheeks feel hot make a snowball and use it to attack the fort she looked over his shoulder ron neville and harry are making their move hermione signalling us we ve got to go not before i do this cool lips kissed hers gently when draco tried to pull back ginny leaned into his body his kiss refusing to let him go she d been so good but he d started this and she wasntunlocking her lips before she had what she wanted murmuring draco she used her grip in his hair to keep his mouth fused to hers so his hair felt different and his lips felt different so what he was draco on the inside that what made her kiss him over and over long deep kisses that made her want more colin s smaller build made it easier for her to grab his arse and move aggressively against him he groaned and swirled his tongue against hers before stepping away from the embrace that was so hot she was surprised the snow around them hadntmelted she smirked briefly at the sight of baby blue eyes giving her a dragon fiery stare draco took the snow still in his hand and rubbed it against her lips canthave my girl going around with another boy kiss on her mouth even if the other boy is really me a wide smile stretched her cheeks as he tugged her hand they raced back to attack the enemy fort from behind and win the snow battle no one thought anything of them laughing when everyone did a victory dance together snow began falling while blaise and colin made their way to the small pond he d declared perfect for skating the girl smiled as she watched the flakes float down and glitter against the evergreens you really like snow dontyou blaise said how could you tell colin the way i demanded we make an entire snow family complete with dog the twenty trips down the toboggan hill we took or the fact that i now forcing you to snowshoe through the woods to take me skating all within two and a half hours seeing colin bashful smile on draco face was disorienting to say the least except for that short time at breakfast creevey had behaved himself in fact he was extremely funny and nice when he wasnttrying to put on a slytherin act it was strange to see and hear colin through the voice and expressions of draco though especially when he gave one of those looks every now and then the kind she d been warned about the look that told her colin thought she was funny and nice too and really sexy draco silvery eyes giving her the sort of look that got her into trouble at that blasted party was hard to ignore but she did it blaise refused to acknowledge any feeling other than friendship isntthis place beautiful said colin that heartfelt comment was one of the nicest things about creevey he expressed his feelings so readily gazing around the small clearing in the trees where snowflakes scattered in the slight wind blowing across the pond blaise smiled in agreement together they sat on a small bench and switched their snowshoes for skates at first the pair skated separately blaise did several spins and colin seemed to like skating for speed although he did a spin and a lunge also to show he could after watching her leg lift above her hip in an arabesque looking spiral colin asked have you skated with malfoy before i feel like i d know how to skate with you without having to think about it yes our families have holidayed together since first year she said why are you asking to skate with me a blush on draco s aristocratic cheekbones was an incredible sight a crumpled horned snorkack charging through the bushes would be less extraordinary he nodded shyly a boy who appeared to be an aristocratic malfoy shy adjusting her fuzzy red cap and pulling her cropped red jacket down for proper skin coverage blaise skated over to the youth who looked exactly like her best friend they started in a classic waltz position the snow the skating and the company combined to make the girl smile and sing winter wonderland colin sang with her by the end of the song they were skating together with blaise back against the taller boy chest spinning slowly around to face him she said warmly for a gryffindor you re a decent bloke colin friends yeah you ll say hi to me in the corridors yes and i wontpush you into any walls either she said with a smirk you never did that i know but i might start if you keep bugging me fifth year malfoy impostor looked down and dug into the ice with his toe pick what is it asked blaise colin looked up with a hesitant smile i hate to ask but will you help me with something i learned about a native american culture the inuits for extra credit in muggle studies i was wondering if i could practice one of their rituals with you what kind of ritual blaise asked warily draco double moved closer and looked down with an earnest open expression she d never seen on the real slytherin face the inuit friendship ritual he said i could show you suspicious she looked into innocent looking eyes and you promise it a friend thing you wonttry to kiss me colin shook his head earnestly the only thing that we ll touch will be noses trust me blaise reluctantly nodded it was hard to say no to a friend who wanted help she almost wished she had however when strong hands steadied by holding her shoulders and draco s face neared hers a breath apart colin kept his promise and only touched her nose with his her giggles filled the air as he rubbed the tip of their noses together blaise had always liked draco nose which was a perfect classic length the feel of it softly sliding against hers in so many gentle ways was different but nice she decided to participate actively so colin would have a well rounded experience of the ritual blaise pressed her nose against his in a firm gliding motion the boy hands tightened his grip taking the muffled noise he made as one of approval she did it again after time passed and silver eyes became dreamy though blaise began to have doubts about this native ritual it seemed a little more than friendly in fact her stomach was uncomfortably fluttery and her cheeks were beginning to heat she had just realized that part of that fluttery feeling came from long fingers having slipped under her jacket and top to caress her abdomen when she heard what the bloody hell are you two doing get my your hands and nose off her creevey what were you thinking zabini you idiot blaise looked uncertainly at the scowling boy he asked me to do an inuit friendship ritual because we re friends ginny started laughing hysterically colin grinned as he confessed well i sort of left out that inuits dontkiss with their lips also i kind of made up that friendship ritual name i didntthink you d do it if i told you what it really called draco was sneering at her gullibility what are you blaise a slytherin or a hufflepuff i cantbelieve you fell for that he demanded from colin what that nose rubbing thing called anyway the guilty look on colin face made blaise stomach clench ginny paused in her laughter long enough to cry eskimo kissing blaise punched colin in the stomach oh no oh hell no i did not just get played by a baby faced gryffindor she skated over to the bench and yanked off her skates muttering imprecations putting on her snowshoes she glared at the three who were having a laugh out of her being the biggest sucker in slytherin house blaise narrowed her eyes and gritted i never want to hear about that that eskimo again do you hear me to your graves people you will take this to your graves even draco snickered at her on the way back to the castle creevey who d been playing malfoy for so long he d started to pick up arrogant habits strutted like he d done a whole lot more than rub his nose against hers by the time they d reached the front steps blaise was reluctantly starting to get a sense of humour about the whole thing bye blaise sorry i made you mad but i want you to know you have a really great nose and your abs are awesome she snorted yeah right whatever creevey i on to you you perv bye colin headed into the boys bathroom while ginny told draco to meet her in the library after lunch and went into the great hall once they were alone draco grinned smarmily at blaise and pointed upwards look someone hung mistletoe early c mon blaise you know you ve always dreamt about kissing a girly boy like me colin creevey the exaggerated boyish voice and earnest facial expression made blaise laugh before she could do more than say eeuwww get away you grotty little gryffindor draco yelled ow damn it boot i was just joking stop hexing me ape man blaise gasped when terry slung her over his shoulder and carried her off you re a sick sick woman to get a thrill out of being manhandled draco called after them opening the door to the first empty classroom terry carried blaise in and set her down immediately she threw herself into his embrace his kiss was all she needed to make the day sane again running her fingers through her boyfriend long hair she smiled when he pulled back for a moment to ask are you a sick woman blaise because my manhandling gives you a thrill staring into warm blue eyes she nodded i ve got a bad case of loving you it incurable he kissed her forehead and the tip of her nose before softly kissing her lips good because dr terry recommends lots of tender loving care to treat your condition what do you think about that blaise wrapped her arms around terry neck i think i need mouth to mouth a n yay snow days arentthey the best love sledding and everything else you can do instead of something responsible no idea who wrote winter wonderland but i really like the way either amy grant or vince gill sings it and they re married to each other how hinky is that whether readers have snow or not i hope you enjoy life and remember to review disclaimer no rights to harry potter other than the right to remain an avid reader of the series chapter 17 quidditch and love lessons ginny shoved her gear into a bag slung the strap over her shoulder and left the changing room quidditch practise had been brutal sometimes harry gave oliver wood a run for his money as the toughest captain in gryffindor history their team played slytherin in two days and captain bligh a k a potter was running his team ragged making sure they were in top condition for the match even ron had half jokingly asked harry if he was trying to kill them the good captain had not been amused face set in grim intensity he d yelled i dontcare if it kills me i dontcare if it kills you we re going to practise until i know we re going to beat malfoy leaning into the wind ginny trudged toward the school thinking harry last word said it all the boy who lived was obsessed with beating his archenemy she was rather obsessed with draco herself but in a way that gave lovely butterfly feelings in her stomach not ulcers ginny wait up speak of the captain what he want to keelhaul me for yawning during his motivational speech at the end sorry cap n sir we scurvy bilge rats tend to get bored after a half hour rant maybe if you gave the crew some rum the wind blew strands of hair across her face as she glanced at the boy now walking beside her he looked confused sometimes harry forgot she d gotten over her crush a long time ago she only got breathless around another boy these days but ginny wasntabout to share the information with a slytherin hater uh well you didntseem yourself during practise is anything wrong maybe i was tired of scrubbing the deck for the umpteenth time captain harry what that what she wanted to know what good was being raised by muggles if you never read any decent books she smiled to herself wouldntharry go spare if she staged a mutiny on the quidditch team he was frowning again she tried to explain patiently i tired we practised so hard i dontknow if i have enough energy to eat dinner the team is ready for the match end of discussion quickening her pace ginny sighed in relief as they drew near the side entrance harry wasntfinished it not just practise you never hang out with us anymore every time we ask you to play a game you say you re going to the library do you really need to study there five days a week she d be in the library seven days a week if it wouldntbe too obvious that she was meeting someone apparently some reassurance was in order c mon harry didnti beat you in wizard chess just two nights ago sure i go to the library a lot but you know colin comes with me sometimes it just that i have new friends and i cantbring blaise and luna back to our common room can i the boy ran a hand through his black hair making it stick up worse than ever he needed a styling charm draco hair always looked perfect on the school steps a trio of girls were singing something catchy and dancing in a way that made harry scowl how can you be friends with zabini she a slytherin for merlin sake what can you possibly have in common in response to the loud query blaise called out look girls a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more it is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing what are you trying to say zabini blaise sauntered over smiling in a way that made harry face tighten she drawled i was quoting macbeth if you thought i was talking about you well if the shoe fits you think you re so funny you wontbe laughing saturday when i beat malfoy to the snitch sure i will i going to laugh at a little boy who thinks catching a flying ball makes him a big man i ll be laughing at you potty harry looked seconds away from jinxing the taunting girl ginny stepped between them hey cut it out both of you harry i going to talk to blaise i ll see you at dinner fine i dontwant to stick around anyway i rapidly losing my appetite ginny gave blaise a belt it look which she reluctantly heeded the insolent girl did send the boy a hand gesture when he looked back though he glared and defiantly returned it before slamming the door shut the slytherins broke into giggles flint and macduff waved and rushed inside no doubt to inform everyone in their house all about perfect potter s little temper tantrum did you have to do that ginny asked i did shaking her head ginny smiled at seeing the note waved by a slender hand is that for me no it for that other redheaded gryffindor chaser who going with a slytherin seeker snatching the note ginny eagerly read the message saturday night room of requirement 8pm wear the black velvet dress and dancing shoes the butterflies in her stomach were doing loop de loops ginny folded the note into a tiny square and opened her robes to tuck it into her bra so that your secret how many notes are stuffed in there anyway ginny informed with a smirk no padding necessary why thinking about padding yours it was strangely nice how slytherins enjoyed her quips hermione would ve been indignant but blaise just laughed hey i may not be able to match size but quality well nobody perkier than me oh really says who says terry this was such a bizarre conversation ginny threw up her hands he d know i sure please dontflash me i ll take your word for it blaise chuckled and waved farewell back at gryffindor ginny met the gazes of harry ron and hermione and knew harry had just finished telling them his side of the story they all looked at her accusingly ron demanded to know how come you re friends with someone who makes rude gestures harry made one back ron and hermione both stared at harry he shrugged defensively i was provoked you know how she is ron she gets under your skin too hermione eyes started to spark how exactly does that slytherin girl get under your skin ronald now hermione it not like that c mon this routine the two fell into was really starting to annoy ginny it was as if they were stuck in a rut and never moved out of it instead they just dug it deeper and deeper right now she didntwant to hear bickering she wanted to go to her room look at her dress and dream about saturday so she did the three she left behind didnteven notice where ginny luna had been spending her friday evening finishing next week arithmancy homework she looked up and smiled hello harry the boy who didn t look as cute when grumpy waited for her answer she didntlike his tone so she waited for him to ask again she d mentally counted to ten when he blurted ginny said she was studying with you in the library so where is she blinking in curiosity luna asked mildly did you take polyjuice potion he shook his head as if thrown by the odd question no why because you re acting like her brother the frown was back again luna liked harry expression about as much as she liked the thought that he was a little too concerned about his friend s whereabouts was he suspicious because he was jealous it felt like something was twisting inside she had to fight to not let it show he gave a wry smile sorry it just that ginny been acting different lately not wanting to be with our group like before i only wanted to make sure my friend okay friend so many different meanings were stuffed into that word luna wished she didntdoubt harry explanation making a quick decision she curved her lips into something like a smile and said i think i know where she is follow me i ll show you harry walked beside her as she drifted across the main floor to the stairway he remained silent lost in his own thoughts luna knew ginny was helping draco shelve a book on the third floor and did not intend to take harry there instead she led him to the muggle literature stacks on the second floor the gut wrenching sensation hit her again as the teen eagerly moved toward the shakespeare section his face was perplexed when he emerged from between the bookshelves she not there oh my i wonder if she got permission to borrow that book she wanted from the restricted section let check there all right but i wish you had thought of that when we were downstairs following the boy descending the stairs two at a time luna eyes felt misty normally it was due to the dream about that magical day when he d notice her and wonder why he hadntbefore at the end of last year when harry offered to help her find the things people had hidden she d seen a softness in his beautiful green eyes that she d spun dreams around ever since now she wondered if it had only been her imagination it was a lowering thought watching him pace impatiently before the roped off section she tried to make conversation are you looking forward to the match tomorrow quidditch was the magic word harry looked over and smiled briefly yeah we re going to win and we re going to win big how do you know luna didntcare about the answer she just wanted to see the intense look on his face and watch his eyes light up harry loved the game the way she loved no she wasntgoing to think about that she was going to enjoy his attention even if she had to pretend to be riveted by strategy and strange things like porskoff ploys sloth grip rolls and bludger backbeating he assured her ron been practicing the double eight loop i impressed i ll be cheering for you the wide smile she received made everything worthwhile they talked about school for awhile least and best liked classes and such harry started to get restless again drumming his fingers while he stared at the restricted section hello luna perching on the edge of her table with his back to harry wesley roberts grinned the corners of luna mouth turned up hello wesley now harry was scowling had she really used the same breathy tone reserved for the boy who starred in her dreams the golden haired charmer winked at her oh dear she had it was completely accidental a little voice said yes a freudian slip ignoring inner voices that knew nothing the girl realised she d missed what roberts had just said he smiled nicely and repeated i asked what brings you lurking round the restricted section we re looking for ginny weasley without turning to gaze at the boy who had answered for her wesley said drolly i didntrealize you d changed your name to luna potter very modern and free thinking of you must be very sure of your masculinity i salute you funny roberts thank you potter i ve worked hard to become so luna had to press her lips together not to laugh her eyes must have given her away because wesley eyes sparkled brighter than ever dimples appeared in his cheeks i think i saw the weasley girl sitting at your table she looked like she was gathering her things to leave turning his head to regard the other boy he said dryly if you hurry i sure you can catch her potter dontworry about luna i more than happy to take her off your hands her heart skipped a beat wesley was jesting he didntreally mean it he liked fiona flint didnthe no thanks roberts i more than happy to walk luna to ravenclaw before i head back you can go do whatever it was you were doing before waggling his eyebrows at her wesley said in a laughing voice what was i doing before oh yes i was dreaming of snogging a beautiful girl after i got her alone in a corridor i guess i ll just have to make do with my fantasies hmmm harry rose and moved around to take luna arm keep your fantasies to yourself roberts not knowing whether her heart was racing because of harry or wesley or some combination of the two luna meekly said goodbye and went along with harry wesley called after them lovegood doesntmind me sharing my fantasies do you bella luna she paused at the compliment but refused to look back deeply disturbed to find that she didn t eye of newt and toe of frog wool of bat and tongue of dog adder fork and blind worm sting lizard leg and howlet wing for a charm of powerful trouble like a hell broth boil and bubble merlin save me from cruel witches who never sleep in on saturday mornings what are you two up to blaise yanked opened her bed curtains to see her two friends stirring a cauldron over a portable fire they looked up morrigan grinned we just like the way that sounds shakespeare words are so much better than what we came up with pausing she recited dramatically softer than saggy skin of irma pince will be your hair after using this rinse eeuwww you re right that a horrible mental image how someone can resemble a vulture and have those awful droopy neck rolls blaise shook off the willies produced by thoughts of the librarian i could use some hair rinse though is it done she grabbed her wand off the side table waved it to make her bed and walked over to watch fiona ladle some into a flagon for her thanks vanity thy name is woman the three girls turned to stare at the face looking out of the black curtains shrouding the fourth bed in the room cassandra priam was a strange girl she dyed her hair black and wore nothing but black clothes eyeliner lipstick and fingernail polishes a few slytherins who were into the muggle music called alternative were the odd girl friends blaise always tried to be polite who knew what cassandra would do if she didntlike you in addition she could scry all sorts of useful things in a bowl of water that skill by itself was worth the effort of civility blaise smiled that from hamlet frailty right you probably heard the girls quoting macbeth hard not to priam had a gift for killing conversation the bizarre girl dark brown eyes looked inward for a moment and then her mouth curved slightly you re going to an island today zabini slanting a disbelieving glance toward her friends who were trying unsuccessfully not to snicker blaise looked toward the window where the sky was dark grey and threatening to pour buckets any minute trying to be diplomatic she said well if i do go to an island i ll bring you back a shell okay i appreciate you humouring me it is more than others do no one believes my prophecies i cursed by the gods the pyjama clad girl climbed out of bed to grab some black clothes fiona and morrigan howled with laughter the moment she walked into the lavatory merlin she so creepy why would anybody believe anythingshe says priam is crazy blaise wondered about that cassandra had told her she would be getting new clothes before the wardrobe arrived from her mother she d also predicted the slytherin party would end in disaster back in first year hadntthe weird girl been right about what draco would see after their birthday party maybe there was something to priam claim blaise headed for the shower teasing her friends on the way hey cassandra predicted my hair would be softer after this rinse do you think it will come true in the common room a short time later blaise said to the boy radiating barely suppressed excitement big day for you dracowith quidditch and other things what bigger than quidditch crabbe was doing an excellent job of talking whilst chewing the hulking youth had honed the ability over the years to a fine art his words sounded a bit muffled but blaise would take that over see food any day nothing bigger than quidditch stupid right zabini not wanting goyle to hit crabbe again she agreed right gregory quidditch makes the world go round if you stopped playing it would lead to planetary disaster i sure the large boys nodded earnestly agreeing with her logic they were so funny fiona and morrigan snorted they thought so too draco leaned close to whisper this is my day i can feel it first i going to take the snitch from potter and then i going to spend the evening with my girl today is going to be perfect blaise smiled like you white teeth flashed as draco bit into a strawberry damn right blaise was still grinning over her friend mock conceit as she made her way to the seventh floor just because girls called draco a love god and boys thought he was an elitist snob that didntmean he was either of those things draco malfoy was smart he used people perceptions of him to further his goals and ambitions she hoped today all his goals were realised and the gryffindor seeker went home sobbing like a little girl after his opponent stole the snitch away perhaps that wasntvery nice but regardless of how na ve she could be at times blaise was no hufflepuff outside the room of requirement she walked back and forth three times concentrating on willing the room to become the perfect place for her and terry to spend a few hours together when the door manifested itself blaise walked in and stared it an island the island from my dream there the hammock merlin the water is so blue the flowers smell incredibly sweet and the sand is soft and white someone told me i would go to an island today i cantremember but it doesntmatter the only thing that matters is strong arms slid around her waist looking down blaise saw that instead of her clothes she was wearing a black bikini terry was wearing blue swim trunks her smile spread he was no speedo wearing if you ve got it flaunt it type like someone else she could name she was glad her boyfriend looked fine is this what i think it is blaise nodded laughingly pulling terry across the beach and into the water they swam floated and finally made their way back to the hammock the feel of his body against hers was bliss looking into his deep blue eyes while they gently swung back and forth she asked softly what your family like she combed her fingers through terry long hair as he answered normal i guess mother father three sons i the youngest one my eldest brother david works for my dad our family owns a winery we make old fashioned ciders with apples grown locally and country wines we ve won a few awards and a lot of restaurants order from us wizard bay i ve heard that name eddy loves your elderflower wine from what you ve said she likes all wines dontpoke i joking terry smiled anyway my other brother barry a pro quidditch player he just signed to be a beater with the chudley cannons mum happy he ll be close to home now we live in devon near ottery st catchpole sounds nice do you spend all the holidays together are you close yes what about your family blaise smiled wryly and admitted abnormal mother s mother and father spends as much time away from home as possible they love each other madly in their unique way they just cantlive together he promised to be home for christmas though there no extended family well none they keep in contact with we ve sort of adopted the malfoys lucius was always gone on business too narcissa and eddy became inseparable right before first year and we ve spent holidays together ever since terry lips tilted up as he said with quiet sincerity i wish i could take you home with me he kissed her tenderly my poor little rich girl i a rich little rich girl i ve got you his mouth was firm and soft gentle and demanding all at the same time blaise caressed his firmer paler flesh and forgot about the world outside their enchanted isle as she and terry made her dream a reality draco smirked observing his teammates running across the lawns in the downpour they splashed recklessly through the puddles heedless of the rain soaking them the slytherin captain strolled behind staying dry under his charmed umbrella and taking care to avoid puddles although the day was so overcast it resembled night with poor visibility due to the rain nothing kept students from turning out en masse quidditch was that popular while looking toward the field he could barely see through the sheets of rainwater he heard a voice close behind him yell give em hell draco blaise was huddling with boot under a large black umbrella the scowling boy rolled his eyes as his girlfriend grinned and waved a shaker thing vigorously unable to resist draco boasted always he promised i ll snatch the snitch just for you terry boy sneered not if potter catches it first malfoy ignored the ape man who had less couth than that chimp friend of his what was that name oh yes cheetah that was roberts to a tee a cheeky monkey smiling at his friend just to see wild man boot bare his teeth in anger possessive bastards were so easy to provoke draco waved before heading toward the changing rooms inside he caught a glimpse of red further down the corridor ginny paused before entering the girls area and looked back to see him and smile that smile lifted his spirits and put a swagger in his step his team looked eager to brave the elements for a chance to beat gryffindor he gave them a short pep talk after changing into his quidditch robes grabbed his broom and led his men onto the pitch mid field draco met potter and suffered touching the boy limp fingers for the traditional handshake rejoining his teammates he barely heard hooch whistle over the gusting wind brooms rose into the air the game was on draco gritted his teeth in determination as he bent low keeping a firm grip on the broomstick brutal wind seemed to be trying to wrench it from his grasp shaking wet hair out of his eyes the slytherin seeker crisscrossed the field in pursuit of his target the crowd was a distant din of rain obscured faces as he relentlessly tracked the snitch back and forth across the pitch malfoy didntgive a toss he never paid attention to the spectators anyway he allowed nothing to take his focus off his goal his eyes narrowed in ire as he swerved to avoid another player that was twice he d avoided a collision the heavy rain made it almost impossible to see another flyer until they were practically upon each other why hooch didntcall the game he didntknow or care he stood firm in his resolve not to let anything come between him and the snitch glimpsing the winged ball in flight ahead he leaned into a turn to intercept it reaching out he could almost grasp it until he was sideswiped draco muscles flexed as he struggled to remain seated a flash of lightning illuminated the other player red hair as she reeled from the impact lost her grip and fell the snitch hovered nearby but he never hesitated leaning flat against the broomstick he dove for the girl streaking downward draco grabbed ginny he yelled hold on arms straining he pulled up to make a tough but safe landing shivering with ginny the roar of the crowd finally registered harry potter had caught the snitch and gryffindor had won the match what were you thinking malfoy you were so close to the snitch why didntyou let a gryffindor save their chaser montague might have been memory charmed into a barely tolerable human being but he was still a bastard draco gazed into ginny eyes while saying fiercely to hell with the snitch and to hell with you too if you think a bloody game more important than her life on the way back to the changing room the icy rainfall seemed warm to the boy who was still glowing from the look on ginny face her expression said that while draco had lost the snitch he won something far more precious later he sat elegantly attired at a table negligently watching the lights twinkle beyond the restaurant balcony in the room of requirement the view was amazingly realistic if he d been a weasley he might have spit over the railing to see if it would hit someone passing beneath he wasn t so draco had to make do with smirking over the idea it beautiful is that the eiffel tower it is and it not half as beautiful as you are tonight red hair in a simple upsweep made draco long to sink his fingers into its softness but he could wait he kissed ginny hand and seated her letting his fingertips trail over the nape of her neck after pushing in her chair brown eyes shining with delight over the food and the atmosphere and him of course made the time fly swaying with ginny out on the balcony after dinner springtime in paris had never seemed so magical the enchantment had nothing to do with the surroundings and everything to do with the girl smiling up at him he d been forced to rough up two of his teammates after the game good thing he d learned to fight muggle style shouting down the team using vocabulary that would ve made his father proud he d got them to fall in line and look on the bright side gryffindor house would never live down a slytherin saving one of their own to him it was a win win situation draco bent to whisper in ginny ear what token does a black knight receive for saving a fair maiden soft lips traced a path from his cheek to his mouth long sweet kisses followed finally allowing his fingers pull out the pins keeping up silky hair the black knight realized that holding his fair maiden in his arms was more than he deserved but all the reward he needed a n so glad everyone seems to love shakespeare as much as me couldntjust stick to much ado although i love it too much good bard to borrow lol yes i took the mythological cassandra daughter of king priam of troy the chick who was cursed by apollo to prophesy what would not be believed because she wouldntsleep with him and used her for blaise lydia like roommate remember the lydia character in beetlejuice i liked her style in the movie and the cartoon lol getting to put character types i like in stories is one of my favourite author perks if you liked her or anything else too review disclaimer not rowling but i am thankful she was inspired to write her magical series a world without draco inconceivable lol chapter 18 what a girl wants miss zabini luna turned to look at blaise the girl was staring off with a smile on her face uh oh she was thinking about terry again blaise realised the teacher was calling her name and said yes sir professor hands smiled excellent thank you for volunteering come to the front you too mr creevey the girl gave luna a what did i say yes to look before slowly rising from her seat and making her way to the head of the classroom luna noticed ginny holding her hand over her mouth and gulping in large breaths through her nose was she stifling laughter colin sat on a stool holding a guitar blaise looked uneasy standing beside him professor hands explained to the class mr creevey has kindly agreed to perform a muggle holiday song for our edification he informed me that miss zabini is a fine singer and knowledgeable of many muggle tunes please give them a round of applause to show your appreciation of their willingness to share a song today ginny shoulders were shaking now and blaise was giving colin a look that should have scared him colin smiled angelically and widened baby blues before saying you know the song right are you ready a curt nod was all the answer he received the boy started to play and together they sang it the most wonderful time of the year luna mouth started to twitch colin high sweet voice combined with blaise lower smoother one sounded nice but the combination was so unusual it was funny glancing around the room she saw that her classmates were staring in amused fascination at the odd couple snickers abounded when colin gazed soulfully into blaise narrowed eyes and sang about mistletoe and hearts aglow blaise sneered while her classmates and teacher applauded at the end of the song after class while the students filed out of the room the sullen girl said lovegood weasley hold on a minute luna smiled your song was nice nice yeah right like creevey is nice blaise said with a sneer dontlet him fool you lovegood he may look like a sweet little puppy dog but that puppy only waiting for his chance to sniff your crotch and hump your leg colin had walked into earshot he said merlin that so crude i love it thanks for everything blaise luna hid a smile at the cheeky grin colin gave before he left the classroom ginny shook her head you really shouldntencourage him encourage him a distraction was in order luna said firmly enough of that you wanted to tell us something blaise i did but i dontknow if you two deserve to hear my plan for spending time with the ones you want most ginny brought her wand out and waved it threateningly luna said you know you ll tell us anyway slytherins live to hear praise for their cunning plans after nodding in rueful acknowledgement blaise dug a flagon out of her schoolbag and handed it to ginny in a quick motion she plucked a long strand of red hair and gave it to luna ignoring ginny angry protest she said that hair in one of those polyjuice maximus potions will make you red for four hours luna you ll hang with the dream team in hogsmeade tomorrow what about me what this potion said ginny it called lanqanein or unmemorable potion a hufflepuff seventh year smuggled it out of class when snape was brooding i heard through the grapevine that he had it and handed over the galleons to get it drinking it will make people forget you the minute they see you which is exactly what you want when you re swanning around the village with your brother worst enemy blaise grinned i got my mother to send a memory enhancer for draco to take so he wontforget you too laughing over the amazed expressions on her friends faces blaise raised her hands and motioned to herself c mon i want to hear you say it you re bloody brilliant ginny said closing her eyes and hugging her potion to her chest luna felt the same way although she refrained from dancing around the classroom like her fiery friend it is a brilliant idea are you sure you werentsupposed to be a ravenclaw maybe having a ravenclaw boyfriend rubbed off on me ginny smirked all that rubbing against terry paid off in more ways than one is that it shut up gryffindor girl who smirking like a slytherin from kissing draco so often what time should we take the potion luna quiet question stopped the happy bickering she suggested why dontwe meet behind honeydukes at eleven tomorrow and take them together the girls agreed and went their separate ways behind honeydukes twirling a long strand of blonde hair around her finger as she waited for her friends to arrive luna wondered if she was making a mistake she wanted to spend time with harry but she wanted to be herself when she did it a girl amused voice ordered stop that your finger turning purple you loony blaise and draco were standing a few feet away they looked like models out of teen witch magazine in their stylish clothes and leather jackets perhaps she should get blaise to take her shopping the slytherins nodded approvingly when they noted that the rear of honeydukes sweet shop was deserted and best of all there were no windows releasing her hair luna reluctantly confessed i having second thoughts no you re not lovegood malfoy cool drawl insinuated she d be sorry if she tried to back out now looking up into the clear cold sky luna consoled herself with the thought that at least the weather was nice she nodded and asked where terry he grabbing a table and a couple of butterbeers at the broomsticks blaise lips trembled we re trying to spend as much time together as we can before holiday draco said dontstart mate remember what i told you find a way or make one i counting on you blaise wiped a tear and laughingly replied it all about you right damn straight this was an interesting conversation luna thought if impossible to follow apparently her friend wasntlooking forward to the upcoming holiday if she were as close to harry as blaise was to her boyfriend luna wouldntbe feeling holly jolly either ginny arrival lightened the mood holding up her flagon she said everybody got their potions except for blaise the voyeur okay one two three drink luna body shuddered as a gut twisting skin crawling sensation overwhelmed her the other three no two looked at her with interest the newly transformed redhead looked down she was glad she d worn the clothes ginny had given her in the library last night how strange to be wearing someone else body as well as their clothing draco was eyeing her appreciatively she could practically feel her freckles stand out as she blushed blaise elbowed him and ordered let go love god ginny will be waiting somewhere and she wontlike you eyeing luna up even if it because she looks like her bye bye ginevra have fun the ravenclaw in gryffindor body walked around to the entrance of the shop her body strolled instead of glided now her red hair bounced around her shoulders all the time it was very distracting inside she walked over to the section of the shop where ron hermione and harry were trying to decide which sweets to choose what looks good to you ginny said harry his eyes looked emerald against a dark green jumper she smiled i d rather have a butterbeer actually the three looked at her as though she had gone round the twist belatedly she remembered that a love of sweets was something ginny and draco had in common drat trying to sound as ginny as possible luna said dramatically i ate so much last time that i ve gone off them for the moment i saving myself for the holidays dontwant to miss out on all the treats father christmas will bring she was glad they laughed and accepted her lame explanation harry said he would walk over to the pub with her and the other two could follow after they made their purchases it was hard to appear unaffected as he opened the door for her and bought her a butterbeer luna felt like she was dreaming she sighed if only she didnthave to be ginny to get this kind of attention chatting with harry she noticed blaise sitting on terry lap in a dark corner harry frowned at the couple unashamed public display of affection you never told me what you and zabini had in common since she didntknow what he was talking about luna answered his statement with a question what do you think we have in common uh oh had she sounded too much like her real self harry looked at her oddly and then shrugged i dontknow a stubborn donttell me what to do attitude luna smiled he was right that rebellious trait and draco malfoy was indeed what the two girls had in common unable to explain the latter she agreed with the former yes we re rebels so what she smirked it was so much fun to be abrupt and say whatever she felt like without worrying how it would sound to someone else being empathetic she always considered the other person feelings putting herself first for once was very liberating hi ginny have you seen luna around wesley roberts stood by their table looking down at her with that appealing smile which flashed white teeth and dimples reflexively she said hello wesley before realizing that once again she d sounded a little too luna while he gave her a perplexed look she quickly remembered his question and replied no i think she was doing a few errands today she probably wandering around somewhere probably out searching for the crumple horned snorkack what do you want roberts to help her look harry comment was so sarcastic luna stared in shock wesley said grimly i d be honoured to thanks ginny see you luna watched wesley leave and then turned to harry why were you so nasty the question just slipped out it must be her newly bold gryffindor tongue harry shook his head dontknow just dontlike the guy i guess sorry she made an effort to return his smile this was a good thing wasntit hermione and ron entered the pub and the group settled in to have a nice chat over warm mugs of butterbeer ginny didntknow which was more bizarre watching another girl turn into her or watching people forget her the moment they saw her luna and blaise had done it behind honeydukes and the patrons of the three broomsticks were forgetting her right now being unmemorable was worth the strangeness because she was able to walk into the pub with draco and spend time with him they were sitting at a small table in the opposite corner from blaise and terry she tried not to look over at the other couple the sight of snogging made her long to follow their example the charcoal jumper and black denims her boyfriend wore with a long leather jacket made his skin and hair look even more pale and gorgeous impulsively ginny leaned forward and started tracing draco features with her fingertips what are you doing i trying to keep from throwing you down on the table and having my way with you draco lips curved well that would be interesting wouldntit those eyebrows she adored so much were arching just the way she liked her fingertips traced them before brushing softly across his thick white blond eyelashes and moving down his nose to his chiselled perfect talented mouth his grey eyes glinted as he licked the finger following the contours of his lips before she could do more than draw a ragged breath his fingers encircled her wrist to hold her hand in place while he sucked her fingertip the feeling of his thumb stroking the underside of her wrist as his mouth proceeded to liquefy her insides was so erotic ginny was glad no one could see her expression someone saw draco face however and complained why are you looking so wicked draco are you thinking about me pansy parkinson crabbe and goyle were approaching the table ginny jumped up and sat on draco lap before the pug faced girl could sit on her draco fingers stroked her knee unmemorable to everyone but her boyfriend ginny found herself ironically grateful to the slytherin cow for making her fantasy of sitting in draco lap come true biting her lip to keep from making a sound she marvelled at how cool and composed he seemed no i never think about you parkinson crabbe goyle what have you been doing today tuning out the trolls account of their time in hogsmeade ginny slid her hands across draco chest and through the silky strands at the base of his neck she tugged on his earlobe with her teeth and whispered if you dontwant people gaping at the sight of you making out with an invisible girlfriend you d better move that hand off my thigh the huge louts gulping butterbeer took his shout of laughter as a compliment parkinson beady black eyes squinted in suspicion what got into you today draco nothing yet ginny smile stretched her cheeks when he arrogantly left the table without another word pulling her across the pub inside the men room he swiftly dragged her into a stall and pushed her back against the side wall her amusement over snogging in such a place soon changed into a whole hearted appreciation of the lips and body urgently pressed against hers meeting his mouth and tongue with her own she unthinkingly backed draco into the opposite wall in her eagerness to do some pressing of her own the sound of something hitting the stall startled the boy who had just entered the lavatory uh are you all right in there they looked at each other with an identical mixture of alarm and mirth ronald was asking if they were all right she cleverly muffled draco voice by rubbing her mouth against his as he replied erm yeah well if you re having that much trouble mate you might want to try again later after her brother left draco grinned smartest thing weasley ever said i definitely want to try again later ginny laughed which scared the next boy who entered into screeching the lavatory was haunted and running out again draco knew the sight of him sauntering down the streets of hogsmeade alone and smiling was seriously making people nervous but he didntgive a rat arse ginny was walking beside him and that was all that mattered he couldntprevent a bark of laughter from escaping when he remembered weasel advice back in the men room when they returned to their table only crabbe and goyle remained thankfully a young warlock with a drinking problem had mistaken parkinson for an attractive bird on the pull that would be an easy conquest and taken her off for a grope by the fireplace well the slytherin hoped the poor bloke would think two out of three not bad when he sobered up or that the day would forever be a blur either way pansy was out of his hair and the boys were easy to order off to oversee their house party preparations ginny had refused to sit in his lap again but he d driven her wild with his eyes just as easily as he had with his fingers he d given her his patented steamy stare through his lashes while looking her over from head to toe red hair freckles and a bright blush really brought new meaning to the term on fire blaise had floated over to say hello and goodbye before joining tarzan over by the entrance draco had smirked what he didntwant to chat with your best mate i devastated my feelings may never recover the dreamy chit had just laughed and bent to kiss his cheek before advising stop sitting here all alone looking gorgeously broody go find ginny and have some fun tell her i said there no snow to roll in but there a blanket under a willow to roll on what are you talking about ask miss freckles after all you re not safe anymore waggling slender fingers the daft girl headed for the jungle man glaring across the room tarzan grunted something before planting a possessive kiss on jane draco mockingly saluted the he man with his mug blaise was truly sick to enjoy those primitive demonstrations i dontthink she sick i think she romantic chagrined at speaking his thought aloud draco said you wouldntwant me acting like that would you no i dontthink my heart could stand the thrill the slight disappointment he d felt at the first word turned into something quite different by the end of ginny little confession allowing his features to harden into resolve he lowered his voice to order with silky menace we re leaving get up we re going to that willow now if you hesitate i going to pick you up and carry you there got it big brown eyes grew bigger her face turned pink at the end of his command ginny nodded oh yes jumping up she clutched his hand and pulled him to the door impatiently brushing past other patrons in her haste to get outside the memory made him smile as they left hogsmeade behind and drew ever closer to their willow underneath a blanket had been left spread upon the ground hoping not to discover one of boot long strands upon it there was a limit to how much he could stomach draco let himself be pushed down he couldnthelp laughing when red threw herself on him and began kissing him passionately think its funny do you ginny eyes sparked as she raised her mouth from his bright strands slid across his face as she bent to look him in the eye fiercely she ordered stop laughing you re going to give me the best snog anybody ever had on a blanket and you re going to do it now got it merlin she was sexy all fired up malfoy could feel his body flush he sinuously rolled until her body was under his lowering his lips to hers he promised oh yes after snogging ginny until she vowed his kiss was the best ever draco lay on his back a forearm covering his eyes to block the sight of her while he calculated arithmancy equations in his mind heart beat slowing he breathed a sigh of relief when his body relaxed i sorry i didntmean to let things get so mmmm so is right i not complaining ginny it just takes a while to cool off after kissing like that is all she laughed a little oh that uh commanding tone of yours is really something yours too silence stretched between them feeling almost normal again draco rolled onto his side to face the girl who was already facing him they smiled at each other ginny joked so that why blaise is always walking around in a daze do you think they ve er you know he admitted i dontknow we re friends but we dontshare the details of our love lives not that she had one until boot it not something either of us wants to know you re saying blaise never knew when you were going with someone c mon she sure knows about me oh she knew she just ignored or made sarcastic remarks to or about and even hexed a few of the girls i er dated you are the first girlfriend she ever approved of donttell her i told you though blaise likes to pretend to be a tough girl he could tell ginny was pleased to be the only girl his best mate ever approved of her smirk was too cute he d kiss it but his pulse was starting to race again ginny snickered tough girl my arse did she tell you what she let herself get roped into yesterday blaise sang a holiday song with colin in muggle studies that was hilarious his chuckles joined her giggles i warned her colin was a puppy looking for his chance to hump her leg she laughed full out i wondered where that description came from she told that to luna and colin overheard good maybe he ll keep his pervy nose to himself fiery hair flew as ginny shook her head he loved it i think he got a new fantasy now draco closed his eyes and groaned well that mental image has ruined whatever romantic urge i might ve had for the rest of my life soft lips caressed his we canthave that i depend on those urges you know i have to ensure they ll be available whenever i want them he opened his eyes to stare meaningfully whenever we want them ginny nodded solemnly but her eyes sparkled as she kissed him again purely out of selfless concern for the preservation of his urges of course blaise got dressed to go to terry house party feeling like the emotional malfunctioning broomstick ride she d been on the last few days was finally smoothing out yesterday in double potions with terry she had gone mental no other way to describe it professor snape had been reminding them that this was their final potions class before break she remembered how the sardonic man had appeared to look straight at her while addressing the students i sure it will break your hearts to leave school behind but as you spend your days away from hogwarts dontforget that eventually you will be back and i expect competency levels not to drop whilst you re away snape lip curled out of sight out of mind is the phrase deemed trite because it is so true if class performance suffers after break i shall be very displeased the words seemed to echo until blaise was trembling and tears were streaming down her face fiona took an appalled look at her and asked professor if this is the draught of serenity why is blaise crying snape stalked over and tersely demanded she gain command of herself immediately blaise nodded but a glance at terry ruined whatever composure she managed to attain the thought of weeks without seeing his face touching or kissing him devastated her her sobs were silent but distracting to the class nonetheless the professor had seemed embarrassed by her emotional outburst gruffly he told her step outside until you gain control his gaze flickered to another table malfoy no i want terry brows lifted in surprise at her temerity the frowning professor agreed very well mr boot escort ms zabini outside covering her face in a vain attempt to keep her staring classmates from seeing how upset she was blaise rushed out into the corridor terry wrapped his arms around her and asked baby what wrong his eyes were so loving and so blue she couldntstop crying i started thinking about how much i going to miss you and i lost it you think i mental dontyou i think you love me and i love you and we ll work it out we ll see each other somehow soft kisses to her eyelids punctuated his words gentle kisses given to kiss away her tears led to passionate ones as his mouth tried to convey his feelings to her lips she leaned into him while he backed into the wall their kisses became deeper and deeper his hands had opened her robes and slid inside to caress her back when they heard uh no professor zabini not quite herself yet but in a few more minutes i sure she ll be just fine wesley roberts grinned at them from the doorway blaise smiled when he winked and shut the door again terry pressed his forehead to hers and looked into her eyes better nodding her head she smiled and hugged him briefly before he opened the door for her to rejoin the class inside whispers started as she retook her seat blaise glanced at the professor he pursed his lips another quick look revealed draco was looking disgusted too students were snickering blaise asked fiona what is it your robes are opened you lovesick fool face burning blaise quickly fastened her clothing and refused to look at anyone for the remainder of the class blaise stared into the mirror to apply her makeup thinking back to last night when depression struck again terry had promised to play some games with his friends and she d said of course she didntmind she wasntsome insecure girl who would fall apart if she spent a night away from her boyfriend later she had sat and stared at a tapestry in the corner of the common room until draco had returned from a visit with ginny her lips quirked remembering he crouched down by her chair and demanded what are you doing blaise your friends think you re becoming a head case over here what wrong with you she looked sadly into his eyes holiday is almost here we wontsee them for three weeks i dontknow what i going to do i feel like i cantbreathe i just want to cry his classically perfect face twisted as he thought of going so long without seeing ginny for long moments they looked at each other in shared misery his jaw hardened and his eyes blazed you dontknow what you re going to do draco said sharply boot will bring his parents round to having you over but what about me eh ginny brothers hate me the parents definitely wontwant me around and i canteven owl her every day like you can terry boy so stop being so bloody selfish mate find a way or make one think up some brilliant plan so we can both be happy he sat on the floor and leaned his head against her thigh as she smoothed his hair while they tried to think of ways and means to be with the ones they were going to miss so much a faint idea fluttered at the back of her mind just out of reach until draco jumped to his feet and said there nothing we can do is there we ll just be haunted by them all bloody holiday an idea sparked melusine was the spirit of lovers haunted by memories and the name of magic mirrors that kept lovers in contact over any distance they were wickedly expensive but she was wickedly wealthy and knew whom to hire for the job mundungus fletcher the dodgy wizard who did all mumsie black market shopping he was amoral and willing to do anything for a galleon just the man she needed draco saw blaise expression and looked at her with hope in his eyes she said go grab some stationary and meet me in the owlery i have to get my roommate cassandra to scry the address of a man who can get us what we need i ll meet you as soon as possible rising she laughed and quoted our remedies oft in ourselves do lie he laughed with her and asked what that from all well that ends well blaise smiled at the memory and adjusted her hat her outfit was over the top but this was the last party before break and she d arranged a special something with a little help from wesley downstairs her outfit made her fellow slytherins laugh and point draco escorted her to the ravenclaw corridor smirking all the way waving goodbye she said the password and entered through the portrait hole into the common room wesley grin shone white as he stopped an orb and said we ve got a special dedication to a ravenclaw from a slytherin he spun a karaoke orb music played but the voice that sang all i want for christmas is you was hers students gawked while she serenaded terry who had stopped on his way down the boys staircase to stare at her she started walking towards him ravenclaws opened a path for her her boyfriend quickly descended the stairs terry reached her and laughed in delight spinning her around and around wesley put on another orb that played the song with a poignant singer vocalising the lyrics deep blue eyes travelled from her red hat with its white ball on the end and white fur trim to her short red velvet dress trimmed in white fur down to her black boots he grinned do i sit on your lap and tell you what i want father christmas to bring me blaise stood on her tiptoes to give her love a kiss no i going to be your present she swayed in his embrace singing softly all i want for christmas is you strong arms held her so tight she felt as if they were one as if they could never be parted she knew it wasnttrue but if her plan worked this would be the best christmas ever blaise closed her eyes and smiled as terry sang back to her all i want for christmas is you a n i love it when all well that ends well i am one of those people who celebrate christmas all december and love every light and decoration i see too much is never enough and i never get tired of mariah carey singing all i want for christmas is you although my friends and family might lol think of this chapter being the equivalent of putting your christmas tree up the weekend after thanksgiving if you re in britain you donteven have thanksgiving so who cares when you haul in your tree and those of you nutcracker type people who dontdecorate your tree until christmas eve or so good for you but you dontknow what you re missing dontforget to throw me a cookie darling reader and review disclaimer not jk but i do share her love of the holidays and especially her glee in giving characters things to do during their time off even if my ideas and hers are 180 degrees apart lol chapter 19 partings and other sweet sorrows pale fingers of sunlight stretched across hogwarts on the day students were scheduled to leave on holiday outside the school a cloaked and hooded figure met a disreputable man at the gates separating school grounds from land leading to the nearby village do you have what i ordered mundungus aye the cloaked person kept their distance from the unshaven wizard whose pores released the stale smell of beer taking the box he handed through the gate the individual examined the items before throwing a small bag through the bars here a little extra for your silence if word of my purchase got around i would be so displeased i d have to tell my father withdrawing a handful of galleons from the bag mundungus fletcher smiled and said greasily no no quiet as the grave i am without another word the unscrupulous man customer turned away and returned to the school back inside the slytherin common room blaise took off her cloak and searched the chamber several students were up among the early risers three students sat on a large sofa while two more sprawled on the floor opposite the table loaded down with breakfast items the tall blond sprawling on the sofa looked up and met her eyes a wide smile broke over draco face striding towards her he laughed as she held up the box and taunted who wants an early christmas present he chased her up the boys staircase and into his room shutting and warding the door he flashed a white wicked grin stop teasing and tell me did you get them yessss draco exultant shout echoed hers yes he sniggered as a voice said outside the chamber i never get my girlfriend to sound like that blaise opened the box and gently unwrapped two of the items inside she gave a small square mirror with a woman face engraved upon the back to her friend and instructed go stand by the window turn away from me and look down into the mirror when he did what she asked blaise looked down into her matching mirror draco immediately his face appeared upon the glass surface she giggled as his face looked astonished then smiled and winked at her glancing up she explained melusine mirrors they re named after a haunting spirit people who want to keep in touch and not have the other person haunt them use these mundungus charged a mint but what good is being a poor little rich girl if you cantbuy whatever you want thank heaven for rich girls then what would rich boys do without them she handed him the mirror in her hand with a smile they d brood over not seeing their girlfriend over the holidays that what i off to give terry his present draco smiled and opened the door for her as she moved past him he bent and kissed her cheek you re the best blaise i ll remember this forever two sixth years passed by at that moment gawking before hurrying down the steps draco roared with laughter while blaise closed her eyes and shook her head downstairs she grabbed a berry off the tray asked fiona and morrigan to sit with her terry and wesley on the train and patted crabbe and goyle heads before singing as she danced out the door it beginning to look a lot like christmas she didnthesitate to sneak into ravenclaw house using the password wesley had given her for the last party it wasntlike she was really breaking house protocol no one would be there tonight anyway once inside she noticed a few early readers but most students had probably stayed up talking or packing last night and were sleeping in climbing the boys staircase using a disillusionment charm was exciting even more thrilling was slipping into terry room and tiptoeing over to his bed her boyfriend was sleeping on his side with his back to her his bare muscular back placing her slim package underneath the bed for safety blaise was glad she had worn her travelling clothes instead of school robes the cashmere jumper dress she wore made it easy to climb on the bed gently roll terry over and straddle him as she leaned close to whisper baby wake up it me terry eyelashes fluttered but he didntopen his eyes noticing the twitching corners of his mouth blaise realised what he wanted stroking his smooth defined chest she bent and softly kissed his lips blue eyes blazed into hers as the sleeping cutie awoke and hungrily kissed her she felt slightly pervy for being turned on by making out near sleeping roommates until he whispered merlin this is crazy and hot the feel of his hands sliding from her shoulders down to her backside was almost as shocking as the cheerful voice asking are you awake in there she turned her head to see wesley eyes become round blue orbs after he opened the curtains at the end of the bed and saw his friend and blaise he stared in disbelief as his eyes registered exactly what terry hands were almost covering and travelled up the rest of her to meet his mate glaring eyes gulping he hurriedly shut the bed hangings and told the other roommates no boot definitely not ready to get out of bed yet i think we should go on ahead to breakfast and let our pal grab something whenever he feels like it roberts chatted with the boys as they dressed and left the chamber at the door his merry voice reminded i ll be back in an hour so you better grab and go mate i ll see you two later blaise thought ruefully that there was nothing like having new panties displayed unknowingly to throw cold water on hot and turn it to warm she felt terry chest shake with repressed laughter climbing off the bed blaise opened the curtains and bent to retrieve the package where re your trousers standing upright she answered sweetly it a jumper dress terry frowned and sat up swinging his legs over the side of the bed before reaching out to tug at the hem it too short i saw your arse when you bent over then i wontbend over blaise said cheerfully to change the subject i brought you a couple of presents raking back long hair with his fingers he shook his head you didnthave to she nodded solemnly yes i did here sitting on the bed she watched him look at the small mirror front and back is this what i think it is yes it a melusine mirror watch terry she held up a matching mirror his smiling face appeared in her mirror and he could see hers in his this is great i can talk to you see you it so much better than an owl his face clouded how much her fingers stopped him from asking the question she said it doesntmatter poor little rich girl remember all i want for christmas is you and you re worth anything and everything she slid her fingers through his hair and kissed him reluctantly breaking away to hand him his second present it was a framed picture they had taken it during the last trip to hogsmeade she was standing in front of terry with his arms around her and they were smiling he smiled now seeing it blaise showed how to press an almost imperceptible button that opened the frame to reveal a second photograph his reaction to it was everything she d hoped it would be who fiona took the picture creevey developed it we didntlet him see the dry photo he was so disappointed where room of requirement really looks like something out of arabian nights doesntit how blaise smiled at the memory eddy wanted to take belly dancing one year and i went with her she couldntget the hang of it but as you can see i picked it right up like the outfit yes good i hoped it wasnttoo much or too little terry blue eyes were starting to give her the tarzan no more talk more kissing look he traced her movement in the photo with a fingertip what oh the moves well there upward and downward figure eights half turns his intense gaze began to travel her body as if he was imagining her in the costume it made concentrating on her explanation extremely difficult then there the head ah slides and arm uh and rolling erm masculine fingers turned her face to his while terry lips stopped her rambling explanation with passionate appreciation for both the photographs i knew it i knew i d better run ahead and pry you two apart wesley said laughingly you d better perform that charm and get to your house blaise the train leaves in two hours blowing a kiss to terry she used the disillusionment charm to become unnoticeable wesley exclamation followed blaise down the stairs what do you mean that a dress she was staring out her dorm window lost in thought when a blond on a broomstick flew up to it grinning ginny smiled back and then realized he wasnta figment of her incredibly detailed imagination ginny frowned as she hurried to open the window refusing to let her twitching lips break into a smile no matter how appealing draco looked in casual black on a broom she was not smiling at someone so reckless traitorous lips they were smiling without permission fine see if she bought them the good lip gloss ever again exasperated that she was becoming mental as the boy who thought nothing of breaking rules to see her ginny whispered fiercely what do you think you re doing my roommates are showering and getting ready they could come out any moment draco laughed i want to give you an early christmas present hop on hop on as though she would do any such thing ginny heard a voice in the bathroom it sounded as if it were coming closer panicking she clambered out the window and practically leapt onto her boyfriend lap very glad to be wearing denims she wrapped her arms around draco neck and leaned sideways as he leant forward across her lap to steer he drawled you re a lusty wench throwing yourself at me so eagerly shut up and get us out of here yes ma am thankfully they achieved vertical lift before ginny roommate wandered into the room and exclaimed at seeing an open window the sensation of flying was always a thrill even more so when a love god face was so close to hers her lips were acting on their own volition again kissing his cheek maybe she would buy them the posh brand after all if it were on sale now they were tracing his ear and doing naughty things to his earlobe ginny sighed her lips deserved the best money could buy which was why she d let blaise buy her that siren cosmetics kit the other girl kept threatening her with smiling over her zaniness as she nuzzled his neck ginny barely noticed the scenery the snow capped mountains the sunlight sparkling on the lake the dragon claw willow the fact that they were landing ginevra ladies first time to get off oh bollocks draco let the broom fall and carried her underneath the willow fronds to the blanket where he carefully pried her arms away from his neck he grinned at her pouting face extending a small padded box opening it she saw a mirror small square old looking interestingly engraved on the back but still just a mirror ginny smiled uncertainly thanks for the present merlin your expression is so funny it is not any old mirror see i ve one that matches look in yours as i say ginny she was glad to provide a source of entertainment for her boyfriend but she d rather be kissed than laughed at scowling ginny glanced down and saw draco face in the reflection she gasped what is this thing grey eyes looked silver with boyish happiness it was one of her favourite looks on him right after intense rain cloud passion he grinned and she refused to think of all the different grins that melted her insides as he explained they re melusine mirrors melusine is the name of a spirit they re for lovers who dontwant to be haunted by memories the way i d be haunted by you if i couldntsee you talk to you even if it only in a mirror ginny eyes grew damp as she smiled and leaned forward to kiss the lips that said such lovable things she was not going to cry just because malfoy of all people had just said the most romantic thing she d ever heard in her life drawing back after sweet kisses started sliding like her tongue into sultry territory ginny started thinking of when they could use the mirrors was ten times a day too much another thought struck she asked how did you think of this well draco guilty silence told all blaise had come up with the idea and he would have taken the credit if she hadntasked directly how slytherin and almost as adorable as the little boy dontbe mad cause i naughty look on his face right now she scooted over and leaned back against his chest wrapping his arms around her he said with a smile in his voice my specialty is executing plans getting the job done and done right so if you ve got an idea i your go to guy strangely his words made her think of fantasies and not mundane things like helping her with homework or a leaky faucet although the image of malfoy in a pair of tight denims and a tool belt with no shirt made her cheeks go bright pink silent laughter shook the chest she was resting against could he feel her flush like snakes felt body heat he did that slithering twisting now she was on the bottom move that she found so inspiring she admired his rain cloud eyes up close he whispered i knew you were blushing knew your heart was racing because i was looking in the mirror ginny was glad she could giggle at herself because she seemed to be doing it an awful lot around draco his laugh was a beautiful wonderful thing and she was glad he laughed with her even when it was at her because she her eyes searched grey she had to finish packing she wasnttaking much home but the train wouldntwait because she was sorting out her feelings under a willow tree kissing draco one last time ginny lifted the mirror can we use it on the train he nodded smiling faintly she ran across the grounds to the school entrance looking back she saw how the sunlight haloed his hair it made him look like an angel of light ginny knew he was both light and dark and she wouldntchange him even if she could she waved and went inside luna usually looked forward to the holidays time spent with daddy was rare and precious because of it her mother had loved celebrating yule she would ve liked blaise her friend loved yule too she d already made luna promise to floo to malfoy manor and spend blaise birthday on yule doing traditional things like baking cookies with her luna hoped the familiar holiday activities would be comforting and not painful she still missed her mother so much ready to go lindy the indies were all set everyone seemed excited to be going home for the holidays cindy family was large and lived in the country she looked forward to skating everyday mindy parents were taking her to france to visit friends bindy folks ran a restaurant in london that luna promised to visit luna gathered her things and followed them downstairs they climbed aboard thestral pulled carriages and rolled toward the station onboard the train the girls headed for the third to last compartment of the last carriage cindy had foreseen in divination that this was the most propitious one to sit in luna was sceptical but figured it wouldnthurt to humour the girl ginny appeared in the doorway after she sat at the window hey luna would you like to sit with us for awhile ron and hermione are off in the prefect carriage and we could use the company nodding serenely luna told her roommates that she would return later in the outer corridor ginny stopped abruptly and stared into the second to last compartment luna looked through the glass panel to see what was so compelling inside terry was leaning against blaise who had her back to the window and her legs draped around and over her boyfriend luna said thoughtfully it must be hard to run in those heels although they are very pretty her companion snorted i cantbelieve she has the nerve to wear that dress it indecently short blaise just has to show everyone she has long legs that always look tan see how terry running his hands all over her i m i m jealous wishing you could sit with your boyfriend like that ginny smiled wryly yeah good thing green my colour oh crap she seen us quick let go make a face against the glass luna obligingly moved beside her fiery friend and pressed her face to the glass in a silly way that made the people inside laugh one outside laughed too hello luna just what she needed wesley roberts smiling down at her like some ghost of christmas present or was it future ginny was looking from one face to the other like an inquisitive weasel luna tried to think of something to say but her mind was a blank all she could do was say hello wesley how dare his smile be naughty and nice all at once people with gorgeous dimples should receive coal and switches in their christmas stockings luna was not going to let some disturbingly charming boy distract her from spending time with harry she wasn t really in a moment or two after she got used to seeing him in a nordic patterned jumper that made him look like a viking god she was going to tell wesley have a happy christmas and leave honestly before that time came however the compartment door opened and fiona flint stuck her auburn head out did you find some cards wesley she smiled to see the pack in roberts upheld hand then what are you waiting for we ve got a game to play wesley smiled be right there the door slid shut he hesitated as if not knowing what to say luna said it for him happy christmas wesley see you after break happy christmas luna if i dontsee you before then why would you see me before blue eyes twinkled dontknow just a feeling i trust my feelings dontyou she shook her head no wesley paused before entering the compartment he gave her that gently chiding look that made his mouth curve temptingly we ll have to work on that ginny waited until they were sitting to ask what was going on with her and wesley roberts luna wished she had posed that question outside in the corridor instead of inside with harry potter listening to every word keeping her composure luna said mildly there nothing going on i blaise friend and wesley is terry s that all we re both ravenclaws and he a very nice and friendly person harry piped up i ve seen roberts in action ginny and he nice to lots of girls right now he doing his act for flint cloudy green eyes shifted their focus i hope you re not letting him be friendly to you too luna she didntanswer but everyone seemed reassured by her composure harry and neville began to talk about professional quidditch while luna asked ginny about her family and found out that charlie would be home christmas eve bill and the twins would come from london to spend the holiday with them too the family was games mad but enjoyed their quidditch matches most neville wasntlooking forward to playing backgammon with his grandmother and avoiding his nasty relatives but he was getting a new set of herbology texts for christmas and reading them was something he really did look forward to no one asked luna about her plans she tried not to mind she realised that most people caught up in their own dramas had little time to wonder about others the trolley witch came by luna purchased two licorice wands and a bottle of iced pumpkin juice taking alternate bites of black and red licorice neville offered luna a bott bean which she declined with a barely subdued shudder those every flavour jellybeans were simply revolting she didntknow why boys got such a kick out of bile and belly lint and toe jam flavoured beans harry offered her a chocolate frog which luna accepted she was a girl after all what self respecting female turned down chocolate her wizard card was the muse marina resisting the urge to tear the card or smear chocolate on it she tried to slide it unobtrusively down amongst ginny gummy bugabear wrappers harry retrieved it hey look you almost lost your card luna which one is it oh marina she really looks like lorelei doesntshe i should think so she professor lorelei mother why oh why couldntharry glasses have been muggle made he saw way too well neville looked the card over too before asking how old do you think lorelei is she doesntseem that much older than us ginny laughed when luna said coolly loads at least ten years why do you want to ask her to the next ball harry smiled thoughtfully ten years isntvery much when wizards live so long is it a horrible mental image of harry declaring his love for the older woman flashed into luna mind she could see lorelei hugging harry and then looking deeply into his eyes before succumbing to some obscene professor student passion and snogging his brains out a boy would be no match for a siren the indignant girl had just imagined walking up to the cradle snatcher and giving her a stinging hex to make her quit sucking on harry tongue when a voice brought her out of the distressing vision luna luna are you all right you look strange why because her face was red and she was about to hyperventilate taking a deep breath luna calmed herself and nodded to the boy who looked concerned ginny had the nerve to snicker and say i think something disagreed with her she looks fine now when luna accidentally spilled her pumpkin juice onto the redhead teen witch magazine ginny muttered okay i ll belt it crikey you play hardball she did didntshe humour restored luna smiled until ron and hermione came in bitterly complaining it seemed malfoy had refused to sing a carol with the others instead he had told the head boy what he could do with figgy pudding luna saw ginny lips quirk at that soon after her friend made an excuse about needing the loo and all but ran out luna tried to join the conversation but since it seemed to consist of anti slytherin ranting she wished everyone a happy christmas and returned to her own compartment on the way her eyes met wesley through the glass merlin help her the smile that lit his face when he saw her made the day seem a whole lot brighter draco did not do sing a longs he was not into christmas cheer the head boy was off his knob if he thought a malfoy was going to sing a carol perhaps the rude suggestion of what to do with the figgy bloody pudding was unbecoming to a pureblood but he didntcare sneering at any student who dared glance his way in the corridor he stalked away from the prefects carriage taking a mirror out of his pocket he said curtly ginny her face smiled at him from the glass and whispered second carriage third door on the right hurry whistling the tune he d formerly derided and longing to get jolly draco sauntered down the corridor in the second carriage he caught a glimpse of bright red hair and quickened his pace he caught up to ginny as she ducked into a broom cupboard he barely had enough room to stand upright his girlfriend was squashed between him and the brooms that was the only part he liked big brown eyes that looked dark and mysterious in the dimly lit space looked up at him i heard about you rebelling against holiday cheer i like it kiss me draco was happy to oblige eventually he noticed her jumper it was a green knit with bah humbug emblazoned in red letters across the front draco laughed and traced the words with his fingers it took a long time because the jumper kept rising and falling erratically smirking in a way that got him another snog wasntbeing slytherin its own reward he said a scrooge amongst the weasleys how scandalous she giggled i not a scrooge i love christmas and spending time with my family the jumper just for fun i do enjoy shocking people sometimes feel free to shock me anytime how about right now now is good stretching the kinks out of his spine later draco smiled as he watched his girl return to her compartment anytime spent with ginny was good he smiled while checking to make sure the little snotrags were behaving in their compartments what a thrill prefect duty was perhaps he would run into the odd couple of weasley and granger they could punch him in the stomach and pull his hair for auld lang syne the thought made his smile widen why he was grinning like an idiot and thinking bizarre thoughts was beyond him the bayberry scent in the air must have some happy holiday spell on it that his subconscious was fighting draco was more comfortable thinking that instead of contemplating the disturbing suspicion that those feelings he d experienced that day in the library were still hanging around waiting to be acknowledged hearing off key carolling in a first years compartment he entered like an avenging angel and snapped save the caterwauling for your parents no one else thinks you re making a joyful noise blessed silence followed his work there done draco strode out on the lookout for another distraction once the hogwarts express pulled into the station he leaned against the train with arms crossed idly watching the students disembark and meet their parents draco didntenvy them their touching reunions complete with sappy hugs and kisses who needed parental affection when a more satisfying kind was available ginny smiled at him as she followed her loutish brother onto the platform and patted her coat pocket meaningfully he smirked his girlfriend looked like she wanted to snog him again she didn t of course couldntadmit she had a slytherin boyfriend to her gryffindor family and friends whatever would they say draco tried not to feel bitter as he watched ginny hug her parents and chatter happily with her group of loved ones blaise followed boot off the train terry boy looked around for his family frowning when he didntsee them glancing back at blaise the ape man suddenly realised he and his woman were parting tarzan pulled jane into his arms and kissed her in a way that raised quite a few eyebrows including those of boot family terry lover boy mum looked appalled perhaps seeing her baby suck face was a shock draco personally liked his friend short white dress and the red and white floral coat she wore with it she looked very chic but much too sexy for parental piece of mind blaise did an excellent job of quickly detaching herself and buttoning her coat she smiled sweetly as jungle boy introduced her to his parents who were wearing matching red jumpers an older shorthaired version of boot stood behind the parents draco sneered as the elder brother gave thumbs up tarzan said something to jane her wobbly smile made the ape man move toward her draco gaze turned skyward please merlin save me from another display of affection hulloo darlings your mummies came to fetch you come along come along drinky double parked across the platform edina zabini stood on tiptoes waving her hands frantically as her plummy voice echoed from where she waited with his mother the women were decked out in ankle length furs eddy wore white and narcissa black both wore sunglasses and his mother was taking a drink from a flask the sight of the women flustered blaise more than meeting the boyfriend family draco took pity on his friend and strolled over to take her arm and pull her away she ll see you boot come along blaise behind them the boot family had a conversation that made draco smirk terry your mother and i demand an explanation merlin brother did you steal malfoy girlfriend shut up david she my girlfriend girl girlfriend you ve got a girlfriend well i hope he doesntlick the tonsils of girls he only knows casually mum much less let them shut up david inside the car listening to the routine of eddy inanities and narcissa snide remarks draco slowly relaxed the friends shared a rueful smile the holidays had officially begun hours later malfoy manor stood as quiet and oppressive as ever downstairs the mums were passed out on sofas in the enormous lounge upstairs inside the unappreciated grandeur of his room draco pulled on a pair of silk pyjamas and sat on his bed looking down at the small mirror he called ginny a freckled face smiled at him as she whispered draco bill and the twins came over to welcome us back home we re in the middle of a game i ran to the loo when i felt the mirror warm how are things with you i miss you fine the parents embarrassed blaise in front of tarzan ape family but she recovered i just wanted to see you say goodnight ginny giggled i saw a bit of that ron was disgusted at zabini shamelessness he must ve mentioned bare legs four times before i asked why he d been staring enough to notice that shut him right up wish i could ve kissed you that way oh no someone knocking i ll say goodnight although we wontgo to bed for ages the boys want a midnight quidditch match her voice rose stop pounding i ll be out in a moment ginny smiled regretfully i ve got to run i ll see you tomorrow bye pink lips blew him a kiss and she was gone off to have fun with her family and potter while he sat in the mausoleum his family called home all alone he felt like king richard moping around a self pitying bastard saying now is the winter of our discontent placing the mirror in the bedside table drawer draco left the room down the hall he paused outside blaise door the friends had come up with a ward a few years ago that they called freyja lock as the fabled lock of the norse goddess it was named for the ward ensured his or her door wouldntopen to anyone the person inside didntwant to enter he smiled as the handle turned and he walked into the room hi blaise was sitting on her bed looking down at her reflection in the mirror leaning over to place it face down on the side table she said hi terry family is thrilled to have him home his brother barry flooed over and the guys will probably talk quidditch all night she looked as miserable as he was it wasntvery nice to envy someone else happiness with their family but they did he sat beside her and joked is there some unspoken rule that we dress to match the rooms look at you in red pyjamas to match your red linens and hangings and me in black to match mine seeing her smile he bumped her arm with his and said hey freyja your lock not working it let me in that because i wanted to see you tonight dontexpect it to open tomorrow night frey she smiled remember second year when i got into norse mythology and you suggested we name ourselves after the twin gods sure being called the god of sunshine rain and lovers beat baby boy any day he teased i never thought you were much of a goddess of love and magic though guess you ve showed me blaise leaned back against the pillows and rolled onto her side following suit draco waited for his friend to push him off the bed when she didn t he smiled impishly we re not brother and sister you know he expected her to be amused but her expression remained solemn i know i also know i ll never be as free as she was no matter how much i share freyja love of clothes and watching faeries dance in the moonlight slept around did she she smiled a little mmmhmm she once slept with four dwarves to possess a beautiful gold necklace brisingamen one myth said it became the milky way four i hope that necklace was worth it i donteven want to think about it of course you don t freyja shut up your god no better marrying a giantess named gerd and rumoured to be a little too fond of his sister if you know what i mean frey pervy norse gods no wonder we like them dark eyes were serious gazing into his maybe freyja just wanted to be close to frey to someone she cared about who cared about her for comfort and nothing else draco scooted down into the position he remembered as before the sensation of caring fingers caressing his hair was beyond pleasant it was comforting smiling against his pillow he muttered we feel that way freyja but the old gods they were definitely pervs shut up and sleep frey content draco decided sleepily to graciously allow the goddess keeping loneliness at bay to have the last word tomorrow though would be another day and a different story a n winter of discontent line from shakespeare king richard the iii there are so many interesting stories and theories about freyja and frey i took mine from poetic eddas the oral sagas of iceland which were finally written down from 1000 1300 a d and have been compared to blockbuster summer movies full of action sounded good to me in the lokasenna loki takes on the rest of the norse gods in a insult contest and pretty much kicks butt and airs everyone dirty laundry i love mythology as much as shakespeare so you know i ll be throwing bits into the story whenever i can hope you liked it disclaimer the works cited below are jo and the bard s and the song bobby lewis not mine chapter 2 let get it started weasley can save anything he never leaves a single ring that why gryffindors all sing weasley is our king i never get tired of that song luna hummed the catchy tune while she walked across the grounds towards the lake the dragon claw willow was set slightly apart from the others as if the normal trees were trying to edge away from the larger one whose leaves ended in a tip that resembled a dragon claw her father had run a story in the quibbler once about a squib whose pets began disappearing once she put them in the back garden with the dangerous looking tree the girl was still undecided about how reliable the source had actually been after all the woman admitted to forgetting to close her back gate shrugging off tiresome doubts about daddy journalistic integrity luna sang her favourite chorus again she cautiously brushed the drooping stalks aside to reach the slytherin already leaning against the trunk blaise was sitting with her legs stretched out looking through the leafy screen at the lake beyond turning her head upon hearing a cheerful voice the girl contradicted you re singing it wrong here how it supposed to go taking a breath she sang mockingly weasley cannot save a thing he cannot block a single ring that why slytherins all sing weasley is our king mildly surprised to hear a rich throaty voice when she d half expected a soprano luna observed serenely i bet whoever wrote that song really regrets it now tucking her legs to the side she gazed expectantly at her new friend it was malfoy but he allowed another boy to take the credit the poor bloke was popular around the common room for awhile but transferred to beauxbatons after weasel got his act together blaise grimaced couldnttake the hexes anymore oh my luna leaned forward you mean that boy who kept getting the purple pustules oh yeah we really live our sorting hat song the other girl tone dripped sarcasm perhaps in slytherin you ll make your real friends only the hat doesnttell you that with friends like these blaise looked away shrugging glancing back she gave a small smile and admitted ah draco canthelp acting the prat sometimes not after being treated like the prince of the world his whole life luna found this very interesting you sound like his friend i mean as opposed to a person malfoy lets hang round in case he wants something if by friend you mean i hang round draco because he smart and funny even though he can be a git although i not a flunky like crabbe or a love slave like pansy yes we re friends what a slytherin like way of putting it luna approved perhaps the rest of the sorting song is correct too she recited softly those cunning folk use any means to achieve their ends tapping her chin the girl mused i dontknow why people view that so negatively we ll need those qualities if we re going to get our beatrice and benedick together like we ll need a ready mind of wit and learning blaise said thoughtfully two houses working together to end a merry war betwixt sir draco and the lady ginny sounds like a noble cause to me is it ever truly noble to use deception on others did you read one act of much ado about nothing the whole play is based on people using deception to gain their desires we re not the bastard brother hoping to see the lovers fall into social disgrace we re the prince helping two people who just need a little push to get together helping dontyou mean duping she held up her hands dontget all slytherin i not saying i not for it luna explained i canthelp debating ideas that why i a ravenclaw i could talk about the theme of deception as a neutral means to a benign or malignant end and give you specific examples from every act if you d like i guess that means she read the play loony lovegood was a lot sharper than she first seemed if it was a deliberate act she had been sorted into the wrong house blaise raised her hands to mirror luna s spare me although since you re so keen on the ethics of deception and all why dont you write our essay on it i thought you were going to toss off three feet of parchment before the next class i would if you were the dotty girl i first thought you were living in some dreamland for all i knew you d have drawn rainbows on the parchment instead of writing the essay the look in the pale eyes turned toward her was hard to read was the misty eyed girl surprised at blaise original impression of her or was that a permanent look because the orbs staring at her were a bit protuberant are you saying you dontthink i loony anymore the dry comment was worthy of a slytherin snickering she replied crazy like a fox nodding her head in approval blaise added ginny will never suspect a thing luna dreamy smile was extremely effective camouflage for a machiavellian mind neither will draco if you keep him off balance good job in the great hall by the way you know the girl said after a contemplative pause if you d let me pierce your ears and give you some earrings and red lipstick you could be quite a distraction i ll take you up on the piercing but dontworry about the jewellery and makeup i ve got loads she laughed shortly i ve avoided getting girly to hack mum off not because i clueless she made a face and now her dream will finally come true bloody hell blaise rubbed her ears glaring what was that a piercing charm stop whining muggles shoot needles through their earlobes luna said lowering her wand blaise knew she was attempting not to laugh how barbaric all right then maybe i ll give you my crumple horned snorkack pendant as a token of my appreciation really rolling her eyes at one of the few people on the planet who actually believed in snorkacks blaise sighed yes as soon as somebody gives me one now let talk about what we re going to do next after discussing a few details luna noticed there a part of the second act in the play that really fits our situation realising that she d never get to go search her trunk for the jewellery box if the brainy blonde wasnthumoured blaise imperiously waved a hand to indicate the daft girl should recite away luna quoted i will humour ginny that she shall fall in love with draco and you will so practice on draco that in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach he shall fall in love with ginny if we can do this cupid is no longer an archer his glory shall be ours reluctantly impressed the normally impassive girl did something out of character she applauded the efforts of a non slytherin descending the staircase beside colin ginny yawned so widely she actually sprayed saliva on a girl three stairs further down keeping a straight face while her victim rubbed the back of her neck and looked around for the culprit was extremely difficult it didnthelp that her friend was looking at her as if she d grown a second head quickly feeling her neck ginny was relieved to discover that she still had only the one the way last night had gone anything was possible her mum had always told her never go to bed angry well mum had a saying for everyday of the week who knew which one would actually be true is everything alright ginny i didntsleep well last night colin and i dontfeel like talking about it so dontask creevey closed his lips she patted his arm consolingly poor boy loved to talk covering her mouth to cover yet another jaw cracking yawn the girl debated whether to go to the infirmary and get a wake up potion or to fake illness and just sleep the day away on an infirmary bed catching colin flinching away from the threat of another juicy yawn ginny decided she better get a wake up nodding her thanks for her friend promise to save her a seat she stumbled down the last steps to the main corridor and turned to make her way to see the mediwitch aaaggghhhhh ginny closed her eyes in a silent scream why did dad have to bring home that enchanted muggle ray cord play her thingy i keep hearing the song tossin and turnin all night oldies muggle music as harry called it was incredibly catchy and had the nasty habit of popping into one mind at the least wanted moment it was even worse when the song actually matched your thoughts then it repeated itself over and over until a formerly rational person was driven round the twist that me formerly rational tossing and turning all night merlin make that song go away was exactly what ginny had done she d been so infuriated by the actions of zabini and malfoy that she d left the great hall the minute she d finished mutilating the food on her plate harry and the others had laughed at her disgust thought blaise was all right and she was overreacting overreacting her ha she d like to see them not get upset when the slytherin snake looked at her no them whilst making his move on another girl and getting that girl to take off her robes waiting for her them to explode so he could laugh his arse off which she had and he did and that was why she couldntsleep last night those dreams those awful awful dreams all bloody night ginny was plagued by nightmares whenever she would slip into a deep sleep her traitorous brain would send horrific images causing her to bolt upright gasping for breath until she could calm down and begin the whole process over again draco was running a finger down blaise cheek while smirking at ginny blaise was standing with her robes open letting malfoy run his hands over her body while she taunted ginny if you dontwant him lots of other girls do ginny was pushing zabini aside and grabbing malfoy hair with both hands to no a first year boy squeaked in fright and ran away from the mental case who was yelling at herself great just great first i having those nightmares during the day and now i scaring ickle firsties practically running now ginny turned the corner at the infirmary and barrelled into another student without looking up she tiredly mumbled sorry and tried to move on strong fingers gripped her shoulders and a familiar silky voice drawled what the hurry red weaselette really is beautiful when she angry too bad i dontlike her or anyone else in her family reluctantly admiring the sparks flaring in ginny brown eyes and the flush spreading across creamy skin dusted with freckles draco waited for the sputtering girl to reply lips curved in a provoking half smile speechless eh i like you more already not that i donthave that effect on most girls in this school just the price i pay for being so me his mocking smile set the girl off oh you just because i fell for your stupid prank first year doesntmean i going to do it again so so donteven try brows raised in surprise at the depth of her anger draco scowled what are you talking about weaselette he knew but he wasntabout to admit it the boy wasntkeen on the thought of skipping down memory lane but if she insisted you know what i talking about ferret or have you pulled your little stunt on so many first years you cantremember funny weaselette you know i haven t her face was turning pink i know you pulled it on harry he told me watch your mouth you know damn well i told potter to meet me in the trophy room for a wizard duel and we both know that not what you told me ginny cut in hotly draco sneered well you were a silly girl you told me i was pretty that you liked me wanted to get to know me her eyes were blazing now and he stepped away from the scorching heat i waited for ages before filch came you set me up and that was cruel and i ll never forget it malfoy stared back defiantly i ll never forget it either and the truth is cruel so get over it gaining control of himself he leaned against the wall and crossed his arms insolently raising a white blond brow he drawled never got over me did you red that why you re so angry isntit been carrying a torch for me all these years in your dreams malfoy parkinson and zabini may think you re a god but everyone else in this school thinks you re just a boring prat did you get that wake up stuff draco crabbe ambled up to loom behind ginny oblivious to the conversation he had interrupted you telling her about the dreams keeping you up all night goyle questioned added his hulking presence beside his cohort draco resisted the urge to roll his eyes sometimes the advantages of his minions brute strength slavish loyalty and obedience were really not worth the sheer stupidity he was forced to endure day after bloody day he looked over at ginny she was sneering apparently her brief association with tom riddle had left her with slytherin tendencies what all this noise out here madam pomfrey had opened the door to the infirmary she looked extremely cross the mediwitch dismissed malfoy with a brusque you ve had your potion go on with you now the starchy woman turned her attention to ginny are you another one needing wake up potion because you couldntsleep last night the girl face rivalled her hair her eyes widened in dismay draco felt a grin welling up inside and for a change did nothing to stop it from spreading across his face ginny eyes grew even wider at the sight with a whimper she dashed into the infirmary smiling in arrogant male satisfaction malfoy jerked his head at crabbe and goyle who silently fell in behind him as he sauntered toward the great hall a n thanks for the great reviews i really do a happy dance whenever i read one the sight may scare others but it my review and i ll dance if i want to lol so help me put on my dancing shoes and review this chap is dedicated to elspeth bates fellow writer and fab reviewer on multiple sites disclaimer not rowling not shakespeare whose words i borrowed from twelfth night and midsummer night dream i belong to you is off toni braxton 1993 self titled album and well before huey lewis and gwyneth paltrow sang it smokey robinson sang crusin chapter 20 song and dance young sir is going out so early this morning draco spared a brief glance for the house elf that had asked the question he nodded his head and lifted his broomstick slightly while continuing to stride toward the front door going flying if blaise asks i ll be back by seven perhaps it was rude of him to answer curtly but draco had never been truly comfortable with elves years of watching his father mistreat dobby had given him feelings of deep distaste both for the man who abused and the creatures who allowed it the zabini house elf who had readied malfoy manor was nothing like any other elf the boy had seen however he was a dignified being treated like royalty by the family he served the elf wore designer tea towels and got days off for merlin sake exiting the home of his forefathers a rogue gallery if ever there was one he could not make himself turn around and wave farewell some aversions ran too deep mounting his broom draco pulled on his gloves and performed a warming and then a disillusionment charm he neither wanted to freeze his arse off nor be seen by muggles smoothly pushing into a vertical lift he hovered in the air for a moment to look over the house and surrounding grounds the great pile of stone set in the wiltshire countryside was impressive he supposed mrs zabini certainly thought so every time eddy visited she exclaimed the same thing now this is what i call an ancestral abode his lip curled as he wondered how such a vain empty headed woman had persuaded her ruthlessly brilliant husband to marry her either the man had been drunk or she d been pregnant and he d been drunk good thing blaise took after her father except for that shopping habit that came straight from edina speeding toward the salisbury plain draco smiled with lips closed no bugs in the teeth for him yesterday his friend had declared ginny must have a new dress for their date and dragged him off to search the shops of london the newly girly girl had shown a different side of her personality one that combined a businesslike attitude with a love of fashion it was worth the inconvenience and boredom to see blaise work the shops to find the perfect gown when he reached the ancient monument draco landed lightly upon the highest stone and looked out across the plain he marvelled at the ingenuity and determination of the people who had moved these massive monoliths smirking he decided that the druids in charge had to have been early slytherins after spending another peaceful hour contemplating stonehenge draco flew home as the hour of eight arrived the quaint village of ottery st catchpole in devon was starting to show signs of life the milkman was levitating bottles to and from the doorsteps of his customers while the boy riding his broom to deliver the daily prophet threw the morning paper into yards and occasionally even by front doors as he flew by inside the ivy covered walls of the white witch bed and breakfast the smell of baking permeated the air beside the large gathering room fireplace draco turned to allow blaise to brush the floo powder off the back of his shoulders looking around the chintz and lace filled space his lips curled are you sure this was the only inn available on the floo network i dontknow if i ll be able to stand waiting here if our room is decorated like this one blaise smiled commiserating with him as she dusted the last speck of powder from her long red coat trimmed in black fur he knew she felt like he did talking via magic mirror was all well and good but after long days without kissing and touching one did tend to become shirty draco at least was spending the entire evening with his girlfriend blaise had to make do with a stolen hour with terry boy in between setting up his evening with ginny and flooing to london with lovegood to complete his cover he smiled at his best mate and stroked her cheek with a black gloved finger he did appreciate her effort and understanding may i help you a short woman wiping her hands on an apron approached them from what looked to be the dining room blaise said yes we reserved a room in advance zabini the round cheeked older woman was as friendly as she was plump draco bet her cooking was brilliant she looked as though she d sampled quite a bit of it oh my heavens i did wonder when you sent that message round if you would be popping in this morning i told my sister you must ve heard about our breakfasts and wanted to make sure you wouldntmiss it introducing herself as mrs comfrey she returned blaise smile whilst looking enquiringly at draco he nodded politely but didntintroduce himself although clearly wondering what sort of strange couple was standing in her lounge the woman was polite enough to mind her own business after all the lodging had already been paid for leading the pair to the register the woman watched blaise sign in and asked brightly and your young man i ll just put down friend shall i you understand he knew the woman understood something far different than the actual situation but neither he nor blaise was about to explain to the woman that they werentillicit lovers his long black cape swirling about didnthelp calm the woman any neither did his insinuating smile could he help it if naughty looked so good on him mrs comfrey gave them their room key and led the pair to the staircase before they climbed halfway a tart voice announced from below they seem rather young to me my sister mrs snidely i ll only be a moment dears the teens shared a look of amusement while they watched the short plump woman talk to her tall thin sister the conversation was muted but the couple stifling laughter could plainly hear the words zabini jewellers paid in full and looks dangerous to cross apparently the pleasant woman won out over her sister for mrs comfrey bustled back up and led them to their room without further delay here you go dearies the honeymoon suite the lavatory with a lovely claw foot tub is right through there so sorry for the misunderstanding shall i send up a breakfast tray yes please it smells wonderful i sure you re justly famous blaise said with a charming smile he rolled his eyes the proprietor left with a cheerful nod draco tossed his cape over a chair before stretching out on the large comfortable bed blaise tsked at the sight of shoes on the duvet cover and promptly took them off his feet he smirked unrepentantly a knock sounded at the door mrs snidely handed over the tray whilst looking down her long nose at the youth sprawled on the bed thanks blaise said facetiously closing the door in the unpleasant woman face he leered playfully do you think they re calling me your kept man down there boy toy more like and i bet they think you re worth every galleon grinning blaise placed the tray on a round table overlooking a small balcony and picked up the teapot to pour a cup of tea she didnteven offer to make him a cup petulantly he demanded what about me this is your tea if you move your indolent arse over here and take it shaking his head in pretended affront draco slid off the high bed and lounged in the chair across from the smiling girl looking askance at the white walls white furniture white bed and table linens he said dryly i surprised they didntwant verification of virginity before they let this room blaise handed over a scone slathered in butter they did so it a good thing i qualify the look of shock on his face made the silly virgin laugh he tried to delicately ask why she and boot hadn t but the wench refused to answer said unless he d like to hear a speech about her moral choices it was none of his bloody business reaching for the arts section of the paper his mate winked and threw him the sports they ate and read quietly until a knock broke the peaceful silence after opening the room to admit ginny blaise immediately left telling the girl she d do a couple of errands and then wait downstairs the two were going to snog like crazy and she didntwant to see it she wasntjealous it was more what roberts had said affection deprived friends shouldnthave to watch snogging poor wesley she and terry were so bad about doing that in front of him blaise resolved to never to do it again unless she forgot or just couldnthelp herself since ginny probably wouldntbe down for another half hour she placed her black fur hat on her head pulled on dragon hide gloves and strolled down the cobbled street to find the specific shops from which she needed to pick up her orders stepping out of the weasley fireplace later blaise was immediately struck by the ordered clutter of the place it was so full of interesting things and seemed so homey how different from any of her parents houses it was everyone was bustling about from one room to the other fred and george came running over to take her coat cor why didntyou look this gorgeous when we were at school blaise take her coat fred my pleasure george looks like a russian princess doesntshe yeah but underneath she looks like a spanish gypsy fred clasped his hand over is heart if you know how to make paella blaise i asking you to marry us right now both of you she asked with a smile these bright haired boys must have received all the charming genes in the family merlin knew their brother ronald didnthave any of course and please call us gred and forge the simultaneous silliness made her laugh not so their mother stop embarrassing the girl and yourselves and go tell harry and ron we have a guest molly weasley matronly figure and auburn hair made blaise think of hugs and bedtime stories how lucky ginny was to have a mum like her she saw her friend frowning and looked down at her white cashmere top and form fitting black trousers tucked into knee high boots was the outfit not demure as she d hoped the hem almost touched the low waist of her trousers ron and harry entrance into the lounge diverted attention from her clothing what she doing here ronald weasley how rude miss zabini is your sister guest and i expect you to behave politely right mum sorry zabini nodding her acceptance of the clearly forced apology blaise waited for the frowning boy to meet her eyes she winked he immediately turned bright red and stalked out of the room smiling she met green eyes which considered her solemnly from behind round glasses smirking at the famous harry potter blaise remembered her items and handed the basket in her hand to her hostess oh my evergreen and holly boughs candles and oranges studded with cloves i didntknow young people celebrated yule anymore and what this oh heavens magical me a life in pictures i ve been searching for this book for ages i dontknow what to say i do said ron the boy looked like a freckled face rain cloud lurking in the doorway couldntstay away could he blaise smiled sweetly at him before telling mrs weasley it just a token of appreciation for your hospitality potty and the weasel snorted rudely how untrusting they were mr weasley came into the room and greeted the newcomer in a friendly manner blaise gave him a small gift also he smiled and looked curiously at the object in his hands what this then it a battery tester solar powered so you only need to place it in the sun every now and then to keep it working the man beamed look boys you place the battery here and it lights up if there a charge thank you so much miss zabini what a thoughtful gift yeah dad will be testing his battery collection all weekend now wontyou dad the amiable man smiled sheepishly at fred comment and asked his wife if she d mind sending his lunch out to the workshop there were so many batteries he was raring to try the twins grinned at their thoughtful guest they were two young men who clearly appreciated well planned bribes like their sister their younger brother and potter were the only ones who thought she was a slytherin snake out to get something blaise couldntfeel offended she was over a luncheon of paella which blaise did indeed know how to conjure she refused a marriage proposal and received permission for ginny to attend a muggle ballet performance of the nutcracker with her that evening if mrs weasley believed that the girls were actually going and with blaise parents well she should have listened better blaise slytherin smile toward the gryffindor across the table caused the boy to push his chair back and clomp angrily upstairs shortly afterwards ginny led the way with harry into the lounge following blaise insistence the two played wizard chess halfway through the match blaise climbed the magically sturdy but rickety looking stairs of the burrow marvelling that the weasley only had one bathroom per floor unsurprisingly the large number of residents made finding an unoccupied loo a quest of epic proportions at the top floor underneath the attics she felt as though she had found the philosopher stone instead of a mere vacated toilet opening the door with a relieved sigh a short time later blaise noticed that another room on the floor was open curious she walked over and looked inside ron stood by the window muttering to a small owl that was sitting on a perch built into the wall beside it dontknow why ginny had to bring that girl home aw mr freckles you re hurting my feelings the face that turned toward the door looked ready to rip someone head off and she could guess who s dontcall me that i hate it when you call me that how come you re up here anyway loo hard to find an unoccupied one blaise smiled in the way that seemed to make ron especially uncomfortable did you think i came looking for you it was amazing how belligerent he could look well you re here arentyou so yeah i think you did so what do you want something about that openly angry expression caused her to be honest in return i want to know what your problem is there was a perverse satisfaction in knowing she could yank the gryffindor chain and get such a violent reaction his angry expression when she closed the door faltered when she leaned against it and smiled infuriated panic was a very remarkable look he answered i ll tell you what my problem is it the way you re always smiling and winking at me and pulling stunts like that licking mousse thing why do you do that stuff why do you think every one of the freckles on ronald weasley face stood out as he paled in fury if she had wanted a reaction blaise sure got one large hands that hardly ever let the quaffle in anymore gripped her arms and gave a shake frustrated anger filled his voice i think you get your kicks from teasing me why boot and malfoy not enough for you you want me to kiss you too wow brilliant blue eyes combined with red hair and freckles were quite striking no wonder hermione was so smitten blaise smiled no i want you to kiss granger weasley looked like he d been hit in the head with a bludger her smile widened what will it take for you to give that girl a snog she kicks your arse every time you notice someone else doesntthat give you a clue she wants your attention all to herself of course it does i not as thick as you all like to think i am it just what i dontknow how okay i ve never kissed anybody before and i feel so bloody stupid that i d rather get hit in the head than have mione laugh at me or worse feel sorry cause i dontknow what the bloody hell i doing staring in shock at the tall boy now turned away and running an agitated hand through his fiery hair blaise said quietly it not that hard a thing to get the hang of i never kissed anybody until terry and ron laughed shortly he had though hadnthe kissed somebody before he didntmash your lips against your teeth or anything horrid like i d probably do to hermione bugger all weasley was really sweet not wanting his first kiss to be horrid blaise couldntstand it she had to do something putting a hand on his arm she turned the unhappy teen to face her and said briskly all right here the plan dontsay a word until i finished i either insane with christmas cheer or a sucker for romance maybe both dontcare doesntmatter okay deep breath i ll teach you how to kiss a girl no hands no tongues strictly put your lips like this stuff then you kiss granger under the mistletoe or in the moonlight wherever before holiday ends deal the hit by a bludger look was back rapidly followed by narrow eyed suspicion what in it for you canta slytherin do a good deed without their motives being questioned blaise rolled her eyes fine i sort of admire gryffindor spirit so i wouldntmind seeing you and granger happy okay dontsmile that opinion and the once in your lifetime kiss are secrets you will swear by godric gryffindor to take to your grave ronald weasley he nodded earnestly like i d want that wild man of yours after me or worse hermione after me in a bad way their shared smile was almost as disconcerting as the thought of a shared kiss blaise felt awkward and bloody stupid herself as she moved closer taking his hand in hers she matter of factly showed him how to cup her cheek like this and tilt her head just so and place his lips like that kissing ronald weasley had to be one of the weirdest things she had ever done it made the inuit friendship ritual she d done with colin seem barely odd by comparison the boy lips were so different than terry s fuller and wider the feel of his mouth on hers wasntbad just strange their eyes looked warily and slowly closed ron lips moved against hers tentatively at first after a few minutes though weasley demonstrated that being a keeper wasntthe only skill he excelled at after intense practise the detached purely educational nature of the kiss changed his calloused fingers were sifting through her short curls while she allowed her hands to satisfy her curiosity about what weasley red hair felt like it wasntsilky like terry s but thick and a bit coarse blaise rose on her tiptoes he was really tall wouldntwant him to get neck strain his hands slid down her back she gripped his shoulders solely to keep her balance ron tongue was sliding against hers when the door opened and two merry voices were heard arentwe glad we volunteered to come up and see what was taking blaise so long indeed we are george everybody downstairs is worried that these two are having a row up here i wish a gorgeous bird would row with me like that fred ron jerked away from blaise and yelled shut up you two and you better not say a word to anyone mr freckles was sweet and a good gryffindor boy but he didnthave the right tools to handle the twins inviting them in blaise explained how zabini jewellers was looking for unique gifts to send to the orphanages they supported and asked them if they d like to make a deal after another proposal was laughingly made and refused they discussed terms only once before ginny and blaise left did fred and george make any reference to the little scene they d witnessed commenting on how agreeably everyone was getting along as they played games in the lounge mrs weasley said brightly that she was so glad that ronald and blaise had made friends and were now saying nice things to each other yeah george arentthose two using their lips in a much nicer way now they are indeed fred it so spiffing whenever people are able to use their tongues in such a pleasurable manner a lifted eyebrow from blaise had the snickering twins subsiding into prudent and lucrative silence when the girls flooed back to the b b ginny went first as blaise prepared to say the white witch bed and breakfast her eyes met ron s he winked oh merlin what monster have i created i only wanted to do him and granger a favour not give weasley a way to torment me i ve got to get out of here and forget that episode ever happened that was my first and last pity snog blushing she refused to look at ron or those hyenas he called brothers hurriedly she blurted her destination tossed floo powder and left draco and ginny were waiting in the lounge after checking to make sure they remembered the floo direction and proper wards to her father office flat blaise stepped into the fireplace and said the words to take her where she most wanted to go wizard bay winery terry was waiting for her when she stepped out of the stone fireplace floo powder filled the air as he hugged her tight impatient hands tugged off her hat and coat and caressed her body with the same urgency her lips conveyed to his short hard frantic kisses eventually became long soft satisfying ones lying atop terry on the sofa in the winery office blaise never wanted to leave his arms the days they had spent apart seemed like forever she was sure his brown hair had grown longer and she wanted to feel it against her skin she pulled off her top sighing happily as he chuckled and rubbed the strands against her face and chest his jumper soon joined hers on the floor the warmth of his skin was better than any warming charm whispers of i ve missed you i love you interspersed kisses as terry warm hands began to undo a clasp the sound of approaching footsteps halted his fingers the couple sprang apart blaise threw her boyfriend his jumper and quickly dragged on her top she looked at the clock on the wall the hour had already flown by the locked doorknob rattled terry are you in there the older man voice sounded concerned giving her boyfriend a last kiss blaise ran to the fireplace and grabbed a handful of floo powder terry called just a minute dad blaise blew a kiss said lovegood house whilst throwing the floo powder and disappeared luna sat in the library reading what was at any other time would be a thrilling account of an explorer lifelong search for the crumpled horn snorkack today it could not hold her attention her eyes kept drifting to the fireplace your friend will get here when she gets here darlin no sense tryin to watch a pot it never boils that way lunatic larry lovegood appeared to be engrossed in the memos of upcoming story ideas for his paper the quibbler but he d noticed her preoccupation just the same cigar smoke wafted into the air as her father took a puff and released it in a ring that floated gently toward the high ceiling shrewd blue eyes focused on his daughter glad you re finally going out and about after your mother well i didntblame you i didntwant to be gallivanting around either but now i proud of you luna thank you daddy the man ran a hand through his short dirty blond hair larry might resemble his cousin arthur quite a bit but the appearance of amiability was only skin deep underneath he was a driven man whose true passion was the news and not the dry boring bits found in what he called the non prophet luna counted his working at home on holiday nights and weekends as proof of her father love if not for her he d never come home their house was situated between the predominantly wizard village of ottery st catchpole and the muggle town of ottery st mary both villages were located on the otter river in devon near exeter lyme bay was within easy flying distance and luna and her parents had spent many holidays in a cottage on the water there every now and then she would catch sight of one or more weasleys in the village this holiday she had been running errands to the shops more than ever before her persistence had paid off when she d bumped into ron and harry outside the quidditch supply shop a couple of days ago they chatted for several minutes before the boys had to fly back to the burrow the thought of how bright harry eyes had looked against his green jumper brought a smile mooning over some boy are you i d recognize that misty look anywhere your mother looked at me that way when luna smiled her father rubbed the back of his neck as he admitted scared the hell out of me that look did why a beautiful girl like that was interested in me i will never know i know daddy mummy said the moment she saw you she knew both sets of blue eyes became misty for a moment uncomfortable with gushy sentiment as always her father quickly changed the subject so where are you girls off to and who this new friend of yours anyhow luna smiled to see him blow smoke rings through smoke rings we re going to london to shop and have dinner she blaise zabini slightly protuberant male eyes lit up zabini daughter of enrique zabini zabini jewellers always places big expensive ads hmmm enrique a ruthless bast er man sweetheart what the daughter like she a funny kind of slytherin calculating but emotional and kind too i like her a lot sounds like an interesting gal well here she is i guess i ll see for myself blaise stumbled out of the fireplace smiling at her friend and the man raising a sandy brow to look her over her coat was unbuttoned and her fur hat askew most telling of all her left earring was missing luna hid a smile father this is my friend blaise zabini blaise this is my father larry lovegood pleased to meet you young lady luna told me good things about you thank you sir it a pleasure to meet you as well luna rose to her feet and asked should i change blaise said that fine for shopping we ll find you a new dress before we go out to dinner if that alright with you mr lovegood of course of course girls need new frocks now and then go and have a good time what this the flustered man looked into the small gift bag given to him by his daughter friend inside a paperweight swirled glitter that when shaken settled down to form a saying what shall it prophet a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his readers to the quibbler her father bray of laughter brought luna over to view the gift reading the paperweight message she giggled daddy wink told her he agreed with her assessment of blaise calculating but kind after being pulled through what felt like every wizarding dress shop in london luna sighed in relief when blaise finally found one worthy dolce and gabbana stregone inside luna looked in vain for tags how was she supposed to tell how much anything cost stop worrying about the expense your father can afford it we re here to find a dress and beauty is priceless frowning at the girl looking over a red beaded gown with a critical eye luna said dryly i know because there not a price tag to be found saluto di benvenuto may i help you ladies gorgeous witches in little black dresses should not be allowed to work in shops even outrageously expensive ones it depressed the clientele namely her blaise appeared not to mind si certo we each need something for tonight gesturing to the dress in her hands the decisive girl stated it a bella cosa but we re looking for something not so formal a little more fun si i will show you some things you will like trailing after blaise and the unhealthily thin woman luna wished she were home with her snorkack book no clothing was worth this pain except that beaded bustier with that skirt and that blue satin evening coat with the leopard print lining overwhelmed by her first experience with shopper lust luna was easily persuaded into buying the whole outfit including shoes by some person named manolo later looking across the table after dinner the only thing luna could think to say was grazie which made blaise cackle like a witch before saying this place usually only has karaoke on friday nights but during december they expand to saturdays too c mon let watch i might even give it a go myself through a corridor on the other side of the restaurant the girls found the large room packed with people at the tables and bar a singer was butchering winter wonderland on stage colin sings better than that luna looked at the other girl curiously when did you start calling creevey colin brown eyes grew even bigger long story not telling blaise gazed around the room oh my gods look who it is let go say hello hauling her friend behind her the excited girl made her way to the bar and the young man sitting on a stool with a charming grin on his face call d robin goodfellow are not you he that frights the maidens of the villagery said blaise pleased laughter brought out the dimples in wesley robert handsome cheeks he kissed blaise hand and then turned to bring luna to his lips still clasping his fellow ravenclaw fingers in a firm warm grip he murmured thou speakest aright i am the merry wanderer of the night he told them terry owled me told me you d be here i supposed to keep wesley grinned as he held up fingers and made a quoting motion while saying horny bastards away from my girl the couple sitting next to roberts left so the girls took the seats the trio laughed while bad singers performed wesley asked blaise while nodding toward the stage why dontyou go up there and show them how it done either the boy wickedly persuasive grin or some latent trait of gryffindor recklessness made the girl hop down from her stool and saunter over to where the orpheus was spinning the musical orbs the two talked nodded and the gypsy eyed girl took the stage whistles and claps made her smile wesley slid over to the seat by luna and chuckled poor terry he going to be so jealous when i tell him how sexy his girlfriend looked tonight why tell him then because carina and that means pretty by the way i going to record our songbird and send it to my mate my fun will be making sure he has a good mental image of what she looked like while singing it you have a very odd notion of fun wesley gaze looked dark and intent in the dimmed room i ll be happy to show you my real notion of fun anytime you want luna just say the word was the room unduly warm perhaps if she took off her evening coat no now wesley eyes were enjoying the view of her bare shoulders and she felt warmer than ever fortunately blaise spoke and his attention was diverted to the small recording orb in his hand this song is for terry i belong to you blaise poured her emotions into the words the silence at the end of the song seemed to please the singer as much as the enthusiastic clapping afterwards gesturing to her friends she didntstop until they came over to see what she wanted you two are up next i ve picked out a song that easy to sing the words and music appear on this sheet as you go along i did it so now it your turn give me the recordbrall wesley terry will want to hear you too why luna agreed was something she didntwant to think about she was afraid it was due to the boy standing beside her on stage holding the paper for her to read although she didntknow what cruisin was she did the best she could with her soft soprano wesley voice was mellow and smooth as he sang cruise with me baby she sang tremulously at first but her partner was so good luna relaxed and sang better than she ever had before by the last chorus she was smiling into amethyst blue eyes coincidentally the same shade as her bustier and evening coat a short time later wesley walked the girls over to the restaurant fireplace which was on the floo network and usable for an exorbitant fee that blaise had blithely added to the bill after her friend returned to malfoy manor luna prepared to go home as well before she left she nervously smiled at wesley and thanked him for the song and coming to watch over them he replied with a smile that she just knew was going to give her disturbing dreams about faeries a merrier hour was never wasted there ginny stared at the dress hanging in the closet reassured that blaise was nothing more than draco best mate no girl who wanted malfoy for herself could ve picked this dress for another woman to wear it was beyond beautiful the gown belonged to a princess in a fairytale the princess ginny had always longed to be how many nights had she looked out her window pretending she was a captive princess in a tower dreamed that a black haired white knight would rescue her and carry her off to live happily ever after those childhood dreams had transformed she now wanted a black knight who could also become a dragon to carry her off only the happily ever after part was uncertain but she refused to think about the future when the lights of london sparkled beyond the window ginny reached out a hand to reverently touch the dress miss is needing assistance to get ready spinning around she beheld a house elf wearing an extremely fancy tea towel edged in fur the elf regarded her with kind eyes ginny said who are you i am minky miss young mistress sent me to help you into the gown and do your hair ginny smilingly accepted she needed all the help she could get after minky had worked elf magic the reflection in the full length mirror was so amazing it was hard to believe it was really her complicated upswept hair along with expert makeup amazing shoes and the emerald dress with a strapless top and floor length many layered skirt all combined to leave her speechless in the lounge she saw draco looking out through the glass wall at the city below his platinum hair pale features and perfect frame looked so elegant in a modern black tuxedo she sighed he turned at the soft sound aristocratic features softening into a smile of awe silently he moved to take her hand the look draco gave her as his lips touched her skin was so tender ginny had to blink back tears they smiled devouring each other with their eyes you re beautiful they laughed at the shared sentiment ginny teased jinx you owe me a butterbeer lips that made her shiver curved into a smile as draco removed a box from his coat pocket how about an early christmas present instead taking the box her fingers trembled as she lifted the lid and removed dangling emerald earrings she shook her head i cantaccept these they re too much masculine fingers took the earrings and gently slid them into each feminine earlobe draco said softly o mistress mine where are you roaming o stay and hear your true love coming that can sing both high and low trip no further pretty sweeting journeys end in lovers meeting every wise man son doth know he paused and caressed her cheek with the back of his fingers while saying with a small smile what is love tis not hereafter present mirth hath present laughter what to come is still unsure in delay no good is seen then come and kiss me sweet and fifteen she couldntbelieve he had memorised that for her that day in the library she hadntknown this was so much better ginny gladly moved into draco arms for a kiss pulling back after long sweet moments she asked what play is that quote from the smile that made her think of a mischievous faery flashed twelfth night act ii scene iii took me forever to find i thought it was from a bloody sonnet grinning he admitted i changed the last bit to suit you i ll gladly say in delay there lies no plenty come and kiss me sweet and twenty when the day comes though tears of happiness welled and spilled down her cheeks at the thought that draco wanted to be there when she was sweet and twenty gentle fingers brushed them away and pulled her close the couple stood embracing until minky asked young master is wishing dinner now draco nodded yes thank you offering his arm with a slight smirk he said if my lady will accompany me i thought we d have dinner here the thought of eating in the large stark ultra contemporary flat didntthrill her but anywhere she could spend time with her boyfriend was better than the finest restaurant the lift of a white blond eyebrow made her heart race oh young master allowing draco to lead her to what she d previously thought an entrance to a bedroom ginny watched as the doors were pulled back to reveal a set of stairs at the top the door opened onto a rooftop garden faery lights sparkled almost as brightly as the city whose lights could be seen shimmering in all directions the table was beautifully set the air charmed to feel like spring instead of winter during the meal conversation mainly consisted of looks and smiles dreamily ginny watched shadows play across draco skin and hair and eyes and mouth and thought what could be better than this a violin began to play standing her prince her black knight her dragon lover stood and held out his hand she rose and put her hand in his they stayed in each other arms swaying together as the enchanted instrument played song after song until the first rays of dawn broke over the city a n it seems like all the characters want to have their time in the spotlight even ron wanted a first kiss what a writer to do let them have their way of course christmas is a time of giving so i hope you like longer chapters cause the next one yule give me a gift back in the way of a review it all i want for christmas from you lot anyway d disclaimer am not rowling or a believer in any kind of magic except the magic of love i do like suspending disbelief and pretending for a story sake so dontflame me for a little literary witchery people lol chapter 21 yule blaise appraised her outfit in the wardrobe mirror the flirty short skirt with matching black halter top wasntquite appropriate for a breakfast picnic she chose a hot pink cashmere jumper and pulled it on in the mirror her reflection grinned moving to the louis xiv desk she wrote a note when draco came looking for her later he d find it she glanced at the ormolu clock on the mantel there was plenty of time to get downstairs to the library and floo over to meet terry closing the door she headed for the stairs singing quietly happy birthday to me happy birthday to me after stepping out of the winery fireplace blaise looked around the transformed office today was the winter solstice the day the sun stood still and time really did feel suspended as she gazed at the faery lights floating around the room the desk had been pushed to a far wall in the centre an enormous green circular blanket was encompassed by pots of small white flowers when she heard the door open blaise looked up to see her boyfriend entering with a picnic basket terry brown hair was pulled back into a pony tail his eyes against the navy roll neck jumper and denims were incredibly blue he placed the items down onto the blanket and closed the distance between them cradling her face in his palms he softly kissed her lips happy birthday baby surprised nodding blaise smiled tremulously taking his hand and walking into the circle the faery ring the lights you it so beautiful the pleased smile on his face was beautiful too you like it i love it i love you kicking off her shoes she wrapped herself around him trying to express her feelings with a kiss it was very successful because terry knees buckled taking them both down to the blanket realising that the floor beneath her felt cushy blaise said when she was allowed to take a breath you used a comfort charm long strands that had been pulled free by her naughty fingers tickled as her boyfriend teased pampered little rich girls dontlie on hard floors this one would to be with you eyelids closed as lips met in a tender kiss that turned into a succession of kisses only the sound of terry stomach rumbling ended the snog laughing they pulled apart and sat up terry grinned i starving it took forever to set this up and sneak to the village bakery accepting a flute of cider and pronouncing it a very good year blaise broke off a bit of pumpkin cranberry muffin and popped it into her guy mouth before taking a bite herself mmmm she approved a peek into the basket made her smile there must have been a dozen different kinds of muffins as well as basket of strawberries watching terry eat half a dozen muffins before turning to the berries made her hungry for something more than food trying to appear casual she tossed the cashmere jumper aside and reached over to pick up a berry and bring her boyfriend attention to her nearly bare back he traced her spine with the tip of a finger and murmured whose birthday is it anyway i feel like it mine but i wontbe seventeen until summer solstice blaise shivered happily how do you feel about older women setting the basket aside terry drew her onto his lap i love older women as long as they re you her hands were a lot less subtle tugging his jumper off and hurling it out of the faery ring lying in his arms was the best present of all and she told him so blue eyes that had been closing as he trailed kisses down her neck opened abruptly stretching to pull a small box out of the basket terry handed it over smiling at her surprise inside the box was a heart shaped locket on a fine chain the jeweller child immediately knew that it was sterling silver victorian and expensive the engraved star in the centre of the heart had a ruby set into it the pure red colour of the jewel was so vibrant and the locket so lovely that blaise had to press her lips together not to cry terry fastened the chain around her neck with the heart resting underneath the hollow of her throat pressing the small catch he opened the locket to show her the tiny picture of him on one side and a lock of his hair in the other oh terry i she had to break off or start bawling masculine lips curved i wanted you to know you have my heart i wish you could live with me and be my love and we could all the pleasures prove first the breakfast then the locket now shakespeare his eyes twinkled i got that from one of my mother poetry collections it christopher marlowe seems his buddy shakespeare borrowed from him too of course marlowe probably borrowed that from someone else i dontcare who wrote it i love the thought almost as much as i love you blaise said i knew something had happened that day i finally noticed you in potions but i never dreamt i could feel so much or fall so hard she admitted my family isntinto touching or any kind of closeness i didntthink i needed it until you came along but now holding terry so tightly she could barely breathe blaise was too choked up to continue he seemed equally moved letting his eyes and hands and lips express his emotions in kisses and caresses eventually tearing himself away her boyfriend covered his closed eyes with both forearms as he lay beside her finding her jumper she put it back on she picked up terry shirt admiring the view for another moment before saying with a regretful sigh here your jumper sweetie thanks she helped pack up the basket and started to bring the faery lights down i ll do it terry said quickly lowering the lights back into a box before transfiguring the dozens of potted flowers back into one large arrangement that he placed on his father desk the blanket magically folded into a handkerchief sized cloth and was placed in the box with the lights and stored in a closet once he d moved the desk back into its usual position in the room they sat on the sofa holding hands blaise resisted the temptation to do anything other than talk he asked how are you going to celebrate the rest of your birthday blaise stopped kissing each individual finger on his hand she considered it a present to herself to reply luna and ginny are flooing from lovegood house to spend the day with us we re going to make all kinds of yule stuff before i drag everyone into the woods to get holly and the yule log before dinner he looked amused by her enthusiasm she smiled and touched her locket the ruby is one of the stones of yule it a stone of love passion and promise of heart his smile was so boyishly sweet blaise almost threw herself at him and snogged him silly terry said i looked for blue topaz but i saw this and the lady at the antique shop said the ruby was december mystical birthstone it supposed to open the heart to love so i had to get it he pulled her hand and body into his arms snogging had never seemed less silly terry the couple jumped apart standing slightly behind her boyfriend blaise peeked over a broad shoulder while listening to the conversation what do you think you re doing brother none of your business david it became my business when my girlfriend found a silver earring between the cushions of that sofa last night and accused me of cheating on her i told angie it was your girl and she came over this morning to ask mum and dad if blaise is going to be at the christmas eve party so she can return it i saw the lights flickering up here and figured you were fooling around again the older boot face looked a lot like terry s his eyes werentas blue though and he wasntas handsome with a broader build and short hair terry frowned what did the folks say dontknow but i think you need to come find out say goodbye and owl her later no offence blaise terry told his brother he d be right down and closed the door in david face he walked her over to the fireplace i guess this is one birthday you wontforget i really did want it to be special she twined her arms around his neck it was special the most special birthday i ve ever had i never going to want to take the locket off somehow the brief soft kiss she meant to give turned into a long ardent one a knock on the door reminded her terry had parents to talk to she had people to see also after blowing a kiss and promising to mirror later she flooed back to malfoy manor stepping out of the ostentatious marble fireplace in wiltshire blaise ran upstairs and changed into a swimsuit she needed either exercise or a cold shower and swimming was far more enjoyable not wanting to lose the necklace she reluctantly undid the clasp and placed it by her precious mirror downstairs a side corridor lead to the indoor pool converted out of a sunroom and conservatory inside the sound of the pool shower halted her steps from behind a potted palm she saw draco in a black speedo running his hands through platinum hair as the water streamed down his body quicker than a house elf chugging butterbeer blaise backed out of the chamber and ran upstairs to take a cold shower luna stirred a pot of porridge and smiled at the man frowning over the competition rag at the breakfast table she served him a bowl adding raisins brown sugar and cream just the way he liked it munching on a rasher of bacon the quibbler editor returned his daughter smile and picked up his mug of coffee where are you off to today malfoy manor it blaise birthday and i going to floo over and return after dinner she didntmention that ginny weasley was coming too luna didnttrust her father not to casually let it drop to his cousin arthur shrewd blue eyes softened i glad you re not going to be alone today sweetheart you and your mother always spent yule together doing all that girl stuff that looks and tastes so good i ll bring us back some cookies and a holly wreath lunatic larry lovegood grinned do that especially the cookies i love yule cookies you love all cookies slightly protuberant male eyes narrowed if you expect father christmas to fill your stocking with something other than switches miss cheeky you ll keep him stuffed with cookies she giggled we ve already bought them and anyway what kind of father christmas makes children go shopping to purchase their own presents a smart one who never has to stand in a return queue slightly protuberant female eyes twinkled you re so brilliant daddy her father raring to floo to work and rip someone head off for not scooping the non prophet on some story or other winked as he headed for the library father christmas just put you at the top of the nice list young lady humming have yourself a harry little christmas luna waved her wand to clean the kitchen before drifting off to wait for ginny to arrive inside the library a redhead appeared in her fireplace carrying a brown paper sack had to hide the presents i told mum i was cheering you up by spending yule doing crafty things brown eyes sparkled i didntlie even if i did stretch the truth like a slytherin luna replied must be all that stretching you do to kiss draco paid off has it you re so funny i forgot to laugh ready to leave lips still curving with amusement at her own humour luna nodded and passed ginny the floo powder as she listened to the other girl say malfoy manor in a clear voice she thought smugly that harry enjoyed her dry humour wesley did too her reflection in the mirror above the mantel frowned she was wearing an amethyst jumper and jacket but she refused to believe her choice meant anything other than a partiality for blue eyes no the colour blue exasperated floo powder was thrown with an angry motion the malfoy library was just as magnificent and daunting as luna had thought it would be the walls of books didntlook like the kind she d like to read however one title how to make minions and influence others caused her to prudently decide not to peruse any more to her relief blaise bounded into the room wearing a red jumper that actually covered her entire torso come on there so much to do and no time to waste i sent the love birds off snogging over cookies makes them sickeningly sweet so it just you and me mate until lunch luna noticed the heart shaped silver locket the other girl wore that a lovely necklace a birthday present a dreamy smile accompanied the nod from terry he made me breakfast in a faery ring he was beautiful i think your boyfriend really handsome blaise but i dontknow if i d say he was beautiful the dreamy smile widened i meant the breakfast the locket his picture and hair are inside blaise laughed oh who am i kidding you donthave to agree loony but i do think terry is beautiful quit snickering and follow me to the kitchen it got enormous medieval ovens when i wouldntsit on lucius lap one christmas he cornered me and whispered they were used by his ancestors to roast cheeky little girls in thankful the nasty man was in azkaban prison and not slithering around marbled halls looking for cheeky little girls to do vile things to luna followed her friend to the kitchens a house elf had been busy arranging all the ingredients they d need on a massive work table in the centre of the room taking off her jacket she took out her wand seeing the rod blaise looked appalled put that down we re doing things the old fashioned way with our own two hands but your house elf will bake them magically in an instant that not old fashioned fat lot you know people way back when had elves too waving a hand blaise said will you light the candles in the centrepiece for me while i put on some music i ve got to have the atmosphere just right to get a yule groove on watching an orpheus ball spin to engage the projection charm and play what sounded like an icelandic christmas carol luna noticed the small oak branch in the middle of the table it was used as a base to hold three candles red green and white sprigs of holly surrounded the branch the sight made her happy and sad at the same time her mother used to arrange a yule centrepiece too the nostalgic girl watch the wicks ignite with a bittersweet smile blaise noticed and said take that home with you tonight it a good substitute for a yule log and the holly will invite good fortune to visit you do you really believe that no but it nice to follow traditions feel connected with something yule is cool luna agreed and enjoyed making every kind of cookie imaginable by hand even more than she had anticipated she boxed a set for her father and a larger one for ginny family blaise nibbled on a caraway cake while they drank cider and looked proudly at the table loaded down with their handiwork after the girls helped drinky clear and store everything away a new set of items appeared on the table the ingredients were extremely aromatic luna picked up a flagon to sniff and set down before picking up another item and another frankincense pine needles cedar and juniper berries became yule incense while cinnamon clove mandarin popine frankincense and myrrh oils were eventually combined into yule oil once they completed their latest project blaise said rub a little oil on your pressure points tonight luna and you ll have lovely dreams the girls decided to do an experiment and apply a couple of drops to their wrists to see if lovely daydreams would come after the pair giggled madly for a few minutes blaise stared off with a smile that reminded luna of wesley s naughty and nice at the same time she looked at the holly around the oak centrepiece and remembered her mother telling her the story of the holly king and the oak king who battled twice a year to rule the world and win the spring maiden at the winter solstice as the waxing sun overtook the waning sun the oak king representing light and life won the battle against the holly king of death and darkness luna eyes became heavy as her mind drifted off to an ancient time the spring maiden watched the dark king fall and the golden ruler laugh triumphantly as he left the body of his vanquished foe and strode toward the maiden with flowers woven into the long blonde braids on either side of her face as the oak king arms encircled her trembling body she knew the holly king wasnttruly dead but she couldntthink about him now standing so close to the man who made her heart race bright blue eyes burned as they travelled the length of her body and the oak king dimpled smile drew ever closer to the lips that ached to explore his mouth in a passionate kiss luna you okay i dontknow about yours but that daydream of mine was bloody amazing terry and i were floating above the faery ring luna blinking the dazed girl nodded and then shook her head saying i not going to take any of that oil i dontwant those kinds of dreams although she smiled when blaise joked that she was going to bathe in it luna immediately rushed to the stone sink to scrub off any trace of oil that remained her skin the moment ginny awoke yule morning she smiled she was spending the entire day with draco and the thought was so exciting she felt like doing a happy dance so she did right on top of her bed what the girl lacked in agility she made up in enthusiasm snickering she hoped harry was already awake she jumped down with a satisfyingly loud thud and ran across the room to her wardrobe opening its doors made her frown her face twisted unhappily as usual she had nothing to wear she might have clothes suitable for hanging out with brothers or visiting old people in a nursing home but not one single item was trendy new or sexy about to reach for the standard black jumper she noticed a rectangular box on the floor of the wardrobe it definitely hadntbeen there yesterday wondering who in the world ginny lifted the lid inside was a note i hate it when i accidentally buy clothes in the wrong size and colour take them off my hands would you b two items lay wrapped in tissue underneath the note one was a white top made of some stretchy material her mother would term fit for a scarlet woman the other was a soft green v necked poncho with the cutest fringe after running to the loo ginny pulled on denims before slipping the top on brushing her hair she checked herself out in the mirror blaise words from quidditch practice came to her making her say laughingly lookin good weasley you re not wearing that out in public are you ignoring her brother look of wrath while applying eye liner a puff of powder and lip gloss was a challenge but ginny was up to it she lifted the poncho and lowered it carefully before replying i going to luna to do yule things with her today there wontbe a single boy at her house happy o brother who thinks he my keeper ron looked relieved the simple soul she hadntpromised to stay at luna had she she was becoming slytherin and she loved it almost as much as she loved juice she needed to grab some orange juice before she left she was too edgy to eat downstairs ginny poured herself a drink in the kitchen smiling at her father and harry they told her she was looking very pretty well her father said that while harry nodded and smiled in agreement that meant she was bloody gorgeous didntit her mother sang a different tune that a nice poncho ginevra dear i used to wear one myself but i must say mine didnthang off a shoulder and show a top that was thankfully dad cut in your mother right ginny she never wore a proper top under her poncho tube top or nothing isntthat what you used to say love arthur weasley how dare you say such things in front of impressionable children her father wink at his irate wife made his daughter giggle her brother and friend looked horrified hilarious to think mum a wild child the woman was anything but now or was she children didntget plucked from under cabbage leaves no matter what ronnikins might think seven children meant a whole lot of merlin her watering eyes were going to ruin her makeup if she didntyank her mind off its disturbing and disgusting path ginny threw out desperately i hope luna will be cheered up by all the yule things we re going to do today her family sympathy for the motherless girl distracted everyone from her new clothes until right before she picked up a handful of floo powder in preparation to leave forehead creased in suspicious thought ron asked where d you get the new clothes he looked at harry who shook his head wasntme smiling sweetly ginny said before she threw the powder and left from the best mate of your favourite slytherin after a brief stop at luna s she walked out of the fireplace at malfoy manor the appalled expressions of her two favourite hypocrites flashed into her mind again making her smile even more brightly at the boy waiting to pull her into his arms she dropped her bag and returned his kiss running her fingers through that beautiful hair while melting against his muscular body that looked so good in a silky long sleeved grey tee and black jeans breaking his lock on her lips draco stepped back and raised a white blond brow potter didntpay for that outfit did he her dragon was almost as sexy steaming with indignation as he was being steamy ginny laughed no your shopaholic mate did are you complaining chiselled lips looked even more perfect smirking not likely blaise bought me this shirt and new dragon hide boots for yule duly admiring black boots that her brothers would drool over the girl glanced around the library and said interesting decor is the rest of the place like this you mean dark and depressing some of it i ll show you around blaise said to meet for lunch complained we d ruin the cookies with too much sugar or something so i ll give you a tour of the kitchen last slipping an arm around her waist draco led her out of the library she would ve called eerie and evil and into a marbled corridor he gave her a dry amusing spiel on which period or which ancestor or what artist as they went from one beautifully decorated room to the next ginny could tell that sarcasm aside draco loved his home but hated his dark family history he was also incredibly conflicted about his parents she couldntreally relate it was sad to think of despising her mum and dad as much as she loved them trying not to let her pity show on her face she tried to open a door it was locked white teeth that really knew how to nibble flashed that blaise room we ve got wards on the doors to keep unwanted visitors out come try this door he led her to another room further down the corridor she tried the knob the door opened right away inside the room she noticed all the accents from bed linens and hangings to the robe tossed over the back of a chair were black running her hand along the silky counterpane on the bed she turned to find draco quicksilver gaze close to hers startled she took a step back and found her back flat on the mattress with eyes now the colour of rain clouds staring into hers only millimetres away trying to appear nonchalant she asked your room i suppose is that why i was able to open the door the lips she was trying hard not to stare at so obviously hovered tantalizingly out of reach as he smiled that smug slytherin smile that drove her out of her mind in a good way ginny glared her intent to stay like this all day before she d make a move he liked being in control way too much and it wasntgood for him long delicious minutes passed as he pressed himself into her increasingly restive body noticing that draco was supporting his weight with his arms so considerately ginny finally gave herself permission to pull his head down to hers after he rolled away breathing heavily ginny laughed when draco told her his home had too many rooms with beds sofas and flat surfaces they needed to go outside she slid off the bed and held his hand as he led her downstairs to a side door regretfully ginny reminded him that her poncho was more for looks than warmth he pressed a wall panel that slid back to reveal a closet full of coats and jackets of every description mother eddy and blaise all have a collection of outerwear pick something remembering that she was rich in love if not material possessions and envy was wrong ginny picked out a vintage shearling coat wishing she had a western hat to go with it her boyfriend grinned and snagged a matching jacket he pulled down a couple of black hats telling her they were charmed to stay on until taken off placing the smaller one on her head he smiled blaise and i saw a couple of yank tourists in getups like this last year and decided we d look even better dressed in wild west i a thinkin you make a mighty purty lil cowgirl too red thanks grinning over the contrast between his bad yank accent and how good he looked in the rugged coat and hat she followed him out to the stable where he d begun storing his broom he told her he liked to fly in the mornings and tried to sneak out without disturbing anyone he handed her a broom performed disillusionment and warming charms and said giddyup following his lead ginny was amazed at the beauty of the salisbury plain sitting beside draco atop stonehenge watching the tourists she leaned over to whisper in the ear that begged her to breathe into it the people who built this must have been early gryffindors they were so bold he just grinned and shook his head before tipping his hat and suggesting they mosey on back to the corral racing him back was thrilling maybe flying on the count of one instead of three was technically cheating but a slytherin should appreciate that shouldnthe even more thrilling was being pulled off her broom and punished for her trickery with kisses after she won back inside they removed outerwear and strolled into the informal dining room which cosily sat twenty blaise and luna sat on one end of the table while the mothers sat at the other mrs zabini called out blaise darling your other little friend arrived waving a flute of champagne the frizzy haired woman smiled brightly told the girl to call her eddy and went back to perusing a selection of nibbly things on her plate narcissa raised a haughty brow and glass in acknowledgement before turning her attention back to her friend and her liquid lunch the pair walked down to where ginny sat between blaise on the end and draco on her right across the table luna smiled hello ginny we had a nice time making yule things i boxed up loads of cookies for you to take home blaise giggled as she ladled soup from the ornate tureen into bowls and waved to a plate of sandwiches after inviting everyone to help themselves she murmured only nice luna i hurt that oil was absolutely fabulous eyes narrowing luna warned the two dipping their spoons into french onion soup that yule oil of hers should be outlawed if a couple of drops produce indecent daydreams like well i donteven want to imagine what dreams would come from more of it dontlet her push a bottle on you glancing sideways ginny smiled to see draco eyebrows waggle turning to blaise she asked may i have luna bottle too draco watched his best friend and girlfriend snickering together at luna disdain over their interest in lovely dreams and didntknow how his day could get any better he found out after lunch when his mother tried to slink away draco reminded her of their outing she rolled her eyes and muttered oh whatever darling i live to traipse into the forest eddy whined to her daughter what it all about sweetie this unhealthy interest in yule and communing with bloody nature darling do we really need to tramp into the wilderness to ruin our manicures gathering holly and dragging some gods awful rustic log into the house cantwe just have drinky pop them here for us and finish off the beluga and champers the silly woman opened her puppy dog eyes wide and bit her lip as she sidled up to her daughter and looked up entreatingly into her amused face i sorry if it sounds selfish darling but all this ceremony and ritual thingy is so much bloody work sweetie wouldntyou like to go shopping instead like a normal girl said narcissa the steely look she received quickly closed her mouth blaise informed the women this is our celebration and we want to go into the bloody woods cut some bloody holly roll the bloody jul wheel and levitate the bloody yule log back home where we ll have dinner do the bloody lighting ceremony and open gifts is that bloody clear to you eddy lower lip was sticking out in a pout as she nodded narcissa over by the sideboard pouring vodka into a flask said with a sneer as bloody crystal a short while later draco and ginny brought up the rear as blaise and luna blazed ahead in their red and blue coats behind them eddy and cissy stumbled along in their matching leopard print hooded jackets ginny in a black fur trimmed coat that was a twin to blaise red one smiled quizzically up at him do you do this stuff for you or for blaise he smiled back i used to do it for her and because it amusing to watch the mothers stagger through the woods but the last couple of years i ve found i actually like this tradition stuff why just wondered i glad i got to see this side of you i look good from all sides his girlfriend shook her head but she didntdeny it how could she about to kiss ginny in front of anyone who cared to look his head stopped its descent when blaise called we went ahead and gathered the holly but we re not rolling the wheel without you get over here now pulling red by the hand draco explained as they walked toward the little group on a hill overlooking a small pond the sun was said to be the wheel in the sky and jul is the season of the wheel winking he confided we pick out the bits we like best from norse and celtic traditions and wing it really see that wheel of dry wood the girls are steadying we ll set it on fire and let it roll down into the pond like the norse did dontask me why then we ll go get the yule log and bring it home someone always gives us an ash log since it never supposed to be bought and one of the elves whisks it out here for us to find the girls younger and older all looked excited when he prepared to light the wheel as the flames began to engulf the rolling wood eddy and sissy sang the song they called our contribution to your little fun draco smiled at the shock on ginny and luna faces as he and blaise joined in with wheels on fire overall his girlfriend seemed to enjoy the traditions even if she giggled nervously while participating in lighting the yule log after dinner ginny and luna placed greenery around the massive log lying in the lounge fireplace the mothers doused the log with cider and ale griping about the criminal waste of alcohol blaise used a wheat stalk to dust the log with flour finally he took a piece of wood saved from last year ash and lit the yule log luna explained to ginny the meaning behind the ritual celebrating life triumph over death and bringing the sun light into the hearth and home sitting between his two favourite girls on the sofa draco rubbed his hands in anticipation at the sight of yule presents his mother had gone overboard with designer clothing as usual and he thanked her with a kiss on the cheek the birthday girl did the same with her mother idly curious he asked blaise the title of her book from the not so loony girl the curious lore of precious stones it great i can look up rubies curling his lip at the necklace from terry boy draco handed a box to his friend her dark eyes sparkled as she lifted up a pair of delicate ruby earrings in the pigeon blood hue matching the small ruby set into her locket gorgeous a genius and generous too you are truly a god frey the smacking kiss blaise planted on his cheek made him grin ginny quiet question made his smile falter why do you call draco frey before he could think of an answer luna said frey is a norse god the lover god of yule peace and prosperity his twin was freyja the goddess of love and war blessing the matter of fact and edited summary he smiled feeling the same relief he heard in ginny voice oh brother and sister that nice blaise quickly grabbed her present from ginny and exclaimed over the red cap and mittens inside you made these yourself that brilliant draco was surprised when ginny handed him a present it was a handmade black jumper he lifted it up while she said anxiously i not the best but i thought about how good you look in black and i hope you like it standing abruptly he ignored the mothers who said they were toddling off to bed disregarded luna murmur that she would help clear up and meet ginny back in her library sparing a single glance for blaise who winked he dragged his girlfriend out of the room and into the first empty chamber he could find pressing ginny against the closed door draco proceeded to show her he didntjust like it he loved it much later he returned to the lounge and stood in the doorway watching blaise hum while performing a comfort charm on the carpet in front of the hearth sauntering into the room and planting himself down beside her draco nudged her pyjama clad shoulder with his own you sound sentimental been talking to girly locks freyja yes frey i going to spend christmas eve with his family he tried to be happy for her but he felt too sorry for himself at the thought of being stuck all alone with nothing to do but read a bloody book low soft laughter received a glare did she think it was funny blaise waved a flagon in front of him see this i didnttell you before because that would ve ruined the surprise but that hufflepuff sold me two unmemorable potions we ll get drinky to pop over to gerd ginny s with a memory enhancer and you ll floo over and spend the day her father has a fireplace connected to the network in his workshop what do you think about that i think this is the best yule ever and making you my best mate the smartest thing i ever did lying side by side they grinned at each other and then turned their attention to the fire watching it burn and sleeping before it was something the friends did every year although he usually slept on a sofa this year he planned to stay right where he was thinking about her twelfth birthday the one he had thought she had forgotten malfoy laughed abruptly dark eyes smiled although she asked calmly what i just remembered you were the one who came up with the eternal friendship spell he chuckled at the memory of what happened years ago their newly co dependent mothers had arbitrarily decided to throw a joint yule birthday party for their darling babies that year at the malfoy london home blaise had pouted in the library the entire day she d wanted her parents to spend time not money he hadntminded it was more attention for him marcus flint giving him a doll for a yule present sneering to everyone that it was the only girl draco malfoy would ever get close to had thankfully come at the end of the party he had sulked and brooded after that refusing to eat cake or play with anyone eventually he wandered into the darkened library and sat in a chair opposite blaise after he told her what had happened she asked are you that upset because of what he said no it just that i shouldnthave to take shite from flint or anyone else what would you do to get close to one one what a girl i dontknow malfoys dare anything why you offering yes he stared the girl who bloodied parkinson nose for trying to kiss him before break was serious he smirked wanted him like every other female did she he followed blaise upstairs into an empty chamber curtains fluttered on each side of the opened windows a circle of candles illuminated the room walking inside the circle he watched in disbelief as the girl took off her top blaise had obviously known about everything already and done all this because she d known what he d do the girl was more slytherin than he had thought she pointed her wand at him take off your shirt too the situation was bizarre but bloody interesting and he would dare anything blaise explained i not trying to do anything but be your friend if we cast this spell we ll be friends forever do you want that too blaise was a girl but she was smart easy to talk to and her parents were as lousy as his were it would be nice to know someone would always be there for him be a real friend what the hell he would do it draco nodded and took off his shirt they stared at each other as the night breeze made the candles flicker she waved her wand in four directions and said some sort of chant using a letter opener from his father desk to prick her finger she placed it into his mouth reflexively he sucked the blood away she drew blood on one of his fingers and drew the digit between her lips placing her hands on his shoulders blaise said solemnly good or bad brown eyes stared impatiently until he placed his hands on her shoulders and repeated with a roll of his good or bad right or wrong right or wrong flesh and blood flesh nice flesh too ow all right and blood make friends lifelong he liked the way that sounded make friends lifelong a strong gust of wind blew into the room and extinguished the candles after a long moment of utter darkness the candles relit it was creepy and very cool he grinned knowing he was going to enjoy having blaise as a lifelong friend when their mothers had staggered into the room edina accepted his playing healer excuse with drunken concern his mother had sneered at the girl dragging on her top receiving a formidable glare in return following her mother downstairs blaise had tersely said see you before telling her mother to hang on damn it and guiding their broomstick the short distance home eddy had been ranting about performing a memory charm the moment they got back all this time he had thought her mother had erased the memory and she let him think it his best mate was a very smart girl his smile widened at something never considered that chant and the rhyming thing you made up for us to say was bloody damn good for a twelve year old big serious eyes looked straight into his i didntmake it up i found it in an old book hidden inside another text in your father library but that means the wind and the candles and the spell really yeah are you okay with that he stared realising how much their friendship meant and how glad he was that it would last forever yeah blaise rested her head against his chest while he stroked his fingers through her curls he stared into the flames and thought about how bizarre weird and very cool life was suddenly he chuckled draco felt and heard her smile what i think this better be another one of our take it to the grave secrets dontthink terry boy would appreciate it like i do ginny either oh yeah yeah as the yule log burned the friends drifted off to sleep a n the fab four were very active this chap and i had to have my abfab ish mums and put the title to the theme song in too i hope you enjoyed all the yule birthday celebrations next chap is christmas eve so brace yourself bridget for an even longer chapter i do lurve me some fred and george and ron and harry and terry and oh my draco really outdoes himself lol remember it the christmas season people or that i a very needy person all you reading at another time of year and give the gift of a review chapter 23 new year eve outside arthur weasley workshop light snow began to fall inside two girls stared at each other and at the polyjuice maximus flagons in their hands blaise asked do you really think i can pull this off of course remember what happened before people see what they expect to see it only for four hours i ll meet you back here right after midnight and you can go see terry ginny took a deep breath this means a lot to me i dontknow how to she smiled a little anyway what should i wear relieved that gushy sentiment remained unspoken blaise grinned anything you want that part of the fun mi casa es su casa and all that just what now it was blaise turn to take a deep breath wait until after midnight to kiss draco okay we re friends and i dontwant any weird he kissed me vibes our love god already promised that the only reason terry is okay with this so i asking for your promise too ginny smiled a little i wouldntwant you kissing anyone with my lips either so sure i promise to be good although it going to be hard the girls giggled then grimaced together as they unstoppered the flagons and each added the other hair recklessly blaise chugged the disgusting sour smelling liquid she bent over upon feeling the gut wrenching shifting sensation panting she straightened and looked up into her face big dark eyes and full red lips grinned wickedly at her she was even more gorgeous than she had thought no wonder terry couldntresist her a swathe of fiery tresses fell over her shoulder blaise raised a hand and brushed it away then laughed and started running her fingers through it before tossing her hair oh my gods you ve got the coolest hair smirking ginny drawled play with it all you like but if you cut it you die tilting her head from side to side so she could feel her hair swish and bounce blaise did a little happy dance and then stopped and looked at ginny in horror where d my natural rhythm go it like i fighting stiff white girl impulses when i try to move my body her double did a stretch shake motion and grinned look at me i a slytherin sex goddess the girl now looking gryffindor smiled at the slytherin who seemed as thrilled to be able to wind down shake and work her back as she d been to play with long girly hair reminding ginny to call enrique papa or father and her mother eddy and not to strew clothes on the floor because the house elves expected her to be tidy blaise wished her friend luck and watched her floo to the zabini london home blaise didntenvy ginny for getting to attend a posh new year party she d rather spend a few hours pretending to be a normal girl with a normal family temporarily pale pink lips curved as blaise left the workshop and headed toward the house the continued awkwardness was bothersome looking down at her shorter but attractive new form clad in a black turtleneck a cashmere one bought yesterday since the thought of polyester blend gave her the shudders she wondered if ginny felt self conscious about being curvy she would have to work on that blaise swayed side to side and smiled when she felt her body begin to loosen what are you doing ginny shite ron was staring at her from the back door with a scowl on his face and she couldntsmile suggestively smirk or wink at him how in the world was she supposed to react blaise closed her eyes briefly while saying to herself you re a good gryffindor girl who loves her brother even though he a git what do you say she opened her eyes nothing oh the freckled brow creased in consternation i thought you were trying to dance like zabini or something i hope you dontstart acting like her giving blokes ideas blaise said innocently as she could what kind of ideas his face reddened she smiled they were naughty ideas eh aw mr freckles thought she was sexy how sweet feeling charitable blaise let the topic go and went inside although she couldntprevent herself from ruffling his hair when she passed by ron laughed so the teasing must have been something he was used to from his sister in the kitchen molly weasley bustled about preparing dinner seeing her daughter the woman smiled give us a hand luv sure tell me what to do now ron and his mother were staring did ginny usually not help luckily the lanky gryffindor joked must be a new year resolution mum yes and it might only last until tomorrow so make the most of it her cheeky retort seemed to put the pair at ease it took less effort than blaise would ve thought to return ron affectionate smile she watched him leave the room before turning to molly do you want me to conjure anything oh no dear no that quite all right if you could just set the table that d be marvellous thankful the weasleys had open shelving blaise did as she was asked the wizard hats she made out of the serviettes got a strange look as did her quick centrepiece made from a bowl of apples surrounded by greenery the radish rosettes she garnished the salad with and the candles she arranged and lit to softly illuminate the long table but otherwise her mother was pleased with her help at least she thought the faint th thank you d dear meant the woman was pleased mr weasley came in carrying a bottle of champagne he stopped and stared at the table before raising a red brow all this fuss just for family nobody more special than you dad where that had come from blaise didntknow must be some sort of residual ginny ness that came with the body the head of the weasley family smiled brightly and kissed her cheek so he must have liked it the rest of the clan and potter filed in giving the decorated table no more than brief amused glances she sat between ron and potty no harry must remember to call wonder boy harry the serving bowls floated down the table and blaise gazed curiously at each homey dish before taking a spoonful fred and george sat across from her and slanted a look towards each other is ginny top cashmere fred i do believe it is george baby sister getting expensive tastes from her posh friend interestingly raising a weasley red eyebrow felt just as natural as arching a zabini black one curving her deceptively sweet lips blaise said do you boys really want to talk about profiting from a connection to zabini jewellers her knowing look stopped the twosome in their tracks they retreated gracefully i just meant you looked lovely darling sister yeah me too fred posh looks good on her well rich doesntmean happy the most attractive brother had spoken of course blaise might have been a bit prejudiced since bill reminded her of terry he continued we had a surveillance update meeting and the operative doing random checks on enrique zabini says he chose a union dispute at a goblin mine over spending christmas with his family so dontenvy your friend ginny she doesnthave anything money cantbuy deciding that bill appeal was overrated and she wished she hadntallowed her fingers to play with his pony tail when he passed by earlier blaise stared down at her plate and pushed a bite of yorkshire pudding around with her fork charlie the brother who did something with dragons in romania said smilingly if she has good friends like you baby sister she got a lot happy that she d stroked that one hair the girl he thought was his sister smiled back she did have good friends and even if her parents werentwonderful weasleys they were her parents damn it and she was rather fond of them and things money could buy thank you very much stacking dirty dishes in the sink for ron to clean she avoided his probing stare why are you helping me another resolution no it the full moon ron glanced uneasily at the window if he went outside to check the moon blaise was going to lose it finally he smiled uncertainly before narrowing his eyes and grinning evilly she almost hexed his arse when he grabbed her and put her in bizarre hold where his arm wrapped around with the forearm under her chin held her back against his chest only the thought that perhaps this was some strange sibling ritual kept her from stinging ronnie boy the calloused fingers she had refused to remember started tickling her sides weasleys were extremely ticklish she started shrieking with laughter and squirming what going on is she going to wet her pants like she used to fred and george avid questions caused her tormentor to loosen his grip allowing her to dart away to safety entering the lounge she saw that harry and charlie were playing wizard chess blaise thought the game was a bore although she had memorised several famous wizard strategies to use when draco wanted a match she d always gotten more amusement from his facial expressions than the yawn inspiring game blaise observed potter closely for a few moments trying to figure out what her pal luna found so bloody attractive about the boy the hair was hopeless the glasses geeky the scar that was cool and the eyes now staring at her were really really green maybe the intense eyes did it giving harry a weak smile she went to sit beside her father on the sofa the last thing she wanted to do was encourage potter attentions to ginny the boys want to play skittles so i off to fetch the one i repaired from my workshop sweetheart would you care to give your old dad some company mr weasley was the nicest man it was fun to pretend to be his daughter she nodded and grabbed a cloak off the peg by the back door thank you dear crap she had taken his cloak handing it over and noticing one that looked a bit shorter than the others blaise snatched it and smiled when the cheerful father opened the door without comment and gestured for her to precede him outside when he mentioned how pleased her mother was that she d made the effort to help tonight she felt all warm and fuzzy inside it was awkward and brilliant at the same time on a bench in the workshop arthur picked up a skittle that he d repaired chuckling and telling her the story of the twins cheating with a iron disc charmed to look like the cheese and how it had broken the skittle in half smiling she agreed that he should do a counter charm on every wheel of cheese from now on all the while wondering why someone would throw cheese at little wooden pins after they d returned to the house everyone but mrs weasley went down to the basement where a long alley was set up with skittle pins standing in a formation at the end reflexively blaise took the pin from mr weasley and headed down to replace it the boys cheered hurrah ginny volunteers to be sticker apparently the sticker was the person who stands at the end of the alley and sets the nine pins back up and returned the cheese to the person who hurled it she could do that the game was interesting and the terminology humorous the cheese was shaped like a wheel of one but made of some tropical hardwood the positions of the pins left after a throw were described by names like london bridge gates of hell and the big bog blaise got a kick out of calling feet when she rolled the cheese back to the thrower a bit too hard and it jumped out the alley and headed toward a bystander after she had accidentally done it a dozen times knocked over three beers a bowl of crisps and whacked potter shins twice the boys threatened her with bodily harm watching harry throw a cheese which passed through all the pins without knocking any over blaise cheerfully shouted bollocks with the rest before stating that her indentured servitude was over and she was escaping to go help mum jeers from the men followed her upstairs in the kitchen molly was setting an array of desserts out on the table an orpheus orb played a song that never in a million years would blaise have figured a weasley favourite smiling as she watched the well rounded woman sway to dancing queen the girl moved into the kitchen and started dancing by her mother molly watched her movements i remember that together they side stepped cross stepped side stepped touched one foot to the other and clapped side by side they moved back and forth several times before dancing free form around the kitchen laughing and impressed with the older woman moves blaise was doing the bump with molly when the boys trooped into the room six male jaws dropped in shock the slytherin in gryffindor skin admired the mother composure as she acted as though they d been merely having a chat saying briskly come along and have dessert midnight only a half hour away instead of taking her bowl of trifle into the lounge with the others blaise ate a bite set the dish down and wandered upstairs to find ginny room she looked through the other girl wardrobe and frowned she in here george the twins entered the room fred leaned against the shut door and questioned with narrowed eyes who are you and what have you done with our sister blaise stared in shock in the name of merlin how did they know she looked into the mirror the potion hadntworn off no brown curls were peeking through red tresses or anything george put his bright head close to hers making the table pretty helping out being nice sticking and dancing with mum to music you always complain about confess aliens put a pod in the room last night and when ginny went to sleep you replaced her pod sister oh my gods this was awful about to babble all she noticed the boys shoulders were shaking with repressed mirth they d been having her on too relieved to be angry blaise gently pushed her brother s hair out of his eyes and drawled you re so clever george i hope you dontgo to sleep tonight because i d miss you if a fellow pod took your place the brief look of alarm in his eyes made her giggle fred burst into delighted laughter you should ve seen your face brother afraid of pods now are you i told you not to read that body snatcher book his sister raised a red eyebrow and said ominously dontlaugh fred my people have their eye on you too for experiments her brother was incorrigible his face lit up crikey d you think they d be sexual ones with beautiful alien girls she pulled fred hair and then smoothed it back she couldnthelp it the lure of weasley hair was irresistible over the last hours every family member bright strands had passed through her fingers ginny and bill locks were the silkiest and the parents charlie and the twins strands very nice too but mr freckles hair had the most interesting texture following the boys back down into the lounge she noticed ron sitting in a chair frowning and rubbing his forehead blaise asked headache he nodded she smiled and leaned over the back of the chair massaging his scalp in the way drinky had once showed her relieved tension she felt a bit pervy for enjoying the feel of his hair so much especially when he began moaning how good it felt but blaise rationalised that it was a sister duty and happily delved her fingers back into that incredible red hair at midnight the twins lit off fireworks and the family all kissed each other blaise enjoyed all the affection until potter stood looking at her with an alarming gleam in his eye panicking she decided to head the boy off and quickly gave him a closed mouth peck on the lips said happy new year harry and bolted toward the workshop scrubbing her lips with the back of her hand blaise ranted inwardly oh my gods first creevey then weasley and now i ve kissed harry bloody potter damned gryffindors who next longbottom aaahhh must go snog terry and forget trauma ever happened the potion had worn off for quite a few minutes by the time ginny arrived back trading clothes blaise complimented the other girl on her choice of dress and then stared at the necklace around her neck pale fingers removed the gold torque set with teardrops of amber and gave it back to its owner i hope you dontmind my borrowing your christmas present from draco soft brown eyes filled with nothing but starry memories reassured darker ones that ginny saw the necklace as only that a necklace lips curving in relief blaise waved it off and told her friend a few highlights of the evening red laughed at the pod sister episode and snickered at the potter peck she said the party was amazing the slytherin and gryffindor stared at each other for a moment in silence after blaise grabbed floo powder rolling her eyes ginny moved forward and hugged the other girl blaise returned it said yeah happy new year to you too and left smiling all day long on new year eve a song called anticipation kept running through ginny head her mum had been spinning an orb while making breakfast and the words of that song were haunting looking into her mirror that afternoon as she straightened up her room because mum always insisted the family start the new year with a clean and neat home not that it lasted long ginny sang i was thinking about how right tonight might be merlin toenails fred i think there a dying weasel in our sister room i hear it yowling in agony you re right george there nothing to do but find it and put it out of its misery really a mercy killing is the kindest thing now the door burst open and the twins rushed in they looked around for the dying animal before grinning like the loons they were sneering at them ginny tossed her red hair and a hairbrush which hit fred shoulder he cried ow i telling mum you hit me go ahead i ll tell her how you crushed my tender feelings and you ll be peeling potatoes the muggle way the three grinned at each other this old routine only varied in what was dying what was thrown and what was threatened traipsing downstairs after the boys she was halted on the steps by harry calling down ginny can i talk to you for a moment she didntknow could he sighing ginny trudged up to ron floor and sat on her brother bed while harry stood by the window the boy who never heard of a hair styling charm ran a hand over his unruly hair but it stuck out in all directions as usual it was hard to believe she had once found his nervous habit adorable now it was irritating how he could face down the dark lord but still be unable to look a girl in the eye was a mystery she didntcare to solve she d gladly leave it to luna if the other girl still wanted to take the time and effort lately the gryffindor had noticed a ravenclaw boy circling around the otherworldly blonde ginny herself would take a definite over a maybe any day who knew what luna would do although if her friend asked her opinion ginny emerald green eyes were gazing intently at her why was that so alarming she tried to look attentive tilted her head slightly and widened her eyes a bit the boy remained silent although his brow lined so much she could practically see the wheels turning in his mind had ron got that habit from him or had her brother rubbed off on his friend either way it was rather sad hanging round people who were quick witted and liked banter just as much as she did had spoilt her made her other friends seem slow and dull by comparison encouragingly she asked yes harry uh ginny i er wondered may i ask you something her stomach felt like she d fallen off her broomstick again with no draco to catch her harry was blushing slightly and his hand was doing that nervous futile grooming thing again oh shite oh no no no dontask dontask what why did i ask i dontwant to know how do you know if you like someone i mean really like someone that wasntso bad he just wanted a girl with actual boy girl experience to give him her opinion right she thought about draco and answered they make you happy and you want to make them happy you cantkeep your hands off them but if you could only look into their eyes and see them smile at you it would be enough does that help harry shook his head what about friendship if you like someone as a friend wouldntyou like them as a girlfriend no trying to smile ginny was aware it looked more like a grimace now she knew why harry wanted to talk he was trying to convince himself that he could make a girlfriend out of a friend well if the friend was her no he couldn t he stepped toward her she wanted to make a break for the door but forced herself to stay put if your friend doesntmake your heart beat faster harry it wontwork you cantjust like someone personality there has to be chemistry and you cantforce it really you cant what if you dontknow if they d make your heart beat faster because you ve never kissed them dontyou think you should kiss them like this frozen in place ginny brain shrieked at her to turn her head faint vomit something but she just sat and watched harry face come closer as he sat beside her on the bed turned her face to his and kissed her maybe the girl she d once been lived on in some corner of her mind and demanded she prove to the former potter groupie that kissing harry wasntthe most exciting thing she d ever felt if so then allowing his lips to touch and move tentatively against hers should kill or at least shut the little annoyance up forever because it wasntexciting and her heart didntrace she felt detached noticing that his lips were nice but not draco s his hands resting on her shoulders didntmake fire streak through her veins or make her to want to push him down and snog him until they both gasped for breath in fact she was starting to feel trapped suffocated her eyes never closed his opened and stared into hers harry lips twitched his shoulders started to shake suddenly he threw himself back on the bed and covered his face she felt horrible her passive rejection had crushed him what could she say harry are are you all right the hands lowered he was laughing harry loosed the mirth he d been repressing in gales of amusement she couldnthelp but smile although she was a bit miffed draco would ve been upset if she didntrespond but perhaps that was the whole point harry was gasping through his chuckles that was almost as bad as kissing cho kissing cho chang was bad green eyes looked wryly into hers yeah she was crying the whole time it was wet and gross i kept thinking about her nose running and it really ruined the mood my heart was racing before the kiss and hardly at all during or after it i guess i should ve known right then that we werentgoing to get together yeah ron entered the room what going on ginny felt sorry for her brother who looked hopefully from his sister to his friend he was always trying to set them up keep harry in the family she guessed her brother would have to be satisfied with friendship because no way was his best mate becoming the boy who married a weasley standing she said i hope our chat helped harry good luck ginny walked out the door hearing her friend who she was relieved would no longer try to be otherwise say thanks i ll remember and i hope you take your own advice smirking she answered over her shoulder dontyou worry about me harry i may have problems but that not one of them later ginny immediate problem was trying to force down polyjuice maximus the glop looked and smelled nasty blaise gave her a mocking look and hastily downed the stuff not about to let anyone claim to be bolder than a gryffindor ginny drank hers too the liquid seemed to run through her veins twisting her insides and melting her body before reshaping her form into something taller leaner and incredibly different opening her eyes ginny looked at her hands they were elegantly slender and honey coloured instead of pale and slightly freckled looking up she stared at herself she had even more freckles than she d thought no way did draco give her a kiss for each one she was going to demand he give her the rest as soon as possible blaise was having a good time playing with her hair she could knock herself out as long as she didntcut it experimenting with her own new body ginny did a move that she d seen the slytherin girls doing on the steps before blaise had given harry a v not for victory oh my gods she could do it she was able to wind up and down like a snake and shake things she d never even thought of trying before the other girl wasntso lucky ha ha welcome to my white world zabini this was fun maybe she d ask for a few dance lessons when they got back to school the gryffindor looking slytherin was glaring at her ginny was amused did she really look that intimidating no wonder some of the boys she d dated didntlast too long they werentman enough for her thinking about the teen who was man enough put a smile on her face through zabini call my dad papa and my mum eddy speech smiling cheekily she watched soft brown eyes flash quite strikingly before she threw the floo powder and left stepping out of the zabini library fireplace ginny met the deep dark eyes of the man sitting behind a massive desk she knew at once that this was blaise father enrique zabini he had short black curls that should have softened his image but didn t zabini daughter got her striking good looks from him he didntlook like a dad he looked like a latin lover his intense features reminded her of a quote yond cassius has a lean and hungry look he thinks too much such men are dangerous mr zabini looked like he could plunge a dagger into caesar just as easily as he could make deals and keep a family empire expanding the man took a drag on a thin cheroot and blew out the smoke did you enjoy visiting your friend yes papa a wide grin split the man face making it appear boyish and sexy ginny felt pervy for noticing the way a friend father looked reluctantly the man fake daughter moved to his side and allowed him to take her hands after he d put his cheroot in a crystal dish you call me papa so all is forgiven now eh my little girl realises that her father has to build the company even at christmas so he can leave her something worthy of the zabini name no more silent treatment for your papa si the uncomfortable gryffindor in slytherin skin nodded and kissed his cheeks after he had brought her face down and saluted hers she was thankful that blaise mother entered before she had to do something awful like sit on the man lap that cologne of his should be illegal ginny wondered where she could get some for draco enrique sweetie darling i awoke and you were gone i missed you you always know where to find me edina yes working bloody boring working cantyou let it go for one bloody damn day darling why do you persist in using foul language in front of our child woman do you want me to give you a better use for that mouth of yours staring in shock as mr zabini strode over to kiss his wife in a way no child should be subjected to seeing ginny sidled around the couple it was rather horrifyingly fascinating this display of raw parental affection ginny eyes closed in denial at the thought that her parents might ever act like this even behind closed doors no they didn t no no no no no run along and change sweetie darling draco and cissy will be here in an hour do wear something fab sweetheart marina new year eve parties are always packed with photographers taking photos outside we want to make sure we get into the papers turning back to her husband eddy murmured why dontyou come upstairs too mi amor not wanting to hear the answer ginny ran upstairs and counted the doors on the right one two open the third and went into her room it was unlike the rest of the contemporarily furnished home the large space looked like it belonged in a castle in spain with all the heavily carved furniture tapestries and heavy bed hangings the dressing room was a room that contained two walls of clothes and a long dressing table covered with more perfume and makeup than a shop counter picking up scents to sniff ginny curiously opened drawers to find a collection of shells a jumbled mess of what looked like antique not costume jewellery and a photograph album sitting on the stool in front of the mirror in the middle of the dressing table her reflection waggled its eyebrows to encourage her snooping she opened the album and smiled blaise had been a cute baby loads of pictures were taken during her first five years and then photographs got fewer and fewer until they abruptly became more numerous when a blond boy began appearing with his dark haired friend one photograph with 12th birthday printed on the scrapbook underneath showed blaise pouting and draco scowling before the girl sneered at the cake and left the picture the next holiday shots showed children playing on a beach occasionally the zabini family would be photographed together mostly the pictures were of blaise and draco doing holiday activities skating building snowmen opening gifts swimming playing games and all the other things children did on holidays abruptly ginny shut the album knowing it wasntnice to envy all the memories blaise and draco shared but she did a single photograph fluttered from between the pages of the book and drifted down to the floor picking it up she looked at the picture it showed three girls sitting at a library table colin had taken that picture luna was smiling enigmatically on either side of the blonde ginny and blaise were smirking at each other before grinning at the camera on the back was written my ravenclaw and gryffindor friends thank merlin they re not hufflepuffs placing the photo back before returning the scrapbook to the drawer the temporary brunette smiled at her sultry reflection in the mirror as she undressed dress after dress was considered for the party blaise had an obscene amount of clothing how was she supposed to decide finally an ethereal black chiffon gown caught her eye strapless it was fitted to the hips before falling to the floor the skirt had a slit in the front that was almost indecent ginny loved it a house elf appeared and helped her into undergarments that barely covered anything and the dress in a blink of an eye her makeup far more dramatic than anything she d ever worn before was applied sliding her feet into shoes so adorable she knew they were outrageously expensive ginny moved to the jewellery armoire to find a necklace and earrings to wear in the bottom drawer she found amber and gold earrings and a celtic or norse looking gold necklace set with four teardrops of amber lifting the collar she noticed engraved writing on the inside to freyja brisingamen without the dwarves love frey the jewellery looked perfect with the dress picking up an evening cape she headed downstairs to see if draco had arrived she wanted to hear what he had to say about the necklace ginny didntreally think anything of it they were best mates they called each other pet names like the twin gods of course they loved each other like friends still she wondered what the slytherin norse love god reaction would be and she was about to find out waiting with the parents in the foyer draco stood quietly hands resting with studied casualness at the sides of his tuxedo he tried not to fidget under mr zabini narrowed gaze the man who had greeted the malfoys with an offhand offer of a drink had been not so subtly probing the boy about his interests marks at school and future ambitions thankfully he d just run out of questions obviously eddy had tattled about the fire festival kissing she d witnessed and the over protective father was trying to sort draco out determine if he was suitable draco had answered each question calmly and as honestly as he thought the other man able to handle both males glanced up as blaise sauntered down the staircase it was incredibly weird to know that his girlfriend personality inhabited his best friend body only a close examination allowed draco to see the difference his friend would have openly admired his dashing good looks called him gorgeous kissed his cheek and carefully smoothed his hair before raising her eyebrows in a silent demand that he return the compliments ginny as blaise stared at him as if she wanted to drag him away and snog until her lipstick was gone and hers was the kind that couldntbe kissed off mr zabini frowned at him before smiling indulgently at his daughter you look wonderful doesntshe edina the frizzy haired woman and narcissa were sipping champagne and complimenting each other on their elaborate gowns eddy was in white and cissy in black the gala was a black and white ball so they were happy to have both ends of the fashion spectrum covered starting in surprise at her husband words mrs zabini glanced up for a cursory look and said yes yes if a tad plain look at my sequins darling and cissy beaded extravaganza wouldntyou have liked something with a bit more glam sweetie i fine mum the women gasped in horror eddy tottered back and quaffed a glass of champagne before pouring another drinking it down like medicine and saying faintly mum you called me mum do you think i look old darling is that why you called me that horrid bourgeois hag name dearest mr zabini stalked over to give his wife a kiss that frankly draco was glad to be forced to witness now his urges were effectively doused for the evening after the man had murmured nauseating latin lover type phrases in spanish and italian he chided it was a slip quierda blaise calls me papa remember carina forget it and let us go enjoy the evening my love averting his gaze from the sight of enrique kissing his way up his wife gloved arm draco looked at ginny she mirrored his moue of distaste he met her at the bottom of the stairs offered his arm and whispered still glad you came smiling wickedly his girl in friend skin lowered her voice to say i am now i ll be even gladder when this potion wears off and i can show you how happy i am to be with you without words funny how wicked smiles looked the same with either girl spirit looking out the eyes not so funny was the way his stomach lurched when he saw the necklace she was wearing controlling his expression draco smiled and remarked casually as though he didntsuspect his girlfriend had already read the message on the back of the reproduction of a norse noblewoman torque i gave that to blaise for christmas what does the inscription mean he told the truth myth says freyja got the necklace from four dwarves who only wanted her to thank them personally in payment all four at once ginny looked shocked and amused he smirked one each night for four nights but still without the dwarves is so much better she laughed draco escorted ginny outside grateful that the subject was closed there was no way that he would admit the four amber drops were a private thank you for the nights he and blaise had innocently spent together it would sound hufflepuff and pathetic some things friends just had to take to their graves the party was being held across the square so the families strolled over outside several photographers were taking pictures of the arrivals and one asked for a group shot of the zabini malfoys eddy and sissy were all aflutter over the thought of being in the paper draco and the girl everyone thought was blaise stood in the middle between the zabini parents and his mother the boy slipped his arm around his girl waist and grinned when she returned the favour he was glad that she had such a good sense of humour about the whole thing their eyes met and held whatever form she took draco thought he would be able to recognise ginny just by the way she looked at him with such love did she love him inside an elf took their outerwear and the party moved toward the ballroom just inside their host and hostess were greeting guests marina in her simple white gown made the women she kissed cheeks with look like gilded lilies the satisfied smirks eddy and cissy gave each other said they thought the siren looked frumpy mr zabini spotted a friend and excused himself to head toward the bar the mothers grabbed drinks off a passing tray and stood by a column drinking and happily deriding every other woman dress sometimes right after they had exchanged greeting with them draco told the women he and blaise were going to find some food and escaped awful arentthey ginny said they re unique i ll give them that chuckling draco took her hand and led her to the dining room transformed into a buffet with numerous small tables and chairs scattered around the room the teens filled plates and sat together at a tiny table for two after he adjusted to the sight and sound of blaise body projecting ginny personality and expressions he relaxed and treated the evening like a date it was an unusual even bizarre date but still a date they wandered from the dining room to the lounge where draco played heart and soul on the piano after she applauded he made ginny laugh by admitting he couldntplay any others they drifted back into the ballroom where his date floated in his arms as they circled the floor draco smiled when ginny sighed over the enchanted ceiling as she watched stars fall and comets blaze across the night sky and the man in the moon wave at the dancers below the music changed some of the dancers started to tango he pulled ginny close slid his hand around to her lower back and in tango position moved forward with her following his movements on every beat their feet barely left the floor as they glided effortlessly his partner smiled impishly and pressed against him only his promise not to kiss ginny while she had blaise s lips kept her safe from retaliation looking away to cool down he saw another couple who were just heating up as the song ended with let face the music and dance a woman in a black evening gown with a plunging halter was kissing a man who looked vaguely familiar draco stood still and ginny followed his gaze to the couple who should be damned glad the room was romantically dimmed oh my gods that professor lorelei who she with as if in answer the pair unlocked lips lorelei saw them and gasped the man turned draco didntrecognise his face but the piercing stare and curled lip were well known when the man raised a dark eyebrow before smirking and pulling his date close for a slow dance and the woman grinned and winked he said snape no why would he come here disguised raising his pale brow in a sardonic way answered her question they werentthe only couple who were seeing each other secretly she giggled and looped her arms around his neck resting her head against his shoulder as they danced another young couple caught her attention oh no that girl the one in the short black dress that one of my roommates rosaline wells he glanced over at the blonde who was currently interested in nothing but her date you mean ginny roommate blaise full red lips smiled in relief that right she ll never know which is good because i donttrust her rosaline always listening to people conversations and i saw her cheat once on a history of magic test i didnttell on her but i didntforget it either maybe she should ve been a slytherin ginny laughed and they forgot about the other girl as the new year approached they stood in a dark corner of the gallery outside the ballroom and watched fairy fireworks light the enchanted sky inside the house no one was around so draco felt free to say ginny in the darkness he only saw a flash of white as she smiled he said softly i love your smile he felt dark eyes searching his face her tone mirrored his i love your smile too the pause between her words propelled him to say do you love anything else about me he heard her catch her breath yes everything his breath caught too draco whispered i love you ginny i love you too he wanted to kiss her but he couldn t he d promised do you want to kiss me no one would see when you looked like colin i wanted to kiss you because you were draco inside where it matters the moment his lips touched hers he knew he shouldnthave done it ginny mouth felt different tasted different and he should ve waited for the clock to finish striking dragged her back to the zabini home and kissed her there when she moved against him however and his hands slipped into the front slit of her skirt and moved around to the back draco rationalised that it was really ginny arse and only the girl he loved would know or care the kiss turned passionate as enchanted streamers and confetti showered around them cries of happy new year filled the air dragging his lips away he said roughly let get out of here she nodded took his hand and followed him inside magical fireworks illumined another couple in their path it was that rosaline and her date the petite girl with the blue eyes and cool arrogance of a feline smiled in a way that made him uneasy but maybe she was just giving him the eye merlin knew girls had come on to him with a date in tow before with a curt happy new year draco brushed past her and rushed ginny across the ballroom out to the entry where an elf brought his cloak and her wrap and back across the square to the zabini house in the library he waited for the potion to wear off before taking her into his arms again he sighed as her lips met his and the embrace felt right and good and filled him with that indescribable feeling he knew was love all is prepared miss is there anything else you is wishing minky to do luna smiled at the house elf attired in a tea towel trimmed in fur when she d told blaise about her father wanting to open their home for a staff new year eve party as they had done when her mother was still with them the other girl had insisted minky be allowed to assist caterers are all well and good but an elf can decorate intimidate the staff into doing their best and make sure everything runs smoothly in a way mere humans could never dream of dontargue minky will be happy to pop over and help we ve frustrated her by not having our own bash and you ll prevent her sulking and getting into the butterbeer really you re doing us a favour blaise zabini was a force of nature that luna knew better than to try to fight her family on her mother side claimed the motto flecti non frangi may we bend but not break luna lived it the house was now decorated in faery lights silver and gold balloons streamers and white floral arrangements that gave an elegantly festive air to every room in the place the dining room had been turned into a buffet and the long music room across from the lounge transformed into a small ballroom excuse me miss but my mistress asked me to help you dress you is ready sighing as once again she bent before the gale force winds of blaise wishes luna showed the elf her room and stared as minky held up a dress that she had seen once before on the shopping trip with the slytherin girl who seemed to be unable to resist buying other people clothes luna had admired the bias silk slip dress in the same shade of blue as her eyes but had been told it wasnta girls night out dress it was a get slinky for a boy dress apparently blaise had changed her mind because there werentgoing to be any boys at this party it was adults only luna was only making an appearance every now and then to check that caterers kept the food and drink coming and to reassure her father that the barbarians invading his castle would leave eventually she fully intended to spend most of the night finally getting around to reading her snorkacks in the mist book blinking luna realised that minky had instantly applied makeup and arranged her hair thanking the elf who smiled with alarmingly large teeth before leaving luna stared into her mirror and wondered what exactly about her appearance troubled her so the makeup was light even though she personally wouldnthave used blush or shadow that sparkled on her eyelids her hair was loose except for the two thin braids that framed her face frowning luna reached to pull a braid loose her father poked his head in the door for merlin sake come down and help me greet these people sweetheart i gettin hives just thinking about trying to make nice to people i ve never had to be nice to before smiling at the man tugging at his tuxedo tie his daughter left her hair alone and went downstairs to smooth over daddy abrupt welcomes it wasnthis forte and larry you came great and a pleasure oh yeah sure go on in and get drunk i mean a drink style of greeting made some people uncomfortable after an hour of smiling and shaking hands luna was taken aback to see mr roberts entering with his son instead of his wife wesley looked way too good in a black evening suit with a shirt as white as his smile and no tie the golden streamer floating past was the exact shade as his hair blue eyes glinted impishly hello luna i volunteered to escort dad and make sure he doesntdance on a table or sing you ve lost that loving feeling dimples as engaging as his son flashed as the elder robert protested once it only happened once and forever after this is the way i treated her father laughed and admitted he had sung the song once or twice too pale and bright blue eyes met in shared amusement wesley winked as he followed his father into the lounge lunatic larry looked at the door and said i think that it for the leeches i mean guests darlin anybody else who drags their arse uh arrives later can show their damn er darn selves in let go get a drink and no alcohol for you missy damn i mean darn chuckling with her father luna didntnotice the boy in her path until she walked into him his hands felt warm on her bare shoulders as he steadied her with a smile that made luna heart race in a way that surely had to be unhealthy care to give me a tour what are you doing here a golden brow rose do you always start conversations this way at her negative headshake his lips curved temptingly her own lips tingled no they did nothing of the sort or the tingling was from the lipstick she must be allergic luna tried not to look at wesley mouth or into his eyes as he spoke again in the droll tone that made her smile i myself am often surprised at life little quirks i suppose i could ve gone out with some mates and got pissed but instead my mum got a cold and i decided that hanging out with you sounded a whole lot more fun than getting drunk and disorderly why had she looked into his eyes the little voice in the back of her mind that had said here a boy to go with your dress when she d first seen wesley was now trying to get her to ask him to define fun luna felt pervy for even considering having him demonstrate it so she told her inner tart to shut up luna decided to treat him just like any other friend and agreeably gave a tour around the house impulsively she showed him the secret stairway that led to a series of spy holes wesley peered through the eyes of a painting and looked down at the people in the lounge with such glee that she asked are you a peeping tom the golden haired boy kept his eyes fixed on the crowd below but his voice trembled with laughter that hardly complimentary it possible to enjoy spying on people without being a pervert anyway i not the one whose house has spy holes are you a peeping tomasina no but intrigued blue eyes gazed into hers go on tell me what hideous sin have you committed lately she shook her head his dimples deepened you re just stalling now unable to help herself luna grinned it wasntlately but i did use to peek at my parents dinner guests i hold you in the highest respect did you ever see anything good if you mean naughty then yes i did but i not telling so dontask he pretended to pout that does put a damper on our relationship very well if you wontentertain a guest i ll just have to find a way to entertain myself luna heart stopped for a moment as his eyes lowered to her mouth seeing the look on her face wesley grinned and returned to gazing at the guests merlin they re drinking like fish down there we should come back in a few hours i bet we d see a lot of naughty goings on then his tone sharpened bollocks that prat humperdink here my father loathes him he in accounting and always harping over exorbitant business lunches i told him to sod off once and all he could stammer was i would not say such things if i were you he turned away from the spy hole let go bella luna firmly ignoring the inner voice saying ooohhh bella luna he likes you she led her fellow ravenclaw down to the kitchen for a butterbeer as they sat in companionable silence luna heard a voice in the outer corridor twying to find a woo wuv will you diwect me pwease the man moved away after getting an answer but wesley laughed so hard that luna asked what so funny the smile that tempted her no tempted someone else such as fiona flint creased his face attractively that was the celebrant who presided over a cousin of mine wedding he was so i cantexplain i ll just have to let you hear for yourself leaning forward wesley attempted to look solemnly into her eyes before intoning mawage is wot bwings us togeder tooday mawage that bwessed awangement that dweam wifin a dweam giggling luna gasped no you re joking he didnt he did my cousins and i were convulsing in the back pew as the man assured the happy couple that wuv tru wuv will fowow you foweva so tweasure your wuv clutching her stomach she laughed with him until tears rolled down her cheeks luna eventually composed herself glad that wesley had come to the party he was so no she wasntgoing to start thinking like that luna jumped up and suggested they go get something to eat that was a safe thing to do except that he ate as elegantly as he looked and was so amusing and charming and good looking every time a guest in an emerald green dress walked by luna was consumed with guilt wasntharry her one true love of course he was it was just that sitting alone in her room dreaming of him or reading a book in between thinking about him wasntsatisfying anymore excusing herself luna went to powder her nose and stayed there for an hour tiptoeing past the makeshift ballroom a voice inside halted her steps you re just in time luna they re about to play our song that doesntleave much time for dilly dallying come along wesley hand was outstretched tired of fighting herself luna placed her hand in his and allowed him to draw her inside to the dance floor the goblin band started playing an oldie build me up buttercup wesley sang along to as he twirled her around he spun her out until only their hands clasped and then pulled her back they rocked together to the beat her pulse started racing again as he lowered his head to look into eyes after the song ended wesley immediately began dancing again so she relaxed and followed his lead rationalising that they were the only teens here and it would be rude to make a guest bored and uncomfortable luna happily spent the rest of the night by his side right before midnight she showed him the library wesley nodded in approval of the books but started getting a glint in his eye as the new year approached she tried to head him off with now wesley but he just smiled hello my name is wesley roberts you re beautiful and its new year s prepare to be kissed she put a leather chair between them but he raised a golden eyebrow and stepped around it saying again hello my name is wesley roberts you re beautiful and its new year s prepare to be kissed luna darted around the desk stop saying that eventually wesley cornered her against a bookcase and luna prepared to be kissed by closing her eyes and parting her lips her hands seemed to have a will of their own sliding into his hair and pressing his head to hers the kiss was incredibly sweet luna trembled as wesley raised his head and played with the braids in her hair the lips that she wanted to kiss again smiled tenderly she leaned toward him just as mr roberts stuck his head into the library and told his son it was time for them to leave inconceivable blue eyes stayed locked with hers as wesley said be right there dad toying with a braid he brought it to his lips before letting it go and backing away luna he was almost at the door before she collected her wits enough to say yes stopping in the doorway he leaned against it and looked at her did your mother ever tell you any yule stories say the one about the oak king and the spring maiden her eyes grew wide and her mouth opened in surprise unthinkingly luna put a hand over her heart as she whispered yes he winked and curved his mouth in a way that made his dimples look even more adorable if such a thing was possible good it my favourite standing in the library long after wesley left luna fingered a braid and sighed mine too a n happy new year did you catch all the princess bride quotes i put 13 citations and two familiar words humperdink inconceivable in because i ve wanted to do it for a long long time and please dontfeel you have to quote them back i ll take your word i also for my own twisted enjoyment put a feeling in common for each of our protagonists d carly simon sang anticipation and diana krall is the singer whose version of let face the music and dance inspired ginny and draco tango build me up buttercup is by the foundations and good grief could a song be better suited to wesley and buttercup i mean luna the yond cassius lean and hungry look quote was from julius caesar and yeah i used part of it before just the lean and hungry part when terry dragged blaise off to go lick chocolate mousse off each other but i felt it suited enrique who i saw as a antonio banderas type w adams family impulses remember to start your new year right with a review chapter 24 a bump in the road to love luna hummed weasley is our king while she finished packing she was looking forward to going back to school where life would return to normal once she resumed her usual routine surely her feelings would sort themselves out too she shut the case with a snap the sound of a throat clearing drew luna gaze to the doorway her father stood with an unlit cigar in one hand and a tumbler of firewhisky in the other bottled courage at this hour of the morning he had a very grave look on his face she hoped nothing bad had happened to anyone they knew darlin i need to talk to you about something in the library she followed her father downstairs looking across the desk she noticed that daddy was now pouring another shot from his emergency bottle of firewhisky oh dear the news must be very very bad indeed she wondered which relative had died her father said gruffly now you know when it comes to selling papers that news is news yes protuberant blue eyes so similar to luna looked down and then straight into her eyes this time sweetheart since the news is about a friend of yours i bought all the photos and the rights although i wontuse them i promise i ll only print the decent one what was daddy talking about in answer to her questioning look he handed over a set of photographs luna could only stare in shock they were of blaise and draco beautifully dressed and attending a party she shuffled through the pictures from the first where they posed with mr and mrs zabini and narcissa malfoy to the last where they were kissing passionately as confetti streamed and draco hands were under blaise skirt whoever took these photographs had followed the couple for hours there were pictures of the two eating dancing talking and groping er displaying affection she couldntbelieve the images were real and perhaps they werent really she asked when were these taken new year eve on new year eve ginny and blaise had taken polyjuice maximus potions and traded places for the evening blaise had confessed how much she had liked being a weasley for a few hours but ginny had just said the evening was really special yeah luna saw exactly how special in colour what a predicament she thought quickly did you get the negatives her father gave her a look of admiration pulled an envelope out of a drawer and tossed it over luna held them up to make sure they were all there before calmly handing the single picture and negative of the couple with their parents to her father she took the rest of the photographic evidence to the fireplace and waved her wand to burn everything to ash she returned to her chair when does the story break and how bad is it going to be a proud smile curved around her father fat cigar daughter you re going to be a fine editor one day damn fine story in today paper page one in the society section wish i didnthave to do it but the malfoy zabini merger rumour plus wealthy pure blood families setting up their kids makes this story one that housewives and businessmen love to read sold out almost as fast as the potter interview we re on a third printing right now he handed her today quibbler luna immediately looked at the section in question she frowned at the picture that was going to cause blaise so much trouble it wasnttoo bad at first glance but if anyone studied the photograph for more than a moment it was obvious that the blaise and draco in the picture were more than fond of each other the way their arms curved around each other waists as they leaned together stared into each other eyes and laughed over something before the animated photo ended and started again said it all i wish it hadnthappened darlin from what you ve told me that not her boyfriend but if some sleazy reporter from the intruder had got a hold of those pictures the damage would ve been a damn sight worse i know thanks daddy luna moved around the desk to give the rough edged but kind man a soft kiss on the cheek she smiled when her father pulled her onto his lap and gave her a hug when she was little the feel of loving arms and the smell of his cigar made her feel secure gave her a feeling that everything would be all right thankful that at least she still felt secure in his love luna returned the hug and then headed back to her room she had a train to catch and several friends to break bad news to on platform 9 3 4 luna scanned the crowd but didntsee blaise anywhere her roommates mindy cindy and bindy asked her to sit with them in the third to last compartment on the train again so she agreed after storing her things overhead and telling the other girls she was going to take a walk luna stepped out into the corridor she came face to face with harry potter luna didntsmile mistily but she still smiled happy to see him hello harry he smiled back but it was half hearted distracted hello may i pass by please we re trying to get to our compartment luna serenely stepped aside as ginny moved near she whispered have you seen the quibbler today the redhead halted looking impatient to get by she said no why because blaise and draco posing with their parents on new year eve are the front page story of the society section no yes and you re lucky my father bought all the pictures instead of the intruder i burnt every photograph except the one used in the paper but even that one looks pretty bad for blaise ginny face paled so dramatically every freckle stood out she said faintly as if in shock oh my gods i didntmean to it just happened i never wanted i dontexpect you did but what are you going to do about it now ginny stared and then shook her head nothing terry knows blaise traded places with me so he shouldntbe too upset and if you burnt the other pictures then blaise will never have to know i kissed draco with her lips after promising you wouldn t the distraught girl grabbed her arm looked into her face you wonttell will you the picture cantbe that bad it ll be laughed off and everything will be fine luna instantly knew what trait ginny had inherited from arthur weasley unfounded optimism she shook her head i ll bring my copy of the quibbler round later take a good look at the picture and then see if you can tell yourself everything will be fine she sighed i better get back to my compartment i ll try and find blaise before someone else shows her that article bye bye harry was watching the girls from inside his open compartment door he couldnthave overheard their low conversation but luna knew he had figured out that something was going on his look said what did you say to upset ginny blue eyes lost any trace of mist didnthe know her better than that instead of feeling hurt luna felt angry she gave the boy who deserved a hex for jumping to conclusions a none of your damn business look and opened her compartment door she closed it with a snap that startled the other girls hanging on to a vague smile with all her might luna resumed her place by the window and stared out seeing nothing but the shocked look on harry face incredibly luna couldntdecide whether she most wanted to laugh or cry a feeling of expectation made blaise smile happily as she and draco strolled toward the hogwarts express soon she would be with terry and see him every glorious day life was beautiful thrilled to be going back to school are you mental mate grinning at the boy who she knew was just as pleased as she was to leave non maternal care and return to the arms of the ones they loved blaise bumped draco shoulder with hers crazy in love maybe what your excuse a secretive smile on a classically handsome face made her gasp oh my gods you told her you loved her when oh when else new year eve right that absolutely fabulous she hugged her friend arm in glee as she teased i dontneed to ask what ginny said who wouldntlove you she reached up to kiss his cheek and smooth white blond hair careful not to disturb perfection glancing around blaise became aware that they were drawing an unusual amount of attention she and draco wore black clothing with long black leather coats but lots of other slytherins did too it was nothing out of the ordinary so what the bloody hell were parents and students gawking at blaise said i going to find terry he said they d be sitting in the second to last train compartment again drop by if you find out why people are staring it really starting to weird me out draco eyes flickered contemptuously over the nearby watchers he said with a smirk maybe they just haventseen a couple as gorgeous and well dressed as us before if we werentus we d stare in awe too while he sauntered off to the prefect carriage blaise walked swiftly past other students in a hurry to find her boyfriend and snog him silly terry was alone in the compartment although luggage was stored overhead his deep blue eyes lit up as she entered and launched herself at him as she pressed kisses to every part of his face he chuckled and said wesley fiona and morrigan went to buy a few papers to read on the trip good then i can do this without shocking anyone touching her lips to his she sank into his embrace deep sweet kisses continued while her coat was being dragged off and thrown over on the other seat blaise ran her fingers through the long brown hair she would never tire of feeling brush against her hands her face and her body the warmth of terry muscular frame against hers the sensation of his hands sliding up her back underneath her top seemed as necessary as air perhaps there was something to the snake slytherin reputation she did feel colder whenever she couldntsee or touch her boyfriend blaise smiled against terry mouth as she envisioned herself hissing with pleasure concentrating on making up all the kisses she d missed out on while on holiday and stroking the incredibly warm skin underneath terry jumper she didnthear the compartment door open an amused voice said well girls i can definitely say that yes blaise has found the compartment fiona and morrigan followed wesley inside giggling terry sat with his back against the window and his legs across the seat blaise leaned back against his chest and drew i heart u with her finger on the denim clad leg draped over hers terry wrapped his arms around her and asked the others so what with the sudden interest in the news waving copies of the prophet quibbler and intruder wesley stashed them in the overhead compartment along with blaise coat just wanted something the girls and i could read during the last hour of the trip merlin knows we ll need a distraction to take our minds off the snogging that will be going on before our scandalised eyes the rascal held up a hand dontsay you ll use a disillusionment charm it doesntblock sounds love birds flint tossed her auburn hair he just jealous because he affection deprived the poor boy wesley didntlook deprived although he made a comical face kind of you to mention it jokingly he added are you offering to do something about that fiona replied maybe yes maybe no i tell you tis incredible to believe how much she loves me o the kindest fiona flint looked so baffled that blaise explained wesley quoted shakespeare the taming of the shrew i guess you re the shrew a shrew wesley laughingly fended off several mock blows the friends were soon chatting about everything they d done on holiday wesley had several funny stories to tell about his muggle relatives and a film he d seen on telly called christmas vacation the thought of loads of relatives piling into one small house to spend a zany holiday together was an alien concept to blaise the closest she d come was new year eve with the weasleys that had been really really nice at least until gred and forge accused her of being a pod sister what imaginations those two had she tilted her head to the side to watch the movement of terry lips as he shared their christmas adventures and told about helping out at the winery over the holiday blaise didntcare what her boyfriend said as long as she could feel the vibrations of his chest against her back and gaze at the poetry in motion which was his mouth after the trolley witch came by the group compared chocolate frog cards debated whether or not to try certain bott beans and enjoyed being together again the trip seemed to fly by as wesley had predicted an hour away from hogwarts terry performed a disillusionment charm while the couple kissed the compartment door opened i need to speak to blaise well she occupied at the moment but if you leave a message with me i ll see she gets it whenever she comes up for air ms lovegood blaise laughed at wesley tone and became visible again come sit by me and tell me what up luna hesitated well i dontknow if you d really want anyone else to hear we re all friends no secrets here so sit and spill the blonde handed over a copy of the quibbler wesley snickered as he rose and retrieved his copy and handed the other papers to the girls on either side of him what in your father paper that got you looking so serious luna nimble fingers opened and began turning pages world news boring quidditch cannons losing is hardly shocking society drivel what the hell are you doing in this photo with malfoy zabini blaise felt as though she d just fallen down the rabbit hole what the hell are you talking about roberts luna opened her paper to the photograph blaise turned to terry this picture was taken new year eve you know where i was we met after midnight you know this isntme he nodded but his eyes were stormy sure looks like you zabini roberts voice sounded steely morrigan didntlike his tone and her black eyes flashed if she says it not her it isn t ravenclaw then who is it her evil twin fiona entered the argument i dont know but i would ve thought you d have heard of a thing called magic roberts you re supposed to be so bloody smart she looked at blaise who was it i cantsay you mean you wont terry voice was flat his eyes showed his anger malfoy was supposed to keep his hands to himself obviously he didn t he broke his promise but you won t will you you ll keep on protecting your friend even though you dontowe him a damned thing while she stared at terry set face wesley said if she doesnttell who it really was the whole school going to think she been cheating on you again mate and i dontlike it luna leaned forward you know blaise loves terry and would never cheat on him yeah i do but our friends don t and our house doesn t and neither will the rest of the school or terry parents that photograph makes him look like a bloody fool being led around by his dontsay it blaise couldntlet wesley say anything more everything sounded so much worse because it was true people were going to think and say horrible things beside her terry crumpled up the paper and threw it down visibly upset he took her hands in his i didnttell you because i didntwant you to be upset but my parents have been trying to get me to stop seeing you my family thinks i wontbecause we re having it off aunt hyacinth told them catching us in the act caused her heart to go wonky christmas eve he laughed without mirth every relative i have has been sending them old intruder and quibbler articles about your family blaise but i didntcare because that doesnthave anything to do with me and you this does his face creased unhappily my parents are probably sending a howler right now she didntknow what to say his mother disapproval was what drove her to crawl all over him on christmas eve in a way that led to even more disapproval now this how could she explain to terry that she couldntbe mad at draco for being in love wouldntruin his happiness to try and make people think better about her her eyes and expression must have told him for her he let go of her hands malfoy bloody slytherin snake bastard the obscenity used every other word to describe the boy he loathed made blaise flash back to the dungeon storeroom terry looked twice as dangerous now he took a breath and looked at her incredulously how can you stand him stand up for him constantly let him lean on you and use you malfoy scum no he my friend and i wonthurt him just because he made a mistake it wouldnthelp your family wouldntthink any better about me even if they knew they made up their minds before they met me that i some rich bitch tart who trying to ruin their baby boy life and you know it immediately she knew she d made a mistake to argue with her infuriated boyfriend his eyes blazed as he said bitterly maybe i do and i could take that what i dontknow is if i can take that bastard being your friend anymore not when he pulls stunts like this one every other damn month i dontlike being called whipped baby and that going to be mild compared to the shite i ll be taking after everybody sees this photograph blaise could feel her cheeks flush as her breathing became laboured tears started to spill down her cheeks terry blue eyes looked watery too as he pulled a square mirror out of his jacket pocket and put it in her palm and wrapped her fingers around it maybe we should both take some time to think things over no please terry take it back we can work it out was that her voice it sounded so strange thick with tears his face crumpled before he looked toward the window away from her i need some time blaise i cantthink about anything right now except trying to stop myself from finding that friend of yours and beating the hell out of him the compartment was deathly quiet blaise lunged to her feet ignoring her friends pleas to come back she ran to the opposite end of the train and slipped inside a small storeroom between two boxes she huddled down wrapped her arms around her knees bent her head and cried silent gulping sobs that wracked her body and streaked her face while she rocked back and forth in the motion that had never truly comforted her as a child and didntcomfort her now draco had picked up a weird vibe as soon as he and blaise walked onto the platform to catch the train but he d played it off for his friend sake once inside the prefect carriage he listened bored as the head boy droned on and on about the same duties and responsibilities he did every bloody time feeling a stare he turned and saw granger giving him a disgusted frown she always acted like he was something slimy though so nothing was new there weasel too was giving him the evil eye did the rabid redhead think he had his eye on granger malfoy sneered he was sure that with a complete make over and personality transplant the spew poster child would be a fine girlfriend for a weasley malfoys however had higher standards he curled his lip at the boy who d probably have a brain embolism if he knew a ferret had put his paws on his little sister arse draco glanced contemptuously away everywhere his eyes looked however some mental midget was gaping at him it almost made him doubt his hair styling charm surreptitiously he ran a hand over the do reassured that it looked perfect as ever reminding the prefects to wah wah wah wah wah the head boy left the carriage to go impress someone maybe a first year if he used a bad word hold on there malfoy what was this weasel must have gotten some balls in his christmas stocking how nice for him that granger hadntbusted them yet in a drawl calculated to send weasel into a fury he said what do you want weasley to be something other than poor and plain sorry i canthelp you better remember to send your list off to father christmas earlier next year zabini mr freckles was looking at him the way his brothers had before one of the identical bastards helped potty kick his arse if ronnie boy was planning on giving him a muggle whipping though he d be in for a surprise after the little episode on the quidditch pitch draco had hired instructors over the summer to teach him muggle duelling at least the street fighting down and dirty kind what the hell had the prat just said you heard me that picture in the paper with zabini was low even for you malfoy what are you talking about troglodyte this this was today quibbler society page a picture over the caption zabinis and malfoys merging families as well as companies the picture showed him and blaise standing between their parents and laughing at the pretentiousness of the whole thing he didntthink it was amusing now were other pictures taken had blaise seen this what did she think and was tarzan giving jane a hard time about it balling up the paper draco left the carriage ignoring the weasley rant that continued behind him he looked in the compartment where blaise was supposed to be she wasntthere terry boy was staring out the window like the sullen ape man he was his pal roberts sat alone on the other bench glaring daggers at the newcomer a crumpled newspaper was on the floor not good he snapped where are the girls wesley looked at him with loathing malfoy took a step back not wanting to know anymore but the glaring bastard told him anyway blaise ran out of here crying awhile ago and the girls took off to different compartments soon after so i have no idea not that i d tell you if i did malfoy terry looked away from the window to snarl get the hell out of here before i beat the shite out of you your little stunt may cost me my girlfriend and i d really like an excuse to make you pay you bloody selfish bastard what could he say if you think we re anything but best mates boot you re insecure and need to talk to a medishrink about you re little problem blaise loves you you stupid ape man seeing the fury in girly locks gone wild draco quickly jumped back slid the door closed and used his wand to ward it shut until the train arrived in the station from the bellowing and pounding on the door it was a smart move that wasntvery smart loony lovegood offering advice the day had officially gone down the toilet he wasntgoing to ask bollocks he was why not because terry going to hate you more than ever now and blaise loves him if you really wanted your friend to be happy you would ve apologised and tried to get them back together did he break up with her lovegood shook her head yes and then no he said he needed time to figure things out he didntbreak things off but he did return her mirror blaise ran out so fast we couldntfind her i afraid she hiding somewhere crying draco was afraid of that too bloody pangs of guilt almost made him open the door and let tarzan stomp him into the floor almost instead he nodded his grudging thanks to luna and opened ginny compartment he could tell at once that the group in here had heard almost everything through the thin wall ginny looked like she wanted to cry her beautiful brown eyes were shiny and sad she asked have you seen blaise is she okay he tried to smile but couldn t no and i dontknow will you tell her i feel so bad about everything that she still my friend her eyes told him she felt awful but what could they do potter had to butt in frowning at his friend why should you feel bad it her own fault for messing around with malfoy his feisty red told potty to shut up because he didntknow what he was talking about draco lips curved not even bothering to look at not so perfect potter he nodded to ginny and left he spent the rest of the trip looking for blaise unfortunately his search although made on the pretext of prefect duties and done as unobtrusively as possible made the gossip fly faster than ever draco prudently scanned the ravenclaw compartments through the glass panels only once the train had pulled into the station draco searched from top to bottom and eventually found his friend in a tiny storage room pulling her up and into his arms he carried her away from the carriages to where a few boats were left ready in case latecomers needed passage across the lake blaise silent shuddery tears were making him feel worse than ever she just sat and cried with one hand holding her heart locket and the other clutching a mirror as they floated toward the castle draco wondered miserably what he could possibly do about it ginny had never realised how much you could hear thorough a compartment wall until voices started rising on the other side of hers it wasntlike she could hear everything but certain loud statements like what the hell are you doing with malfoy and the whole school going to think she been cheating on my mate again and malfoy bloody etc gave her a good idea what was happening neville and harry listened with her in quietly appalled fascination the trio looked awkwardly at each other when they heard no please terry take it back blaise had sounded so gutted it made ginny feel guilty as hell especially when they heard the door slide open and light footsteps running away that really made the compartment erupt flint and macduff cursed out boot and roberts and left shouting what anatomically impossible thing the boys could do soon afterwards luna opened the door to their compartment and handed ginny a paper thought you d like to see what you ve no doubt been hearing about luna didntsay hello or even glance at harry which was extremely odd she just nodded and left looking down at the picture with harry and neville now crowded against her sides to get a peek ginny heart sank blaise looked way too friendly with draco in the picture luna had been right this situation was not going to be laughed off or fine why would blaise look at malfoy like that if she loves terry neville artless question echoed in the compartment harry snorted because it malfoy he a snake and i guess she one too before ginny could protest they all stopped and listened as they heard someone beating on the door and cursing in the next compartment she should have known that draco was the cause he opened their door and focused on her the boys probably thought the slytherin was looking for his friend but ginny knew he was checking to see if she was okay harry sounded off like a prat about blaise and she was happy to tell him to shut up silvery eyes gave her a look of appreciation that was the only good thing to happen that day after draco left ron and hermione entered finished with prefect duties they sat and were quickly filled in by harry and neville about everything that had been happening ron said we saw the photo in the paper i told malfoy it was low even for him hermione looked at her boyfriend maybe you were right maybe zabini no better than she should be this photograph looks really bad you cantblame boot if he breaks up with her when ron just stared out the window without replying to hermione ginny jumped to her feet i going to go sit with colin congratulations you two you just became the biggest judgmental gits ever bigger than percy and penelope colin after she d whispered all the details of the story was realistic malfoy came by here to check for blaise everybody knows the story by now and no one going to believe she and malfoy are just friends i dontthink anyone but lovegood you boot and roberts ever really did what about you i didntuntil i got her to do that inuit friendship ritual nobody having it off with malfoy would ve fallen for that one the friends shared a smile over colin triumph over the fair sex and the naivet of a girl that seemed so sophisticated and slytherin colin whispered so you re not going to tell anyone it was really you and malfoy do you think it would help the features many called baby faced became serious no nobody would believe it they d think you were lying for her and blame that on zabini too disembarking ginny watched draco methodically searching for blaise catching his eye through a window she d waved and tried to smile his twisted effort was just as sorry as hers the moment she reached the castle ginny brushed off ron apology and quickly hustled what gear she d brought home back up to her room dashing out of gryffindor tower before anyone could question her she tried to think what she would do if she were draco she ran to the boat entrance and met the boat as it docked ginny helped pull blaise up the steps inside they supported the girl together draco frowned unhappily what should we do she wontstop crying taking charge in the manner of weasley women throughout the ages ginny said confidently madam pomfrey will take care of her in the infirmary let go before some little snotrag comes whining to the mediwitch for something why he found her snarling so attractive ginny would never know but the blond who looked even more gorgeous with tousled platinum hair and a worried expression on his face was giving her the look again the one he got before he pulled her behind a bookcase or a statue or into a dark corner where no one could see him kiss and touch her in ways no one else ever had well he could keep those smirking lips to himself at least until blaise was taken care of poppy was a brusque but caring mediwitch she saw blaise and gasped oh heavens what ails this girl ginny said she cantstop crying giving the students an i never would ve guessed that look the mediwitch bustled over to a cupboard and started rummaging inside over her shoulder she asked hurt feelings or broken heart ginny looked at draco and thought of how she d feel if he said to her what terry had told blaise broken heart oh dear no cure for that i afraid all i can do is treat the symptoms this will stop the crying and this will help her sleep i ll keep her overnight and you can come take her back to her house in the morning ginny tried to lighten the mood when she and draco left remember when we couldntsleep because we were dreaming of each other of course although you never did tell me if i was wearing clothes in your dreams in mine you only had freckles on ginny returned his smile of course not when he looked smug she added you were wearing a cloth diaper cupid cupid you dare to call a malfoy cupid ginny teased as she ran down the corridor cupid cupid cutie cutie cupid strong fingers grabbed her wrist and pulled her into an empty classroom being pushed up against a door and snogged breathless by draco was something ginny was becoming addicted to eventually she admitted that malfoys were love gods and not cupids they stood holding each other long after they stopped kissing closing her eyes as his arms held her close ginny was guiltily grateful that blaise chose not to tell anyone the truth she loved draco and he loved her but it was so new so vulnerable they needed time to grow closer stronger before they tried to deal with all the problems being together would bring before they returned to their houses ginny looked up into draco face and tried to tell him everything would work out he shook his head and held her tighter chapter 25 friends luna left the great hall after dinner feeling perturbed she had been trying to see blaise for days but the girl was avoiding her and everyone else in muggle studies blaise came in just as class began looked down taking notes the entire time and rushed out before anyone could say a word luna had even approached malfoy and tried to ask him about their mutual friend the conversation had not been a success the slytherin had glanced away when he said zabini was okay she just needed some space and didntwant to talk to anyone today when luna had tried for the third time in as many days to ask about blaise malfoy told her icily to keep her nose out of other people business as she was walking away feeling very upset he called after her with the information that blaise was in the library all evening every evening luna wait she turned to watch wesley hurry to catch up she had been doing that a lot lately between certain classes and on the way to and from the great hall for meals luna had begun to expect that wesley would call her name and brighten her day with his smile and lively banter she even found herself watching him study or talk to friends in the common room in the evenings last night when he had caught her looking and smiled luna heart had pounded so hard she d fled to her room her pulse felt erratic right now but she refused to run away instead she waited serenely while inwardly wondering when she had stopped feeling guilty about noticing wesley roberts appealing dimples he reached her side i dontsuppose you re going to be seeing blaise any time soon she in the library right now i on my way to see her why wesley expression was boyishly earnest how had fiona flint been able to resist forgiving him for defending his friend blaise roommate had passed them several times in the corridors since the scene in the compartment and each time she d either glared or pointedly ignored the boy blaise did have loyal friends wesley was lowering his chin and looking up in bashful appeal luna didntbuy it but it was extremely cute he smiled in a way that could convince merpeople to buy gillyweed well it been five days since our little train wreck and terry gone beyond worried to worrying me zabini hasnteaten one meal in the hall and they haventhad any doubled classes so he hasntseen her now he picking at his food and staring at her picture for hours on end i volunteered to see blaise tell him how she doing ease the misery may i come with you nice to know terry was suffering too luna nodded her acceptance of his company as wesley reached for the handle to enter the library ron weasley pushed it open harry potter was right behind he looked at the two of them and frowned you two looking for zabini wesley draped a friendly arm around luna shoulders yes we are happen to know which section she in ron said yeah she back by the restricted section the girl helping pince in the afternoons told me she been staying there for hours and hours every day so i uh we went over to see her harry shrugged we said hello she seemed okay okay do you need new glasses she not okay ron told luna you talk to her you re a girl girls are good at that stuff thank you ronald i will harry was scowling didntlike being ignored did he a little too used to her tripping over herself to getting his attention was he luna knew she was wrong to feel so hurt that harry didntseem to return her feelings he had never asked her to dream about him she d done that all by herself she hoped he missed her attention missed her maybe then he would want to spend some time with her go to the trouble of saying hello luna one day that time was not now harry eyes were as hard as the emeralds they resembled unwilling to look at him anymore she brushed past the gryffindors and went inside luna could feel her companion stare as roberts tried to read her face are you and potter he paused and then said i know i haventmade my feelings a secret but i dontwant to make a move on someone else girl i no slytherin nervously luna tucked a long strand of hair behind her ear before she could answer wesley fingered one of her earrings i adore radishes his fingers that close to her face made her stomach drop do you as long as they re earrings and i donthave to eat them i insane about them especially when they re dangling from ears as pretty as yours oh luna shook her head no there no me and harry did you want there to be yes ah well then since he too stupid too know what he missing would you like to go with me her face felt hot i would like to be friends with you slipping his arm around her wesley winked close friends at her nod he grew bolder kissing friends they had reached the last bookcase before an open area filled with tables and chairs scattered in front of the roped off restricted section luna allowed her robin goodfellow to pull her between bookshelves his lips were as firm and gentle and the kiss every bit as sweet as she remembered she smiled definitely wesley grinned and pulled her by the hand over to where blaise was working industriously on a long scroll on something probably history of magic the slender girl finished and double checked the parchment before rolling it up noticing the pair before her zabini full lips curved slightly oh hello luna wesley i ve just finished my last assignment watching the other girl stuff several scrolls into a school bag luna asked homework due tomorrow something almost amused flickered in the girl eyes waving an airy hand toward the stack of books on the table blaise said oh no i did that essay ages ago maybe even first week no that was my last regular assignment for the year she frowned if i knew what the professors were planning to assign over easter holiday i could do those too but they wonttell me said something about tradition and perverse enjoyment bet that was snape said wesley luna giggled but blaise acted as though she didnthear dontknow what i ll do with myself now maybe get some extra credit her lips twitched in detached amusement i might give granger a run for the swottiest swot award i scored two points higher on yesterday history of magic test i think she almost cried wesley was raising an incredulous brow it was very dashing he said carefully are you telling us that you ve completed all your assignments for the rest of the school year when have you found the time that tiny smile thingy blaise kept doing was starting to creep luna out what was wrong with her the other girl answer gave her a clue there are plenty of hours in the day if you dontsleep much or eat in the hall i ve slept maybe oh an hour or two if that the last four days and it really helped me tear through my schoolwork luna bet all you had to do was trade your personality for that of a glassy eyed zombie she tried to ask casually why did you start doing this the mannequin currently posing as blaise zabini replied sunday when i came back from the infirmary everyone was very supportive but i had to find some way to bottle up my feelings i had to get a hold of myself so i took off my necklace my ring put them away and figured that since i didntwant to sleep and dream about you know i d stay up in the common room and work on some assignments it really helped i dontthink i ve cried for days now and just look how productive i ve been wesley frown told luna that he didntlike what he saw any more than she did gently he kidded the purple shadows look wonderful with your gypsy eyes zabini and your cheekbones are incredible really tragic heroine looks good on you but have you actually eaten anything since saturday a look of faint surprise lifted dark brows looking underneath a tome the girl lifted a scarlet coloured remembrall so that what i forgot to do draco been making me drink a potion since i dontlike to stop working to eat and i dontwant to go to the hall anymore wesley slanted a look at luna before softly asking why not blaise got up and slung her school bag over her shoulder she made an effort to smile and it just looked more pitiful you know why not wesley go back and tell your friend i fine or i mental whatever you like i dontwant to see him or talk about him or think about him and since i promised to help crabbe and goyle with herbology i d better get going see you later the pair watched their friend drift out of the library like some sort of wraith luna turned to wesley when do slytherin and ravenclaw houses have potions together again tomorrow good standing to leave luna girl stiffened as wesley encircled her with his arms his hands smoothed down the length of her hair and then began rubbing her back it felt good tentatively she returned the embrace luna wasntconfident enough to stroke his back but she did slip her arms around him he warmed her inside and out she could get used to having a friend like wesley little by little she relaxed against him resting her head against his shoulder when she felt his lips brush her hair luna closed her eyes and sighed psst red ginny over here long pale fingers beckoned from behind the statue of bertha the behemoth ginny walked to where draco was lounging against an ample backside my lips haventrecovered from our after lunch snog in the empty classroom on the fifth floor so if you re desperate for affection funny i ll remind you of that the next time you drag me off to a broom cupboard like yesterday which by the way i too bloody tall to be snogging in you sadistic wench aw does ickle malfoy back hurt yes it does as a matter of fact want me to kiss it and make it better gorgeous slytherin love god lips pouted in a way that sorely tempted ginny to make her own even puffier she had to cover her mouth to stifle laughter when he said slyly yes but there something else that would be even more effective his silver eyes were gleaming so she knew this was going to be naughty she shouldnteven ask what you could give me a massage i just happened to pick up some oil over the holidays oh really mmmm she smiled the idea made her go mmmm too she mock frowned i suppose if i dont your mate zabini will be only too happy to do her best friend a favour ginny expected playful banter not a look of frustration draco shook his white blond head as his face twisted unhappily zabini not doing too good i didntwant to tell you but she gone mental over boot wanting time apart her thank the gods it s friday cheer drained away she should have known when blaise avoided the hall and sat so quietly in muggle studies that something was wrong she just hadntwanted to know she had been too pre occupied with her own romance damn guilt sucked malfoy understanding nod told her he felt the same way ginny didntwant to ask but she did anyway tell me draco began to pace like the jungle cat she d seen imprisoned at a horrible muggle place her father had once taken her the zoo he said as he walked restlessly back and forth she doesnteat doesntsleep and spends all her time doing school work last night she finished hers for the year and started on mine he made a face i didntlook forward to writing a three scroll parchment on how wizard goblin relations have changed over the ages but i didntask her to do it for me in a perfect imitation of my handwriting he raked a hand through his hair i going to feel horrible when i turn that in i donteven want to think about the guilt i ll feel over the essays for charms potions and defense against the dark arts wow that sounded bad and she didntmean letting his friend do his homework one thing bothered her how is blaise able to be super swot girl if she doesnteat or sleep doesntyour brain shut down or something if you do that a frown line ginny longed to smooth away appeared on draco aristocratic brow he grimaced i make her drink meal replacement potions but i afraid she taking something else she sent an owl to eddy sunday morning and that night a package came he said bitterly our mothers take all kinds of potions to keep them going the gods only know what blaise is on she wontsay no just smiles at me like some bloody automaton and goes off to write another paper you should tell snape he your head of house draco smiled at her as if she was the most brilliant girl in the world it was flattering but it wasntthat amazing an idea he should have thought of it ginny smiled maybe slytherins didntthink like gryffindors more proof that he needed her desperately happy to have something he could do to help his friend draco pulled her into a hug before unexpectedly bending her back over his arm he stared into her eyes in the way that made her heart race no wonder i love you red whatever can i do to repay you her face was turning pink and it wasntdue to the blood rushing to her head i love you too and i ll think of something after giving her a kiss draco returned her to an upright position he murmured wickedly i hope it involves massage oil ginny looked up into bertha eternally grinning face after he left and said what are you smiling at the thought of hagrid and a barrel of oil that disgusting and i wontstand here another moment with a sex crazed statue tossing her fiery tresses she flounced away grinning were you just talking to a statue trust ronald to show up where she least wanted him to luckily ginny could run verbal rings around the boy until he fell down dizzily figuratively speaking no but i heard what something about being sex crazed really sure it wasnta projection of your own thoughts brother huh was it nice to twist your brother mind up in order to watch him spin madly as it unwound perhaps not but it was fun as they walked up the stairs toward their next classes ginny explained maybe you re having sex crazed thoughts ron so you think i the one saying it so you wonthave to deal with it the scrunched up freckled face tried to follow her logic you mean i really the one thinking about sex you did bring it up anything you want to share with your younger but wiser sister no well yeah i was wondering can you like someone without liking them well well brother dear was deeper than she had thought how interesting ginny smiled are you asking me if it possible to be attracted to someone without wanting to be their girlfriend or boyfriend sure you can why no reason this conversation was just what she needed it was so amusing she decided to pull ron leg and see what he would do his sputtering was always good for a laugh ginny said come off it ron you wonder about quidditch not boy girl stuff confess you kissed blaise up in your room over holiday and now you re wondering how you could like it and still want hermione to be your girlfriend ron didntanswer he looked away his face was red merlin underwear he had kissed blaise fred and george both acted so funny after fetching the pair making those comments yuck ginny did not want to imagine her brother using his tongue in a pleasurable manner eeuwww quickly she advised donttell me and whatever you do donttell hermione her brother looked horrified at the thought good or was it an awful suspicion struck you dontwant to do what didnt happen and we re not talking about again do you red hair shook wildly no never no way i dontwant to ruin my chance with hermione it only zabini looks so sad oh brother he had dad soft heart dontworry about blaise snape is going to help and she ll be fine you just worry about your own love life and keep those lips to yourself and hermione ron nodded relieved she waved goodbye and looked forward to arithmancy where everything added up the way it was supposed to hey night owl glancing up from the importance of ethics in potions making essay she had just finished for draco blaise met her roommate coolly amused gaze hello cassandra done yes the girl dressed in a long black cape with heavy black eyeliner and lipstick looked back at the four slytherins who waited behind her this girl needs to see the sunrise the group of three boys and a girl nodded their agreement they all were as equally pale and fond of the colour black one of the boys carried a guitar a faint stirring of interest caused blaise to rise and take the cloak priam had brought for her cassandra held out her hand to the group each one gave her a galleon lips curved smugly the girl dark eyes gleamed as she pocketed the money i told you she would greet the day with us but no you foolish mortals never heed my visions i pity you trailing behind the group with her roommate blaise was content not to think just walk the slytherins sauntered out the front entrance and lounged on the steps she sat beside cassandra who offered her a pair of dark glasses placing them over her eyes and leaning back on her elbows like the other girl blaise asked why are we doing this the group snickered the girl with long straight reddish black hair scarlett explained i saw it in a film once a group of vampires sat and greeted the day with sunglasses on it was cool our little group usually comes out every monday to see the sunrise because mondays suck and we find it amusing but cass told us you needed us today curving her lips to feign interest blaise saw the boy with blue black spiky hair and a guitar staring at her in awe what are you on her refusal to answer didntoffend instead the boy who introduced himself as lexx started strumming his guitar and telling the others night owl here a ramones girl let sing for her the music he played was familiar her mother had an orb of the group some remote impulse caused blaise to sing along with lexx i want to be sedated cassandra held out her hand the group groaned and reluctantly coughed up sickles she sneered at them shut up i could ve bet you galleons the sun almost up so keep singing vamps sitting on the steps of hogwarts wearing sunglasses and singing a song with bizarre slytherins seemed logical to blaise may i join you the group turned and stared at the tall boy who was standing at the top of the steps he stood with his hands in the pockets of his trousers with only a black fisherman jumper to ward off the chill strangely he didntlook cold blaise had a vague impression of pearly white skin and not quite long hair with a fringe falling into eyes of the same shade of deep black uninterested she turned back around although cassandra and scarlett continued to gape as if bewitched finally her roommate said in a breathy voice have a seat the boy sat between cassandra and blaise scarlett asked eagerly what your name still looking at blaise he answered kieran the lilting almost musical inflection in the boy voice made the other girls sigh and the boys frown lexx said almost belligerently i ve never seen you before are you a new student or what i am a visitor i suppose looking directly into blaise eyes he asked softly why are you so empty inside i am unable to sense your feelings what you need to make you happy that makes me sad she didntwant to make him sad but she d worked too hard not to feel emotion and she wasntabout to give in to the invitation to share the pain she d buried so deep the boy could go sell empathy somewhere else rising to her feet blaise curved her lips and said goodbye to the group kieran trailed after her catching up to her in the entry he put a hand on her arm to get her attention apathetically she waited for him to say whatever he was going to and leave her alone what is your name what year are you in and what is it house blaise zabini sixth year slytherin house why avoiding the sad eyes blaise looked at his chin instead it had a dimple the boy was talking again he said i will ask my sister lorelei to let me stay in your house she tells me i am a sixth year too i will be in your classes and perhaps tomorrow you will be more open to making a new friend perhaps bye blaise was aware that the odd boy kieran watched her until she turned a corner and moved out of sight but she didntcare enough to look back and wave pushing thoughts of the strange encounter away blaise lethargically drifted upstairs to take a shower that afternoon inside the dungeon where she had arrived well before the rest of the class blaise heard a voice say impassively class does not begin for ten minutes miss zabini professor snape words caused blaise to look up from the table where she was setting out potion ingredients he was standing in the doorway holding a flagon of something she watched him walk toward her yes i hoped to finish and leave early are you unwell something in the way he stressed the last word caused a faint stir of alarm serenely she shook her head i fine maybe a little tired she arranged the jars in order of use and began to grind dragonfly wings with a pestle she could feel dark eyes assessing her with clinical detachment she didntmind she felt rather detached herself mr malfoy tells me that you have not been sleeping or eating pausing before starting to mince kookaburra tongue blaise said mildly he exaggerates does he i am curious miss zabini how are you able to excel without proper rest or nourishment the faint stir of panic was becoming more pronounced she shrugged i dontknow dontyou look at me blaise put her knife down and turned to face her head of house his fathomless orbs gauged her pupils her shadowed eyes sharp cheekbones and overall weight loss his lips turned down have you been taking bottled sleep maybe she had but she wasntgoing to admit a thing why do you say that the professor slight smile admired her slytherin socratic method of answering with a question but he wasntgoing to let her off bottled sleep is a controlled substance administered only by healers for good reason it is not intended to be taken more than once a week daily utilisation can result in dangerous side effects and you show signs of several really yes really the professor voice was soft and deadly serious she would be alarmed if she could feel anything that was her favourite side effect numbness he held out the flagon she automatically took it and then blinked what this antidote it should take effect one hour after ingestion you should have time to complete your potion before needing to return to slytherin house after one or two hours of healing sleep you should return to normal i dontwant to return to normal perhaps not but i must insist or i will inform the headmaster who will be obliged to owl the ministry to investigate how a student came into possession of an illegal substance eddy wouldntlike azkaban there was no happy hour blaise drank the potion and handed it back to the professor he inclined his head and left her to continue assembling her ingredients other students came in fiona sat beside her wow you ve done all the prep work thanks no problem blaise could feel someone gazing at her but she refused to look she added the ingredients to her cauldron meticulously one item made her partner laugh virgin tears is that what makes this a draught of sorrow a girl crying over being a bloody virgin after time passed and the potion came to the point where the tears were added and the solution turned from murky grey to a sparkling clear liquid blaise began to move more and more slowly carefully she ladled her potion into a flagon and labelled it she was too tired to fight the urge to return the gaze of the boy staring at her from across the aisle he looked thinner too but his eyes were as blue and his hair as long and silky as she had tried so hard not to remember fiona asked the exasperated man admonishing a boy for breaking his vial of tears will breathing the fumes make you cry professor irritably the teacher spat without looking of course not if you would bother to read the course material you would know that the draught of sorrows is used to end melancholy not cause it why because zabini crying blaise looked down at her wet fingertips she was crying when had that happened when she d looked at terry face and wondered if she d ever touch it again she ignored her classmates gaping and picked up an empty vial blaise held it up to her cheek and let several tears roll into it slinging her school bag over her shoulder the girl who wanted to leave and fall into bed forget what was causing her chest to hurt so badly picked up the vial and flagon disregarding the boy whispering her name she handed the potion to the professor and the vial to the classmate who had dropped his it was the ravenclaw who had sneered at her in the hall as he d given her terry note he sneered at her now are you trying to say these are virgin tears zabini yeah right look i pour them in and it turns clear it took concentrated effort to put one foot in front of the other the boy disbelieving words were heard but she didntturn around not even after she heard snape say pointedly go sit down mr boot i did not give you permission to leave your table ten points from ravenclaw you may take your seat also mr malfoy reaching her house the drained girl slowly pulled herself up the stairs her bed had never looked so good blaise dropped her bag on the floor and collapsed across it falling into dreamless oblivion malfoy draco looked up and saw blaise roommates rushing down the girls staircase he had returned from the library where time spent with red worked better than a draught of sorrow for relieving melancholy he needed to clean up before dinner it looked like proper grooming would have to wait though flint lips were pressed together as if holding back tears and macduff face was distraught too snape had assured him that after a couple hours healing sleep his friend would be fine why wasntshe up by now fiona answered his question blaise wontwake up we ve tried cold water shaking the bed even slapping her face we dontknow what else to do he held up a hand to halt the flow of explanation his eyes grew flinty with determination go and open the double window i going to get my broom and fly up the girls nodded eagerly and ran back upstairs draco jogged to the broom shed it was pathetically easy to counter hagrid wards and retrieve his broom impatiently he sprang upwards and flew toward slytherin tower the opened window was a tight fit but he drew up his legs and leaned low as possible to make it through the opening inside the room he jumped off and handed his broom to morrigan blaise was lying asleep on her bed as he drew near she rolled her head and frowned she been doing that for awhile now if you try to talk to her she murmurs no said morrigan draco sat by blaise and said sharply wake up the sleeping girl frowned and turned her head away his temper flared damn it blaise i order you to wake the hell up right this bloody minute the door opened and several girls looked in shocked at hearing and then seeing a boy in the girls section of the tower draco snarled get out and if anybody says anything i ll make them wish they had purple pustules the girls gasped and quickly slammed the door shut once more he looked down at blaise again even in sleep she looked defiant as she murmured no and turned away he d had it with the kid glove treatment nobody said no to draco malfoy in slytherin house with a grunt he slung blaise over his shoulder like terry boy used to it wasntas easy as it looked when the ape man did it and ignored the girls shrieks of what are you doing and what are you thinking to carry blaise into the shower draco activated the water to spray a lukewarm blast and propped the girl against the wall blaise was now gasping and trying to turn away from the water he yelled wake up i tired of putting up with your shite blaise so open your eyes wet curly hair shook violently as she cried no i dontwant to i dontwant to open my eyes i dontwant to feel i just want to sleep too bad blaise because i not leaving i know it my fault that picture got taken and i feel guilty as hell i a selfish bastard and i sorry i so bloody damn sorry but i cantstand this anymore i want my best mate back brown eyes opened sorrowfully blaise whispered it hurts so bad i know draco hugged his friend tightly he said softly too much of water hast thou poor ophelia he pulled back to see her face she gazed at him sadly but didntcry if she did he might do something embarrassing that he would never live down draco spirits lifted immeasurably when after stroking his cheek his mate lips curved and therefore i forbid my tears they turned when fiona ran into the lavatory one of the girls went to tell snape crabbe just came into the common room shouting that the he on his way you d better get out of here draco snapped the command to turn off the water he looked at blaise will you be okay she smiled her first real smile in days yeah at the window he hesitated blaise rolled her eyes go ahead say it so you can fly out of here before snape catches you levering himself out the window and onto his broom draco ignored the cold to smirk i always knew i d see you in the shower zabini the re animated wench taunted before shutting the window i saw you first malfoy poolside on my birthday nice arse teeth chattering draco laughed as he put away his broom and used the disillusionment charm to sneak up to his room he hurriedly got ready for dinner on the way out he removed an item out of a desk drawer and slipped it into a pocket inside the great hall conversations hushed the moment he entered maybe it was the fact that he wasntwearing school robes but a comfortable black tee and trousers that allowed him a full range of movement roberts nudged boot who quickly rose to his feet as draco approached terry drew his wand expelliarmus laughing derisively draco kept coming shielding charm ape man girly locks threw a powerful straight punch aimed at his opponent nose but draco raised his arm and took the blow in the elbow which caused pretty boy lots of distracting pain smiling viciously malfoy side kicked boot in the knee terry boy got in a decent hook to the side of the head on the way down the two tables erupted as boys from each one jumped up onto their benches and tables to see their housemates battle it out the teachers at the staff table screamed for order the hufflepuffs and gryffindors climbed onto their tables to scream support for their favourite contender it wasntdraco kick malfoy butt boot how pathetic hufflepuff cantmake themselves say arse the arseholes punch that snake bastard again male weasels are such nasty creatures good thing for me they re as stupid as they are brutal the boy who instigated the brawl smiled viciously as he blocked a punch by the limping but still feral looking wild man maybe boot would fight better if no girly hair obstructed his vision jabbing the ravenclaw in the eye draco said while terry head rocked back with the impact i hope i hurting you as much as you ve hurt blaise the jammy bastard intercepted the next blow and attacked in a fluid movement that said he wasntgoing to go down without a fight boot gritted same to you malfoy before either could make another move dumbledore waved his wand and froze everyone in the hall draco watched in grudging awe as the headmaster walked down the aisle moving around spectators to reach the two boys that remained unfrozen professors snape and flitwick followed behind the white haired wizard what is the meaning of this disgraceful exhibition of muggle duelling mr malfoy mr boot covertly taking off his wizard version of brass knuckles and slipping them back into his pocket draco sneered ask boot he threw the first punch terry boy was miffed you were going to attack me malfoy and you know it it would seem that you boys are equally at fault therefore you shall share an equal punishment two weeks detention served together one week with each of your heads of house professor snape has graciously volunteered to oversee the both of you starting monday at seven you will return to your houses at once returning tarzan snarl as they left the hall draco jeered better go let pomfrey take care of that knee boot cantswing on vines without it shut the hell up malfoy i ll shut up after all i now have my best mate jane all to myself while you re stuck with only cheetah to groom your girly locks astonishing how satisfying it was to hear the bellow of rage if that didntbring the jungle boy back to his woman then nothing would psssst malfoy draco over here slender pale fingers were beckoning from behind the statue of bertha the behemoth smiling and then hissing as blood trickled from his lip draco walked stiffly over to ginny she held a basket of first aid items a pale brow rose how i knew the moment you started punching terry that you d need me to patch you up amazing fighting ferret that you are sitting stiffly with his back against the wall draco battered lips tilted up i was amazing wasnti a soft loving kiss was placed against the corner of his mouth not swollen and bleeding you re a black knight in shining armour a n both shakespeare lines are from laertes speech in hamlet thought of the first part looked it up and said oh i like that following bit too lol stories are so interesting when they twist and turn arentthey hope you ve enjoyed this chap let me know in a review chapter 26 lovers ginny left the great hall after breakfast saturday filled with anticipation the january day was bright and cold harry and company were going to sneak into hogsmeade to play pranks as appealing as the thought of managing mischief was she had other plans that were even more thrilling as she neared the staircase down to the lower levels the girl looked both ways to make sure no one was approaching before taking the steps down to the dungeon corridor at the bottom of the stairs she turned and gave a muffled shriek when a warm hand covered her mouth and pulled her back against a masculine chest well well what have we here a sacrificial maiden for a dragon to devour ow ginny pivoted and took the hand of the boy whose palm she had nipped she kissed his boo boo and slid her arms around his waist no i a dragon tamer draco grin brightened the dim corridor he looked so bloody gorgeous his pale classic features framed by a black jumper and dark shadows when he noticed her gaze focusing on his mouth he winked tame me all you want once we get inside red at the door to dungeon five he used his wand to counter the wards my house elf slinky is incredibly clever at finding out all sorts of useful things ginny entered lorelei classroom marvelling again how bright and cheerful it was compared to snape s the enchanted windows made all the difference the lack of specimen jars floating about helped too draco looked smug it was so cute slinky told me the professor has gone to nurse her ailing father and isntexpected back for a week her heart began to pound the dragon was giving her a look that sent shivers up and down her spine it was that steamy his rain cloud coloured eyes became hooded that means no one will hear you scream ginny felt as if she was on one of those muggle carnival rides that made your stomach flip over and over she swallowed hard and tried to sound challenging instead of breathy what makes you think you could make me scream dragon she had to remind herself that weasleys never retreated when he stood so close his body brushed hers this in a flash claws tickled her sides ruthlessly within moments the maiden was screaming with laughter and begging stop please oh gods why do i have to be so damn ticklish baby stop her tormentor ceased and looked at her with an odd expression on his face she giggled i wish i d known that calling you baby would make you freeze earlier maybe my side wouldnthurt now she kissed him softly sorry i know it reminds you of your mother calling you baby boy the hands gently stroking her sides under her jumper made her forget everything except how good he made her feel his lips kissing hers caused any slight regret at not going pranking to disappear dreamily ginny wondered how the brush of his lips the slide of his tongue could feel better and better as time went by usually the better she knew a boy the less she liked him or wanted to kiss him with draco the more they were together the harder it became to control herself keep her hands from being naughty and restrain her body from moving in ways that made him break away and recite arithmancy equations to calm down the answer to her internal question gave her a warm glow that suffused her entire being as she whispered i love you i love you too she had just reached round and grasped hold of her boyfriend incredibly fine arse when a noise in the outer corridor made the two spring apart and look around wildly for a hiding place draco nodded to a back worktable covered in a cloth that hung to the floor they quickly concealed themselves and sat hugging each other while trying not to laugh as the door opened curiosity made ginny lean over to peek around the side edge of the tablecloth she put her lips directly to draco ear and breathed it that new sixth year i told you about last night who got sorted into gryffindor while her brother in slytherin lorelei sister after another peek ginny whispered she went into the storeroom probably to get stuff for the er things the gang is doing today even in the gloom a white blond brow rising was a sexy sight her boyfriend knew what kind of things his least favourite fellow students were planning they listened to the humming girl return from her supply gathering ginny jumped when a sardonic voice asked what in the rucksack the girl replied top secret professor i could tell you but then i d have to convince you to let me go off with the gryffindors anyway and unfortunately i donthave time right now how about we have this conversation later in the dim light beneath the table ginny shared a what the hell look of amazement with draco she covertly looked out again and saw snape mouth curve into something scary a smile after a stomach churning moment the man lips curved down into a more natural grimace you would not have to go off with potter and his little friends if you hadnthad that so called accident with the anti aging solution crossly the potions master added i begin to think you enjoy acting sixteen again lorelei ginny looked at draco his mouth was hanging open it was so unfair that he could even do that attractively platinum hair shook indicating that he couldntbelieve his ears either an amused feminine voice which sounded more youthful and slightly higher pitched than that of the woman they knew said remember it ronan for the next week severus and canti have a bit of fun i doing my best trying to live the clich i ve been forced into the new girl with a twin brother who comes to school and immediately becomes a source of juicy gossip she paused and then laughed just think what the students would say if they knew i was having it off with my professor the sound of kissing was heard ginny and draco both grimaced the girl lorelei had become said smilingly i ve got to go love you can discipline me later are you going to be naughty the insinuation in that dark silky voice made ginny press her hands against her queasy stomach the thought of those having erm intimate moments was just as nauseating as when she d seen mr and mrs zabini get affectionate and almost as much as the mere thought of her parents ever talking like this to one another older people should knit and smoke pipes not be sexy it was gross she could see draco white teeth gleaming in the near darkness thought her squeamishness funny did he his smile faded when they heard oh yes this week your good woman is going to be a bad girl that a nice boy like harry potter wontlike at all and in your class professor i going to be very naughty once the pair had left the classroom the couple hidden beneath the table waited for several minutes before scooting out from under the cloth ginny was kind enough to rub the kinks out of draco lower back her hands slid lower he said dryly my arse feels fine yes i know the slight blush on his high cheekbones made her grin he kissed it off she sighed happily when his lips eventually left hers and draco held her in his arms caressing her back the floating on air feeling popped like a soap bubble when he observed with pitying amusement if lorelei ronan whoever thinks that being a bad girl will turn perfect potty off she delusional ickle good boys always go for bad girls just like bad boys go for he broke off with a nervous laugh at the sight of her raised eyebrows ginny narrowed her eyes think i an ickle good girl do you bad boy maybe you dontknow me as well as you think a calculating smile crossed his face before draco said with false casualness oh really well if you d like to show me what you mean i suppose i d be agreeable her mouth stopped the transparent attempt at slytherin cunning with a bold gryffindor kiss sliding her fingers into silken hair positioned his lips just where she wanted them her tongue given permission to be as wicked as it wanted did things she d only thought of before until his lips and body hardened and the embrace became something her mother would decry as bad but felt so deliciously good she was walking on the beach with harry holding his hand and enjoying the way the balmy wind gently blew her long hair the boy beside her picked up a shell and showed it to her luna smiled and then frowned a melody carried to them upon the breeze haunting and disturbingly alluring harry dropped her hand and started walking toward the music she had to hurry to catch up around the curve they both stopped and stared upon one of the rocks jutting from the ocean a mermaid with pearly white skin and shimmering scales was combing her hair she was singing a song without words that managed to convey a sensual promise that captivated the male listener the siren pushed her long black wavy locks behind her shoulders luna gasped her blue gaze darted to her companion face his glazed emerald eyes and open mouth told her he appreciated the impressive view his sigh caught the attention of the enchantress lush red lips parted in invitation the mermaid slid off the rock and into the water diving down with a swish of an iridescent tail she reappeared in the water close by the couple wet her hair was transformed into long spirals eyes the colour of black pearls entreated as she held out her arms and beckoned seductively harry in a daze the boy started removing his clothing luna gaped in disbelief when harry walked into the waves her stunned look moved from the pile of clothes in her arms to the cute white backside diving into the water numbly she watched the boy remain afloat in the siren embrace witnessed them kissing passionately the sound of hoof beats drew her gaze to where a rider on a white stallion was galloping down the beach toward her the man dressed in black slowed and then stopped beside her mind whirling all luna could think to say was why are you wearing a mask the rider golden blond hair was uncovered when he took off the scarf like mask and tucked the black silk into a pocket he said they re very comfortable and quite handy for disguising identity pirates whose features are known soon find themselves taking a long drop with a short stop bright blue eyes twinkled while a white smile framed by dimples flashed luna saw that he was a teenager like herself and was even more drawn to the pirate he bent down and pulled her up before him on his horse his lips quirked while he tossed the clothes and glasses down upon the sand and told her in a pleasant voice filled with mirth your companion probably wontbe wearing those again the lovely siren is married to a kraken the moment she finds a friend the fish swim to tell the monster and well he shrugged and kicked the stallion into motion in the distance she could see a ship luna glanced over to where harry was floating perplexed and distressed the girl asked the boy who looked ready to burst into laughter well what what does the kraken do the droll voice that made her smile spoke by her ear if lover boys dontget to shore fast enough he eats them i ve lost two of the crew that way this voyage at her gasp of horror the chuckling pirate snapped the reigns and urged the stallion into a full gallop a horrible roar echoed behind followed by silence then a mermaid singing and a sea monster growling followed by silence once more straining her ears the girl heard a faint luna travel down the beach simultaneously amused and relieved she looked up into merry blue eyes and smiled where are we going a golden brow lifted it was incredibly dashing the appealing lips that were so close to hers parted bent close and murmured to my ship i a pirate you re my plunder any objections she shook her head yes then no she wondered aloud what the name of your ship the only one i ve ever heard of is the revenge pulling up next to a rowboat on the beach the pirate dismounted and swung her down to join him on the sand he gave her a smilingly chiding look revenge what good is that no luna my ship the true love it was hard to think when he pulled her close and a warm palm caressed her cheek but she made the effort and asked why name a pirate ship true love because nothing can stop true love the most anything can do is delay it awhile her heart turned over pulling his head down to hers luna kissed him his lips stilled in surprise and then moved in a way that made her fingers tighten in his hair how nice plundering was after he put his mask back on the boy pulled another one out of a saddlebag ever think of being a pirate you d look lovely in black she laughed and allowed him to tie on the mask of silk it was very comfortable she put a hand up to his face and said wonderingly what your name he grinned engagingly dontyou know the sound of giggling woke luna from her dream the dread pirate roberts had just helped her out of her corset so she could change into something more comfortable she d been eyeing the black silk sheets on a bunk big enough for two when the captain cabin had dissolved into a boring four poster bed are you awake lindy cindy cheerful voice was grating today trying not to sound irritable luna replied i am now silence greeted her response hmmm maybe she had not done such a good job at hiding her resentment amused at her unaccustomed grouchiness luna stuck her head out of her bed curtains and asked did you fix sunday brunch cindy it the only thing i ll be happy to have a dream disturbed for cindy giggled oh yes lindy we wouldnthave uh interrupted otherwise the three witches broke into cackles bindy put a hand to her forehead and imitated oh wesley luna gaze slanted to mindy who seemed to be laughing half heartedly at best luna frowned mindy had turned wesley down so if she wanted him at this late date it was too bad slightly alarmed at the possessive feelings she had for a boy she didnteven call her boyfriend luna made an effort to take the teasing cheerfully they sat down at the table in the centre of the room and began to eat tearing off a bite of croissant luna turned the conversation to bindy new romance with her gryffindor oh neville the sweetest the pleasantly rounded face glowed happily as bindy gushed we have so much in common and he the best kisser the smile on luna face froze when mindy challenged so how good a kisser is roberts lindy or do we even have to ask with you sighing oh wesley in your sleep luna thought how washed out strawberry blonde hair looked when compared to ginny vibrant red no you shouldnthave to ask you could know but instead you chose to run after someone who already has a girlfriend mindy said rumour has it terry doesnt have a girlfriend anymore no one seen zabini in the hall and he spends every night either with the quidditch team or up in his room so if i choose to run after him he fair game luna fingers twisted her linen napkin i was in the train compartment when terry said he needed some time to think about things he didntbreak up with blaise so he not fair game mindy tossed her hair i know you ve been hanging around that slytherin so i understand your loyalty but really did you see that picture in your father paper there no way terry is going to take that girl back so when he officially dumps her i plan on giving him some comfort and if you dontlike it sorry the singsong way mindy said sorry was so infuriating luna was glad she didnthave her wand handy the witch might not have any hair to flip with attitude if she did before she could do something rash like toss her juice into the other girl face her other friends intervened do you like my eggs benedict i dontknow if the sauce came out right some of the spells in that stewart woman meals in minutes it magic cookery book dontturn out well bindy nodded at cindy comment i know i thought maybe it was because she a yank and some of the words are spelt a bit differently but i dunno i heard her muggle cookery books are wonky too the girls talked conjuring cooking and agreed that oliver the magically naked chef was the best luna didntknow if it was because his spells came out perfectly or because the photograph on the cover would lose its clothing whenever a buyer said a specific charm whichever the ploy to distract mindy from her bad mood didntwork she just came at luna from a different direction did everyone hear about harry potter and the new girl one of our seventh years heard from a fifth year whose cousin is a sixth year gryffindor that the two were shouting yesterday morning in their common room and awoke the whole house everyone heard the girl screaming that potter was obsessed and he shouted back stopping abruptly the falsely contrite girl simpered hearing this doesnt upset you does it lindy cindy shook her head at mindy what your problem today you know luna had a crush on potter forever it not nice to rub it in her face if he going with someone else bindy said i think that cousin doesntknow what they re talking about neville told me the new girl ronan is very nice anyway how could harry be so crazy about a girl he only known through distressed she halted and bit her lip through what all three of the other girls asked reluctantly bindy finished in a low sad voice through her sister professor lorelei and letters it seems they ve been pen friends for ages or so harry said to neville yesterday luna thanked cindy for brunch and silently gathered her clothing in the shower she tried to let her tears flow with the water but couldntcry it hurt too badly to think of harry feeling for someone else what she had wanted him to feel for her maybe her dream had been a premonition of things to come if that girl had long black hair she would know for sure wouldntit be funny if some of that divination mumbo jumbo turned out to be true not funny ha ha but it would definitely be funny peculiar luna disregarded the stares of her roommates as she hooked silver radish earrings into her lobes and tucked long strands behind her ears so they were displayed for the world to see downstairs terry and wesley were sitting on a sofa she went over and sat down beside the boy whose face lit up when he saw her lifting her hand to his lips her friend said ready to go to the library luna nodded she asked terry have you seen blaise he shook his head and said that morrigan told him last night that blaise had been sleeping on and off since friday afternoon but was sure to come to the hall today for lunch terry looked edgy and excited he jumped up and announced that he was going to go take another shower and find something better to wear watching his mate rush up the boys staircase wesley smiled and extended a hand to luna when they reached the library he asked any book you need in particular a history of magic text back near the restricted section their steps halted when they heard a girl say stop crowding me harry i cantbreathe luna drew in a sharp breath as harry said i canthelp it i want to be close to you taking a step forward luna angled her head to see a boy with unruly hair pressing a girl with long black wavy locks against the bookshelf he bent his head and tried to kiss her turning her face away the girl said oh harry backing up rapidly luna felt the other girl words said it all oh harry wesley looked grimly in the direction of the other couple before meeting her sad gaze and winking grasping her by the shoulders bright blue eyes twinkled into hers as he said thrillingly my gods luna you re driving me insane i ve got to kiss you right here and now and i dontgive a damn who sees us the boy waggled his brows roguishly and lowered his mouth to hers thanking merlin for gorgeous pirates who saved maidens from having to watch supposed white knights run after sirens luna threw her arms around wesley neck and kissed him back with everything she had the appreciative growl he gave as his tongue swirled with hers told her what she had was what he wanted she continued to kiss him even after hearing a soft feminine oh a curt male voice said excuse us harry elbow jabbed wesley as he passed and he muttered to the girl that maybe he should tell pince students were having it off near the restricted section his companion told him he was a hypocritical arse and flounced away he hurried after her calling ronan wondering how she could feel so gutted and happy at the same time luna stared into wesley understanding eyes she reached up to caress his cheek thanks kissing you is all the thanks i need dimples appeared actually i should be thanking potter for being the hypocritical arse he is chuckling he asked humorously was there something we came to the library for i cantremember now luna pulled wesley by the hand between the stacks snogging early sunday morning blaise was determined to gather her courage and talk to terry yesterday she d spent most of her time sleeping or lounging in bed except twice when commotions in the common room had interested her enough to drag on a robe and stumble downstairs the first time students had screeched while loud bangs echoed outside morrigan and fiona filled her in someone probably gryffindors had sprinkled a kind of powder all down the corridor that sparked and made loud snaps when people walked on it no one had been hurt but a first year boy had wet his pants blaise had privately admired that prank not that she d ever tell anyone except maybe ginny blaise rolled out of bed and quickly made it with her wand deciding to take a shower after she came back she grabbed the black leather outfit that draco had called vampire chic when her mother had given it to her for her birthday she dressed pulled on her leather boots and left the room after picking up her matching leather coat downstairs the lone boy sitting on a sofa looked up and asked smilingly where are you going she smiled back at him wondering how she could have been indifferent to his offer of friendship drugs they were just as bad as people said they were her smile brought an answering one to his face he said in a tone that reminded her of music and magic for some odd reason you are going to greet the day again may i come with you was there a female who had ever told him no oh right she had blaise said yes kieran shook his long fringe out of his eyes i dressed in a black to be appropriately attired just in case he offered his arm in an old fashioned gesture they walked together in comfortable silence as if they were old friends outside cassandra group sat staring incredulously before handing cass sickles kieran told her roommate disapprovingly you should not take money from your friends they cannot help being unbelievers pale skin became pink as the girl who wasntwearing black eyeliner or black lipstick today rolled her eyes she gave the other four back their sickles blaise repressed a chuckle when cassandra told them to sit down and shut up kieran sat beside the girl and told her warmly you look much prettier without the blackness on your face wow what a compliment i under whelmed the bright pink blush on cass cheeks belied the words she scowled at her gawking friends and told lexx to play the damn guitar he grinned sure thing pulling out a pair of sunglasses and placing them on her face blaise listened to the boy sing a melancholy song as the sun rays washed over their faces blaise stomach started knotting that would be how she d feel if terry didntlove her anymore stop kieran hugged her and glared at lexx your song is making blaise sad inclining his head toward the girl on the other side of cassandra he said it makes scarlett sad too she thinks you will never ask her to go with you lexx head turned so fast his spiky hair looked alive what scarlett you never said anything tossing her long reddish black hair the girl stood throwing over her shoulder you never said anything either lexx got up and followed her inside those left on the stairs sat in awkward silence cassandra said well this has been fun her tone sharpened as she watched kieran lean toward blaise what do you think you re doing mesmerised by the bewitching teen fathomless eyes blaise had sat entranced until he touched his lips to hers pulling back she echoed the other girl question ruefully he admitted i sensed you wanted a kiss but i did not know it was another kiss you wanted until i am sorry will you forgive me be my friend blaise rose patting the boy arm she couldntbe mad at kieran he was well intentioned but still she told cassandra you d better keep an eye on our empathy boy if he goes around trying to kiss all the girls and make them happy he wontlast a week you claim to have the sight use it to keep him out of trouble the boy pout that was even more no she refused to admit anyone could pout more adorably than draco could blaise told the group she d see them later cassandra matter of factly informed her she would come to the hall for lunch but wouldntbe eating anything hiding her scepticism blaise said okay thanks and left to go have breakfast with her other friends when it came time to enter the hall for lunch she froze the same way she had in her dream are we gonna stand here all day or are you gonna stop being chicken shit and open the door what morrigan is trying to say fiona said with a glare at the blunt girl is things will work out so open the door all right taking a deep breath blaise put out her hand and then paused morrigan brushed past her muttering for crying out loud follow us in chickie blaise glanced down at her jumper and short skirt sure i look okay you look tan and sexy i hate you shut up and get your arse in gear morrigan joking words made blaise relax trying to appear casual as if she hadntgone mental and avoided the hall for a week she sauntered into the chamber behind her friends a glance over at the gryffindor table showed that ginny ron and colin appeared happy to see her she smiled relieved that not all conversation in the place halted while students stared her steps slowed and stopped when she looked for the one person she really wanted to see he wasntthere she asked wesley where s he looked past her shoulder blaise turned to see terry striding down the aisle toward her his hands lifted to frame her face his eyes searched hers she slowly returned his smile after kissing her softly he grinned and placed an arm under her knees and one around her shoulders to lift her up and carry her back down the aisle girlish sighs echoed behind them as he kicked open the door and swept her out of the hall once outside terry put her down we d better run before prefects come after us together they dashed up to the seventh floor terry went through the motions before the room of requirement and opened the door for her when it appeared when they went inside long brown hair swung as he looked around in disbelief except for a few magicked torches on the walls the room was bare stone terry took her hands in his i dontunderstand i concentrated on making the room just the way you needed it to be what went wrong nothing i dontneed anything but you his handsome face twisted with regret he held her close and whispered roughly gods blaise i ve been such a jealous bastard i know you love me and i love you more than anything or anyone i dontwant to live without you anymore tell me you forgive me she pulled back his eyes looked misty too she couldntspeak so she nodded and pressed her lips to his terry kissed her hungrily and she eagerly returned every caress so happy to be in his arms again blaise didntnotice the contours of the room shifting and changing until she was gently lowered onto a soft surface she opened her eyes in confusion that swiftly turned into delight they were in their tree house on the cushioned area they hadnthad a chance to try before lying in terry arms blaise told him how she d tried to cope with unhappiness with a potion and how her friends one in particular had gotten her off it he shared how he d found out who his true friends were surprisingly his quidditch mates made him realise that if they could dislike his girlfriend and still tell him they would support his decision to be with her then he could put up with draco even though he thought her best friend was a snake he might never want to be mates with the guy but he wouldntfight him anymore she tried to tell him how much she loved him and how different that feeling was from any other but he shook his head you donthave to explain sombre blue eyes gazed into hers i ve been jealous of malfoy because he knows you better than i do he spends more time with you than i do and has you defending him against the world i was afraid that you d wake up one day and decide he loves you more than i do too and decide you love him more than me oh terry no he smiled crookedly i ve been reading shakespeare since i ve had so much time on my hands othello another jealous bastard like me not seeing the green eyed monster i dontwant to be like him stroking his cheek smoothing back his hair she tried to reassure you re not and you would never hurt me i already have i ll do my best not to anymore he smiled briefly i even memorised a line in case you ever let me close enough to say it want to hear it yes terry said think st thou i d make a life of jealousy to follow still the changes of the moon with fresh suspicions no his fingers sifted through her curls travelled across her features i ll try my hardest not to be jealous we ll talk things over work things out okay against his mouth she smiled okay and then kissed him while running her hands over his soft jumper and then slipping underneath it to touch the firm warm skin she d missed so much wanting to feel his body against hers she tugged the fabric up he pulled the jumper off to give her full access to every inch of smooth muscle after she d trailed her hands and lips across his torso terry lifted an eyebrow along with the hem of her jumper giggling she peeled the garment off and threw it across the tree house gazing down at the fuchsia bra that matched her skirt he said must confess me like your dress she smiled wickedly me like your undress terry played tarzan once more intense blue eyes obscured by the long strands of brown hair that fell across his handsome face stared down into hers as his mouth twitched at the corner but otherwise maintained his ape man image no more talk more kissing draco sat on a stool in the dungeon classroom monday evening drumming his fingers on the table a glance at snape stilled his impatient motion a giggle was heard outside the door before it opened and blaise practically skipped inside followed by her swaggering ape man tarzan and jane had obviously been making up some more draco curled his lip at the girl wagging an impertinent finger and admonishing them to be good boys he sneered full out when she smiled shyly at the potions master and placed a shiny red apple on his desk before whispering thanks and rushing out of the chamber the silence in the classroom was uncomfortable as the three males were left trying not to catch each other eyes finally professor snape cleared his throat his tone was chilly you have been given detention due to your inability to control yourselves i find it fitting that you test mentitiri potions he rose from his chair the ministry has placed veritaserum under strict regulation but other elixirs can be used to determine truth by other means the name might cause some to believe the solution causes lying but instead it proves truth because to tell a lie after taking a dropper full of this potion causes the user to blush bright red after testing the flagons and recording the results you may leave snape gave them each a stern piercing look i will be in my office and i warn you now if i am disturbed for any reason another week will be added to your detention have i made myself clear yes sir draco knew boot didntwant to be forced to spend extra time together any more than he did snape did too the man sallow face wore an expression of satisfaction that would curdle milk the professor exited the chamber in a swish of black robes after lining up the flagons for testing and choosing a quill and parchment to record their findings on boot picked up a potion he read the name while extending the flagon and a dropper hermione madison in order to keep peace draco took the potion and drank a dropper full that picture of you and blaise dancing were you trying to seduce her no immediately draco felt his face heat defensively he qualified his answer at that moment i was but i glad the picture was taken glad i didntgo through with it his skin felt normal again a white blond eyebrow lifted as he nodded to the other potions after boot had recorded the positive reaction the muscles in the ravenclaw face tightened as he took a dose after reading kate aelys did you ask because you re jealous of me no boot face turned red it only confirmed what draco already knew but it was amusing to have it out in the open when another dropper was administered boot asked if i was your girlfriend best mate would you be jealous of me of course not touching his hot face in disbelief draco said iliana moranar potion worked so i see ask a question so we can tell if julia nazgul brewed her potion correctly tarzan was looking a bit too complacent draco drawled have you had it off with blaise no he rephrased the question have you thought about it never my how bright that blush was something in boot expression made draco nervous to swallow the next dropper liquid you sneak around to see your girlfriend is it because you like lying and deceiving yes damn now tarzan knew he disliked sneaking around glancing away he waited for the blush to subside and the other boy to rub it in boot said becky sue kitsune test was positive i ll try jenny roses draco asked would you sneak around to be with blaise if you had to no the flush on boot face made draco feel slightly better as he waited to test a dropper of solution would you give up blaise if ginny got jealous and didntwant you to be friends anymore yes feeling like his face was on fire draco grabbed a potion uncorked it with a terse mina richie s and handed a dropper to the other boy to drink the ape man looked uneasy now good he demanded did you ask blaise to stop being my friend no huh no reaction try again did you think about it no and my face should be red so richie potion was unsuccessful at least the jealous possessive bastard admitted that he d thought about it probably knew she wouldntgive her best mate up so he caved like the cave man he was a little voice inside that sounded eerily like lucius drawled look who talking the amazing ferret who caved to a weasel because she cantbear to upset her ickle friends and family with the likes of you you re just as scared of losing your girl as he is love god draco accepted the dose of lenora ayse s potion and quietly answered no to the question of did he force the former slytherin captain to resign surprisingly boot saw his flush and said good montague a worse bastard than you ll ever be he got a nasty habit of picking on any bloke he thinks is pretty fourth year during the yule ball he came up to me in the lavatory sneered at my beautiful hair and asked if i was a nancy what did you do i told him to get the hell away from me and if i ever heard he d bothered anyone else everyone in school would hear about his interest in nancy boys as far as i know he behaved himself since then draco felt a disquieting twinge of something that felt disturbingly like respect he quickly picked up holly lunarian s flagon and passed it over determined to ignore the uncomfortable feeling until it went away after the potions were all tested and duly recorded the two boys cleaned the flagons and returned them to the storage cupboard placing the parchment on snape desk boot said offhandedly see you later even more casually draco replied yeah right whatever see you tarzan bounded up the dungeon stairway eager to find his woman sling her over his shoulder and go make up some more no doubt draco made his way upstairs to where ginny was waiting at a more dignified pace the sight of her standing at the bottom of the steps to the seventh floor pausing for him to join her caused his civilized mind to be taken over by a primitive urge stalking over to her he swept her up into his arms her hands slid around his neck while she stared at his implacable face and asked why he remembered how much she d once liked his playful threat to carry her out of the broomsticks his gaze flickered for an instant to her face before he said you hesitated draco was relieved that he d reached the top stair with his captive because something she saw in his eyes made ginny go limp in his arms head falling back and hair spilling over his arm like a red waterfall a swift glance revealed that her eyes were closed and a smile curved her lips he smiled in male satisfaction and walked by the stretch of wall concealing the room of requirement three times he had to ask his girlfriend twice to open the door for them the first time she d dreamily murmured hmmm inside the room a grin flashed across the face of the boy now dressed in chain mail and boots with spurs his hand tightened on the hilt of his sword when the fair maiden looked down at her green velvet dress she rubbed the material of the full skirt lifted it to see the pearls sewn on her shoes and smiled as she looked around the medieval chamber it was filled with tapestries an enormous fireplace and clean rushes upon the floor draco led ginny to the cushioned window seat where he threw a lyre an embroidery hoop and a psalter off the bench so his love could sit bending on one knee before her he thought fleetingly that he was fortunate not to be rigged out in bloody armour ginny removed the circlet keeping a length of gauzy material covering her hair and tossed it onto the pile of unwanted items she asked simply why drawing a sword out of its scabbard draco lifted it before allowing it to drop to the floor it was heavier than it looked sometimes i wish i was a black knight then at least i could fight for you and if your family refused to accept me i d steal you away and marry you force them to acknowledge that we belong together i watched boot carry off blaise yesterday and i envied him i wanted to carry you off too but i couldn t so i did this soft hands caressed his face i sorry i so selfish wanting to be with you and wanting to find a way to make everyone okay with it i wish it didnthave to be this way i promise it wontbe forever he kissed her tears away and held her close until she murmured could the mail come off it not very comfortable it was also heavy and a pain in the arse to remove by the time ginny helped him drag the cumbersome garment of linked chains over his head they were both panting with effort giggling his girlfriend ran a hand over the dragon embroidered in red on the chest of his black velvet tunic sitting on the window seat and pulling her onto his lap he growled got a thing for a dragon do you i love him the tight burning sensation that had been hurting draco chest ever since the inner voice had sneered at him eased he showed his gratitude to his fair maiden with tender kisses that turned devouring as his fingertips smoothed over the skin exposed by the low round neck of her dress and the medieval lack of undergarments he whispered hotly i love you ginny you re my treasure and you know what a dragon does with his treasure dontyou dazed brown eyes blinked melts it a rumble of laughter escaped definitely something to consider his face became serious as he looked into her eyes and promised he clutches it tight and never lets it go her lips trembled and then pressed against his until he felt they both melted a n yes i love my reviewers so much i even mosh their names together for the students whose potions got tested ah eee ah i so relieved tarzan and jane are back together the must confess me like your dress is based on a line from a fave book of piers anthony ogre ogre i felt bad wrenching them apart but it was for a good cause and i ll make it up to them not a speck of trouble until after spring break when oh naughty me getting ahead of the story they ve all got so much to do before then chapter 27 with a little help from my friends blaise paced behind the statue of bertha the behemoth while she waited for a certain boy to pass by the corridors were chilly on the last thursday morning in january but she wasntmoving to try and keep warm instead the physical action reflected her inner agitation was she really going to do this a slim gryffindor was approaching she stepped into the shadow of bertha generous backside and whispered psssttt creevey colin get over here she pulled him out of the sight of the passing students he asked what up blaise looked away to screw her courage to the sticking place as shakespeare would put it i just wanted to say thanks for being so erm nice when i was you know out of it colin face became angelic when he smiled which made her suspicious i didntmind hanging out with you in the library you did some helped me with my homework it was an hour or two every night and no one wants to hang with a zombie not even for tutoring just admit it you were being a friend and i think you re really blaise narrowed her eyes if you tell anyone i said this i will hex you but you were sweet and now i feel like i owe you one colin smiled you want to pay me back is that it yeah what did you have in mind his eyes were almost on the same level as hers they were twinkling he wanted to make her to say it she bent the slight distance between them muttering irritably inuit friendship ritual after frowning at the boy chuckling at her euphemism for eskimo kissing she rubbed the tip of her nose against the tip of his nose and then continued up its length once he felt the slide of her skin against his colin stopped laughing and a glint appeared in his eyes she recognised that gleam from when he had looked at her with draco face alarmed but determined to go through with the thing she lowered her gaze to the nose hers was gliding along slowly blaise told herself the movement was friendly not sensual the way colin held her face in his hands while he took over the ritual and thrust his nose along hers in a firm pressing motion was just extremely friendly when he backed her against the statue however that was too friendly blaise forcibly pushed the puppy away incorrigible he laughed was my nose as good as malfoy s she backed away and rolled her eyes apples and oranges fifth year malfoy is a classic perfect apple and you smiling at the way his face fell she said you re an adorable orange he flashed a smug grin blaise said that doesntmean i want to squeeze you creevey that okay rubbing me was thanks enough especially since you already agreed to sing another song in muggle studies with me her jaw dropped what i never oh last wednesday you wanted me to look at some song lyrics but i dontremember agreeing to sing did you look at the song the duet between one of the weird sisters and the lead singer of a werewolf band yeah the lyrics were simple and sad i cantsing the girl part though it too bloody high i ll sing it then and you can sing the bloke part it doesntmatter her heart sank when he smiled angelically the little devil i told professor hands we d sing it in class today so you might want to practise as colin strutted past her blaise wondered how she got herself into these kinds of messes then she remembered she was the biggest sucker in slytherin house inside the hall she pretended the gryffindor table didntexist terry dark blue eyes brightened when he saw her causing her a twinge of guilt over rubbing another boy nose even in friendship blaise made herself feel better by stopping and giving her boyfriend a brief but heart felt kiss before gliding on to sit by draco she asked goyle if he was looking forward to hogsmeade weekend he answered out of the corner of a mouth stuffed with food sure that scintillating conversation over blaise tried to pretend she was incredibly interested in her breakfast it didntwork draco bumped his shoulder into hers you re doing a good job of covering boot doesntsuspect a thing but i ve known you too long what did you do i thanked creevey for sitting with me in the library every night when i was mental white blond eyebrows lifted how exactly did you thank the little pervert if you think he was just being an ickle nice boy you are still mental one of those nights i caught him being nice by holding your hand and kissing it she stared i dontremember that you dontremember a lot of things including creevey looking at you the way a necrophiliac looks at a girl corpse that not yet stiff eeuwww that disgusting i agree so again what did you do determined to take the memory of the second inuit friendship ritual to her grave blaise made a face i going to sing another song with him in muggle studies hufflepuff her lower lip poked out why was she such a sap the next time she ran into creevey she was going to shove him into a wall well she d ignore him at least draco chuckled and tapped her bottom lip with a fingertip stop pouting and remember to keep your hufflepuff tendencies in check except when it comes to me her giggles made crabbe and goyle laugh too spraying pansy and millicent with bits of egg and making them shriek in anger humour restored blaise asked enjoying detention the way draco upper right lip curled reminded her of his mother or a muggle rocker named billy idol on him disdain looked good enduring detention actually who besides a lovesick fool like you would enjoy testing potions with an ape man not wanting to embarrass him with her girly sentimentality she said while picking up a berry terry told me you wouldntgive up our friendship thanks all part of being friends lifelong good or bad she laughed right or wrong what are you talking about the cool demanding voice behind them made blaise jump snape clipped i came to excuse you from your detention tonight mr malfoy i will be away and therefore will not see you again next week you may report to flitwick for the remainder of your detention the shrewd gaze narrowed i ask again to what were you referring with your talk of good or bad right or wrong draco said calmly while avoiding the potion master gaze nothing sir it only a silly rhyme blaise fought the compulsion to look into snape eyes she knew he would see something she didntwant him to if she did like the image of a candlelit room after a tense moment the professor said i hope for your sakes it was only a silly rhyme if it was something else such as dark magic sometimes referred to by ignorant children as love magic i would be very displeased should she nod her head or shake it apparently their confusion was reassuring to the sardonic teacher who bid them good day before stalking down to give terry the good news of the cancelled detention draco said yeah right love magic friendship rituals are not dark snape an old woman jumping at shadows i not going to let him ruin my plans for the weekend blaise nodded her agreement and leaned out to return terry warm smile that afternoon in muggle studies she stood beside creevey while he strummed his guitar a darting glance revealed that ginny was snorting like a weasel behind her hand and luna was trying not to laugh the rest of the class was waiting eagerly for the odd couple to sing another song for their twisted enjoyment blaise shot a dagger filled glare at the boy who should have been ducking instead he sat up straighter and looked even more eager after he finished the intro she sighed inwardly and sang her part of broken the song was about a broken romance a few of the girls wiped away tears while they sang strangely cheered by the stricken expressions of the class blaise muttered at the end dontexpect any more thanks creevey his pseudo innocent gaze made her want to smack him with his guitar for the rest of class she drew hearts with zb tb inside them onto parchment blaise listened with half an ear as hands pontificated on about how heartened he was to know that after his brilliant tutelage they were all satisfactorily knowledgeable on the subject of shakespeare much ado about nothing is there anything you would care to add miss zabini she said for man is a giddy thing and this is my conclusion blaise met ginny smiling gaze and continued i did think to have beaten thee but in that thou art like to be my kinsman live unbruised and love my cousin soft brown eyes looked astounded as if the freckle faced beatrice hadntconnected the dots between the play and her matchmaking friends until just now after an open mouthed moment ginny smiled from ear to ear blaise winked then looked at luna and thought of how potter was making an arse out of himself over another girl she quoted the last lines of the play they were very apt think not on him till to morrow i ll devise thee brave punishments for him impulsively she stood and told colin strike up the pipers colin began playing some muggle tune a song asking if they were going to scarborough fair he sang in a lilting rhythm that sounded like something shakespeare would have liked luna smiled mistily and rose to her feet holding out a hand to ginny and blaise she said dreamily come come we are friends let have a dance that we may lighten our hearts they danced up the aisle and then around colin in a circle to the applause of the class and the genial approval of the professor who seemed to get a victorian thrill out of seeing feminine wrists and ankles only the three girls knew why they were laughing so hard and having so much fun as luna talked to wesley at dinner she realised that sitting next to a charming pirate was lovely in many ways feeling his thigh press against hers was one being able to look into his merry blue eyes and see the smile that made her day brighter was another added to the other benefits was having her back to harry potter not being able to see the former boy of her dreams sitting by the girl she tried not to hate made the meal that much more pleasant she listened to wesley and terry talk about the upcoming saturday with a content smile it was hogsmeade weekend and blaise wanted to have a picnic in the shrieking shack the boys were mulling the idea over wesley asked how about you luna are you willing to brave the shrieking shack for a picnic she hid a smile just a picnic golden eyebrows waggled her pulse accelerated we could play spin the bottle or truth or dare i know what i d dare you to do a blush crept up her chest and heated her cheeks wesley smiled in a way that made her long to touch his dimples with her tongue do you think i d dare you to do something naughty smart girl a commotion two tables over made the ravenclaws turn their heads and stare luna insides twisted harry potter and that girl were arguing mouths dropped and eyes widened when the girl tossed her pumpkin juice into harry face students gasped when he returned the gesture averting her eyes from the food fight that spread to the entire gryffindor table luna eyes met wesley s he smiled hearing mcgonagall shout for order when the two instigators were banished to their house he leaned close to be heard over the roar of gossip if we ever play with food i promise not to throw it i ll feed it to you a bowl of strawberries appeared on the table oh dear had the elves taken her desire literally the boy chuckling beside her was reaching for one with his elegant fingers when mindy spiteful voice was heard my my how stormy and passionate potter is about his new girlfriend dontyou agree luna agree with what the bared teeth presented as a smile reminded luna of a rabid animal that needed to be put down agree that you ve never seen harry potter so hot and bothered over a girl before and that they re probably having it off right this minute right this minute i dontthink the stairs would be very comfortable luna said mildly how interested you are in other people love lives i suppose it because you donthave one of your own i could have one if if you werentsuch a bitch that no one would have you unless you got a personality transplant or an exorcism luna smiled thinly true but i bet i see a crumpled horn snorkack before that happens wesley stood and pulled luna away outside the hall he let go of her arm and bent over laughing until he had to wipe tears from the corners of his eyes his laughter was so infectious she chuckled too he lifted her off the floor in a hug and spun her around merlin you re beautiful when you re angry i bow before your wit and beauty she giggled to see his elaborate bow his words made her feel like a bold wench so luna took wesley hand and led him up the stairs to the room that was just what she needed he examined the moth eaten tapestry of a wizard being clubbed by trolls with lifted brow trying to teach trolls ballet barmy eyes that were bluer than the sea after a storm narrowed where did that door come from it wasntthere before it the door to the room of requirement flashing dimples wesley said i ve always wondered if this room was real or just another school legend what inside come and see he gallantly opened the door and waved her inside luna walked into the room and felt the ocean breeze saw the sun setting in brilliant colours on the horizon she was viewing from the deck of the only pirate ship in the world named true love looking down she laughed the bodice of her gown was square necked and scandalously low it was made of some thin material that clung to her legs in a way that made it clear no petticoats were underneath a gentle touch at the base of her neck where a curl had escaped her upswept hair made her spin around and forget to breathe wesley was oh wesley dressed in black from head to toe he gestured to his outfit with a black gloved hand i glad i finally got round to reading that princess bride book who knows what i might have thought otherwise perhaps that you have a fetish for masked men luna emboldened by his smile and the fantasy brought to life raised his hand to her lips and kissed the palm you must admit you make a wonderful dread pirate roberts he pulled her close everyone knows the dread pirate roberts never takes prisoners buttercup i not your prisoner he looked away to where the sun was bathing the horizon in a reddish glow that spread across the ocean when he glanced back his eyes searched hers wesley said in a light tone contradicted by the seriousness of his eyes you ve taken me prisoner luna or to be more exact bold pirate lass that you are you ve captured my heart and the rest of me comes with it she looked down her gown had changed into a black shirt and breeches tucked into boots she was a pirate luna reached up and touched her mask pulled it off her face and felt her hair fall down her heart was thudding the wind picked up and blew long strands of hair into a curtain separating them tender hands brushed them aside in wesley eyes she saw everything she d wanted to see in harry but never had she shook her head why his brows drew together why not do you think because potter blind everyone else is too we ve spent enough time together that i think i know you you re beautiful and smart loyal and brave funny and his face became intent every time i see you i want to kiss you and every time i kiss you i never want to stop i dontwant to be your kissing friend anymore i want to be your boyfriend the sky became cloudy while the sea began to get choppy waves broke against the side of the ship splashing the couple staring into each other eyes luna wanted to reach for what wesley was offering but she knew she would have to let go of the dream of a love someday with harry and she had clung to that hope for so long luna braced herself as the deck began to tilt with the force of the waves she watched a barrel roll over the side and float away she made a decision and the joy it gave far outweighed the sadness the wind became soft and balmy she moved close and reached up to caress the face that meant so much to her she whispered if i have your heart it only fair that you take mine untying his mask luna reached up to brush wesley lips with hers she slid her hands up his chest wesley deepened the kiss as they sailed into the sunset lovingly he murmured as you wish later after practically floating up the girls staircase in happiness luna found her three roommates waiting up for her mindy face was red and splotchy from crying bindy and cindy stood with crossed arms looking at the other girl bindy prompted wasntthere something you wanted to say mindy sniffing and pushing back her hair mindy took a step toward luna i sorry for being so hateful i was jealous because you have wesley and i donthave anybody because her pale face crumpled because i a b bitch that needs a per personality transplant or an exorcism luna almost smiled how silly those words sounded now cindy eyes sparkled over the hand she was keeping over her mouth bindy said i could go to the library and look up personality transplant spells for you what kind of person do you want to be instead please dontpick dumb blonde or blonde bimbo or blonde bombshell cindy offered in an exaggeratedly breathy dumb blonde voice i could do an exorcism i think i watched a muggle film once so if i could find some holy water she scratched her head how do you put holes in water mindy gave a watery smile luna handed her a much needed handkerchief saying thoughtfully you know snorkacks haventbeen spotted in over two hundred years i think there a good chance that we could find a boy who thinks bitchy is sexy before someone actually sees one really luna smiled she knew a blond gryffindor who seemed to think snarky was sexy maybe he would like bitchy too the thought of colin and mindy made her chuckle as the friends all hugged and changed into their nightclothes before climbing into their beds before she dreamt of the sexy pirate roberts helping her out of a corset luna thought of a way to introduce mindy to colin and whispered laughingly once a matchmaker always a matchmaker all day thursday ginny felt like something bad was going to happen she had felt what her gran had called twinges before and they were no bloody good for anything other than to give her warning to brace herself like when she d picked up that diary of tom riddle s or when her father had been bitten the day umbridge arrived she d felt a twinge and the day sirius ginny shook off morbid thoughts and decided to do something unusual after dinner homework normally she ran off to study the way draco body felt beneath his robes and how long she could kiss him without coming up for air ginny was blessed with bill ability to speed read and could study for tests or toss off essays and other assignments in a fraction of the time it took ron the skill had come in handy schoolwork was something she rushed through in order to learn more about her favourite subject draco malfoy inside her dorm room ginny sat at her desk and speedily read two yawn inducing history of magic chapters scratched out an essay and worked through a page of arithmancy equations setting aside her quill and rolling her parchments up with a thankful sigh she glanced at her timepiece draco had a quidditch workout and strategy session and wouldntbe meeting her for another hour whatever could she do until then her gaze drifted over to her bed she grinned and jumped on it pulling the curtains shut and lying in the shrouded interior with a dreamy smile on her face if she couldntbe with her boyfriend daydreaming about him was the next best thing closing her eyes a vivid scene flashed into ginny mind she was the daughter of a saxon lord from her tower room she watched norman invaders pour into the courtyard below they had battered down the gates brown eyes darted around the chamber and fixed on the hunting knife one of her six brothers had left for her protection she grasped the handle and hid it within the folds of her skirt outside her chamber men shouted and then a horrible thud sounded they were breaking down her door standing with her back to the wall beside her window seat the maid delicate face tightened in determination she waited to see the face of the man who would try and claim her he would meet his death instead lock broken the door swung open and a knight strode into the chamber her fingers clenched around the hilt until the man took off his helmet staring at the white blond hair framing the face of a fallen angel the maiden remembered how they had met at a tournament in france this knight had lost the final joust to her eldest brother but he had won her heart at the feast the norman had promised to ask her father for her hand in marriage but instead had left in the night she shouted liar craven base privy foul cur how dare you show your face in england after breaking your vow to me and leaving for another bloody tournament without a word you you silvery eyes glinted betrayed suitor who met with your father and learned that milord would send you to a nunnery ere he allowed you to marry norman scum who was beaten nigh unto death by your cowardly brothers and left in a ditch to die his spurs clinked when he walked toward her eyes blazing didst thou think i would give up my wife so easily my prisoners wait below with the priest they will witness our marriage and then removing a gauntlet the man touched her soft cheek slid his fingers into her red hair as he smiled with wicked tenderness we will have our second wedding night her hand released the dagger it clattered onto the floor the moment his lips parted hers she held tight to the only man she had ever loved and vowed she would never allow her family to separate them again the knowledge that he had never willingly left her had fought to reclaim her healed her wounded heart and filled her with such overwhelming love that she backed toward the bed with a beguiling smile why dontwe tarry and make it our third wedding night never had she imagined a knight could disrobe so speedily i telling you the picture i took with my goblin spy camera will get us all the galleons we need to invest for our own studio once we leave this so called place of learning about to open her curtains and blast the roommate who had ruined the best bloody daydream of her life ginny paused when the words registered a cold twinge shuddered down her spine she sat up and wrapped her arms around her knees listening but ros what if zabini wontpay to get the photograph ginny didntneed to part the curtains to imagine her blonde roommate talking to her sister esmee a shy brunette seventh year who always followed where her sister led the satisfaction that couldntbe seen on rosaline kell face could be heard in her voice our little rich girl will pay esmee that ravenclaw she mental about almost dumped her over a tame picture he ll never speak to her again if he sees the one i took of zabini and malfoy practically having it off cool laughter rang out hesitant chuckles followed before esmee asked but what if something happens to that photograph it the only one and since goblin film develops magically cantbe copied what if you sat your teacup on it or spilled pumpkin juice or i too smart for that although it sounds like something you d do i ve got a secret hiding place for my little investment and the only way zabini will lay her hands on it is if she pays and pays quickly if this works out i ll try it one more time with professor lorelei that shot of her snogging some bloke while he felt her up should be worth a thousand galleons at least have you sent zabini the note yet what if she traces it an exasperated sigh was heard i had it flown in by owl at dinner so no she canttrace it come along i want to develop some more film i experimenting with double exposures canti go paint instead ros i dontlike smelly chemicals zip it esmee paint tomorrow when there more light so you wontstrain your eyes the voices were at the door now more light but arentwe going to a darkroom ouch why d you pinch me ros ginny waited for footsteps to fade resisting the urge to go hex the devious rosaline until she spilled the location of the photograph she wondered what to do a knock on the door sounded a timid girl voice said hulloo is anyone in here colin creevey asked me to come up and tell ginny to come downstairs says someone wants to talk to you in the corridor outside so i guess i ll tell him i told er someone ginny opened the bed curtains and waved to the third year one of many giggly younger girls who thought colin cute and followed her downstairs as if she was taking a trip to madame guillotine at the bottom of the staircase colin said thanks genevieve i mean gillian georgina the girl looked ecstatic that he finally had her name right ginny thanked georgina too as she allowed colin to drag her outside a hooded cloaked figure stood in the shadows around the corner from the entrance corridor a slender hand held out an envelope the paper looked white against honey coloured skin ginny took the note and began to read some pictures are worth a thousand words the picture i took of you and malfoy on new year eve is worth twice that in galleons all that kissing and groping would be very upsetting to a loved one if you dontwant the photograph falling into the wrong hands exchange the galleons for the picture behind the hog head tavern saturday at one come alone could you even get that kind of money colin asked blaise pushed her hood down sure doesntmatter though i wouldntgive two galleons much less two thousand what i need is for you to tell me if you know who took the picture red and help me figure out a way to stop them the couple of times that draco had called blaise a kindler gentler lady macbeth ginny had thought him joking the look on the slytherin girl face made her realise he wasn t she said unhappily it roommate rosaline kells and her sister esmee draco and i saw ros at the party bumped into her on the way back from the veranda where ginny took a deep breath i didntmean to and she had a spy camera there only one picture i heard her tell that to esmee up in our dorm i was hidden on my bed behind the curtains i so sorry that nice ginevra but not much help now at the beginning of school that cold drawl would have made her mad caused her to storm away knowing the intense feelings slytherins like draco and blaise sometimes hid behind an icy facade ginny placed her hand on the other girl arm encouraged when it wasntshrugged off she asked did you tell draco dontyou think he d be here vowing to hex someone private areas if he knew this isnta job for a black knight chopping off heads with a sword it a job for witches what are we going to do ginny asked ignoring colin indignant protest that he wanted to help and they had better not consider him another witch dark brown eyes gave her the lady macbeth stare you got us into this mess hot lips you think of a way to get us out of it involuntarily ginny snickered hot lips colin snorted you should hear what she called draco a blush crept up freckled cheeks donttell me looking at the other girl she asked hesitantly are you really angry we broke our promise blaise said dryly i did think to have beaten thee but since i know that draco told you you know and i no saint who never gotten a bit carried away i just want to get rid of that photo colin piped up what did malfoy tell you ginny smiled more relieved that blaise didnthold a grudge than amused over colin artless question he continued to pester them for an answer until blaise nudged his shoulder with hers and colin bumped into a wall he protested hey you said you d never shove me into a wall that was a love tap compared to what you ll get if you dontshut it fifth year the expression on colin face was hilarious thrilled and sly love tap eh i knew you d fall for me sooner or later blaise rolled her eyes you re going to fall down some stairs if you dontcut it out colin laughter was contagious and the girls soon joined his even though blaise laugh sounded reluctant a dark brow arched when the slytherin noticed the direction of their steps why are we headed back to your common room ginny face tightened with purpose because the person we need to make this all go away is in gryffindor it lorelei uhm her sister put your hood back on and step back while i say the password after the fat lady finished warbling an aria she acknowledged the password carpe diem and commented so many hooded people nowadays why hide sweetie i was telling the hufflepuff guardian pollyanna just the other week that i would never repeat gossip like that slytherin hussy who i heard let that snake trying desperately not to form mental images that might make it even harder to sleep at night ginny dashed through the portrait hole with blaise and colin right behind her inside she saw the person she was looking for jump up from the sofa away from harry ronan over here called ginny a sound of frustration escaped the girl as she rounded on the boy who had followed her go away harry ginny and i already made plans and you re not invited right ginny surprised but happy to agree to anything that got the girl woman out of gryffindor tower ginny nodded one hand rising to mess up his already disastrous hair harry protested but ronan refused to listen ginny felt a twinge so strong it made her stomach clench but thankfully ronan didntwant to work things out with harry and rushed out of the chamber colin shook his head in disbelief over his hero behaviour as they followed harry really is potty blaise snickered beneath her hood about time you gryffindors realised it slytherins knew first year quiet you two we need ronan and i dontwant comments like that putting her off so let me do the talking the three walked toward the end of the corridor where the upset girl stood crossing her arms and thinking thoughts ginny couldntbegin to guess she motioned for the girl to come round the corner out of the sight of the petulant guardian once informed about their mutual problem the professor who wouldntappear to be a student much longer said i ll go have a talk with the enterprising rosaline and esmee i dontlike to brag but my voice is irresistible and i ll make them an offer they cantrefuse they re in the dungeon three darkroom i saw ms kell name on the sign up sheet in sev snape office pausing she looked at the three students thoughtfully before asking after i destroy the pictured how about we go to hogsmeade have a relaxing night out i need one badly ginny said how could we go to the pub without rosmerta telling dumbledore about it i have access to a personae falsus potion that will make us look like a group of strangers having a night out instead of naughty students and yes colin i do know stealing is wrong that why i using my sister stores she told me to help myself blaise asked if terry and draco were invited the more the merrier as long as they tell no one before or after our outing ronan arranged to meet them in an hour in the courtyard near the front entrance watching her walk away ginny looked forward to celebrating later draco ignored the little pervert creevey gaping at a malfoy holding a weasley hand to smirk at his girlfriend a good little gryffindor is actually going to sneak out of the castle what is the world coming to ginny laughed draco let go of her hand to slide his arm around her waist she leaned against him and sighed the girl who stepped into the courtyard echoed the sigh young love how sweet dontlook hopeful colin you re only getting a kiss on the cheek in celebration lorelei ronan merlin he d be happy to go back to calling her professor made the little potter groupie day with a kiss it was disturbing to see adults looking and acting like students shouldntthey behave with more dignity or something draco was heartily thankful he hadntseen ronan snogging snape the only thing worse was watching her dramas with potter the other girls smiled at her words maybe they knew what she was celebrating he didntgive a toss he only wanted to spend time with his girlfriend the black haired wench passed him a small vial she explained handing out others the larger quantity of potion you drink the longer the efficacy which is why you have a vial instead of a flagon we ll have a little over two hours before the effects wear off cheers pulling out the cork and drinking the stuff which tasted like peppermint draco stared at ginny she had long blondish brown hair slightly different features and tanned skin with no freckles her eyes were still milk chocolate brown and her smile was the same too he smiled in relief she gasped oh draco you ve got short brown hair and brown eyes looking at his hands which werentquite as fair skinned as usual draco laughed he had always wondered what he would look like if he was tall dark and handsome instead of pale perfection he noted the changes in the rest of the group lorelei had white blonde shoulder length hair and a fringe with blue eyes she looked like someone but he couldntthink who blaise had green eyes and long auburn hair with a fringe that was feathered back her current pale features were familiar too boot had long white blond hair two side strands pulled back and tied to keep his girly locks out of his face now sporting bright blue eyes he looked like a bloody wood elf blaise sure liked it plastered to his side playing with his hair and calling him some weird name legolas creevey was the most bizarre transformation of all still average height for a boy and slender he now looked like a bloke in his mid twenties with a square jawed tanned face shaggy blond hair with a fringe and piercing dark eyes those eyes were currently giving the elf running his hands over the leggy girl beside him a look of dislike the twisted lips transformed into a smile when ronan came over and pinched his cheek you look so much like a certain aussie actor that i going to call you heath creevey heath bloody stupid name grinned i know who you look like anna blaise is frida huh blaise grabbed and stared at her long reddish brown hair no way we are not abba look alikes why did you do that to us tonight disco night and zabinis are known for boogie fever so donteven try and say you dontknow every bloody abba song i think you can sing one with me you owe me one as blaise shrugged and went back to cooing over the prince of the woodland elves ginny asked who are we creepy creevey laughed like the fool he was if you d watched muggle telly you d know he angel and you re buffy fer sure like totally you know buffy draco saw ginny didntappear to relish her name either he scowled would he ever get away from the angel stereotype angel of light angel of darkness fallen angel he d rather be called a love god or any god except the ugly ones ronan said buffy and angel were quite the romantic pair so he reluctantly agreed to answer to the ridiculous name if draco had his way though he d call himself spike he noticed the blonde waving her wand and saw that the group now appeared to be dressed in an assortment of black clothing except for anna who was clothed in white she said it went with the abba image better uncaring draco pulled his girl by the tanned hand toward hogsmeade blaise unlocked her lips from the bloke who looked like he should be carrying a bow and arrows to follow colin and the barmy professor brought up the rear to say their group made an entrance was an understatement every single conversation halted even the music stopped as heads turned and the locals stared at the exotic group of people sauntering into their pub rosmerta strolled over to take their order so what can i get you folks butterbeer for them and something with an itty bitty pink umbrella in it for me the attractive proprietor delicate brows arched she looked closer at the nordic blonde haired woman a smile twitched the corners of her mouth sure you can handle it no but i ve had a week you wouldntbelieve i alone for the night and i need a drink my mates will get me home rosmerta smile widened be sure to come back and tell me all about it sometime draco frowned the women seemed to be having a conversation within a conversation he pursed his lips and drummed his fingers on the table earning a disapproving stare from his girlfriend he smiled wickedly she blushed and looked away professor whatever she called herself giggled and she hadnteven had a drink yet he was fortunate not to have her as a teacher she was too undignified draco lips turned down when he realised how much skin his girl sleeveless black top displayed if he caught any other bloke admiring the scenery they d regret it the girls began to talk about clothing styles and fads while disco music played in the background the three males glanced at each other and decided without words not to bother trying to talk about anything they were off school grounds with gorgeous women conversation wouldntimprove the night it was already brilliant here ya go luvs anna tossed a bag to the smiling pub owner with a wink run a tab ros and then keep the change a throaty chuckle from rosmerta made every man in the room sit up a bit straighter he didntapprove of older women being sexy either but his attention was diverted to his girlfriend buffy s butterbeer moustache he leaned over and licked it off she giggled and his mood improved dramatically draco avoided looking at the auburn haired girl being fondled on her elf lap and pouted until his girl got the hint and sat on his the brown eyes looking at him showed the same happiness he felt at being able to be with her in public and not have to worry about who might see or who they would tell when she kissed him draco didntmind being called angel anymore he was in heaven col oopsie heath you re so funny how come a cutie like you not got a girlfriend salazar slytherin the professor was pissed how could she get plastered on one lousy drink with an umbrella in it for merlin sake draco didntmiss the way heath dark eyes flickered over at frida and back again before shrugging ginny asked the question he d only thought and snuggled against him in a way that made draco not even care why the professor had the alcohol tolerance of a two year old anna leaned forward and giggled before holding her finger up to her lips and saying in a hushed tone ruined by intermittent giggling i always has to share m fam ly secret w my friends wait firs you all have to pinkie promise not to tell a livin soul she held out her pinkie one by one they shook it when she turned to him draco scowled at the inanity but did it since she looked ready to cry otherwise ginny giggled in his ear she was wiggling too and that he liked here m deep dark secret melodic laughter pealed ringing in male ears in a way that was quite stimulating shifting in a way that made his girlfriend happy draco nuzzled a slender neck in a manner that was far from angelic and listened as the girlish professor said my sister lorelei an mos the rest of our fam ly are sirens the lure sailors from the sea kind tho we haventdone tha for ages she said sadly there never been a decent drinker in the lot she sighed if n those ancestors had a drunk some o that rum that floated by now an then we might be able to hold our liquor today really said creevey frida smiled i love siren cosmetics the longhaired blond smiled wolfishly into his girlfriend eyes i love siren secrets on you grimacing as legolas whispered his favourite coloured brassieres draco looked away into a pretty pouting face he said would you like to go to that shop we could floo to london on hogsmeade weekend her smile made him smile almost as much as the thought of watching her model sexy apparel the loony siren announced okie dokie it time for a song frida i d ask you too buffy but i ve heard you sing sorry the blonde and auburn haired wenches snickered over his golden brown haired girl pretended outrage and made their way with legolas over to the bar where they talked to rosmerta the woman laughed her arse off and then proclaimed after the patrons hushed tonight we have our first ever karaoke disco duo a round of applause please for anna and frida who will be singing what else abba girly locks spun an orb expertly all those parties working instead of dancing a dark brow rose draco was surprised they werentsinging dancing queen instead a peppy tune was projected and the two women in classic abba pose anna facing front frida standing sideways facing her sang with alternating turns away and toward the audience waterloo the pair danced as if they d practiced and maybe in a way they had if each had a disco loving mother then the hip shaking side or forward stepping motions were probably ones done so many times that no thought was necessary frida even did the standing behind pulling back the other woman hair to sing over her shoulder thing which made the older witches and wizards clap appreciatively creevey whistled when the song ended and the singers returned with a round of butterbeer draco sneered at the blighter practically drooling the lights dimmed as sappy music from that awful muggle band called the bee gees filled the air anna jumped up and pulled heath over to the small space that had been cleared for a dance floor even more revolting than the sight of a professor dancing with a student was the disco ball that had been enchanted to float and scatter sparkles of light across the pub draco saw his girlfriend hopeful look and led her to the dance floor she felt so good in his arms swaying slowly he closed his eyes and pretended he and ginny appeared as their true selves instead of some daft couple named angel and buffy the moment the song ended another bee gees tune filled the space around them how deep is your love the words were simplistic almost hufflepuff but somehow they filled his mind and touched his heart draco tightened his arms around the girl who made him not mind this muggle tosh so much the group ended up leaving the pub at a dead run because they d forgotten about time and were about to give the locals a shock they laughed as they hurried back to the castle sneaking around to a little used side entrance they waited for filch and mrs norris to pass by on their rounds before saying their goodbyes creevey walked a strangely quiet ronan back to gryffindor while boot escorted blaise the long way back to slytherin the sight of their friends leaving them alone reminded draco of another time stalking forward he smiled wickedly at the beautiful girl he loved all alone red what are you going to do now she backed him against the wall and aggressively pulled his head down to hers ginny kissed him in a way that encouraged draco to shift and slide until he was pressing her against the wall his blood pounded in his ears so loudly he barely heard the sound of footsteps approaching in enough time to pull ginny behind the nearby statue of simon the salacious draco had to cover ginny mouth to stifle her gasp when the couple spoke prefect duty is so boring hermione why dontwe go check the room of requirement make sure no one using it to make out hermione giggles caused draco jaw to drop granger giggling inconceivable shall we do the highland games theme i want to see you in a kilt again draco stomach began churning thankfully the other couple drifted away but not before weasley joked that granger just wanted to see his arse rather draco hoped the weasel was joking soft pink lips kissed his scrunched up eyes the down turned corners of his mouth his cheeks and finally lingeringly his lips returning the sweet pressure draco allowed ginny kiss to transform the horrid finish to their night into a happy ending a n my what this lot gets up to it not even the weekend yet eclectic song usage with the weird sister and werewolf duet based on amy lee vocals on seether broken how d the band end up covering a wizarding tune it a mystery d the abba scene was inspired by the film muriel wedding which i liked but the vacation dance number when muriel and her pal dress up in white as abba and win the lip synch contest doing waterloo was the best part by far in 1997 heath ledger was in a series called roar and angel and buffy were heating up sunnydale orlando bloom was years away from donning his legolas wig but tolkien fans imagined him long before peter jackson did i hope readers enjoyed the fantasies the princess bride and other references and review to tell me so chapter 28 rollercoaster of love blaise awoke with a smile on her face tomorrow she and terry would spend half the day with luna and wesley in hogsmeade and the other half with ginny and draco in london to top everything off she d awakened to the sound of music throwing back her covers and opening the bed curtains blaise grinned at fiona and morrigan who were singing while getting dressed i should be grateful you arent yodelling i suppose cassandra priam stood in the bathroom doorway blaise couldntget over the change in her appearance with only a trace of brown eyeliner and lip gloss instead of black kohl and black lipstick to obscure her features the girl face was actually pretty she said you look great cass did you change your look for kieran cassandra blushed a girl can decide to make a slight alteration in her style without it being due to some pathetic urge to please a boy do all of you base your decisions on what makeup and hairstyle to choose on whether or not you think a bloke will like it blaise nodded along with her friends cassandra rolled her eyes and prepared to stalk out the door morrigan ruined her grand exit hey cassandra wait kieran asked me last night to tell you he going to be helping the greengrass twins this morning he ll be a bit late for breakfast so go on without him the otherworldly girl eyes seemed to gaze sightlessly for a moment blinking her face twisted with fury the only thing upsetting those little vipers is malfoy not giving them the time of day if they think they re getting kieran to kiss them and make their phony pain all better they have another thing coming the moment the door slammed shut the three remaining in the chamber cackled like witches fiona held her side that girl is so in denial she pretends not to care less what tall dark and gorgeous does but somehow always manages to make sure he doesntcomfort any girl with kisses wonder when kieran will clue her in to her true motives morrigan said maybe by valentine day that would be so romantic the corners of her lips turned down not that i d know about romance seeing as the closest thing i get to it is a bloody letter fiona hugged her friend that is romance it just long distance and at least jay cantwait to see you at the holidays i wonteven get a bloody valentine since i blew off roberts i talked to him between classes yesterday and he told me he going with lovegood now i couldntbelieve it but she walked up looking like she wanted to jinx me so i guess it true blaise nodded it is terry and i are going with them to hogsmeade tomorrow sorry are you very disappointed surprisingly i am oh well guess i ll have to settle for a boring seventh year with looks money and a bod to die for blaise fluffed her short curls with her fingers if you think beckham is boring it because you ve never danced with him slytherins dontsay bend it like beckham for nothing she waggled her eyebrows at fiona i bet if you give him your famous come here baby smile today he ll ask you to go to hogsmeade tomorrow and by february you ll have a valentine morrigan can enchant one of his friends to keep in practice for her yank what do you say an auburn eyebrow rose i say when did you become such a ruddy matchmaker since i read much ado about nothing and discovered how much fun it could be if nothing else the time shall not go dully by us fiona said i remember a line she clasped her hands together and gazed up at the ceiling god match me with a good dancer together blaise and morrigan shouted amen fiona smirked and god keep him out of my sight when the dance is done the friends laughed as they left the room and headed to the great hall for breakfast in the entry a boy was leaning against a wall waiting for someone probably his girlfriend he looked around as if to make sure no one he knew was near and then waved blaise over she said talking to me of your own free will i flattered weasley he looked almost bashful i just wanted to say i glad you re better now aw ronnikins was being sweet blaise muttered yeah well i remember you coming to see me in the library so thanks she flailed around mentally trying to think of something non sappy to say your hair looks longer you letting it grow he gave a huff of surprised amusement yeah i suppose does it look okay bet granger thinks you re lookin good mr freckles weasley wide smile flashed thought i told you not to call me that anymore she shot back thought i told you to keep it strictly lips after the words left her mouth blaise wanted desperately to somehow grab them back but it was too late he smiled at her chagrin and teased i should be thanking you what do you have to thank zabini for ronald dark brown eyes met blue for a panicked instant before blaise turned to hermione for recommending weasleys wizard wheezes to my father they were given the contract to supply the orphanages zabini jewellers supports with unique items at christmas she smiled of course no thanks are necessary the boys already did that and even proposed to me the darlings both of them hermione asked coolly i suppose you d like two husbands since you re so used to juggling two boyfriends blaise ignored ron gasp of shock giving a true smile in return she liked hermione a heck of a lot better snippy than when she was doing her usual prim and prissy know it all act that didntmean she wasntgoing to give the girl as good as she got though imitating draco insolent stare and wicked smile he was the master at making others lose their cool she said after a sidelong glance ron wonder if i d enjoy juggling three as she sauntered away blaise felt her shoulder blades prickle she expected hermione could come up with some incredibly uncomfortable hexes thankfully the girl didntblast her with one after entering the hall blaise rushed over to kiss terry that was exactly what she needed to get the morning back on a happy track lifting her lips from his she purred morning love he smiled and echoed the sentiment when she forced herself to go sit in her proper seat draco gave her that what did you do look blaise greeted everyone at the table and began to eat honestly he was so suspicious and way too perceptive pansy gleefully told everyone the latest gossip ronan was leaving hogwarts rumour had it mcgonagall herself caught the girl in potter room this morning blaise looked over at the gryffindor table ronan finished saying her goodbyes and called to her brother hey kieran watching the bold girl step up onto her house table leap down to the other side and walk toward slytherin blaise had to admit ronan had style if no taste at all in boys she returned the girl smile when she climbed up and over their table to reach her brother i leaving how about walking your sister to the door kieran nodded about time when the pair walked away draco leant over i dontcare what anyone says no way did potter get a leg over blaise snickered maybe the prophet should change his name to the boy who couldntget lucky draco shout of laughter made his housemates grin and the students over at gryffindor table glare knew they were disparaging their ickle hero did they ginny and colin were the only ones who smiled instead of sending visual daggers the remainder of the meal passed in a pleasant mix of outrageous speculation and hilarity until a large black owl swooped down from the rafters it dropped an envelope and a magazine in front of blaise some impulse made her peer down the table at cassandra her roommate gazed at her with pity insides wrenching in dread blaise lifted her wand before she could blast the mail draco grabbed her wrist and took her wand away people get sent to azkaban for tampering with the owl post you have to open it and face whatever it is like a big girl blaise leaned out and looked at terry he was smiling reassuringly at her luna and wesley were too she squared her shoulders and reached out a hand to open the envelope the bottom dropped out of her world when the missive rose into the air projecting her mother enthusiastically gushing tones sweetie darlings it been so so hard to keep this a surprise but finally i can share the absolutely fabulous news you ve been made the new zabini jewellers couple those pictures you were such angels to let the photographer snap whilst we waited for the bloody buggery anorexic models to show were so much better than the other tosh that we used them instead cissy and i are so proud our gorgeous lovebirds are in all the mags take a look at how glam you are and remember to thank your mumsies when you owl sweeties ciao the gusher exploded into a shower of black confetti blaise stared down at the magazine not even bothering to brush the paper out of her hair draco gave her a commiserating glance and turned the publication over it was teen witch bollocks practically every girl at this school would have one delivered over the next day staring down at the couple looking at engagement rings together in the first ad blaise admitted that she and malfoy did indeed look gorgeous and glam when she saw the next advertisement her eyes closed in misery how would she ever explain this to terry they d been goofing around with the photographer while waiting for her father at the posh london shop over holiday the models had been late and the nice man werentthey the worst had asked them to do him a favour enact a couple of scenes just to make sure the lighting was right the lighting was brilliant but the photograph i think the bloke too pale for you blaise but you look beautiful she looked up terry gaze was wry but it was smiling her answering smile was lopsided the pictures were never meant to be in magazines he held out a hand she took it and stood picking up the magazine he slid his arm around her waist i know things like this just happen to you baby come on tell me all about it on the way to class blaise ignored the stares the whispers and the sight of owl after owl gliding down to drop magazines into eager hands to walk out of the hall with terry smiling down at her and keeping her close by his side ginny watched the couple leave the hall and turned colin the ads cantbe that bad if terry was smiling can they he pointed to the copy of teen witch an owl dropped onto the table in front of her maybe you ought to see for yourself hermione reached out and turned the pages how rude the first advertisement after the table of contents was a zabini jewellers ad showing a stylish young couple looking for an engagement ring ginny glanced over at draco he was regarding her steadily watching her face to gauge her reaction she gave a small smile before looking at the magazine again the photograph was very tasteful yet her stomach began to knot she observed the pair while they looked at rings chose one and then watched draco slide the emerald and diamond ring onto blaise finger over ginny shoulder ron said thought i d see what the fuss is about doesntseem like the rest of her brother words trailed away when his girlfriend flipped and found a full page spread now ginny knew why blaise had closed her eyes in misery she wanted to shut hers too but she couldn t instead she sat frozen in place watching the images play out in a loop over and over again she tried to detach her feelings view it impersonally the ad depicted a couple propped on pillows lying together in front of a fireplace the pale hair and skin of the man wearing a black robe was a dramatic contrast to the dark curls and golden skin of the woman in red the male whispered in his partner ear when she sat up he draped a magnificent diamond necklace around her neck no wonder the photographer recommended using the shots they didntseem staged they seemed real the magicked picture ended before masculine lips touched deep red feminine ones but the ad implied that the couple would be making love in front of the fire after the man had expressed his love with diamonds ron muttered crikey that mrs zabini a right nutter to do this to her kid if her sweetie darling hadntdone it she wouldnthave been able to use it would she ronald ron and hermione argument heated up but ginny tuned them out while she tried to come to terms with the jealousy eating away at her heart she knew those two were best mates comfortable with one another and realised how easily that could seem more intimate when viewed through a camera lens blaise loved terry draco loved her terry appeared to be handling the ads well why wasntshe that photographer is bloody brilliant i bet zabini jewellers makes loads of galleons off these ads every girl will want her man to be malfoy and guys will want to see nothing but golden skin and diamonds ow why d you hit me ginny you care more about the photograph than about the girl in it blaise has to be mortified over her mother using her so horribly and you you snatching up her magazine and rushing out of the hall ginny face crumpled she d yelled at colin but she was really upset at herself a voice called to her asked her to wait she started running fiery hair streaming draco caught up to her and pulled her by the wrist into an empty classroom wrenching herself away from him ginny crossed her arms did you kiss her draco looked hurt of course not it was a bloody photo shoot it was all pretend i dontlike the way it looks either but you of all people should know i do know the words seemed to burst out of some dark part of her soul i know how close you two are and i canthelp but wonder how you express that affection when no one else is around do you sleep together in front of the fireplace she couldntstop herself from asking are you lovers as well as friends he had rumpled his hair with agitated fingers damn it red you know we aren t his gaze pleaded why are you saying such insane things her hands shook as she held up the magazine because everyone who opens this and every other bloody rag with those ads in them will see you and blaise looking at rings you and blaise in front of the bloody fire you and blaise ginny wanted to give him a bat bogey hex for looking so lost for words she wanted to scream and tear her hair out she wanted to find blaise and tear her hair out instead she tore the magazine into tiny shreds and then used her wand to reduce the paper to ash while draco looked on with open mouthed incredulity while she stood breathing heavily face red teeth gritted his expression changed from shocked to something that caused a frisson of alarm to travel up her spine she took a step back when he took a step forward my my my what a passionate reaction you had ginevra all fired up over a few pictures of me and zabini you ve seen worse before why go over the edge this time he took another step forward she involuntarily took a few back placing the teacher desk between them draco eyes were a dark shade of grey that she hadntseen before the sight was very unnerving so was his half smile what happened to the little spitfire who ripped a magazine apart with her bare hands cat got your tongue little red bird not if she could help it if the boy stalking her like a great cat thought that he could use his love god wiles on her well she was keeping the desk between them to ensure that he couldn t ginny watched him lean down and draw a heart on the dusty surface of the desk with a fingertip the initials gw dm were placed inside the sight reminded her of the one he d carved inside a giant pumpkin she had to bite her lip to keep from speaking he was the one with explaining to do draco moved suddenly around one side causing her to squeak in alarm while she countered his position chiselled lips curved now you re a mouse are you too timid to tell me how you really feel he smiled when she glared dontlike thinking of yourself that way gryffindor timid afraid cowardly i not a coward merlin she d risen to the bait oh how smug he was his lips pursed so sexily oh no he wasntluring her with his indecent good looks ginny mutinously shook her head a white blond eyebrow rose he was not playing fair there was only thing more evil he could do to her since i seem to be missing my first class to try and decipher what the hell has got into my girlfriend i really should make myself comfortable draco took off his robes and placed them over a chair he cleaned with his wand wouldntwant to get dusty ginny pressed her lips together ruthlessly he began to tug at his tie even when the diabolical boy removed his blazer and unfastened the top three buttons on his shirt she remained strong no matter how much she wanted to reach out grab that tie and use it to pull draco over for the snog of their lives she wouldntdo it she would stand firm she might sway a bit and tremble but she was a weasley she would hold out her internal speechifying allowed draco to slip around to her side of the desk he gripped her shoulders talk to me ginny what going on in that mind of yours why are you acting mental over those pictures in frustration he gave her a small shake tell me ginny knew her expression mirrored his unhappiness i sick and tired of the gossip i hate having to keep my mouth shut every time i hear it did you know people think you ve got some sick slytherin open relationship going that they wonder whether boot cantsee it or if he just doesntcare since he her main man and you re only the boy on the side draco face hardened of course i know what people say i ve lived with shite like this my whole life you learn not to care and not to listen his palm cupped her cheek why do you care when you know that i love you and you love me the tender expression that transformed his face made her feel even more miserable i want to be the girl in the photographs with you i want everyone to know you re nobody boy on the side because you re my main man the satisfaction on draco face indicated he had known that all along he had just wanted her to admit it ginny fought back tears only i cantbe that girl because i canttell anyone yet having blaise over helped me get my parents to admit slytherins are not all death eaters in training but i still need a bit more time before she couldntgo on she was too choked up to say another word her throat ached and tears began to trickle down her cheeks draco pulled ginny against him and held her so tight it was hard to breathe it was just what she needed his lips brushed her hair i ll wait i dontlike it but i understand it frustrating and i envy blaise because she and boot get to do all the things i d like to do with you but i can deal with it malfoy are known for making the best out of a bad situation masculine fingers were stroking her hair sliding slowly down her back ginny whispered i thought malfoys were known for being love gods the slow smile he gave made every nerve in her body tense in anticipation we are and i ll show you exactly what i mean when her lips cut off his speech she didntwant talk she wanted action ginny felt a primitive elation when draco mouth moved passionately against hers every kiss she gave and returned made the word mine echo in her head these lips mine these hands mine this face mine this body mine this incredible arse mine mine mine a low rumbling chuckle escaped the mouth that was hers when draco said i glad you think my arse is incredible and i like the possessiveness but if you keep squeezing me like that i going to have to squeeze you like this ginny was too distracted by the bone melting sensation of having his hands mould and press her backside against what was hers hers hers to feel embarrassed about speaking aloud her hand clenched convulsively around his tie wanting to pull him down and snog his brains out some more a knock on the door halted the lips hers were reaching for again the handle turned draco snapped who there blaise she slipped inside and smiled hesitantly at ginny colin found me a few minutes ago told me he gave binns a female problem excuse for you so you wontget detention for missing class knew just where to find you did he pervy little stalker what about me blaise widened her eyes pretending not to know what he meant then grinned and reassured the boy returning his hair and attire to perfection i said someone had slipped a puking potion into your juice at breakfast and you were recovering from the prank she smirked luckily your arithmancy assignment just happened to be rolled up with mine so i turned it in and all is well ginny asked how did you know where we were blaise took a small sphere out of her pocket draco laughed a trackingbrall how long have you had it is that why you always found me whenever we played hide and seek he saw his friend reluctant nod and crowed you little cheat wish i d thought of it good one ginny looked askance at the grinning pair slytherins were so strange sometimes then again wouldntshe love to be able to find malfoy when she didnthave the mirror handy her hands rose without thinking to catch the small ball tossed by the other girl keep it i ve got another one blaise winked at her before opening the door and then gesturing that the coast was clear after ginny followed her draco drawled want to be able to track me down and snog me at all times eh ignoring one slytherin giggles and the other smirk she nodded damn right the look of admiration on both faces made ginny toss her hair and strut like a slytherin all the way down the corridor toward her next class slowly and carefully luna wrapped a long strand of blonde hair around her finger before class ginny had pulled her friends aside and asked for help with a plan for getting professor hands to sponsor a muggle style valentine dance luna had been doubtful but blaise had proceeded to use her snake like cunning to paint such beguiling mental pictures of music and slow dancing with their boyfriends that the doubter had been swayed to agree to help feeling like another female who d taken a bite of forbidden fruit because a sneaky serpent had talked her into it luna eyes narrowed her finger started to turn blue the colour suited her mood although she fully realised how lucky she was to have wesley luna still felt a pang from time to time whenever she saw harry this morning when she d heard the rumour that potter and the new girl had been caught by mcgonagall she d had to look down at her plate and force herself to keep eating although she had felt ill wesley smile had lifted her spirits so had hearing the girl harry had obsessed over tell her brother that she was leaving luna had refrained from glancing over at the gryffindor table which seemed to reassure her boyfriend that the news didntmatter to her one way or the other now absently noting the purple cast to her digit luna released the hair and wished that she hadntfelt her heart lurch at the thought that harry was probably gutted at the girl departure and might need a friend professor hands the man looked up from the magazine he was reading he had assigned them a couple of chapters to read silently from their textbook and promptly relaxed at his desk smiling genially he replied yes miss zabini blaise winked at luna in an enthusiastic breathy voice hands seemed to like she said professor colin was telling me the other day that his muggle friends at home all have valentine day dances at their schools and i was wondering luna was wondering how males could lose iq points just by listening to a girl speak breathily it was quite disturbing colin was nodding his head like he knew what blaise was talking about and agreed with every syllable perhaps it was the blood rushing from his brain to other areas yes blaise ducked her head and looked up bashfully do do you think a valentine dance here at hogwarts would would be a good idea to promote tolerance of the non magical and increase student knowledge of their social customs the professor held his chin in a podgy hand tapping his lips with a finger and generally tried to appear wise and manly he failed miserably a muggle style valentine dance to educate and promote tolerance assuredly if i were to approach the headmaster he would immediately seize the opportunity to celebrate magical diversity however i fear the work involved excuse me professor the man speaking rhetorically more than to the class halted his ruminations and gazed amiably at the girl sitting with such nice posture straight with shoulders back and inclined his head regally for her to speak ginny said professor lorelei once told me how much she enjoyed organising dances at her other schools i sure if someone as distinguished as you were to mention the subject she would eagerly volunteer her services luna remembered the part she was to play in this choreographed farce and said i dontknow i dontthink anyone could make this valentine dance a reality it would take a lot of influence hands took the bait luckily for my classes i have just that influence miss lovegood i dontlike to toot my own horn but when i speak people listen class is dismissed i will go see albus headmaster dumbledore at once luna stood with blaise and ginny while their classmates filed out blaise happy smile visibly wilted when the professor hurried over with his magazine and asked her to autograph the jewellery advertisement displaying the girl skin along with the diamond necklace once the slimy professor left the girls exited the classroom outside blaise grabbed her curls in both hands and shrieked aaahhh if i didntwant to have this dance so bad i can taste it i d i d colin had hung around he asked what it taste like then blaise laughed shortly it tastes like terry lips fifth year and that the only thing worth putting up with professor i toot my own horn ginny snickered he has to toot it himself nobody else in their right mind would want to touch it much less toot it the friends laughed colin asked with a smile is anyone going to the library after dinner luna knew why the other girls were going and it wasntto lay their hands on books she said are you going colin if you are there a friend of mine i d like you to meet blaise and ginny both said they d see them later and went their separate ways colin asked which friend the sweet one or the one with attitude i know longbottom going with brocklehurst luna verbally sidestepped mindy macdougal the one with attitude okay fine i ll see you and your friend later drifting back to ravenclaw house luna pondered whether or not colin and mindy were going to hit it off the boy hadntseemed especially thrilled to be set up and neither had her roommate hello luna harry potter was smiling at her and pulling her out of the flow of students in the main corridor to talk by a recessed window the wind was blowing bits of leaves and twigs around outside inside luna felt blown away too emerald green eyes behind round glasses watched her face intently a sense of unreality gripped her as he ran a hand through unruly black hair how ve you been i haventtalked to you in awhile she blinked you ve been preoccupied harry smiled sheepishly yeah i have i ve missed talking to you though her heart skipped a beat you re really comfortable to be around no drama just good friends would you like to go with me to hogsmeade tomorrow luna stared feeling as though the world had tilted here was the boy who had lost the girl he d made a fool of himself over asking her to go with him to hogsmeade on the day ronan left he acted like it was no big deal because he thought they were good comfortable friends the world shifted back and looked even nicer without that rose coloured distortion it was brighter more real and more dramatic she shook her head sorry harry i going with my boyfriend your boyfriend you cantmean that roberts character wesley and i have been going together for awhile now i didntkiss him in the library because he helped me find a book harry the boy who no potter looked put out how illogical he said you canttrust a charmer like that luna he probably going behind your back with another girl right now no he not wesley as good as he is gorgeous and he loves me sneering did not make harry more attractive like it did certain slytherins instead he resembled a petulant little boy sure he does do you love him luna gazed at the boy she d once thought was her one true love a smile stretched her cheeks so wide they ached her heart didntache it felt like she could fly yes harry scowled at her expression and her answer but his face smoothed out when a black haired beauty with liquid dark eyes stopped beside him the girl looked on the verge of tears some were even sparkling on her lashes in a soft voice that oozed pathos cho chang said i just wanted you to know harry that i understand the pain you re going through losing someone you loved like i lost cedric if you ever need someone to talk to cho paused meaningfully after throwing a strange smug look at luna harry said i appreciate that i was just telling luna how i didntwant to go to hogsmeade alone the other girl lips trembled she was incredibly pretty and immensely stupid luna thought cho was a disgrace to ravenclaw house to be taken in by potter phony grief cho said with doe eyed sympathy oh no you shouldntbe alone i d be happy to go to hogsmeade with you harry if you really need me harry tossed another sideways glance luna way thanks cho i do need someone meet out front at ten the girl watery smile of agreement was tragic heroine sweet she sniffed and moved on limply waving goodbye luna was disgusted did you ever care about ronan she hasntbeen gone a day and you re already hooking up with cho how could you harry said yes i cared but i canthave her so what am i supposed to do be alone the rest of my life besides maybe if she sees me with someone else at her look of confusion he shook his head never mind go have fun with your lover boy she took a step back shaking her head wesley not my lover boy he my love and he got more integrity in his pinkie than you ve got in your entire body harry potter harry walked away luna turned in the opposite direction and came face to face with a boy whose dimples made his smile even more appealing i dontknow whether you just said i ve got loads of integrity or potter got none but the part about my being your love that was music to my ears buttercup draping an arm around her shoulders and steering her toward their house wesley bent down to murmur i do wish you d reconsider let me be your lover boy too masculine lips pursed so adorably there was only one thing to do drag her boyfriend behind the statue of cary the charming and snog him silly later in the back of the library near the restricted section three couples sat at a table together ginny had already left to do some research after a few minutes of desultory conversation during which blaise sat on terry lap and played with his hair in between giggling over the things her boyfriend whispered in her ear the couple told the other four they were going to try out the window seat in the back and strolled off wesley admitted he had a paper due and promised to return after finding a book on the third level luna tried to facilitate a conversation between colin and mindy but neither seemed too interested they both preferred to stare over at the restricted section luna fabricated a story about a book she needed and left the two alone guilt over abandoning her roommate prompted her to go back to the table when she neared the pair the overheard conversation made luna stop and listen in fascination do you think you could drool over zabini a little more colin you ve almost got a puddle on the table there what about you mindy think you could sigh a little louder over boot glaring daggers at his girlfriend wontactually kill her you know so you may as well stop trying luna stayed hidden behind a nearby bookshelf at least they were talking what do you see in that girl anyway gryffindor i thought you were smart ravenclaw that a stupid question blaise sings she funny sexy nice dontsneer she is and best of all she photogenic the sound of magazine pages turning could be heard look at that photograph i ve taken loads and they re great but this this is amazing the camera makes love to her like like you want to wontit be hard to kiss those lips when they re permanently attached to her boyfriend s alarmed by the depth of colin admiration for blaise luna nodded her unseen agreement with mindy question colin answered you can help with that if you ll use those brains and stop letting your emotions show like a hufflepuff you need an attitude adjustment goodness had colin been affected by becoming draco more than she d known or had the sweet innocent image been just that an image not reality luna eyes were being opened a lot today mindy said what kind of attitude adjustment colin chuckled first stop viewing them snogging like mad as a personal affront and start looking at it like i do practise practise for us why that s that s brilliant colin so you want me to do what pretend we ve hooked up so that we can look for a way to break those two apart i can do that a droll voice whispered in luna ear i hearing all sorts of interesting things today that pair would scare me if i thought there was a chance in hell they d be able to pry tarzan away from jane luna shifted in order to slide her arms around his neck if they spend a lot of time together working so closely admiring each other devious ways just think what that could lead to the taming of the shrew i all for it my little matchmaker wesley showed his admiration with a long thorough loving kiss draco stopped at the entrance of the hog head to ensure the hood of ginny cloak hid her entire face advising his girlfriend to breathe shallowly through her mouth he opened the door to the disreputable tavern inside the dirty room reeking of indefinable animal smells they drew covert stares from the dodgy clientele students stopping in on a hogsmeade weekend were a rare occurrence the burly grizzled barkeep smiled revealing teeth that had seldom benefited from cleaning flossing mints with a gleam in his eye made brighter by the clinking sound made by the bag tossed onto the bar the man indicated a door at the far end of the chamber with a muttered floo through there enjoy your trip draco guided his companion through the portal into a room whose only feature was an unlit fireplace he peered sideways and asked you ready red she nodded and stepped onto the blackened hearth tossing a handful of floo powder and stating their destination with a feeling of anticipation he followed the moment he stepped out of the fireplace ginny placed a finger over his lips pointing toward the far door she pulled him over to a nearby cupboard pushed him inside eased beside him and whispered someone here a door slammed enrique zabini was heard shouting what have you done woman i leave for a fortnight and return to find you have prostituted our only child honestly darling that child is all grown up now and posing for a few teensie weensie pictures is hardly prostitution sweetie we didntpay her a knut in the shadows draco wrapped his arms around ginny hiding and hearing unusual conversations was starting to become an unsettling trend he rolled his eyes when blaise father spoke so dramatically it was easy to envision arms waving hands gesturing and eyes flashing oh really cara mia well i beg to differ pretend all you want that you were doing it for the company but i ve received half a dozen marriage proposals from pure blood families half a dozen already why that fabulous cissy and i knew that if we advertised our beautiful babies all the best doors would open ginny jumped at the sound of something glass hitting the wall and shattering draco tightened his hold his girlfriend snuggled closer enrique hissed menacingly you will not sell my little girl to some inbred aristocrat in order to get yourself invited to the best parties carina blaise is destined to head the company one day or marry a man who will manage it until my grandchildren become of age any plot by you and that witch you call friend endangering that future will meet my wrath draco wondered if edina had finally been silenced by terror she was breathing in such ragged gasps they could hear the sound across the room through the thin cupboard door grey eyes widened in surprise eddy s high heels were clicking rapidly while she hurried to the man who had all but threatened her life she groaned oh my gods enrique beloved i would never ever do anything to upset your little plans darling cissy and i are only using this to get invited to glam parties love we still want our little baby girl and boy to join our families one day dearest beautiful amazing sexy man the sounds accompanying the entreating explanation made draco grateful he couldntsee what exactly the woman was doing to her husband enrique grumbled i am still unsure as to young malfoy suitability although for touching my innocent daughter he should be forced to marry her or be cursed the young malfoy in question felt fortunate that the woman trying to get a leg over her husband distracted the volatile businessman from that uncomfortable train of thought sure sweetie darling sweetie sweetie dearest darling whatever you say lover just before you leave for spain and i meet cissy to go shopping cantwe slip off to the bedroom why not slip out of your clothes right here edina quierda the floor is so much closer than the bed i would darling i would but there glass darling that might break the mood sweetie basta go before you get the punishment you deserve right here strega mrs zabini could really move quickly when she wanted her husband deep laughter caused the listeners to cringe while the couple went off to draco refused to think about it he and ginny were going out for lunch and he wanted to be able to eat they snuck out of the flat and bypassed the lift to run down the service stairway to reach the street below the sidewalk was packed with shoppers enjoying the mild london weekend draco held ginny hand as they joined the throng they began to laugh as the shock of the near encounter wore off he looked down at his girlfriend imperiously and affected a latin accent woman you will try on clothing and if your choices do not appeal to me i will rip them off with my teeth ginny stared at him in silence before licking her lips oh my gods draco you beautiful amazing sexy man kiss me the moment his mouth touched hers draco ceased to care whether or not his freckles had been serious or spoofing he was too happy to be able to kiss his woman and not care who was watching later as they strolled back to meet blaise and terry at the flat draco was felt a deep contentment to have spent time with ginny he would have never chosen to go poking round rummage y shops or eat a lunch wrapped in newsprint sitting on a park bench but it had been unexpectedly fun he reached out to touch a smooth cheek whimsically trying to decide whether his girl freckles looked more like a dusting of spicy red pepper or a sprinkle of cinnamon he grinned at his thoughts while he released the wards on the private entrance to the building ginny lifted the bag she d refused to let him carry are you still making fun of my dresses i telling you retro is in draco escorted her into the lift and spoke the destination shaking his head while the compartment rose he was not about to tell red his barmy notions she already thought he was wrapped around her finger as it was some things a man had to be mysterious about if he was lucky she d try and snog the information out of him later still pestering him about his grin once they d entered the flat ginny smile faltered when they heard a girl cry merlin terry get off draco and ginny ran over to see terry roll off the sofa blaise sat up and straightened her top and miniskirt muttering what with boys and tickling anyway if it substitution for groping i d rather he go for the good stuff hearing the snickers she asked the three plaintively did i say that aloud draco nodded amused that seemed to be a female habit transparently attempting to distract her companions from her faux pas his mate said brightly are you ready to go shopping i see you ve done some already show me what you bought ginny now is good waiting for the girls to return draco made a stab at civility wonder what flitwick going to have us doing in detention next week distracted from grooming long hair with his fingers tarzan replied mildly inventory merlin help us if a feather or a pillow gone missing we ll probably be sent scouring the castle for them silence stretched out after that repartee eventually terry said we ran into professor hands in the broomsticks he told blaise dumbledore approved the valentine dance and even volunteered professor lorelei to organise it rather ballsy of him i thought i dontbelieve hands has any dumbledore though probably thinks lorelei owes him one malfoy smirked terry frowned what for hiring her would ve been stupid not to she a great teacher draco looked up to see his girlfriend decked out in a mini dress the shade of red complimented her hair she wore striking makeup and knee high black boots which blaise had formerly been wearing if he wasntwrong and he was never wrong he said you look beautiful ginny smirked adorably told you retro was in the two couples strolled into siren secrets and quickly found the girls loads of intimate apparel draco and terry agreed that they would forgo the pleasure of seeing the items tried on in order to prevent eyes other than their own from viewing ginny and blaise it was a sacrifice they were willing to make and draco knew tarzan was thinking the same thing he was it was more exciting to imagine seeing them later draco glanced round the shop looking for something else his girl would look marvellous in and saw double double weasley trouble coming through the front doors with identical girlfriends he stepped quickly into the dressing area are you dressed ginny your twin pain in the arse brothers just waltzed in the door we ve got to get out of here the girls hurried out fully dressed arms filled with frilly things blaise told ginny give me your things i ll go distract them while you sneak out and after i have this lot sent to me terry and i will meet you down the street in that little park with the statue that looks like vezzini the vicious draco and ginny waited in the back soon they heard blaise exclaim gred and forge fancy meeting you here give me a hug you gorgeous oops i ve dropped all my lacy bits she said huskily how kind you darling men are to help me pick them up like that one fred yes that my favourite too you dontthink it too naughty the couple in hiding slipped out the door while boot and the twin girlfriends sourly watched the red heads finger every silky piece they helped blaise recover from the carpet draco draped an arm around ginny shoulder as they walked toward the park laughing for someone who used to be non girly blaise really knows how to work her wiles now ginny giggled you should ve seen her in muggle studies doing the act on hands to get him to sponsor the dance draco led her to a park bench no thank you suspicious he asked you didntdo the act on hands too did you his girlfriend seemed very interested in a couple of toddlers rolling a ball to each other across the park all of a sudden meeting his steely eyes she turned pink not really i smiled and she laughed nervously demonstrating how nice she could make her posture appear he shook his head in disgust but a smile twitched draco lips if ginny ever pulled that act on him who knows what he d give her he chuckled at the thought of trying to explain before a match why he d given his broom to a gryffindor chaser during dinner that evening draco grudgingly acknowledged that this double date hadntbeen painful as expected in fact listening to the girls excited chatter about the valentine dance he thought perhaps it wouldntbe a bad thing to do again someday blaise shook her head vigorously drawing his attention she said to ginny i agree it too bad hands said that he wanted the theme to be famous couples in muggle history but dumbledore said some students would find it hard to get costumes so we re all dressing muggle semi formal instead at the mention of the dreaded word theme draco glanced at terry the other boy looked equally troubled the moment of shared male dislike for ridiculous get ups wasntalarming as it once would have been hastily averting his thoughts from ludicrous notions like possible male friendship draco saw something that was even more worrying a couple was rising from a table across the room it was professors snape and lorelei draco smirked ha he d known potter hadntgotten lucky snape drew on a cloak covering his face with the hood the professor held his companion coat while she slipped her arms into the sleeves the other three at his table noticed draco stare they gazed curiously over to see what he was looking at terry said hey that professor lorelei her sick father must be better who that bloke she with after blaise whispered the answer in his ear the boy made a face no the couple under discussion was passing directly in the couples line of sight snape remained focused on the door but lorelei saw them without drawing her partner notice she smiled and waggled her fingers once the professors had left the restaurant draco demanded blaise just where did you hear that this was such a great cosy out of the way restaurant erm detention with lorelei ginny eyes were shining with amusement she took his hand and brought it to her lips for a kiss all at once he forgot his irritation draco lifted ginny hand to kiss the back and palm her soft smiling look made him hungry since he had to wait to snog her properly he drawled what for dessert a n if readers who see princess bride quotes everywhere thought the statues were based on an actor and a character and draco sounded like prince humperdink with and he was never wrong what good eyes you have famous couples in muggle history is based on the theme of the prom in never been kissed speaking of kissing next chapter is valentine day i once chided an author for having a v day come and go in a couple of sentences the only sad celebration was a lame prank turning things pink so of course when it came time to put up or shut up in my own story you know what i did d get ready for romance people if you were looking for an unromantic fic one that would downplay the importance of february 14th into a few sentences such as valentine came to hogwarts during the school week young couples disappointed over not having pink confetti showered upon them at madam puddifoot s and not being allowed to hold hands and snog in a corner of the three broomsticks much less rub against each other at a ruddy dance made do with broom cupboards and niches behind statues many lovers were caught by filch and spent that most romantic of days scrubbing bed pans by hand in the infirmary this is not that kind of fic it not too late to turn to an action adventure story where the closest anybody getting to being kissed is by a dementor i warn you if you keep reading you will be subjected to young lovers who dress up dance kiss a lot and express their feelings it wontall be fluffy or in the style of lemony snicket like the a n but it will be romantic chapter 29 be my valentine it was the best of times it was the worst of times ginny smiled at how the opening lines of a muggle novel described her own feelings she stood in the centre of the great hall as she turned in a slow circle to gaze with satisfaction at the dramatic transformation a bittersweet ache made it hard to swallow her life was a tale of two hogwarts most people only saw the life she appeared to live a fifth year who played quidditch had friends but no boyfriend that was why no one was surprised when she d told ron this morning that she wasntgoing to the valentine dance tonight ginny was a bit ashamed of saying she d rather stay in reading a good romance than go with someone she didntlike again neville had heard her tactless comment thankfully he had made a joke about being a much better dancer now and everyone had laughed are we brilliant or are we brilliant meeting blaise sparkling eyes ginny nodded still unable to speak the other girl didntnotice in her eagerness to point out look at how wonderful those alternating red and white panels of fabric look against the walls i so glad luna roommate suggested that we boycott pink and go for simple elegance instead padma and parvati idea of loads of faerylights was good too they really make the room look romantic you ll have a wonderful time tonight ginny voice wavered a bit at the end blaise took a closer look at her face hey you re okay with spending tonight in the room of requirement arentyou all during dinner my best mate kept asking which cologne to wear and if he should try a new hair styling charm draco really looking forward to being with you ginny shook off a selfish wish to dance with her boyfriend on this floor surrounded by all their friends well her friends and his mate blaise her smile became unforced i hope you told him not to change his hair and what did you say about the cologne i gave him and terry the same stuff that my papa uses for a valentine present encantar to love expensive but we re they re worth it remembering how wickedly good enrique zabini had smelled new year eve ginny nodded emphatically yes they all four of them were definitely worth it the faery phlox and roses look lovely together doesntit luna was trailing a finger over a nearby table centrepiece ginny heard the slight melancholy in her friend tone and asked it doesntbother you that harry going with chang does it no wesley and i are incredibly happy that not what troubling me the idea of harry being with someone else it more of a feeling really that he and cho arentright she shrugged i cantexplain it out of nowhere a twinge shivered down ginny spine and made her groan inwardly oh crap not again the weird sensation soon left her and she determined to ignore bloody twinges of all kinds regret envy or sight the girls who had assembled to help professor lorelei transfigure the great hall into a ballroom with assistance from house elves began to head toward the entry hall doors luna and her three roommates blaise and two other slytherins and two hufflepuff girls all waved and smiled eager to rush off to their houses and get dressed for the valentine dance the patil twins and hermione lingered by the doors waiting for ginny to finish admiring their work miss weasley lorelei called would you help me with a small task before you return to your house ginny nodded interest caught sure i not going to the dance so i dontneed hours to get ready like the others do hours the twins were indignant hermione was amused and looked as curious as crookshanks i d be happy to come and help too professor ginny watched lorelei start to smile before containing herself and replying blandly in a manner worthy of snape i sure you would be miss granger however your assistance is not required you may run along now the thwarted girl mouth opened and closed abruptly her lips turned down unhappily all right come see me when you get back ginny you can uh help me with my makeup amused at her friend transparent angling for information she really did have to know it all ginny smiled and waved goodbye to her departing housemates the professor gestured for ginny to precede her and together they walked out of the hall it was kind of weird to think that this teacher had been a student a few weeks ago and she was one of only a few that knew it she took sidelong peeks at lorelei wondering what had really happened between ronan and harry when they reached dungeon five ginny asked while the woman released the wards on the door uhm i was just wondering how your sister doing after they entered the classroom and the door shut behind them lorelei said do you see that table in the far back the one with the cloth covering it swallowing hard ginny said faintly yes fiery red stands out against white material as i sure you can imagine anyway you were asking about my sister she fine happy to no longer be a student and the answer to the question you re dying to ask about ronan and harry potter is no anything else you d like to ask it took a few moments to comprehend that the woman had seen her underneath the table and hadntsaid a word about it had trusted her not to tell ginny was still in the spluttering but then why stage when the professor retrieved a small carved box from her storage room open it ginny took the box and lifted the lid two vials and two flagons rested inside i d like you and mr malfoy to do an experiment for me miss weasley there are two flagons of unmemorable potion and two vials of memory enhancer the two of you would each drink the vial and then the flagon becoming unmemorable to everyone except each other i interested in finding out how long the potion remains viable if you re able to mingle with others undetected and what side effects if any taking both potions together would have are you amenable to performing the experiment was the woman joking a thought struck have there ever been any side effects i believe an urge to express affection has been noted in the past does that pose a problem no i mean no of course not ginny said before she realised the professor lips were twitching very well please keep the knowledge of this experiment contained to yourself and mr malfoy i wouldntwish anything to affect the results adversely until you return the evidence er empty containers and the box tomorrow morning i ll bid you good evening and happy valentine day after returning the woman sentiment and heading toward the door with her precious box ginny paused and looked back at lorelei she was pushing a pencil into alignment with another on her desk the woman felt her gaze because she asked without looking up something else miss weasely why now arranging a row of flagons with enchanted blossoms in them to a precisely equal distance between each other and the edge of the desk the professor glanced up briefly before looking down again it was enough for the girl to see tears glimmering because i can t and because you can goodnight goodnight slowly walking up the dungeon stairs clutching the box ginny experienced that bittersweet feeling again she was happy for herself she got to spend the night with draco and her friends even if her friends would never know it but she was sad for lorelei who had to chaperone the dance and wouldntget to be with her snape ginny steps slowed upon reaching the statue of bertha the behemoth she lifted the box toward the grinning giantess what did you say dontworry be happy has colin been humming that blasted muggle tune again it drives me spare but if you insist actually i insist i also insist you stop talking to statues i canthave a mental girlfriend unless you re crazy about me ginny whirled around to see draco smirking at her she lifted the box and backed into the alcove behind the statue her boyfriend followed arching his eyebrows and drawling i think you ve snogged me behind every bloody statue in school now he wraped his arms around her and bent his head to hers did you like your special valentine she lifted her wrist and kissed the gold heart charm releasing the concealment spell upon the plain surface the engraved initials gw dm materialised she nodded i love it she brushed her lips against his and then noticed his frown what wrong nothing it just i didntmean that valentine i meant finally do you know how hard it is to execute a covert operation when you have to ask the enemy if they ve seen your target a dwarf stood beside the statue scowling at them he was wearing the most bizarre costume ginny had ever seen it appeared to be some sort of camouflage trousers shirt and even makeup on his scowling face the little man glared at the boy who was scrunching his eyes closed and shaking his head if you hadntpaid the guild double for this stealth valentine boyo i d have been long gone so listen up juliet romeo here has a poem for you the strange messenger of love recited in an amazingly mellifluous voice i wrote your name in the sky but the wind blew it away i wrote your name in the sand but the waves washed it away i wrote your name in my heart and forever it will stay ginny watched draco thank the dwarf wryly and visually traced every feature of his classically handsome face and form had she known instinctively all those months ago that he had a beautiful soul no she d been overwhelmed by the beautiful body and complex personality she d wanted to snog him or slap him sometimes both at the same time merlin knew she still felt that way now and then malfoys might be love gods but they werentalways easy to live with they were demanding proud superior considerate self conscious witty smart kind loving snarky spiteful devious adorable oh merlin she loved everything about him good and bad she reached out a hand slid it through the hair at the nape of his neck it was so soft he considerately bent his head to hers but stopped just before reaching her mouth draco blurted in a un slytherin burst of honesty i didntwrite that poem jessica blade did she a housemate into that poetry tripe and i paid her to write it because even though i love you mine would ve been worse than yours to potty smiling ginny whispered i still love my valentine it the thought that counts melding her mouth to the lips that were curved so temptingly she kissed draco and asked when he responded absent mindedly what is it are you saying you love the poem or that you love me her heart turned over at the uncertainty that darkened grey eyes the thought that someone so amazing needed reassurance about his lovability made her want to reassure him in the most basic way ginny said i love you she scolded lovingly i trying to show you how much but you re not co operating are you a love god or a cupid giggles shook her body when her dragon gaze turned steamy and his lips devoured but the laughter couldntescape she didnthave enough breath allowing her hands to roam over his broad shoulders and the chest she wanted to see without a shirt again ginny started to reach around to squeeze that incredible arse she heard draco foot kick something and remembered the box grudgingly she broke the kiss leaning down to pick the container up the girl opened the lid the fingers that knew how to make every nerve ending in her body tremble with pleasure picked up a flagon is this what i think it is a wide smile creased her face at the sight of his grin ginny explained about professor lorelei experiment and the fact that the woman had seen her hair that day they d hid under the table white blond brows rose well well i knew that she was more than a pretty face but this is surprising no wonder she was sorted into gryffindor being a bold romantic of course she rather cunning as well must be why she and snape get on is that why you and i get on if you d shut it valentine we could get it on ginny giggled placed the box a safe distance away and slid her hands around his neck to pull his lips down to hers in a dorm in the slytherin tower blaise finished drying her hair smirking slightly over fiona grumbling that people with naturally curly hair that fixed itself should be hexed she reached out and touched the card on her desk terry had arranged for a dwarf to deliver it during lunch the grumpy little man had shaken his head in disgust muttering why do you people think shakespeare romantic tragedy says it all and hamlet oh fine prepare to be bedazzled by the bard he took a deep breath doubt thou the stars are fire doubt that the sun doth move doubt truth to be a liar but never doubt i love she had jumped up from her bench and hurled herself at terry even before the dwarf had stormed out of the room in the middle of the aisle they d taken public displays of affection to new levels draco had pulled her away and led her to their next class sneering the memory caused blaise to smile as she looked over to where morrigan was sitting at her desk staring down at the valentine card her yank boyfriend had sent hurrying over at the sight of a tear rolling down the pale cheek she asked urgently what wrong midnight eyes more liquid than tragedy queen cho chang tried to blink and hold back misery jay says that he loves me but he thinks we should date other people when we re not together blaise glanced at fiona who shook her head silently advising not to go off the deep end over the bastard bloody nerve to put that in his card inwardly determined to get draco to teach her the hex affecting private areas blaise tried to be supportive sorry mate what can we do sniffing morrigan shook her head nothing except maybe distract me from feeling like total crap the door opened cassandra observed her roommates in their robes preparing for the dance with a measuring stare after walking over and grabbing some things from her trunk the cryptic girl tossed over her shoulder on the way to the shower hope you didntuse all the hot water three sets of eyes flickered to one another slow smiles were exchanged morrigan rose and tossed back her long hair now that what i call a distraction grab your gear mates the friends entered the lavatory after they heard the shower stop they found cassandra standing in front of the mirror with her eyes closed she was a sad sight so blaise didntblame her for not wanting to look the girl startled when she saw that she was surrounded her brown eyes made a darting glance toward the door but she was cut off with no escape morrigan said relax this wonthurt a bit thirty minutes later blaise was almost jumping for joy it was so exciting to take a black bat and turn her into a pink butterfly cass looked so pretty now except for the sneer but hopefully kieran could transform that into a smile the three makeover artists stealthily followed their roommate and watched her walk down the girls staircase meet kieran and kiss him hugging each other the friends sighed happily cassandra tried to give them a black look but her lips were turning up their little cinderella was ready for the ball blaise waved and giggled all the way back to their room morrigan struck a pose as they applied makeup we re gonna make those boys say damn the trio stood smiling at their reflections in the mirror morrigan and fiona had chosen to wear matching form fitting strapless brocade mini dresses in different colours red on red for morrigan and gold on coral for fiona blaise wore a curve hugging strapless dress with a tiered skirt she loved the way the short uneven hemline accentuated her legs and the ruby red colour she grinned excitedly i not waiting for anyone damn we re gorgeous leaving the room blaise led the way downstairs she halted mid way turning to ask morrigan incredulously you re not going with montague are you the other girl smile was rueful he asked i didntcare who i went with frankly i just wanted to be with my friends fiona hugged her dontworry we wontleave you alone with him they continued down the steps to meet fiona new boyfriend beckham and morrigan s escort montague blaise saw draco lounging in a chair across the room reading a book she strolled over and read the title seeker strategy secrets you re blocking my light he said dryly she rubbed the material of his tee with a fingertip a little under dressed arentyou look who talking he smirked i setting up my cover as the poor blighter whose girl off with another bloke according to gossip boot and i flipped a coin to see who got to take you to the dance and he won so here i sit all alone fending off the sympathetic housemates who d be thrilled to keep me company oh poor baby not have fun with your valentine tonight you know i will with mine she blew him a kiss that caused an indignant third year to mutter heartless witch and left the common room blaise made her way to a seldom used corridor and saw a boy leaning against the statue of the giant fezzick the faithful he stepped toward her and she couldntspeak he took her breath away terry was so handsome he wore a chocolate brown velvet jacket over a red white and brown vertical striped shirt and brown trousers the outfit highlighted the red glints in long brown hair and made his eyes look so blue it was amazing it was it wesley doing all but the trousers he said you had a thing for italian clothes you like appreciative lips snogged the smile off his thankful that her makeup was kiss proof blaise shivered when his fingers trailed over the soft material of her bodice you wontfall out of this will you she shook her head it charmed to stay up he smiled in relief and then frowned what about later you ll have to wait and find out lips that were firm and soft at the same time covered hers after a long sweet kiss they made their way toward the dance snuggling against terry in a corner of the entry while they waited in line to have their picture taken blaise watched the photographer work she had to admit that rosaline was brilliant at getting people to look their best for the camera behind them another couple stepped into line it was weasley and granger the gryffindor boy was wearing a blue pinstriped suit that actually fit properly ron girlfriend was wearing a gold fringe tank dress that displayed some femininity blaise smiled at the pair they almost looked slytherin mr freckles returned the smile but hermione didn t how petty just because a girl insinuates she might make your sweetie her number three boyfriend blaise went back to the enthralling activity of playing with terry hair when the doors to the great hall opened couples filed into the transformed space awed at the changes made with the faery lights floating gently around the room and the magicked candles illuminating the tables the enormous chamber seemed cosier more intimate and romantic looking for us wesley and luna were standing behind them terry clapped his friend on the shoulder while blaise gave the blonde in a beaded silk dress a smiling inspection she asked what that colour called thistle it was the same shade as a thistle flower very pretty thank you the couples walked toward an empty table luna waved over two of her roommates and their dates to join them cindy cornfoot and her equally blond boyfriend were both wearing black mindy macdougal and her date colin creevey were in white blaise said trying to look angelic huh too bad we know you better colin really how that asked terry oh boy or should that be oh boyfriend blaise had forgotten she d decided not to tell terry all the little stunts colin had pulled on her pretending not to see a devilish pale brow rising in amusement at her expense she explained with a self conscious laugh colin been a little imp conning me into sing a couple of songs in muggle studies i told you about that didnti yeah i wish i could ve heard you i bet you were great aw terry was so sweet she just had to kiss him pulling back after several lovely moments she noticed mindy giving them a sour look what was her problem she d better not be using colin to get to terry not if she wanted to keep her hair rooted in that flaky scalp blaise glanced at colin maybe mindy wished that he d kiss her in public that could be it dumbledore in a black tuxedo count dracula might have worn officially welcomed everyone to the dance when he reminded them that the white rose bushes outside were for viewing pleasure only laughter filled the chamber the headmaster thanked professor hands for sponsoring the dance along with professor lorelei and the student committee for overseeing the beautiful decorations everyone was given a round of applause cindy said pensively it too bad lorelei doesnthave a date the group around their table nodded terry and blaise smiling at each other in their secret knowledge of the woman funny valentine the professional orpheus spun an orb filling the hall with music the boys stood and pulled back their dates chairs soon the dance floor was packed the orpheus did an excellent job of mixing up the favourite musical styles of the different houses blaise would ve tried to dance to each type of music but terry wasntthat into dancing he was able to move along with her as she worked her body and got a groove on to slytherin style music that along with ravenclaw line and slow dancing were all he could handle when they stood watching hufflepuffs do something called a two step colin asked want me to teach you that dance blaise she looked uncertainly from terry to the girl in a long white dress dontyou want to dance mindy i cantstand that hokey country music it fine by me terry smiled go ahead we ll watch blaise followed colin onto the floor the two fast steps two slow country dance wasnthard to pick up she looked over at terry and saw he was more interested in watching her add a shake to the glide than in listening to mindy chatter when a slow song started terry tapped colin on the shoulder blaise moved into his arms the warmth of his body felt incredibly good every time he brushed against her swaying frame the slow half turns she was making had male fingers tightening on her waist after the song was over the music changed to a disco beat smiling regretfully they joined the ravenclaws and even a few professors in doing the hustle after a few more saturday night fever numbers the music shifted into something only professor tonks her date the former professor lupin professor lorelei and the runes professor smalley stayed on the floor for blaise looked at terry who looked at wesley who looked at luna who sighed fine let do it the two couples moved onto the floor and began dancing with the others blaise stared at terry who expertly spun her out and back before clasping her hands and swinging her out and then in to one side out and then over to the other you ve done this before he grinned i thought it was child cruelty back when my parents made me learn but now i glad why the look he gave her threatened to melt her into a puddle because of you my pausing he sang with the music brown eyed girl during a break from dancing gentle fingers caressed luna bare shoulders causing her heart to skip when one slipped underneath a spaghetti strap she tilted her head to the side to stare up at wesley he was playing with her dress but would never play with her heart he said have i told you how lovely you look tonight only once every half hour or so it been thirty two minutes since the last time i was beginning to worry his dimples deepened in appreciation of her humour her gaze flickered over his clothes only wesley could wear a red velvet jacket with a psychedelic shirt and look gorgeous instead of ridiculous the blue in the shirt matched his eyes another colour was the same shade as her dress it was illogical how coordinating clothing made her feel so giddy it was though they were a perfect match a low chuckle sounded near her ear wesley began toying with one of the blond braids she d plaited on either side of her face he lifted the end to his lips and then began brushing it along her shoulder it made her shiver watching terry lift blaise into his arms for a kiss made luna want to follow their example well perhaps not her leg hooked around his she was a bit more reserved and she might tear her beautiful chiffon dress it was a trifle longer than blaise s her braid was used to trace the v of her neckline go over the silver beadwork and brush across oh wesley she mock frowned and then smiled reaching up to give him a quick kiss her boyfriend stared in amazement luna felt a bit uncomfortable surely she d kissed him in public before giving the matter some thought she was forced to admit that excepting the library incident she hadn t how remiss of her a roguish grin flashed across her pirate handsome face felt like plundering did he how lovely how dare they make such an exhibition of themselves mindy said wesley said drolly are you referring to us we d only just begun to make an exhibition of ourselves mindy smiled tightly her date laughed luna noticed that her roommate seemed more upset over the way colin stared at blaise legs than about the way terry was kissing her how very interesting a slow song began luring couples onto the floor the words were rather suggestive it must be a slytherin selection her boyfriend hands traced circles on her back luna returned the favour the smile she gave wesley froze when her gaze met harry potter s he looked at her even while brushing a kiss across cho hair and manoeuvring the girl toward a secluded corner screened by potted palms harry looked very handsome in a black suit but he was so dark compared to wesley luna gladly turned toward her boyfriend they swayed together for long moments a girl loud angry tone broke them apart cho was trying to get away from harry screeching like a banshee that he d been using her calling her another girl name lora chang rushed over to her friends at a nearby table while potter pushed his way through the curious onlookers and left the hall luna felt almost relieved at the dramatic scene she d known that something was wrong with harry instant relationship with cho and now she knew what it was funny how no one else seemed to be able to connect the dots between this episode and harry infatuation with a certain professor sister it was crystal clear to her she looked around the chamber and saw lorelei looking wistfully into the shadows opposite from where harry had gone a tender kiss brought luna out of her reverie you okay wesley was concerned for her but what about him he deserved better than a girlfriend who was always conflicted about another boy luna decided to make sure he got his valentine wish he d probably like it more than the book on pirates anyway after watching tonks and lupin along with lorelei and hagrid bop around to an oldie wesley waited for the slower music to draw couples back onto the floor he then danced her over to the orpheus there was a gleam in his eye that she d seen before luna started shaking her head oh no i not going to sing again i not really i m you re the beautiful brave girl that i love thank you for doing this minutes later luna was standing with wesley by the orpheus chanting a memory charm to help her memorise the words to the song her boyfriend wanted to sing people were watching and laughing but she was used to that a group of their friends stood nearby which made luna feel slightly more comfortable bindy neville cindy with her date jason mindy colin blaise and terry all smiled encouragingly the music started concentrating on the boy who d talked her into this luna smiled when he led off singing dontgo breaking my heart as before their voices complimented each other again the words of a song seemed to capture everything she felt because she knew he wouldntbreak her heart the applause was flattering but nowhere near as satisfying as the look on wesley face luna felt every bit as beautiful as he had told her she was deciding to be bold as well she kissed him in front of everybody and smiled against his lips when the applause became thunderous after luna and wesley laughingly accepted the compliments of their friends the group agreed to head back to the table the boys volunteered to go grab drinks while the girls decided to visit the powder room together luckily the line wasnttoo long and luna breathed a sigh of relief while she washed her hands that relief was short lived blaise and mindy each exited a stall and started washing their hands at basins on either side of luna in the mirror she watched her roommate slant her eyes over at blaise smoothing a non existent fallen strand back up into her upswept hair mindy said terry is so nice i dontknow of anyone else who d put up with their girlfriend being close friends with other boys luna pretended to check to make sure the silver unicorn earrings wesley had given her were securely fastened a covert glance in the mirror revealed blaise staring at the other girl with narrowed eyes yes he is terry also knows that i only love him so there no need for jealousy mindy fake laugh grated no need well if you say so what are you trying to say mindy simpered nothing i mean if terry is fine with you hanging all over malfoy and encouraging colin to trail after you too then who am i to say anything cindy and several other girls had started to crowd behind them needing to wash their hands but unwilling to break up what promised to be a juicy catfight luna took a step back blaise took a step forward yeah who are you to say anything you ve been trying to get terry since school began and even tonight you ve done your best to chat him up dontshake your head i saw you ravenclaw head and accusatory finger wagging the she sneered as for encouraging colin that shite you re trying to put on me because you wontadmit that you re a lousy date who couldntget a bloke if you were locked in a broom cupboard with him the muffled snorts and snickers of the girls pressing around them brought out mindy temper along with her wand silencio blaise smirked i always use a shielding charm when i dontcarry a wand but no magic needed to do this mindy head rocked to the side with the force of the other girl slap shocked silence prevailed blaise stalked out leaving luna followed by cindy to gently take their roommate by the arm they led her sobbing out into the corridor the niche behind lydia the lachrymose was currently un occupied so they steered their unhappy friend there and used an appearance charm to make the handprint on the girl face disappear in a short while mindy had regained control of her emotions conjured a handkerchief and used it to blow her nose before making the fabric vanish luna waited patiently for her friend to speak i so rogered taking the other girls silence as encouragement mindy explained zabini was right i have been trying to get terry cindy gasped oh no poor colin mindy smiled bitterly poor colin has been after blaise we were working together i dontknow how many times we tried to get those two apart but nothing ever worked tonight i realised that i dontwant terry anymore luna said gently you want colin cindy sweet innocent that she was said why dontyou just tell him mindy laughed if only romance was that easy luna said i could lock you two in a broom cupboard they all giggled at the thought mindy said i ll get back to you on that right now we should get back to the dance luna halted near the doors to the great hall when mindy whispered do you think zabini told everybody one of the doors opened colin walked out hey mindy what took you so long blaise said you were fixing makeup but you dontlook any different smiling in relief his date said sarcastically that how you know it fixed he chuckled the orpheus said he d let me sing a song too you ve got to come be my groupies the girls laughed over the conceit and promised to swoon when the others returned to the dance floor mindy stayed at the table with the excuse of needing to finish her drink luna told wesley as the music played and they swayed together blaise slapped some sense into mindy in the bathroom she realises that she wants colin now all we have to do is get him to want her back wesley pursed his lips in an effort not to laugh and was kissed for looking kissable his eyes were as merry as robin goodfellow when he murmured that should be nothing for a matchmaker of your calibre valentine colin was singing a love song in his beautiful high voice and not looking at his date while he sang it gamely deciding that no challenge was too big for a matchmaker to handle luna melted into her boyfriend embrace and refused to think about any hidden meaning behind the pure notes she just cuddled against the heat of wesley body and basked in the warmth of their love the moment ginny walked behind the statue of inigo the impetuous draco felt that strange feeling he d been experiencing so often over the last few months that it was becoming almost comfortable happiness he didnttrust the feeling but he liked it and was prepared to do just about anything to keep it making his life better than it had ever been before red was wearing the second dress she d found in that grotty secondhand rose shop in london never in a thousand years would he have believed the almost plain dress would look so fine it was all due to the girl wearing it the black silk dress bared one shoulder and the asymmetrical hem made him long to slide a palm up and find out if she was wearing tights or thigh high stockings draco tucked the white silk handkerchief his girl had monogrammed for valentine into the breast pocket of his black suit before lifting her hand to his lips it was worth sneaking around just to see ginny gaze at him as if he was the moon and the stars she looked him up and down impressed as always i glad that i the only girl who gets to see you tonight you re way too gorgeous slytherin draco gave her the come and get me stare through the lashes she always complained were un fairly beautiful and wasted on a boy he said huskily i glad no other bloke but me gets to look at you you re so hot that i d be hexing blokes all night unable to resist him any longer his girlfriend pressed him against the wall and kissed him breathless not that he d had much breath anyway the way she d stolen it with her beauty reluctantly breaking the kiss before the lusty wench broke his resolve not to rush the relationship draco smiled let get unmemorable pouting a moment before smiling back ginny reminded unmemorable to everyone except each other dontforget that i could never forget you how he enjoyed making freckles blush it did such lovely things for her complexion it also highlighted a couple of freckles beneath her right earlobe that he knew he d never kissed before resolving to correct that intolerable romantic error draco threw back the contents of the vial and then the flagon a slight shiver travelled down his spine but nothing else happened he shrugged let go see if the potion works his heart jolted when ginny looked around anxiously draco where are you i know he was just here quickly he grabbed her shoulders ginny love dontyou remember me soft brown eyes met his of course i do you re unforgettable relieved and a bit put out by her prank draco told the giggling girl very funny red just wait i ll bide my time and then i ll get you for that when ginny licked her lips and stared at his mouth he pursed his lips in the way he knew she thought adorable and lowered his voice i going to make you wait and wonder until every nerve is tingling with anticipation until your heart races and your lungs can barely drag in enough breath and then he clenched his jaw to keep from laughing while he bent his head until his lips were only a couple of millimetres away from hers his impulsive sweetheart who had a lot in common with old inigo asked breathlessly what what are you going to do tell me draco whispered i going to find out if you re wearing tights or thigh high stockings smirking he started to pull back but was halted by slender hands grabbing his jacket face flushed she gritted forget waiting you re going to find out right this minute shifting and sliding her back against the wall draco smiled wickedly before sliding a hand up her leg and ravishing her mouth in long hot kiss satisfied by the kiss and the hands on knowledge of ginny thigh high stockings draco grinned at his girlfriend who was failing in her attempt to look disgusted with his slytherin cunning she giggled and he chuckled before they both froze at the sound of an awful familiar voice what that my precious you heard something i know i know dumbledore wontlet us patrol tonight he wants to let the wizard brats have a chance for romance that doesntmean we cant accidentally come upon wrong doers in the course of our leisurely stroll does it my dearest the caretaker and his cat slunk into view on the lookout for erring students mrs norris turned suddenly and sniffed draco tensed that cologne blaise had given him it really did attract every woman under the sun even feline ones filch impatient with his tail twitching companion scolded there nothin here my lovely come along in less than an hour snape has me patrolling the dungeons so if we want to catch lovebirds best do it now yowling the cat ran ahead with her partner hurrying to catch up ginny shuddered they are so disgusting there are not enough words did you see that red heart on mrs norris collar unfortunately yes on the bright side the potions work that cologne blaise made me wear almost got us caught though maybe i should go wash it off no seeing his upraised eyebrow ginny laughed self consciously i really love it well put that way draco nodded agreeably and slid his arm around her waist in the corridor near the dungeon stairway a dark form materialised boy it was the bloody baron tall broad shouldered and brutally handsome the spectre appeal was marred by the numerous bloodstains on his robes malfoy wondered if the rumour about the baron being killed by the jealous husbands of his many mistresses was true the man face looked familiar as though he d seen him somewhere before shaking off the eerie sensation draco said how can you see us low dark laughter rumbled ginny pressed against his side a translucent black brow rose the spirit replied sardonically the dead are not constrained by the limitations of the living come the ghost appeared to freeze in shock when the girl asked where drifting so close draco wondered if he would be trying to hex the baron for coming on to his girl the spectre examined her closely then nodded long black hair seeming to float in the slight breeze drifting up from the underground corridor the bloody ghost floated backwards ye shall do saucy wench holding up an imperious hand to halt an indignant retort the ghost said ye shall come to our love never dies dance of course pansy porpington challenged me to bring a living guest his head might roll off when he sees that i have brought two if the dolt is lucky draco refused to move why should we go haughtily the baron said because you are my kin and your line owes me a debt of blood beside him ginny stammered oh my gods he looks like a medieval you with black hair draco admitted that the bloody baron was bloody good looking maybe that why he d seemed so familiar there was a family resemblance he scowled what this about a blood debt wafting backwards down the stairway to the dungeons the apparition said your ancestor made his fortune by taking it from me his own brother and blaming the deed on another man draco had known his family wasntexactly warm and loving but stealing an inheritance killing your brother that was muggle how much lower could they go ginny hugged his arm he looked down saw the love in her eyes and felt better who cared about his mouldy ancestors he d go to the party let the baron rub it in to headless nick out of slytherin loyalty and that was it they would say have a nice death and leave inside dungeon seven the ironic love never dies dance was in full swing couples floated around the floor in a spirited waltz or walked through a table laden with rotten food claiming to almost smell it the piano player was bouncing on the bench moving his head and body along with his fingers in a very lively way ginny stared hard at the ghost who looked over smiled widely and winked at her the pig tailed ghost who d been leaning through the piano scowled and zoomed toward the living guests ooohhh why d you have to come and snatch amadeus attention he the only truly spirited man here everyone else is so deadly dull go away moaning myrtle noticed the baron and whimpered before darting back to her piano man the ghost sneered at the other apparitions reluctance to draw near and called out i have brought life to the party where is the popinjay here i am you cad who in the devil did you get to oh my word miss weasley nearly headless nick looked nearly speechless stuttering the ghost asked w why are you h here g ginevra my dear the edwardian courtier put a hand to his ruff and looked apprehensively toward the baron ginevra scrutinizing her face and form once more the ghost smiled wolfishly before turning to her draco what is it worth to you to restore your family honour nothing then what is it worth to have this maiden reputation remain unblemished by public knowledge of your secret romance everything a gleam of red appeared in the bloody baron eyes i wish a boon a favour from the two of you it will not harm and after a few moments of your mortal time you will be free to leave unharmed your secrets untold by any here draco glanced around the dungeon all spirits had halted their activities to watch the drama unfold before them he looked at ginny she nodded eagerly let do him the favour and go please the baron asked do you vow by godric gryffindor wench the girl snapped my name is ginny miss weasley to you and yes i agree by godric gryffindor how about you boy draco sneered into the face that was nowhere near as handsome as his all right by salazar slytherin i ll do you the favour and then you keep your trap shut and we leave unharmed the baron eyes closed and then opened glowing fully red draco hugged ginny tightly the ghost lifted his hands and called by blood and by name by boon freely offered i call thee and bind thee ginevra draco felt like he had when that bloody hippogriff had tried to rip his arm off this time he didntfall down and whimper instead he whispered reassurances to ginny while they watched a spirit materialise in shock he saw the ghost step into his girlfriend body he turned to the baron to protest but the ghost stepped into him and what happened next seemed to be happening to someone else in a dream the baron looked down at his hands lifted one to touch the girl face she slapped it away how dare you drag me here using these children to to talk to you try and reason with a stubborn wench who has avoided me for centuries big brown eyes turned dark with fury why should i talk to you lying philandering bastard killed by a jealous husband leaving me the choice of becoming your brother leman or leaping from yon tower thinkest thou i have no right to anger realising that she too had use of living flesh the girl slapped the boy as hard as she could when he tried to talk she shrieked and began flailing at him he grabbed her arms and pinned her back against his chest pleading in the ear she tried to turn away ginevra thinkest thou i loved so little was thy love for me so paltry you readily believed my brother lies he slew me in this chamber when i would not sign away my lands how wouldst i be here if i had truly been killed in exeter what reason had i to linger on this mortal plane except to be with my love once more she sagged against him turned when he released her and stared into his eyes i knew nothing save my love had been untrue and had been slain i died that day smiling through the tears streaming down her cheeks the maiden framed his face with her hands my love has never died i could not hate if i did not love kiss me draco filled with wonder the baron brushed his lover soft lips with his the kiss was so sweet it almost un manned him blinking back unseemly signs of emotion he melded her mouth with his revelled in the touch of her hands made free with his own greedily stroking her body and hair he expressed his devotion with kisses and caresses that grew increasingly bolder and more heated until the sound of a throat clearing eventually parted their reluctant lips his beautiful ginevra smiled lovingly noticing a regency era ghost watching nervously from behind sir nicholas his bride said wilt thou cease flirting if i cease hiding laughing freely in a way that scared castle spirits more than his customary scowl draco baron malfoy teased i almost had you after the christmas ball i caught a glimpse of your aura out of the corner of my eye as i left but thou hast ever been a wily wench appreciating her boldness in kissing him once more draco savoured her warm softness that enabled him to recapture every happy memory of their long ago love he asked tenderly wouldst thou linger on this plane with me awhile longer my love she nodded and hugged him tight taking a last mortal breath the ghosts released their borrowed bodies and drifted upwards draco stared at ginny looked at the tearstains on her cheeks blinked and felt a lone salty drop trickle down his face merlin it had been real not a dream he cupped her face are you all right she nodded smiling crookedly wasntthat the saddest most romantic thing ever he shook his head girls who could figure them out draco had expected his girlfriend to faint with shock and horror instead she was smiling at the ghostly couple wrapped around and into each other and wiping away a tear while she wished them a happy valentine day mental girls were pure mental when it came to love he brusquely said have a nice death eternal love whatever and dragged her out of the dungeon before she volunteered to let the pair have a conjugal visit he didntcare how pitiful the parted lovers were he wasntletting anyone else touch ginny body the starry eyed girl kept the romantic glow he didntgo for that sort of rubbish but it looked good on her they entered the hall and began to dance ginny looked around the chamber whispered in his ear how they d decided on this and done that to decorate it he enjoyed hearing about it due to the sensation of her breath giving him happy shivers they took advantage of being able to dance without drawing attention he taught her some steps that unselfconscious due to being unmemorable ginny picked right up much to his delight they had a few close calls when other couples almost careened into them but nothing they couldnthandle when potty and cho had their little scene draco couldnthelp but whisper that bloke not right no doubt about it looking sad his valentine agreed during creepy creevey song draco noticed the little pervert singing to blaise instead of to his date he d have to give his mate boot a wake up call about that bending his head to kiss ginny draco stiffened since when had he started thinking of tarzan the ape man as a friend he relaxed upon thinking that it must be residual mental deterioration from being possessed by a spirit draco said when creevey stepped down look over there what snape doing his romance crazed girlfriend looked ready to cry those weird happy tears again he taking a rose off ron table my brother looks rather stupid when his mouth hangs open now snape talking to the orpheus her voice grew wobbly as her smile oh draco he asked lorelei to dance oh my gods they look so this is so if you say this is the most romantic thing ever i shall be forced to do something rash ginny still retaining a bit of her saucy wench attitude whispered ever ever ever and giggled when he narrowed his eyes and stepped back his fair maiden stood gaping in the centre of the dance floor while he sauntered over to the weasel table snatched a rose out of the arrangement and strolled back draco got down on one knee and asked softly ginevra will you be my valentine she nodded took the rose and slid her arms around his neck kissing him passionately swaying with his sweetheart draco vowed that one day he too would stop hiding his feelings he would dance with ginny for the world to see and damn anyone who disapproved for now he closed his eyes and knew that ginny and this night was unforgettable chapter 3 getting girly and green eyed blaise felt like a different girl from the one who had walked the school corridors just a few days ago sitting behind not so loony lovegood in muggle studies had literally changed her life somehow asking luna for assistance in bringing ginny and draco together as a real life beatrice and benedick had gained the mellow machiavelli aid in changing blaise life too i wearing makeup i ve taken the chip off my shoulder this weekend delighted mum sends my new robes so i can chuck out the baggy ones from my wardrobe i have publicly declared my interest in boys i am officially a girl smiling at her thoughts blaise glanced around and met the blue eyes of a boy sitting at the table directly across the aisle he was a ravenclaw one of those easygoing athletic types she d seen sitting with the quidditch players at luna table she wondered what he was staring at blaise quickly checked the cauldron she and fiona flint were tending the bellicose potion looked fine just needed a few more minutes of anti clockwise stirring and fiona had that covered she caught the boy eyes again and widened her own in realisation oh gods she was what he was staring at what was his first name blaise had only heard him referred to as mr boot by professor snape whose dark voice always implied that he d like to give the brown haired student the boot right out of his dungeon snape disparaged every student that wasntslytherin however so that didntmean anything blaise sighed desperately envying the boy shoulder length straight hair mr boot there is no possible advantage gained by staring at your neighbour five points from ravenclaw keep your attention on your potion and not ms zabini sudden change in appearance blaise had to learn his name because she could not call a boy boot she pretended not to hear the smothered laughter from the rest of the class or see a rueful smile while looking over at another table draco was sneering at pansy in response to something she had whispered he contemptuously announced that people who were confused about another gender were too stupid to live pansy immediately tried to placate her idol without thought she gestured with a ladle full of liquid splashing her partner millicent broad face with bellicose potion instantly enraged the girl starting cursing pansy and threatening bodily harm as professor snape stalked over to administer the antidote blaise glanced sideways across the aisle the ravenclaw smiled at her again he had such a nice smile and tossed a note that landed in front of her she unfolded the note i always knew you were a girl no offence but snape and malfoy are both gits may i walk to you to the great hall after class terry reading the note over her partner shoulder fiona gasped say yes dummy after sliding the note into her schoolbag blaise smiled shyly at terry and nodded her head he grinned pretending to concentrate solely on bottling the potion and writing their names on the flagon for testing she felt like a mess of nerves inside getting all fluttery over the thought of a boy had to be the ultimate in girly blaise kept her eyes off her handsome neighbour but she couldntkeep the smile off her face humming lunar love her favourite weird sisters tune today luna gazed around the muggle studies classroom in dreamy satisfaction she had managed to coincidentally arrive for class at the same early time as ginny and accidentally bump into her knocking both of their schoolbags onto the floor oh my let me help you so sorry i must have been in dreamland blaise derogatory remark came in handy ginny beatrice huffed in exasperation and blew a bright red strand of hair away from her face its okay luna no that not my essay wait a minute you re partnered with blaise zabini yes that right she very interesting she a slytherin slytherins arentall bad the matter of fact observation lit the fuse of a typical redhead temper she got something going on with malfoy luna that as bad as you can get is that what you think that what i saw that not what blaise told me luna allowed her gaze to drift off to a point above the other girl left shoulder idly she wondered how long it would take the girl to break down and ask what did she tell you hmmm she d lasted to a count of 6 pretty good for an impulsive person ginny not so gentle grabbing and shaking of the blonde girl arm encouraged her to answer well because you re a friend ignoring the raised red eyebrow luna continued and because blaise didntsay that it was a secret spill it lovegood ow stop shaking me all right they re just friends just friends after that scene in the hall friends said ginny in a flat tone of disbelief draco is trying to impress somebody and blaise wants another boy to notice she a girl that all they ve got going on who terry boot sixth year ravenclaw after another impatient shake luna lifted hooded eyes to say you meant draco you really should be more specific blaise doesntknow he very secretive it a slytherin thing stuffing the last of the fallen books into her schoolbag luna said mildly why all the interest no interest other than keeping tabs on the worst enemy my family has at this school oh luna nodded her head trying to project an i get it i think understanding in that case if i hear anything else you ll let me know not that i personally care or anything it only precautionary ginny said defensively a shield charm of prevention is worth a stay at st mungo of cure luna turned and drifted sedately over to her seat smiling at the memory luna tuned back in to the class discussion professor hands seemed to enjoy listening to his students stumble through shakespeare play the class was now reading the second act and beatrice had just used the pretence of not recognising benedick during a dance at the masked ball to take him down a peg or two silently following along a few of the phrases struck luna as very pertinent the commendation is not in his wit but in his villainy for he both pleases men and angers them luna contemplated ginny profile and thought the girl was probably enjoying that part without having a clue why it related to her personally she smiled blaise had sent a note through terry to meet after lunch by the statue of gregory the smarmy luna had been elated that draco had repeated ginny everyone else in this school thinks you re a boring prat several times during the meal in an amazingly benedick like way after all he wouldntbe so angry if his feelings werenthurt and his feelings wouldntbe hurt if he didntcare the plot was thickening perhaps ms lovegood will tell us what part of benedick words to don pedro most indicated his true feelings it seemed that the teacher had noticed her preoccupation and was trying yet again to call her out on it luna sighed why were professors so keen on using eye contact as proof of attention she could stare through the man all class and not hear a word the entire time shrugging over the lack of logic luna dutifully read aloud what she considered pertinent she speaks poniards and every word stabs if her breath were as terrible as her terminations there were no living near her she would infect to the north star utilising her best misty expression luna said pensively benedick is using hyperbole to distract others from his real feelings he states how he would go to the ends of the earth rather than spend any more time with beatrice to cover his hurt over her scornful opinion ginny appeared to seriously reflect on luna opinion about the scene the professor called on several other students for input and then moved on to another part after class blaise waited for the class to empty before saying had me worried for a minute there thought you might tip her off with your covering his hurt and real feelings spiel luna sighed it had to be done subtlety may work for our benedick but our beatrice needs a kick in the arse to get the same effect when i know the gentlewoman i ll tell her what you say go right ahead luna was unruffled i ll return the favour with malfoy grimacing at the thought blaise gathered her things nodded her goodbye while luna patted the omnioculars in her pocket and looked forward to watching the show at dinner draco ran his fingers through the pale hair pansy and millicent were currently mooning over before looking with studied casualness over at a specific gryffindor she was wrapped up in whatever potty was saying probably telling her how he going to win the house cup defeat you know who and bring peace to all magical creatures this year you re not hungry draco what gave you that idea pansy the untouched food on my plate he tried to sneer but it was a half hearted stab prodding the simpletons around him wasntworth the effort tonight he was getting as morose as old snape draco covertly checked to see what ginny was up to now she was looking back at him sombrely maybe she regretted calling him a boring prat she should the minute blaise showed her face he was going to give that weaselette harpy a reason to stare if he could work up to it right now even breathing felt like a chore noticing the heads turning excitedly draco sat up straighter and started to smile in anticipation his friend had just made her entrance and taunting the littlest weasel no longer felt like work it would be his pleasure blaise looked amazing she had taken in her robes somehow so they clung in a way that showed off her long toned body her bold red lipstick really played up latin lips silver hoop earrings swayed against dark curls and the entire package was beyond girly blaise zabini was hot standing in honour of the goddess before him draco gallantly brought her hand to his lips with only the slightest of smirks a chorus of envious sighs echoed through the hall blaise winked at him and gave him a shallow curtsey in return before sliding onto her seat he hoped that ginny was eating her heart out blaise was being a mate to go along with his plan and he intended to make it as much fun for her as it was going to be for him studying her up close draco leant in to examine her earrings startled he laughed merlin blaise your hoops are snakes goblin silver from before the last rebellion you like he rubbed his finger over the serpent earring closest to him emeralds for eyes i like tracing a delicate ear he said silkily i like everything i see he blew in her ear causing her to shiver and laugh he saw blaise gaze flicker to a certain table she smirked and turned back lowering her face to peer teasingly up at him ginny may have brown eyes but they sure look green to me laughing draco proceeded to push the limits of public displays of affection while eating a new dinner with voracious appetite at the start of dinner ginny pretended interest in harry play by play description of the last quidditch game while whispering to colin out of the side of her mouth is he still glaring over here colin looked sideways at the slytherin table if you re referring to the prince of snakes no he glaring at parkinson now heaving a sigh of relief ginny pushed her hair back and looked glumly at her friend as usual he was quick to ask are you all right ginny i fine malfoy just gives me the creeps colin was unusually silent and ginny hoped he would remain that way she wasntup to explaining what was going on between malfoy and herself she didntunderstand it so how could she explain it even muggle studies class was bewildering today it brought up issues she didntwant to think about was she supposed to believe draco malfoy had actual feelings that could be hurt that he was trying to impress her what had he meant by he d never forget it either had the cold hearted snake regretted his actions ginny looked across at draco serious expression feeling even more confused a groundswell of murmuring snagged her attention ginny glanced sideways to see ron and harry craning their necks for a better view of whoever was entering the hall ron blunt as ever said merlin zabini really looks like a girl now ouch he broke off to rub his sore head i sorry did i accidentally hit you with hogwarts a history hermione gestured to the large book with an exaggerated look of remorse ron got the point and said defensively i was only saying zabini looks like a girl now that she wearing makeup and jewellery and robes that show she actually got ow keep that book away from me too bad you have to learn everything the hard way ron harry said laughingly the sheepish redhead was using two hands to rub his abused head the boys went back to watching blaise zabini glide over to the slytherin table ginny watched too she didntwant to see what happened but she couldntlook away i wonder where she found those earrings they look like goblin silver ginny distantly heard hermione observation draco had just stood up and kissed the girl hand inwardly she sighed along with every other silly twit in the hall she had a clear view of the slytherin couple he was using those clever fingers to trace her earrings blaise jumped and laughed when he blew in her ear across the distance the girl eyes locked on her own ginny knew she d be having nightmares about that knowing smirk oh merlin i cantwatch malfoy crawl all over her why are the teachers allowing this snape wouldntobject if the slytherins swept off the dishes and went at it on the table but why doesntdumbledore do anything ginny shook with emotion the biggest shock of all was the casual attitude everyone around her was showing toward the disgusting display the boys were looking like they envied malfoy his sophisticated assurance and polished moves hermione was staring wistfully as if she wanted ron to learn some of draco techniques and use them on her no one was outraged and affronted like she was were they blind was the slytherin couple not stepping over the line to anyone except her the thought that she was the only person who wanted someone to break them up and never allow draco and blaise to sit near each other again was intolerable the abrupt departure of terry boot from the ravenclaw table should have made ginny feel better someone else could not stand looking at the nauseating duo either luna artless words came back to her if blaise was trying to get terry attention she had it he looked sick with jealousy a sudden thought slammed into ginny she reeled from the impact do i look sick with jealousy too ginny forced herself to stay seated until students started to depart counterfeiting a lame excuse about studying she left without drawing the notice of the boy who would be starring again in her nightmares chapter 30 secrets february 15th was cold bleak and grey the sky was cloudy and luna wondered if it might snow she would very much like to play in the snow again she had fond memories of tobogganing with wesley luna could finally admit that when he had wrapped his arms around her and leaned close enough for her to feel his warm breath against her cold cheek her heartbeat had raced at the time she d been chanting friend friend friend it had not worked very well in fact the whole trying to talk herself into right thinking had made her feel rather mental her inner good girl the one who was going to save herself for harry potter and live off dreams forever if need be had insisted remember roberts is only a friend the little voice she d called her inner tart on new year eve had back in november been nameless but just as vocal encouraging c mon be friendly by sticking your tongue into one of those dimples these days luna personality felt healthy and integrated now she wanted to show wesley how much she appreciated him being her boyfriend by sticking her tongue into his dimple after she d explored his mouth last night she had experienced the most romantic valentine day of her life this morning she was reluctant to get out of bed wanting to stay under the covers and continue dreaming that she and her love were slow dancing under an enchanted sky filled with shooting stars bindy ruined her dreamy state by pulling off her covers get up you ll miss breakfast and it the most important meal of the day when that got no response the girl used her most dire warning soon the elves stopped serving grumpily luna watched the jovial girl wave and bounce out the door with cindy chirping good morning and exiting behind her only mindy remained in the room dark circles under greenish blue eyes showed that her dreams had not been pleasant sympathetically luna asked rough night you could say that i kept dreaming boot dumped zabini for me and i couldntget creevey to believe that i didntcare didntwant terry anymore he kept saying frankly my dear i dontgive a damn it was horrible luna stood it was also a scene from a muggle novel gone with the wind i told you not to read late at night mindy frowned i thought you said not to eat late at night that what i told bindy who trying to reduce so she wontbe embarrassed for neville to see her in a bathing suit over easter holiday what mindy said indignantly she looks fine i dontsee longbottom piling less on his plate at meals the only gryffindor who eats more than he does is that weasley boy and he must have a tapeworm or something nodding her agreement neville did enjoy his food and ronald ate enough for three but stayed lanky as ever luna gently redirected the conversation so how did the rest of the dance go after colin song an unhappy laugh sounded you probably didntnotice what with wesley counting your teeth with his tongue and then snape freaking everybody out by dancing with lorelei but my date spent most of his time staring at zabini winding herself around boot like a python i got fed up with it and stormed out luna said what happened then a rueful smile crossed mindy face we ended up behind the statue of bertha the behemoth again snogging our brains out isntthat good mindy shook her head while picking out a uniform and robes from her trunk colin calls it practise you know for when he gets a chance to do to zabini all the things he been trying on me luna quickly evaluated the situation and calculated the most effective action only colin can change his way of thinking but you can change yours to help him want to change start right now next time he wants to practise you use the opportunity to persuade him that you re the girl he really wants the girl backing toward the bathroom already looked ten times better than she had a few minutes ago and mindy hadnteven used a complexion charm yet luna returned her friend hopeful smile and felt a warm fuzzy glow fill her matchmaking heart wesley smile upon seeing her enter the hall for breakfast made that glow of contentment spread throughout her body she slid onto the bench beside him while she fingered a silver unicorn earring luna thanked her boyfriend for ordering porridge and fruit for her his bright blue gaze noticed her eyeing his bacon breaking off a piece and offering it to her wesley mouth curved in a way that made the glow become a flush her eyes became heavy lidded while he fed her the bacon her lips brushed his fingers when he winked and turned to reply to something terry said she smiled across the table at cindy who asked teasingly are you dreading our last class lindy it divination today i looking forward to it actually in response to a sceptical look she said i want to take a nap in one of those comfy chairs in ancient runes luna smiled remembering wesley murmuring in her ear to spend class time wisely daydreaming about him with a start she looked around and saw that her classmates were staring at her that was never a good thing professor smalley chided now i sure you didntmean to be disrespectful miss lovegood in fact several of my self help books state that people who ignore others may just need more positive affirmation in their lives sleepy brown eyes surveyed the class he asked who believes their classmate needs to practise a little self affirmation every hand went up even her friends raised their hands the traitorous witches familiar with the drill from months of watching others be in need of positive affirmation luna reluctantly stood and made her way to the front of the classroom to the side a large looking glass stood in a wooden frame the sandy blond professor smiled encouragingly do you remember what we should say whenever we re in need of positive self affirmation luna closed her eyes to keep him from seeing them roll like blue marbles we do as usual any negativity slid off the teacher like water off a duck although come to think of it the man lips bore an uncanny resemblance to waterfowl especially when the quack pursed his lips and nodded his head like she had seen birds do at home when waiting for breadcrumbs levelly luna stated i good enough i smart enough and doggone it people like me smalley puffed up by his usage of drivel obtained from one of his many twelve step programs decided to allow her the honour of using his authentic norse wooden runes just bought from a real islander not icelander they dontlike that at a frost fair over the holiday asking if she wished to seek knowledge for herself or a friend the teacher said in response to her quick reply of friend think of that person for some reason she thought of blaise smalley asked which method would you like to use for divination miss lovegood she said the first one she thought of the norns ah past present and future illuminated with three runes excellent pull the first one out of the bag which is not authentic since fabric and animal hides didntwear well back in the days before preservation spells obligingly pulling out a rune the girl handed it to her teacher the man showed the symbol of an x to the class while exclaiming gebo the gift does anyone remember what this rune symbolises a girl in the back said hesitantly an oath or bond smalley nodded very good anything else a boy on the front row lifted his hand gebo is the connection between people it shows how lives intersect and the conscious choices we make in relationships absolutely correct do you know how this could apply to your friend miss lovegood a choice she made to form a bond with someone in the past affects the present the professor smiled indeed draw the next rune luna chose another rune the teacher displayed the symbol that looked like a y with a short line continuing up through the middle of the v shape interesting which symbol is this miss cornfoot perb associated with the goddess freyja symbolizing uh the womb hidden mysteries cause and effect action and reaction sir yes and does this reveal anything to you about your friend my dear thinking of all the ways blaise choice to be best mates with draco years ago impacted her life today luna nodded she reached into the bag for the third and final rune her fingers almost picked up one but it seemed to slide away causing her tingling fingertips to grasp another rune instead lifting it toward the professor her pale brows contracted this was a strange one laguz looks rather like a sickle doesntit the water symbol unusual i donthold to the notion that the third rune or runestone signifies one inevitable fate i prefer to interpret the symbol as the probable future result of a current situation whether it happens today or ten years from now even then it is only one of many possible futures bindy raised her hand into the air what does that mean sir the professor shook himself out of the reverie he d fallen into and changed his tone from rhetorical to instructional the norse viewed water or more aptly the sea as a dangerous unpredictable even terrifying place remember it was home to the dreaded midgard serpent and became many a sailor grave this rune signifies things hidden that will be revealed perhaps emotions or fears something the unconscious mind refuses to acknowledge do you find this helpful in regards to your friend miss lovegood not really everybody had secrets things they didntwant to acknowledge or reveal she lied yes quite helpful and returned to her seat smalley assigned the class to use the norn method and concentrate on their own lives next class they would hand in a scroll stating the meanings of the runes they had chosen and any possible ramifications the divination would conceivably have on their future bindy cindy and mindy gathered around their friend in the corridor after class patting lindy on the shoulder bindy said you look like you could use some chocolate to cheer you up i ve got a bar in my pocket for emergency purposes only of course i wasntgoing to eat it or anything luna declined the treat she needed a much more effective mood lifter a boy was strolling down the corridor toward her his black robes made his hair shine golden her heart skipped a beat she praised merlin for the plentiful statuary around the school and gave him a look that made his steps quicken behind the nearby statue of rupert the red luna found in wesley kiss just what she needed to forget the cryptic meanings of the runes before lunch ginny ran up to her room to grab a new quill inside the chamber rosaline and esme were sitting on her roommate bed chatting rosaline glanced up with a cool smile we dontusually see you around much during the day you re always running off to the library or somewhere esme asked do you have a secret boyfriend that you meet there ros and i were wondering if we should follow you sometime ow why d ya hit me sis ginny knew i was just kidding didntya ginny ginny strolled over to her desk to pick up a quill sure i did esme if i didn t i might have to tell lorelei who a close personal friend of my family rosaline whole demeanour changed oh no there no need for that we re all friends who respect privacy here she lifted a print off her desk are you going to be seeing professor lorelei today i took a picture that i think she will really like it just a thank you ginny stared down at the photograph of snape and lorelei dancing there was a box in her school bag that she had yet to return yes but i sure the professor is more thankful you were available to take pictures the thank you is for sponsoring me for an internship with the siren corporation this summer i ll be able to learn from professional photographers and that a priceless opportunity after congratulating the other girl ginny controlled the urge to snicker over the formerly money grubbing blonde gushing that something was more important than the almighty galleon she waved goodbye and made her way toward the great hall the door to the last classroom before the entrance hall opened when she walked by draco stood in the doorway little red little red wontyou come in ginny moved into the room staring in disbelief while her boyfriend shut the door and pressed her against it i cantbelieve that a malfoy knows a muggle faery tale grey eyes rolled in disgust blaise told me it was a wizard tale the little liar her giggles stopped by his demanding mouth little red happily parted her lips letting the big bad wolf in she was still floating on air from last night and feeling draco hands caressing her hair and back was almost too much stimuli for her overloaded nervous system to handle almost when he whispered to meet him later she remembered what she needed to say i dontthink we should meet there for awhile my roommate is a little too curious about why i always heading off to the library i stopped her with a threat to tell lorelei but i wouldntput it past rosaline to try and nose around anyway she as curious as a cat she ll lose one of those nine lives if she crosses me storm clouds had nothing on draco eyes if looks could kill rosaline would be down to life number eight it was sexy ginny forced herself to get a grip where can we go instead her boyfriend shrugged off his temper and gave an intriguing half smile how about someplace different he looked like a little boy with a secret where the attics ginny blinked in confusion had he just said the attics dracos smile widened remember when i gave you the mirror you ve got that same look on your face trust me you ll like this almost as much the big bad wolf must have looked like that when he persuaded little red riding hood to leave the nice safe path and go for a walk on the wild side no wonder the girl ran off to pick flowers how could any female resist well normal females mcgonagall would probably look down her nose and inform the wolf that she had a schedule to keep and he could go put his dirty paws on someone less morally upright ginny giggled over the silly mental image she agreed to meet him after dinner and gave her wolfish boyfriend one last kiss before rushing to the hall snogging really made her hungry hungry are you i ve never seen you eat this much good for you ginny said ron her brother look of approval was offset the wide eyed expressions of harry colin and hermione smiling closemouthed she had manners after all ginny kept chewing her large bite of ham sandwich a quick peek over at slytherin revealed blaise and draco were gazing her way and smirking ginny noticed the pile of sandwiches on her boyfriend plate and tried to return the smirk she choked instead colin pounded on her back while hermione quickly handed over a goblet of pumpkin juice to drink eyes watering ginny thanked her friends colin chuckled dontbite off more than you can chew this time okay ginny caught him eyeing the slytherin table and made a face take your own advice colin i do ginny i really do she shook her head at his cocky smile next to her hermione said we should probably go patrol before the next class ron lunged off the bench knocking over his goblet and almost upending his plate cool yeah i ve really wanted to uh patrol harry told ginny as the couple left the hall in a rush if all the prefects were like them think of the mischief we could manage he glanced over at the next table where a black haired girl rose to leave the hall it was one of blaise roommates morrigan macduff abruptly harry levered himself up and said a quick goodbye over his shoulder before striding to the exit across the table neville said awkwardly bindy and i saw harry and that slytherin girl when we were looking for someplace to talk last night they were very er friendly reflexively ginny eyes glanced toward draco he was twisting his lips and giving her the that bloke not right look she couldntdeny it and wasntin a position to do anything about it she gave a shrug and made an oh well face she saw her boyfriend smile smugly before lifting his hand in the secret wave they had come up with like two kids in a secret club she returned the gesture in the malfoy girlfriend club only one member was allowed outside lorelei dungeon classroom in the time between lunch and the first afternoon class ginny felt uncertain not bold should she knock just open the door say a quick thanks and leave or try and say something more meaningful enter how did she do that was snape rubbing off on the woman i ve been expecting you miss weasley was the experiment successful ginny placed the box and the photograph on the potions professor desk yes there were no side effects the potions lasted all evening and our presence was never felt except by mrs norris that didntcount because draco was wearing cologne that a zombie would ve drooled over and encantar i thought i caught a whiff you re right it an amazing scent this photograph is wonderful too please give miss wells my thanks when you see her we should both be thanking you the words poured out without thought but ginny wouldnthave taken them back even if she could she really meant every one the teacher smiled and ginny could see a difference between yesterday and today today she glowed with happiness all because snape had danced with her in front of everyone making their relationship obvious to anyone watching did having your partner be openly your partner make such a difference the new radiance in lorelei smile said that it did ginny said thanks again and goodbye before darting out of the room she almost ran directly into snape the girl gulped the man looked down and said in the dark tone that made boys like neville whimper like little girls watch yourself miss weasley rushing about heedlessly will lead to harm for you and others one day ginny eyes were huge in her face caught by the intent stare of the man who seemed to be trying to look into the windows of her soul images came to mind draco smiling at her draco laughing draco sneering before rolling his eyes and getting kissed by her for his adorable smirk a vision of dancing with her boyfriend last night unnoticed by the people around them made her smile and the man watching her so intensely scowl releasing her gaze professor snape nodded curtly and swept into lorelei classroom ginny heard muffled voices starting to rise and ran she didntwant to have those wandless legilimency rumours confirmed it might cause her to die from embarrassment arithmancy wasntthe most taxing of subjects numbers were boring but reliable they always added up correctly whenever human error didntfactor in she could do these equations in her sleep today ginny was grateful for that ability because her brain was refusing to concentrate on the subject at hand instead it wanted her to think about draco her family and figuring out a way to make both happy maybe she could start with ron if he could understand that draco wasntthe enemy her shoulders slumped she wished that didntsound so hard like healing the blind ginny decided she had to try she finished her class work and asked the professor if she could have a pass to the library ron had bragged just this morning that he would be using his prefect pass to skive off history of magic after lunch she received permission and turned in the assignment on the way out in the library ginny went directly to the tables near the restricted section leaning back in one of the chairs her brother was obviously not working on anything except how far he could tilt without falling over ronald and charlie had a lot in common both brothers preferred to learn through doing rather than reading he grinned at seeing her appearing happy to have someone to talk with she watched his chair wobble precariously before he set it back on all four legs she took a seat across from him hey brother hey yourself sister what up is everything okay ron was so protective he would be a good dad someday right now the concern irritated but ginny refused to give in to the urge to snap his head off for it she had a higher purpose sure finished arithmancy early so i came here saw you and decided i d rather talk than find a book that okay ron looked pleased sure so what d you want to talk about this was the hard part where the lack of a plan made this crucial conversation awkward casting about for some way to lead her brother around to the idea of draco being a human being like everyone else ginny asked did you see snape ask lorelei to dance ron made a face like he was about to spew a slug yeah almost ruined valentine day the mood ya know why i mean if they love each other why shouldntthey be together openly what was so wrong with them wanting to have a dance ginny warmed to her subject why cantpeople mind their own business and trust the two involved to know what best for them whether those people like it or not unconsciously her voice began to ring with aggravation why cantyou just be happy that i she happy and give d snape the benefit of the doubt if she loves him she not going to give him up just because her b students dontlike him and dontapprove her brother face scrunched in an effort to understand what she was saying blue eyes narrowed i didntknow that you felt so strongly about it sorry but i cantbloody stand snape and it makes me wonder what kind of person lorelei really is if she loves a snake like that maybe i was wrong to think she was so nice ginny stood up cheeks pink so just because a person loves someone you say is bad you think they must be bad too did you ever stop to think that maybe you are the one with bad judgment that you made up your mind not to like someone and never gave him or her a chance you just condemned them ron stood too face reddened his voice was now as strident as hers was snape condemned himself every time he treated us like crap he done nothing but persecute harry so no i wontgive him a chance and if you dontlike it maybe you ve been hanging out with too many slytherins her face must have paled because her brother lost his mulish look and asked concernedly hey why are we arguing over lorelei anyway she doesntgive a toss whether i like snape or not it no big deal all right pince swooped over like a vulture no doubt hoping there was a carcass to devour they were sitting quietly when she appeared with a loud sniff through her beak the scavenger warned them to keep it down and flapped away ginny went through the motions of talking about their family and safe topics like quidditch in reality she was doing the same thing she had done in arithmancy using part of her brain to complete a task while the rest tried to figure out her life in the little chat with brother dearest snape and lorelei had been the substitutes for her and draco she had almost slipped a few times but he d never noticed if ron was that adamant about refusing to reconsider his view of snape how much more intractable would he be about malfoy when they left the library ron walked beside her all the way down the corridor to the main stairway appearing relieved that their differences had been reconciled if he only knew ginny thought with heavy steps she headed to her next class a light snow began to fall outside causing the girl passing a window on the way to her last class stop and watch it for a moment blaise felt that snow on top of last night dance was the icing on top of a lovely cake terry called her name she paused so he could catch up to her and held his hand on the way to potions once they reached the dungeon classroom her boyfriend kissed her hand gods will you two just leave off the way you act all lovey dovey makes the rest of us sick pansy parkinson face looked even more like a pug when she sneered the hag in training millicent bulstrode snorted like a wart hog behind her sick with jealousy pansy i sorry but i told you i only like boys pansy was not attractive when angry in fact the red flush highlighted the moustache the girl was beginning to develop enraged she screeched that not what i meant and you know it blaise said mildly then you re jealous because i have a love life and you don t no you you twist everything round you you ravenclaw were you just paid the highest compliment possible blaise i salute you but i d like to get to class before snape has us scrubbing cauldrons by hand if you d be so kind to step aside wesley droll words made the ravenclaw classmates around them laugh pansy glared daggers muttering vague threats she and her crony stormed into the chamber terry clapped his mate on the back thanks for breaking that up i was afraid my girl would be duelling in a moment i saw parkinson reaching for her wand my pleasure my friend blaise entered the class and saw the worried look on fiona face she hurried to their table what wrong pansy been saying she going to get you for humiliating her better watch your back mate i ll be careful professor snape addressed the class if it were up to me i would not allow any more sixth years with dubious skills to attempt this solution unfortunately the curriculum requires that you prepare it if done correctly this potion taken from the medieval text causae et curae may be used to medicate stomach ills he pointed his wand imperiously at the list of ingredients on the blackboard however if the last five ingredients marigold yarrow nettle basil and valerian are not placed slowly into a gently simmering cauldron the resulting fumes act as a snape closed his eyes briefly appearing to gather strength to handle stupidity he sneered at the students leaning forward in anticipation aphrodisiac in a menacing tone he promised that anyone careless enough to embarrass themselves or classmates would regret it snape didnthave to be specific the mere thought of what he was capable of was enough to ensure every student measured and combined the ingredients meticulously fiona irrepressible whispered the one thing you and terry dont need is an aphrodisiac finely mincing the yarrow the girls giggled until a silky dark voice asked behind them do you find something about this potion amusing miss flint miss zabini satisfied with the expressions of contrition the professor stiffly inclined his head and told fiona to re do her yarrow before stalking across the room to correct another student blaise avoided eye contact she didntwant to start giggling again around her students silently prepared their potions at the end of class every cauldron was gently simmering a correctly done solution except one pansy deliberately turned up her flames when fiona stepped away to clean their implements in the back washbasin blaise watched in shock as the girl rapidly tossed the last five ingredients in one after another immediately fumes arose pansy lifted her wand blowing the vapours directly into blaise face dizzily the girl heard the professor use a dissipation spell to prevent the fumes from affecting anyone else her hazy eyesight focused on her best mate two tables in front of her he was staring horrified blaise smiled at him while her thoughts became fuzzy and everything turned dreamy exhilarated by the energy and adoration poured out by the mortals who whirled around the bonfire without knowing their goddess danced with them freyja looked across the flames and smiled frey was standing on the other side of the fire she called to him gerd brothers must be visiting again the goddess was well aware that the redheaded giants tried frey patience but freyja had always found them extremely friendly she heard her name being called by the one who demanded she be his alone freyja blew a kiss to the deity of love before turning to face the warrior god she felt her soul ignite with a sultry smile she held out her arms and breathed an invitation odin blue eyes blazed as her lover her husband pulled her into his embrace his all consuming love for her made the goddess of love and magic content to become frigg the wife as well as freyja the lover lips that she never tired of kissing devoured her mouth the flames of the bonfire were nothing compared to the flames of desire coursing through her body her hands released the long silken strands of his hair and stroked their way down his muscular frame the seduction of his mouth and fingers made her knees weak he lowered her to the ground with a reckless passion that engulfed her world in fiery sensation slowly blaise became aware of her surroundings when her eyes regained their ability to focus she turned her head and saw terry lying on the bed beside hers he was sleeping they were in the hospital wing awake i hadntexpected that so soon madam pomfrey brisk tone was comforting somehow one knew that the formidable mediwitch would allow nothing to impede her patients recovery the woman checked her vital signs when the girl tried to sit up she and the woman both gasped her uniform shirt had several buttons missing showing an expanse of skin that was quite shocking the mediwitch bustled over to a cupboard removed a robe and drew a curtain around the bed to enable privacy shakily blaise changed and sank back down on the bed madam pomfrey tucked her back in and pulled the curtain aside you may visit now professor snape the cool assessment in the man gaze made blaise tense in fear instinctively she kept her eyes from meeting his her head of house questioned expressionlessly do you remember anything of what took place in my classroom she nodded looking at his nose it was interesting rather than handsome like terry or classic perfection like draco nose accidentally looking into fathomless black orbs for a moment the girl blushed when she saw a satiric eyebrow arch and a corner of snape mouth twitch hastily she focused on his cheek and refused to think anything about it at all huskily she admitted i remember pansy throwing in the last ingredients and blowing the fumes my way then everything became fuzzy like a dream and then i woke up how long have we been here two hours i have been monitoring your condition what condition snape mouth twisted wryly you were affected by the potion fumes she was confused but why is terry here it seems that mr boot was affected when you spoke to him before i could administer an antidote the two of you were inseparable part of the dream flashed into mind freyja and odin everything had really happened to her and terry she covered her face how did we end up in the hospital wing the professor cleared his throat it seems that mr malfoy used a petrificus totalus at the exact moment i also employed it the combined effect added to the stress of the vapours caused the extreme reaction which brought you here by way of a mobilicorpus spell salazar slytherin how many of her schoolmates had seen her and terry frozen in an embrace together upset she demanded why didntyou use a stunning charm he snapped i did it was ineffective as were several spells which should have been sufficient to restore you and mr boot to normality can you explain to me why they were not after a moment of silence the professor tone lowered to one that was soothing almost hypnotic and invited confidences the only wizards i have known to have shown imperviousness to certain charms have been practitioners of the dark arts i asked you once before miss zabini about the possibility of you and malfoy in childish ignorance having dabbled in such magic the circumstances were perhaps not the best for confessions of that sort but now i must ask you to tell me honestly have you performed dark magic on more than one occasion she heard her father voice echo in her mind cara mia there is no such thing as dark magic magic is a tool like fire fire in and of itself is neither good nor bad the wizard using that tool decides to what purpose it is employed whether for dark or light in enrique view no she d never done any dark malevolent magic her face expressed her answer no i am afraid the way you affected mr boot your reaction to the spells even your being awake now instead of sleeping says otherwise stygian eyes flickered over to terry please make wise choices in the future miss zabini not long after the professor left in a billow of black draco entered smiling in relief to see that she was awake he strolled over and tossed a rose onto her lap nicked from a greenhouse get well soon he sat on the side of her bed what in the hell happened in potions you tell me draco glanced over at terry sleeping form it was mental you called me frey then you called tarzan odin and you two started damn it blaise if snape and i hadntpetrified you she touched his arm i glad you did i wasntmyself i was freyja thanks to those bloody fumes i fine now except for being totally embarrassed and wanting to hex parkinson for pulling that stunt did snape make her regret it at least she gets detention with filch for a whole month and no more hogsmeade weekend privileges until next year they shared a smile draco eyes slid away he said gruffly when you called me frey i felt weird she waited for his gaze to return to hers and nodded understandingly i know it was those fumes but even when i thought we were gods i was happy to be with terry and i knew you were happy with gerd ginny that alone tells me we ve never done dark magic that good to hear terry scratchy voice made her start in surprise blaise quickly thanked her mate for the flower and stopping by meaningfully she told him she would see him later with an amused nod draco strolled out she immediately went to lie beside her boyfriend blaise touched his face tenderly kissed smooth firm lips terry said think we ll go down as one of the most scandalous couples in school history she smiled crookedly i afraid so are you really upset about that his fingers sifted through her curls cupped her cheek not anymore i ve gotten used to it it worth the notoriety to be with you he kissed her tears away gently kissed her eyelids her cheeks her lips sweet kisses and whispered words of love made everything better i said the last thing you two needed was an aphrodisiac fiona cried from the doorway how long are you guys going to keep that up blaise looked at terry while morrigan fiona and wesley walked toward them how does forever sound pressing one last tender kiss against her mouth her boyfriend chuckled sounds great draco passed blaise roommates and that joker roberts in the corridor he inclined his head with civility to the girls but ignored the performing chimp that mocked his gesture by sending him an exaggerated bow complete with wavy effeminate hand gestures when the girls werentlooking draco sent the other boy a hand gesture of his own the gape jawed disbelief on the fool face made the day brighter that business in potions still made him uneasy although the talk with blaise reassured him that it had been parkinson and those bloody vapours fault they were still best mates in that moment when she d called his name he d flashed back to new year eve to that embrace and had almost taken a step forward draco climbed the main stairway reminding himself that he hadnt he had remembered who had really been in his arms that night and that ginny was the girl he loved he wasntlike his father professing undying love to one woman while cheating with any other who took his fancy ginny bright hair shone like a beacon ahead taking the steps two at a time draco reached the girl waiting for him on the landing beside the door leading to the attics pulling her into his arms he held her tight too tight she squirmed and protested she needed air to live reluctantly he stepped back sorry i needed that it been a rough afternoon what happened her concern made him spill the entire episode out at her feet his girlfriend promptly hugged him so hard he had to fight for breath it was just what draco needed she agreed that parkinson deserved an additional hex and vowed to help him look one up the thought of them cosily snuggling on the window seat in the restricted section poring over horrifying hexes together caused him to chuckle and feel warm inside draco groaned inwardly now he was mental he unwarded the attic door slinky was the most helpful house elf and deserved a few pairs of unmatched socks at least he opened the door ladies first oh right be chivalrous ginny lifted her robes as if they were skirts to a medieval gown loftily his fair maiden said while sweeping past him dontworry brave knight i ll protect you from things that go bump in the dark he said lumos and raised his wand to follow close behind his fiery wench who going to protect me from you she spun around to face him at the top of the stairs hands on her hips exactly what threat do i pose to a big strong boy like you he winked the one to my virtue ginny giggled before looking around incredulously there no dust no cobwebs just a jumble of furniture and trunks the attics of hogwarts were different from the ones in most homes as his girl had noticed they were clean instead of a single large space the attics were a connected series of large rooms spanning the length of the castle each chamber was filled with the cast off furniture forgotten clothing and mementos of inhabitants who had lived and died there over the centuries draco had first explored the attics back in first year because they were off limits to students since then he continued to return for a potentially embarrassing reason draco liked history not the boring dates commemorating when so and so did such and such the artefacts swords armour toys books even clothing the things that made the past come alive helped him understand what the wizards had been like he hoped his familiarity with the narrow path winding through the discards of past lives would go unnoticed it didn t ginny asked while he led the way have you been up here before hoping to avoid admitting he actually fancied sorting through ancient junk he conceded yeah red curiosity was almost palpable he pretended it was no big deal and hoped she would let it slide no such luck his lioness had all the inquisitiveness of a feline draco he tensed but she broke off and stared at something to the right before exclaiming there are our ghosts the spectres sat together on an upholstered bench the bloody baron lifted a sardonic eyebrow at the couple but the maiden ginevra greeted merry meet young lovers ginny face lit up hello it nice to see you again how are you the men alive and spectral traded commiserating glances while the females nattered on about valentine day we passed through the hall on our way to a private chamber and watched you dance for a moment it appeared most romantic the ghostly ginevra said wistfully draco shrugged when the baron threw him a look of irritation was it his fault that he and ginny looked good together even with a partner like parkinson a malfoy shone with rhythm and grace he and red moved as one and few could compare boot and zabini perhaps if amorphous writhing could be called dancing and maybe some of the professors who he didnteven want to think about the damsel was trading my overprotective loutish brothers stories with his girl the spirit siblings had locked her in a tower when the baron had asked for her hand in marriage grey eyes met ghostly black the apparition shrugged the more things changed the more they stayed the same ginny listened to the tale enthralled glowing the transparent maiden shared how her lord had gained access to the keep the knight had pretended to be a pilgrim asking sanctuary for the night and then spirited her away soft brown eyes were misty at the end of the story which concluded with a wedding in a candlelit chapel witnessed only by a sleepy priest and his housekeeper draco pulled the starry eyed girl away before she stopped sighing happily over the romance and started crying over the couple sad ending with the light of his wand to guide them he held her hand and felt the thrill of exploration that kept him coming back finally they came to the chamber he had in mind all along oh it almost like the room of requirement but even more beautiful because it real ridiculous how ginny approval made him feel so chuffed draco had reconstructed a medieval solar with the many items discovered amongst the piles of furniture and stacks of trunks the dormer window seat wasntas wide as the one in their room on the seventh floor but the length of velvet draped across the seat was just as soft smiling he strode over to a heavily carved wooden trunk and opened the lid her reaction to the dress he lifted out made his day merlin its green velvet and the embroidery is this gold thread draco grinned over her delight yes nothing too good for the nobility try it on no i d be afraid to tear a seam rip a hem or something it so valuable and historical while she spoke he had drawn a tunic out of the trunk he turned to stare do you like history the way he asked the look on his face something must have given him away because ginny stared in amazement at him yes not that rot binns teaches she waved a hand at all the things around them this kind of history smiling she said i love it and you did this put it all together didntyou relieved that she didntfind his hobby odd he nodded how d you like to help me excavate enough to set up a renaissance room i d love it all right then the payment for being allowed the privilege of being my assistant is the sight of you in that gown go change not being the overly modest sort draco began to strip his ginevra licked her lips in a very distracting way he removed the tie and began unbuttoning his shirt she started to speak eyed his naked chest and seemed to forget what she was about to say after blinking she finally collected her thoughts to protest i nobody assistant i a full partner or you can see how this gown looks on that headless mannequin we passed a few chambers back draco admired the way her pink blush highlighted cinnamon coloured freckles before he tossed his shirt over a nearby stool and graciously assented fine you re already my partner arentyou hmmm kindly repeating his words for his preoccupied girlfriend draco smirked when she said dreamily that chest great i mean just a great chest no that just great yeah i ll go change now he waited for his flustered sweetheart to kick a cushion out of her way and step behind a changing screen before laughing silently he wasntstupid enough to do it aloud he pulled the black tunic over his head admiring the golden dragon embroidered on the front ginny said dubiously walking from behind the screen are you sure the gown supposed to fit like this the low square bodice was meant for curves of a less generous nature draco loved it he smiled roguishly sure its chest great i mean fits great his saucy wench sashayed over and ran a bold hand over the embroidered dragon i think so too a white blond eyebrow rose inquiringly think yours fits great or mine his girlfriend had to know by now that licking her lips just made him want to do it for her and yet here she was doing it again she showed such slytherin cunning it was sexy the downward motion of his mouth stopped when she gave him that look that made him feel capable of slaying redheaded dragons both we re perfectly matched nothing could have stopped him from kissing ginny at that moment not a fire breathing dragon not the entire school staff and certainly not a couple of nosy ghosts who poked their heads through the wall draco kissed his girl softly then possessively and passionately masculine fingertips trailed along the edge of the bodice two feminine gasps echoed that was one too many lifting his head and his hand he scowled at the smiling ghosts do you mind the bloody baron laughter sounded rusty his bride giggle was much more attractive the slytherin ghost intoned mockingly we thought you would mind if argus filch caught you up here he will be patrolling upstairs in ten of your mortal minutes frustrated in many ways draco uttered a curt thanks none is required the pleasure of seeing our garments worn once again is more than sufficient recompense the spectres drifted through the wall again after the mortal couple had changed and made their way through the darkened attic to the doorway leading to the lower levels ginny said did you see the way the other draco and ginevra seemed almost opaque do you think becoming us gave them substance draco smirked as they rapidly descended the stairway we are amazing together they ducked into a classroom when they heard the echoing footsteps of filch the couple sat on the floor and leaned against the wall prepared to wait a few minutes and give the caretaker and his cat time to patrol the corridor and head up to the attic ginny leaned close i think the lady was a gryffindor we boldly go after what we want she leaned over sank her fingers in his hair and set her mouth to his he responded in a slytherin manner he didntwaste his breath arguing he saved it for a much more pleasurable purpose a n i dontbelieve in divination but i do believe that the whole rune thingy is really interesting from a historical perspective and was a lot of fun to research yay for protestant work ethic heh will definitely use it again lots of different casting methods to the old runestones perfect for writers when they re looking to add a bit of oomph to the magical plot in my norse gods research found several sources that speculated frigg and freyja were different sides to the same goddess both had falcon feather cloaks and were accused of having an eye or catching the eye of men and gods too much chose to use that characterisation because it fit with my story of course professor smalley was patterned on a snl comedy sketch character who got his cable show guest s to say his positive affirmation with him reviews are my affirmation that i good enough i smart enough and doggone it people like me d chapter 31 the things we do for love north wind buffeted the school of hogwarts several ghosts idly watching the wind bend the willows around the lake shivered reflexively in memory of feelings experienced in days gone by draco leaned against his dorm window frame looking out he wondered if what he was about to do was worth the price he would pay the last time he had used polyjuice maximus to become ginny friend he d had to suffer the presence of potty and that pervert creevey had pulled one over on zabini he only had to tolerate loony and cheetah today but didnttrust the little stalker as far as he could throw him and after he got creevey that wouldntbe two millimetres he stepped away from the mirror to check his appearance in the mirror pale perfection in the jumper ginny had knit for yule draco warded his trunk and desk and strolled downstairs blaise was waiting in the common room with her pals and the boys pouring cups of tea while the rest selected food from the enormous breakfast tray on a low table she paused in giving crabbe a cup added another cube of sugar and handed it to him instead he smirked at the larger boy while lounging on the sofa tough luck old man crabbe just shrugged accepting of his place and took the next cup poured the group chatted casually about the blustery weather declared that hogsmeade weekend would be taken advantage of regardless and discussed their favourite shops in the village fiona asked morrigan so are you coming along with me and david he got loads of mates who d love to go with you no thanks i m going with someone else blaise said oh yeah who the prolonged silence made every eye focus on morrigan her pale skin was flushed her gaze shifted guiltily away potter sprawled on the floor goyle said didntknow there was a slytherin named potter what year he in he not a slytherin he a gryffindor everyone stared fiona said in a voice of deliberate calm i knew you d taken jay wanting to see other people a bit too well it driven you over the edge if you re going with harry bloody potter now she placed a reassuring hand on her best friend arm dontworry we ll see that you get all the help you need stop i dontneed help i not mental and my going with harry is none of anybody bloody business but mine so if you ll excuse me i have to go get ready to go to hogsmeade morrigan bolted upstairs flint trailing after her wanting to talk for merlin sake crabbe and goyle looked as if they d just found out their housemate had a fatal disease blaise dark eyes flashed with lady macbeth intensity i want you to teach me that hex affecting private parts if that yank ever shows his face around here he getting it and if potter tries anything draco grinned my pleasure when his cronies laughed spraying food he said you can practice on the boys blaise giggled draco removed the warming cover from his bowl of porridge and decided to reassure the whimpering pair after he d eaten waiting for creevey to show his face in the boys lavatory near the great hall later draco hoped the other boy wouldntforce him to wear another reindeer jumper plain normal clothing was all he could hope for he didntexpect the little milkman son to be able to afford anything designer so he d settle for decent the door opened creevey rushed in carrying a bag he removed a couple of flagons containing the familiar mud like goo and handed one over along with the bag of clothing why do we go through all the hassle of bringing extra clothing and then shrinking and hiding the stuff we were wearing when we could just hand our gear to each other under the stalls draco gave him the condescending look crabbe and goyle received on a daily basis because i refuse to wear anything that come in contact with your skin creevey without further comment creevey pulled out a pale hair and offered it draco added it to his potion he then gave the gryffindor one of his hairs so he could do the same they headed for the stalls draco grimaced at the cabbage smell and hurriedly chugged the glop down how he loathed the gut twisting re shaping sensation once his clothes hung baggily on his now shorter slimmer and inferior body he opened the bag and breathed a sigh of relief quickly he dressed in a white tee light blue jumper and denims he tied the laces of the trainers and pulled on a denim jacket he found colin admiring his new reflection in the mirror draco thought the other boy had a lot to admire the cashmere turtleneck black trousers boots and dragon hide coat made his face and form look even more handsome pale pink lips smirked enjoy being me while you can it back to girly in four short hours the face that was now slytherin grinned i plan on it creevey face and voice hardening the love god who d transformed into a cupid warned i ve seen you eyeing my mate perv and if you do more than look what you ll hex me creevey raised a white blond brow i the one doing you a favour you should be thanking me instead of accusing me of what what do you think i going to do to blaise while we hang out with a group in public draco refused to concede the point or thank the fast talker he gave as steely a look as he could manage it better be nothing malfoy he yanked open the door and went to find his girl ginny was waiting in line to show filch her pass he stood beside her ignoring the mutters of no cuts covertly draco slid his fingers across bright strands of hair while asking casually new jumper her lips twitched when he rubbed the tomato red cashmere displayed by her open cloak as if he was admiring the softness of the material and not the skin beneath it she d worn it christmas eve and knew he was using the jumper as an excuse to touch her he removed his fingers before they got him into trouble nodding like he was hearing it for the first time when she told him her jumper was a christmas present contentedly staring into her eyes draco frowned when the boy in front of them turned around and said a present from your slytherin friend ronald weasley scowled i dontknow why you d want to go to hogsmeade with her and malfoy instead of us ginny said ron you donthave to mind your baby sister anymore i promise not to take candy from strangers draco stretched his lips into a creevey fake innocent smile what about friends ginny i wanted to get you to try some new sweets at honeyduke s the tint of pink made her cinnamon freckles look edible although he knew first hand that they couldntbe kissed off granger scolded her boyfriend let ginny be she and colin will be just fine and i d like to try some sweets with you the softly insinuating words caused draco shoot ginny a disgusted glance she made a face silently agreeing that the thought of weasel feeding his girlfriend bits of chocolate was unappetising behind them a clique of hufflepuffs sputtered indignantly when a slytherin couple cut in line blaise said we want to be with our friends any objections no one objected when faced with a curled lip and a withdrawn wand what pathetic creatures they were the only good thing about hufflepuff house was that it quarantined spineless losers away from the more worthy students draco approved the roll neck jumper and soft fuchsia poncho blaise was wearing the less skin she showed the better she wasntwearing jewellery or makeup other than lip gloss either he nodded relieved that his friend had the sense not to encourage creevey blaise caught his eye and winked where do you want to go first and when are we meeting up with luna and wesley did you just wink at colin hermione asked in a disapproving tone no blaise looked at weasley she lowered her eyelid in a facetiously seductive manner that was a wink weasley flinched reflexively in anticipation of a blow granger really had him whipped the weasel grinned in relief when his girlfriend looked amused instead of angry they turned around and minded their own business which seemed to consist of cuddling and whispering revolted draco gazed at a much more pleasant view ginny she was giggling we had thought to head to honeyduke first but for some reason we re off sugar for a bit how about we go to zonko instead and get some sweets after lunch luna and wesley will meet us at by the book at eleven sound good to you fine whatever the girls snickered at malfoy s indifference creevey was having way too good a time acting like the prince of slytherin ginny and blaise started talking fashion so draco tuned out and kept his friend moving in line until they got to filch showed their passes and started on the path to hogsmeade the village was packed with students unfazed by the cold wind that reddened faces and caused them to linger in the warm shops inside zonko s they scanned the shelves and debated which products were the best inwardly draco agreed that weasleys wizard wheezes was far superior although he d never set foot in the place because he always made a malfoy industries employee do his shopping after they made their purchases draco followed his girlfriend outside he startled when a strawberry blonde put her hand on his arm hi colin it was mindy something one of loony luna roommates draco tried to smile like creevey hi mindy the girl blue green eyes were inspecting him closely her smile became hesitant are we still on for this afternoon draco slanted a glance at colin the git could ve warned him he might run into the girl he used one of his you re the only woman in the world for me smiles of course we are i really looking forward to it the ravenclaw looked a bit dazed even when he had poor material to work with malfoy magic was irresistible me too well i ll see you at madam puddifoot for afternoon tea mindy bumped into blaise when she opened the door and the taller girl rushed out with her purchase the two exchanged looks of dislike mindy quickly entered the shop behind her friends after throwing a scowl his way that was interesting knew about the crush on blaise did she she didntlike it either ginny briskly took charge and herded them to the next shop inside the sound of music draco steered his girlfriend to the new weird sisters orpheus orbs giving the demonstration model a spin to hear a track the door jingled when a new customer entered it was montague the miserable excuse for a slytherin was followed by bletchley and warrington the barrel chested ex captain promptly swaggered over look mates it the president of the potty fan club leaning in close he said nastily does your hero know his biggest fan a little nancy draco flashed a look at ginny to keep her red headed temper in check he said casually while picking up an orb i d heard about your interest in nancy boys montague but i never thought you d try anything with me isntmy hair too short for you the other slytherins were sniggering at the larger boy red faced fury montague drew back his fist sputtering incoherently i not how dare you imply you little the blow never landed customers gaped when colin creevey slammed an orpheus orb first into montague stomach and then against his square jaw knocking him out cold warrington looked at bletchley wordlessly asking what they were supposed to do merlin montague a disgrace drag his sorry arse to the hospital wing and leave him there the disdain in malfoy voice was chilling the other quidditch players nodded to their captain before obeying his command and each taking an arm to drag the insensate boy out the door creevey glanced at the cracked orb in the gryffindor s hand he drawled that ll never play now better get a new one the impostor plucked another orb off the table and told the proprietor to charge them both along with his and blaise selections to his account and to send them up to the castle as soon as possible the girls giggled over creevey uncanny impersonation all the way to the bookshop inside ginny told the other two i need to grab a book could you keep an eye out for luna creevey and blaise smirked but obligingly went to sit in a couple of chairs in the caf area talking ginny pulled draco by the hand up the stairs to the second floor she went directly to the far back corner turned around and grabbed him by the jumper saying with a look on her face that made his heart beat faster you re an amazing fighting ferret and i dontcare whose lips you ve got i snogging you senseless right now the fiery wench followed her words with action melding her lips to his smiling mouth while sliding her hands into his hair it was strange not having to bend much to kiss her but since he still felt with his own lips and hers were unchanged draco easily overcame any hesitance and used his girly hands to caress everything that took his fancy he d just glided his tongue against hers while caressing her back with the fingers that slithered under her jumper when voices rang out in tones of shock ginny colin get your hands off my sister draco slipped his hand down and out from underneath his girlfriend top before saying hey mates i d love to stay and chat but we ve got to meet some people downstairs did you find that book ginny no i didn t too bad huh well hope you find your book hermione bye ron and no i dontwant to talk about it so have a nice day they scooted past the confounded couple and went downstairs ginny brown eyes were shining with suppressed laughter draco winked she asked in mock disapproval did you just wink at me he gave her his best innocent creevey look before following it with a malfoy toe curling stare damn right i did she gave him a quick hug before continuing over to where four friends were now waiting good when luna opened her bed curtains that morning she gazed blearily over at the window the day was grey windy and probably ice cold if the frost on the pane was any indication she looked at cindy who was brushing her hair in between singing o what a beautiful morning and dancing around the room what got you so obliviously happy it hogsmeade weekend mindy and i are meeting jason and a couple of his friends outside at ten i cantwait yeah it ll be a thrill mindy dry comment met with an oh you from cindy luna aware that colin and draco would be trading places for a few hours said pragmatically at least you re going out this afternoon bindy said madam puddifoot has the best cakes and scones and what so funny the dreamy endorsement of the shop mindy and colin were meeting at for tea made the other girls smile although bindy had cut down on her sweets to ensure she looked good in a bathing suit over the easter holiday her love of food remained unchanged luna thought her friend looked perfect as she was and had a feeling that neville did too but bindy was the one who needed to feel self confident do you think i should wear the green jumper or the red bindy asked anxiously green the girl laughed at her three roommates simultaneous answers green it is neville likes green it reminds him of plants mindy and cindy had to cover their mouths to prevent giggling at bindy transparent adoration of her boyfriend luna asked did you ever plant the seeds from the passionata fruit neville gave you how that doing a blissful smile crossed the sweetly rounded face professor sprout says that she never seen one grow so fast neville and i go encourage it to grow whenever we can the friends realised bindy and neville were snogging like mad in the greenhouse and burst into laughter their roommate good naturedly laughed with them luna was still giggling when she walked down the girls staircase to meet wesley he rose from a sofa and asked with a curve of his lips that deepened adorable dimples tell me what given you the giggles or i ll think you re laughing at my shirt she smiled at the psychedelic swirl of blues you know that shirt looks good on you i was giggling over bindy and neville snogging by a passionata tree to encourage it to grow a golden eyebrow rose without thought she traced it with a fingertip wesley caught her hand and kissed each finger attention to detail was such a nice trait he winked roguishly find out which greenhouse and we ll encourage it too right now we have to go encourage some books in the restricted section they made their way to the library and the comfortable window seat that had become their special place to spend some quiet time together on saturday mornings sometimes they read and kissed and talked other times they just kissed and talked this morning she and wesley sat side by side with their backs against the side wall and their legs stretched out they chatted about inconsequential things that were important only in that hearing about each other thoughts and feelings strengthened the bond between them luna said how can we encourage books wesley gave her the mock chiding look that was so cute books back here dontsee a soul for days on end they might think there re no more people to ever want to read them and become depressed seeing us gives them hope he grinned to hear her soft giggle and pulled her over to rest against him he was very comfortable luna smiled into bright blue eyes and kidded does us kissing give them hope too wesley shook his head solemnly it gives me hope her cheeks heated she lifted her mouth i love giving you hope i cantlive without it he smiled tenderly i love receiving it neither can i his lips moved against hers luna scooted up to straddle wesley and thread her fingers through golden hair deepening the kiss aside from a few closed mouthed pecks from boys probably dared to kiss the loony under mistletoe she hadnthad any experience by the way wesley made every kiss so perfect she knew that he d had lots luna didntcare who he d kissed before she was happy that he was hers now her hands drifted down to play with the buttons on his shirt he smiled against her mouth do it her heart jolted she wanted to it just seemed so bold luna unfastened wesley buttons with shaky hands it took a long time to get them all undone and by the time she was finished her whole body was tense with anticipation luna watched her hands open his shirt she admired wesley smooth fair skin and the musculature that was so different from hers sculptured instead of soft and so warm she trailed her fingers downward his bellybutton was adorable she splayed her hands against his skin and smoothed upwards her fingers grasped the sides of his shirt and stilled she bit her lip and looked up wesley eyes were heavy lidded and his lips curved with piratical wickedness take it off heart pounding luna slowly pushed the shirt off her boyfriend shoulders once his upper body was completely bared she noticed that she wasntthe only one breathing rapidly her hands roamed his shoulders and arms before returning to his chest he groaned her name and lifted her face so he could take her mouth with his the kiss was different from any that had gone before raw hungry and too much for her to take luna pushed away her eyes fell to his chest wesley pleaded would you mind turning the other way for a moment i need a couple of minutes to dress and if you keep looking at me like that i going to want to return the favour luna scrambled off the window seat she stood mentally working her way through the names and meanings of different runes you can turn round now i decent the wry amusement in her boyfriend voice made luna smile as she faced him she was struck again how handsome and charming he was she was lucky that he was just as beautiful on the inside impulsively kissing his cheek luna gave him one of the pretend chiding looks he dished out so often false modesty does not become us you re way more than decent love his eyes twinkled in enjoyment at her playfulness the couple made their way out of the library and toward hogsmeade hand in hand they joked that their friends would never lose them in a crowd since they were both wearing bright blue coats luna was secretly pleased that they matched in all sorts of lovely ways once in the village they headed for by the book and came face to face with another couple who had just stepped out luna said hello harry morrigan morrigan smiled i ve seen you with blaise you re luna right harry said loony luna actually she and roberts have probably been out looking for snorkacks wesley smiled charmingly at the girl discomfited by her date rudeness the look he turned on harry was cool i bet we d find one before you find your manners lifting luna hand to his lips he kissed her hand and then waggled his brows at her before telling harry with deceptive pleasantry unless you d care to be called potter you rotter i would not say such things if i were you luna giggled over the use of humperdink favourite phrase the other couple stared not getting the joke that made it even funnier the moment she and wesley entered the shop luna hugged him tight he chuckled a feminine voice drawled luna used to be so reserved and now she publicly displaying affection what happened to our introverted friend colin sounded uncannily like draco when he said must be that bold gryffindor and sexy slytherin she hangs with bad influences i sure the arrogant demeanour and tone were just right luna smiled good influences blaise looked embarrassed but pleased by the affection conveyed she muttered yeah well if creevey and weasley ever finish grabbing a book let take our mutual admiration society over to the broomsticks and get a butterbeer and a sandwich the white blond brow lifting in sardonic enquiry was so malfoy it was eerie who buying blaise removed a small clinking bag from her jacket pocket and slipped it into her best mate s hand you are colin curled a lip at the girl cheeky expression i so generous wesley chuckled while the girls shared a smile draco and ginny traipsed downstairs no book in sight the four waiting grinned creevey scowled what are you lot staring at snickering luna and blaise pulled ginny out the door toward the pub the girls found a table in the back near the fireplace while the boys went to the bar to get the drinks and food the friends enjoyed the company and the break from eating in the hall as much as the sandwiches which were a far cry from the usual pub fare the salad on the sandwiches was actually green and crisp and the bread soft and warm wesley had just asked if everyone was ready to hit honeyduke for dessert when a voice rang out piercingly sweetie blaise darling draco look who come to surprise you with a visit mrs malfoy and mrs zabini were making their way toward the table luna watched blaise tear a paper serviette apart and narrowed her eyes regardless of whatever bombshell they dropped in their children laps those two witches were going to find out that blaise and even draco had friends that would stick by them no matter what the day had been going so well until she heard her mother voice terry had wanted to help the quidditch team with their seeker strategy that morning so she was free to help draco and ginny spend the morning together she would meet her boyfriend back at school when the polyjuice wore off colin had behaved himself while playing the part of draco and been a lot of fun to pal around with automatically blaise looked at draco upon seeing eddy and cissy wending their way through the crowd towards them he appeared mystified by her panic she turned toward the blond who was her real best mate baby blue eyes gave her a stay calm look her mum complained loudly if you owled more often darling cissy and i wouldnthave ruined our shoes tramping from that school to find you dearest i sent my schedule for the year months ago edina widened her eyes in amazement months ago sweetie you dontexpect me to keep your letters cluttering up my desk do you as though suddenly realising that her daughter was with friends eddy smiled brightly hulloo children i need to borrow blaise and draco for a bit they ll be back soon she pointed to a small table in an opposite corner we need to talk privately draco was shaking his head he didntwant colin hearing whatever foolishness eddy and cissy were going to babble instead of him blaise let her glance flicker to ginny wesley and luna before meeting her friend gaze and arching an eyebrow one witness was better than four he shrugged unhappily she told her mother fine let go blaise had to pull draco up out of his chair to come along he leaned over to whisper i ll let you do the talking okay her smile of gratitude faltered when she saw that the table they were heading toward only had three chairs the women took two and looked impatiently at their children when they hesitated to sit down narcissa waited until rosmerta delivered a bottle of vodka and two tumblers with ice and left to sneer if you can swap spit you can sit on his lap girl there are no other chairs and you re giving me a crick in my neck colin sat down and smiled angelically the devil come on it only for a few minutes blaise avoided glancing at the other table because she knew the others would be giving her what do you think you re doing looks reluctantly she perched on draco s lap her barmy mum gushed dontour baby girl and boy look absolutely fabulous together cissy they re going to make our profits skyrocket when they do the next set of ads i ll drink to that blaise watched the women take a gulp of liquid lunch feeling her body tense her insides twist colin wrapped his arms around her and rested his chin on her shoulder it showed how worried she was that the contact was comforting faintly she asked what are you talking about the women exchanged glances eddy said the ads have been so successful darling that we re going to do another set during your easter holiday it ll only take a day sweetie the photographer will come set up the shoot and then you two can spend the rest of your holiday enjoying the sun and sand a desperate panicky feeling made it hard to breathe properly blaise opened her mouth but couldntspeak she glanced back in desperation draco tightened his hold asking where finally acknowledging her son narcissa replied thought you d taken a bloody vow of silence the way you neglected to greet your mother i forgive you darling since you re astute enough to ask she threw a scornful look at the silent girl that beach house in spain enrique inherited when you were third years of course casa de sol y something you remember it our families holidayed there that summer of course the grownups had to pop over to costa del sol where the action was but you two seemed quite happy to play on the costa de what was that name eddy dunno cissy geography never was my bag my little girl remembers dontyou darling blaise grasped the male hand that had been sneakily caressing her abdomen and tried not to squeeze it painfully in her anxiety she said dully costa de la luz the coast of light near papa family in andalusia the ones he doesnttalk to our place is la casa de sol y sombra the house of sun and shadow why there eddy said irritably because your father is too bloody cheap to spring for the french riviera sweetie said why waste galleons when we have a perfectly good location to shoot at that wontcost a knut i would ve protested more darling but he said cissy and i could holiday in morocco while you and draco are at the beach house baby so what could i do her mother was giving her that puppy dog look blaise hated it almost as much as she hated the thought of staying in that place night after night releasing the hand she d probably bruised she leaned back against her friend and away from the face she wanted to slap she said in a tight voice you re not going to stay with us you re going to leave us alone and go shopping colin fingers gripped her shoulders did he think she was going to lunge across the table his hands started stroking her arms in a soothing manner it worked she calmed down well yes baby girl cissy and i never liked that place too quiet and boring if you re not into windsurfing and whatnot eddy blinked you dontmindterribly do you i mean we left you on your own before and you were always just fine dark memories tried to surface blaise grimly refused to remember the past had no bearing on the present her pounding heart was disregarded she thought quickly and laid out her terms all right we ll go but i inviting a few friends along and you re to put minky on call for whatever i need i ll owl a list of instructions in a few days agreed narcissa said promise her anything so we can go to morocco edina nodded eagerly whatever you want dearest you ll have minky will see to it just take the train to london as usual you can floo directly from our townhouse darlings mrs malfoy was staring speculatively at her son she said you ll enjoy having the place to yourselves again wontyou baby boy blaise shot to her feet shut up you got what you came for the shop next door has a floo you can use if you re too pissed to apparate so leave now another time it might have been amusing how quickly the woman jumped up snatched her bottle and left with eddy smiling nervously and blowing kisses blaise turned to colin if you repeat anything i will what not that i would i could tell that witch was trying to yank her baby boy s chain calm down and think fast because if you dontgo tell malfoy about your chat right now he coming over here blaise strolled back to the group concealing her agitation with a smile who wants to go to spain over easter holiday the two couples exchanged glances before draco asked stonily why spain sometimes being edina daughter came in handy blaise had seen her mum breeze her way through many uncomfortable situations with a blithe attitude and instinctively copied it because zabini jewellers wants another round of ads and papa decided that our house on the costa de la luz would be a perfect place for the photographer to shoot draco was scowling so fiercely it was hard to hang onto a smile but blaise managed mum and cissy are going to morocco while we stay and amuse ourselves at the beach they invited us to bring our friends along what do you think i think you re mental ginny shook her head my parents would never agree since draco had no choice but to go blaise focused on ginny they wouldnthave to know you could say that you re going with luna to stay with her aunt who let a house for the month or something she turned to luna you ve told me how you only see your dad at night during the holidays tell him aunt so and so has invited you and a friend to spain he ll want you to have fun get me a sample of her handwriting and i ll forge a letter nothing to it luna appeared tempted but wesley shook his head i donthave an aunt that would holiday in spain blaise said how about a housemate whose parents have invited you and terry along since there plenty of room at the house and you ll entertain their kid for them wesley seemed intrigued by the possibilities can we have some time to talk this over and get back to you aware that the time before the polyjuice wore off was running out blaise nodded we ll head on back to school i want to talk to terry after arranging to meet in the restricted section of the library after dinner that night the group split up and went their separate ways colin quietly followed blaise out of the pub halfway to school he halted on the path warily she asked what is it he stepped uncomfortably close and cupped her cheek with his hand creevey wasntacting shy and bashful this time he whispered if i to keep quiet about you two spending holidays alone i think you owe me something an involuntary tingle went down her spine nobody did wickedly seductive better than draco or colin polyjuiced into draco he read the question in her eyes kiss me it only fair he kissed ginny when she had your lips haventyou ever wondered what it d be like you can find out and still be able to say you ve never kissed malfoy come on creevey should ve been a slytherin his twisted logic made sense but kissing colin as draco was still cheating on terry blaise said why would you want to kiss a girl pretending to kiss someone else the smile on his face was achingly sweet i ll take you any way i can get you blaise she was flattered though not enough to stop her from leaning against the schemer kissing his cheek and then using a memory charm to adjust the boy recollection of certain recent events colin blinked curiously at her after the spell had taken effect why did you just kiss my cheek back there you helped me keep my cool thanks his look of embarrassment was uncannily similar to her best mate s noting her amusement he sneered yeah fine whatever she left him stalking through the corridors taking house points off students for fun in the corridor outside ravenclaw house she asked a first year who was about to enter to go get terry a few minutes later the guardian portrait lifted again terry stepped out smiling we finished early and i was just wishing you were back when aaron ran up and told me you were here he slid his arms around her waist and pulled her close for a kiss when his hands slipped underneath her poncho and met skin instead of fabric he said what are you wearing under there she took a step back catch me and find out before the last word left her lips blaise spun around and started running she darted up the main staircase her boyfriend must have guessed where she was going because he didnttry too hard to catch her until they d reached the seventh floor he caught her wrist after she d walked back and forth across the familiar stretch of wall three times and pinned her body while his mouth coaxed hers open a doorknob materialised against her hip ow terry chuckled opening the door for her to enter she drew off her poncho inside the chamber that had become the wide terrace of a stucco house overlooking the atlantic ocean off the southern tip of spain i like your shrunken roll neck jumper but where are we it a cropped jumper and this is my family beach house in spain i have to spend easter holiday here and i hope you ll come with me she explained about eddy visit and the counteroffer she d made her mother terry hugged her you know how much i like the thought of you and malfoy alone on holiday he said i ve never lied to my parents before but they ve never been this unreasonable before a corner of his mouth turned up i ve been owling them regularly trying to show how my marks haventplunged i haventlost any friends and show that you re a good person who good for me but they re not even trying to reconsider blaise felt her stomach drop they aren t no yesterday i got an owl asking me to not mention you anymore they ve decided to regard my little romance as a phase i ll grow out of soon terry said forcefully i ve tried my best but they re irrational so if i have to lie to my folks to be with you i will he inclined his head toward the water a determined smile on his face why arentwe in bathing suits we could take a swim blaise shook off her regret that the boots werentgoing to accept her she pulled off her jumper and unzipped her denims with a giggle at her boyfriend stunned expression she tugged off her boots and slid out of her trousers we ve got knickers we dontneed bathing suits she stepped off the veranda moving backwards enjoying the sight of the muscular body speedily revealed terry wolfish grin gave her a thrill of anticipation as he ran toward her scooped her up and carried her into the water ginny had been having a wonderful day until blaise mum had swanked into the broomsticks with narcissa malfoy behind her she had felt her boyfriend stiffen when edina wanted to go have a chat with her daughter and draco she d stiffened when wesley watching the parents and teens reaching a secluded table exclaimed what is zabini doing luna said calmly there are only three chairs so she sitting on her friend lap ginny could feel colin s eyes on her trying to guess her thoughts by her facial expression he d be having a hard time figuring that out she didntknow what to think her first impulse was to jump up and drag blaise off draco by her hair even though she knew full well the boy was really colin after a few minutes ginny relaxed there was nothing romantic about the expressions crossing blaise face she seemed upset then angry the boy rubbing her arms was calming her down not feeling her up i hate waiting for bad news she looked at draco he was drumming his fingers on the table when he saw ginny upraised eyebrow he stopped and gave a half smile how do i know that the news is bad because it always bad news when those two show their faces luna said quietly i sorry draco returned luna sympathetic gaze with a level one that life lovegood underneath the table ginny took draco hand and tried to show by a soft squeeze that she was there for him the feelings that had overwhelmed her at yule when he gave her the tour of malfoy manor returned with increased intensity how awful it must be to have parents like his or zabini s she was so lucky ginny wished she could share her family with draco the way she did with harry but that wasntgoing to happen anytime soon her brothers still used the word malfoy like a four letter word and her parents had sent a letter after new year cautioning her to make wise choices in choosing friends that had been as subtle as one of fred and george whiz bangs the twins and charlie were the only family that had any confidence in her ability to judge character and make decisions for herself the rest smothered her with unwanted advice if she didntlove them and know they meant well draco fingers tightened on hers the other couple was returning to the table blaise eyes and smile were overly bright while she tried to act like all that d happened had been an invitation to spend holiday at the beach ginny couldnthelp being tempted to say yes when blaise assured her she could forge a letter and her parents wouldnthave to know that she was vacationing with draco instead of luna aunt slim fingers were drumming the tabletop again revealing inner turmoil while the group agreed to meet in the back of the library later colin remained silent after blaise and draco left an awkward silence enveloped the table roberts cleared his throat anyone want to go to honeydukes for sweets draco stony expression said he didntgive a toss where they went ginny said i could use a spoonful of sugar to make the medicine go down wesley grinned mary poppins excellent book and attitude miss weasley thank you mr roberts or do you prefer dread pirate ginny and luna laughed at colin s mystified expression and wesley rueful is there a girl at this school that hasnt read that bloody book the girls said in unison no draco stalked out of the pub narked that everyone knew something he didn t but refusing to ask what they were talking about he held the door for the others but sneered at the expressions of thanks ginny lips curved while observing how adorably draco sulked even when he looked like colin when the small group reached the sweet shop she dragged her sulky boyfriend over to the chocolates section and cooed does ickle pouty lips need a cockroach cluster his lips twitched if you re referring to me with that vile name and confection no thank you hot lips she giggled blaise told you masculine lips pursed even more after the fact i dontwant to think about what she called me i want a chocolate kiss ginny scanned the shelves i dontsee any chocolate kisses isntthat a muggle sweet her friend was looking around seeing that no one was nearby he snatched a sample of chocolate from a display basket popped it into her mouth and then placed his lips to hers she noticed a smudge of chocolate on his lower lip when he pulled back ginny leaned forward to lick it off mmm i love chocolate kisses ginevra weasley ronald had a real knack for showing up when she wanted to see him the least he also sounded just like their mother that was scary colin rounded his baby blues innocently hello ron are you and hermione looking for sweets we were trying chocolates i saw what you were trying and i want to know what going on hermione placed a restraining hand ron arm perhaps colin and ginny want to keep their relationship quiet for some reason what draco and ron said at the same time ginny forced herself to stop giggling all right you two you re too smart for us we were trying to see if maybe we felt something more than friendship wisely refusing to look at the blond whose searing gaze would crack her up if she met his eyes she smiled sadly and tried to look as pitiful as possible but there not colin and i just donthave that spark that chemistry whatever it is sighing in affected disappointment she said we ve decided that we re better off friends yeah sorry let go mate draco all but dragged her out of the shop ginny watched him out of the corner of her eye as he marched back to hogwarts he may have looked like colin but every intense expression that crossed his angelic features was pure draco that was why she wanted to snog him now while in a short time she d feel no urge at all what are you smirking at she gave up the attempt to hide her amusement you how you can take my saying colin and i have no chemistry personally i have no clue but it hilarious he snapped when i am creevey you bloody well have sparks and dontyou forget it merlin that adorable pout was back when they reached the entrance she pulled him over to the side courtyard and took his face in her hands when you re colin i want to snog you until i pass out for lack of oxygen does that soothe your slytherin sized ego his mouth took her breath away and his hands made her head spin he hugged her tight and whispered against her hair yes i love you draco no matter what you look like i love you too ginny but i like the way you look right now the best before somebody came by and saw her groping her friend ginny pointed to the door go get gorgeous the way i like you best he gave a snappy salute yes ma am later at dinner she snuck a peek at the next table and met silvery eyes ginny looked away before anyone could catch her and ask who she was smiling at it was a needless worry her friends were too busy talking about easter holiday plans to notice hermione said i know you d like to go home ron but really we ve got so much homework due right after it doesntmake sense i think we should all stay and study gee that sounded thrilling harry nodded i ve got some catching up to do as well besides he added after grinning across the tables at morrigan macduff we ll have plenty of time to do fun stuff after studying ron and hermione both blushed at the thought of fun stuff when harry asked neville what his plans were everyone smiled when neville blushingly admitted he planned on visiting bindy at least once over the break colin grumbled i ve got to mind my brother when i d rather go to the beach when harry asked what beach he winked at ginny the beach in spain that luna invited me and ginny to keep her company at luna aunt rented a house on the costa de la luz for a month hermione the fount of knowledge explained that the coast of light was a favourite wizarding holiday spot due to the quiet seclusion as much as the beaches ron asked ginny do you want to go she said i still thinking about it the conversation turned to other things after dinner she and colin walked toward the library pssttt just ginny not you colin over here blaise called from the niche behind bertha the behemoth ginny told colin she d see him later and joined blaise you ve got to stop leading my mate on blaise snorted that one needs no encouragement to quote our pal shakespeare men prize the thing ungain d more than it is dontworry he ll probably get over whatever now that macdougal going after him but i dontwant to talk about colin i want to talk about you coming to spain i still thinking about it the other girl gave a cheshire cat smile think about this if you dontcome along my best mate going to have no one but me to rub oil all over that love god body somehow ginny wand was pointed at the taunting girl before higher brain function could override the primitive urge to protect what was hers hers hers if you ever touch draco i will blaise wiped the satisfied smirk off her face almost instantly but ginny saw it and thought clearly enough to speculate aloud wonder why you re pretending you d make a move wizards use sunscreen spells more than lotion why are you trying to make me jealous tell me what the real reason you want me to go to spain ginny realised that the over bright look in dark eyes was suppressed tears blaise said the place was named the house of sun and shadow by my father grandfather it lives up to its name it beautiful has an amazing view of the ocean gets sun in the morning and has shade for the afternoon we had a lot of good times there summer holiday after third year blaise paused we also had some bad times and draco needs i need you to help keep things light instead of dark okay the girl crossed her arms and pressed her lips together looking away while she said please how could she say no tell blaise who was really asking for draco since she d have terry sorry you re going to a house with bad memories probably thanks to good old lucius and need my help to get over the past but i cantlie to my parents who are the best people in the world apart from that all slytherins are scum attitude slowly she nodded ginny got hugged before being dragged off to the library in the back of the restricted section wesley luna and terry were sitting on the window seat talking quietly while draco lounged against the opposite wall he saw them approaching and searched her face for the answer to his unspoken question she slipped her arm around his waist yes i ll go unguarded relief and joy made his face almost too beautiful to look at he swung her around yes the soft laughter of the others made draco put her down i mean yeah that good over on terry lap blaise asked luna do you have a letter for me taking what looked like a birthday card she said ooohhh easy loopy writing no problemo amiga wesley handed blaise a note she hunched a shoulder not so easy but i can do it terry asked where blaise got her talent she shrugged hereditary skill from borgia ancestors not everyone who donated their worldly belongings to the pope actually wrote their wills themselves luna asked what are we going to do about schoolwork professors always pile on work over easter holiday draco withdrew a parchment from his pocket and unfolded it his expression was smug slytherin house elf isntplagued with scruples like some others this is a list of all our classes and the extra work each professor plans on assigning we ve got a couple of weeks to swot like grangers and get it done i starting tonight roger the house party i dontwant to waste time i could be windsurfing scratching out a bloody history of magic paper i ll do the research for everybody history of magic since i ve already done my regular work blaise said the offer was eagerly accepted ginny gazed around the secluded area at the students she d bet that last week would never have dreamt they would be planning how to lie and cheat and steal time together with the ones they loved an air of conspiracy of anticipation even exhilaration filled each face she couldnthelp but laugh the boldness of gryffindors the brilliance of ravenclaws the cunning of slytherins and love even hufflepuffs would envy we re dumbledore dream come true wesley grinned all for one and one for all the six musketeers i like it he held out a hand luna placed hers on top of his terry and blaise followed suit ginny slanted one of her mother play nice with the other children or else looks at draco he sighed and placed his hand on hers after the group said their adopted motto together and separated to go gather things for the swot a thon as roberts drolly named their first study session ginny and draco stayed behind a moment in the restricted section draco said i dontmind the all for one stuff as long as you remember you re the one for me ginny twined her arms around his neck damn right i am a n blaise quote came from troilus and cressida act 1 scene ii cressida is one of those bard babes with attitude no wonder i like her lol easter holiday starts next chap chapter 32 breaking away oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive ginny woke to the sounds of her family moving about the house the familiar creaks of floorboards and off key notes of her mother singing in the shower were usually a comfort not today she stared at the ceiling for a long time and then placed a pillow over her head today she was going to luna s and then on to sunny spain she should be excited not guilt stricken she threw the pillow across the room muttering thanks ever so much sir william bloody scott like i wasntfeeling crappy enough already without your pithy quote running through my brain talking to yourself is a first sign isntit fred of what george insanity no you looby hunger come down to breakfast ginny her identically annoying brothers lounged in the doorway grinning at her she sat up and out of nowhere became misty eyed they rushed toward her fred throwing an arm around her shoulders while george patted her on the back now now dontturn into a watering pot we ll see you again before you take the train back to school c mon favourite sister stiff upper lip and all that rot mum will want to go along if she thinks you ll be unhappy without her said fred the sheen of tears dried as if by magic no way did she want mum to come along the thought made her giggle hysterically the boys were pleased they had cheered her up so well nodding in unison they promised to make her whatever she wanted for breakfast okay then french toast her brothers shook over long red fringes out of equally merry brown eyes performed snappy salutes and headed down to the kitchen ginny rolled out of bed mechanically she got dressed and double checked to make sure she had included everything she d need after smirking over the memory of hermione astonishment that she packed without a list she waved her wand to locomoter her bag down the stairs in the kitchen mum dad bill and the twins sat around the farmhouse table drinking coffee and reading the paper they had obviously finished eating and were remaining just to see her off it was one of the things ginny loved about her family most they made her feel special fred hopped up when he saw her enter and brought over a covered dish george was right behind him with juice butter and syrup they served her with a flourish and sat on either side to watch her eat she could ve done without the intense scrutiny that went along with the intense love she felt like a bug under a magnifying glass that because you feel slimy and icky for being such a liar ginny disregarded the inner voice that had been giving her hell ever since she d agreed to mislead her folks about who she was really visiting in spain she ate and gave every appearance of enjoying the food although it was tasteless from stress fred and george congratulated themselves on another weasley culinary masterpiece across the table bill announced the prophet has a small article estimating that zabini jewellers profits have seen a twenty five per cent increase this quarter due to the new ad campaign they ve been running he snorted slytherins will do anything for a galleon even sell their children george took one look at ginny set face and intervened before she could blast her intolerant git of a brother merlin billy boy sell them wonder how much blaise would be probably too much for us fred even if we split the cost and shared the girl the twins waggling eyebrows were not appreciated by their mother really you two i hate to say it but bill has a point those ads were very suggestive and completely inappropriate molly said anxiously i hope your friend hasntbeen trying to influence you into doing wrong things ginny threw her father a dad look he tried to be diplomatic we re not saying you shouldntbe friends with blaise dear it just that well bad company corrupts character and we hope that you ll use good judgment in regards to friendships ginny pushed her plate away sounds like you re saying exactly that dad i cantbelieve this you ve spent time with her blaise is a perfectly nice person bill leaned forward features taut sure she nice because zabini wants to be your friend why would she want to do that though what in it for her slytherins dontdo anything without an ulterior motive there always a catch what the catch here is the girl using you to try and get information for you know who fred and george were shaking their heads in disbelief ginny jabbed a finger at her pony tailed prat of a sibling you re prejudiced admit it you think the only good slytherin is a dead one her brother laughed shortly you exaggerate but not by much i ve been keeping an eye on enemies of the order and guess what they re all amoral slytherins so excuse me if i dontcare for the thought of my baby sister being pals with one he turned to their parents i hope you re not inviting that girl to our home again ginny stared in disbelief when her father said to her i hadntwanted to bring the subject up unless you did sweetheart but i afraid it too dangerous a chance to take her mother immediately chimed in you must understand dearest that your father and i almost lost you and have lost dear friends and family harry too has lost so much due to slytherins molly said we ve tried to overlook your friend parentage but i afraid in light of the recent activities of you know who she paused and then said firmly i wontlose another person i love because i trusted the wrong person i won t i sorry slowly ginny stood and looked at each person the twins eyes slid away unwilling to back her any longer bill steely gaze was filled with self righteous indignation and her parents were pleading silently with their eyes for her to excuse and tolerate their fears and prejudice with only the slightest quaver in her voice ginny said i sorry too i sorry that you re so afraid of what might happen that you re willing to hurt me and my friend just because she a slytherin i sorry for you because you re playing right into you know who hands by acting this way the only thing i not sorry about anymore is going to spain resigned and determined she kissed everyone on the cheek and marched into the lounge with her bag grimly she threw the powder and flooed to lovegood house when she exited the fireplace in the spacious library ginny replied to luna greeting with do you have the complete works of shakespeare luna rose from her chair and drifted over to a shelf asking with an airy wave what are you looking for ginny scanned the volumes picked up the one she was looking for and flipped pages until she found the relevant part i remembered part of a quote and had to look it up it from the life and death of king john not one of the better plays but i not using the quote in context it just fits me she read aloud what in the world should make me now deceive wasntjohn talking about death yes ginny smiled lopsidedly maybe i am too the death of my fantasy that one day if i worked things right and said things persuasively enough my family would tolerate having a malfoy for their baby girl boyfriend luna took the book from her hand and re shelved it something happened best have a seat and tell me all about it she gently pushed ginny into a leather chair conjured a pot of tea on the desk and poured her friend a cup after adding several cubes of sugar she passed it over drink then talk funny how tea made things better was it physical or psychological uncaring ginny recounted the seemingly irreconcilable differences between her and her family when it came to anyone slytherin luna frowned in sympathy my father isntmuch better he ran a recent series of articles on ministry corruption and the officials involved were all slytherin blaise is the only one he concedes isnta greedy opportunist he calls her the exception to the rule she sighed even admitting that he almost had a fit when before we came up with our plan i asked in a letter if i could visit blaise over holiday what did he say that she could visit me but he wasntallowing his daughter anywhere near malfoy because of the you know pictures those damned pictures if she had a chance to do things over she would do it all again just for the chance to be held in draco arms and to hear him tell her that he loved her ginny said i wasntbeing entirely honest when i said that quote was about the death of a fantasy it more than that if i didntwant to be with draco so badly i wouldntdeceive my family no matter how bigoted they were luna confessed i wouldntdeceive my father if it was just to visit blaise either does that make us bad people ginny surprised herself by giggling she hadntthought it possible to laugh after being so upset it felt good no good ginny decided to put all thoughts of family and the future aside she asked so did you pack anything sexy for going dancing luna blushed yes i would ve bought a new bathing suit too but blaise told me her mother went on a shopping spree and picked up loads so we might as well use them ginny said smilingly did you stop to think that she might be trying to manoeuvre you into one of those skimpy bikinis she wears of course and this way i can be innocent of trying to raise wesley blood pressure i impressed with your slytherin like cunning luna made a face i only hope i can be as bold as a gryffindor about wearing a bikini you re a ravenclaw you ll think of a way the friends shared a smile wesley stepped out of the fireplace in a hawaiian print shirt luna quickly moved to hug and kiss her boyfriend they were still snogging when terry flooed into the library hope i donthave to remind you two of the rules terry said with a grin everyone had promised to adhere to certain restrictions during their time together wesley laughed no excessive public displays of affection no night time wandering and no having it off i would say that sounds like no fun except bella luna and i prefer private excessive displays of affection unlike a certain jungle couple we know terry said you have a point why did we agree to that again ginny spoke up because in the worst case scenario we re caught we ll at least be able to say we were only spending time together luna added the rules make things more comfortable too no one has to worry about coming into a room and seeing things they d rather not an awkward silence fell terry cleared his throat are we ready to go one by one first the girls and then the boys took a handful of floo powder and vanished from lovegood house to reappear in a huge hearth in a beach house in spain a house elf materialised to welcome them minky said that she would take care of the luggage since they were awaited outside with a smile the elf pointed toward double doors at the end of a formal parlour filled with spanish artwork and ornate furniture made of highly polished dark wood ginny walked across the tiled floor pausing to touch a sunflower brightening an arrangement on a table on the terrace she stopped to take a breath of scented air the view was breathtaking somewhere around the side of the house the voice of a photographer calling directions was heard clad in a black speedo draco stood beside the rectangular pool tiled in a mosaic of blues gazing out to where the atlantic shimmered in the distance it was dead boring listening to ansel the photographer verbally walking them through the final shot he stifled a yawn and looked forward to the end of the shoot ginny would be arriving soon and draco couldntwait to see her returning to this house had unearthed a lot of buried memories he wanted to cover up again he planned to do that with happier ones that would start the minute he saw his girlfriend face last night eddy and cissy had flooed to morocco they were staying with some old friend from hogwarts days who had invited an intimate group of twenty to celebrate her birthday with a week of glam parties and fabulous shopping he and blaise had played wizard chess and gone to bed early pretending that returning to the house they hadntstepped foot in since the summer after third year was no big deal when the house was dark and silent though draco had admitted to himself that he dreaded going to spain he stared at the ceiling resisting the urge to go bunk with his mate he d smiled when the handle to his door turned blaise slipped inside her face was composed but her eyes were scared she whispered can i stay with you tonight in answer he pulled back the covers she hurried over and got into bed reflexively they turned to lie in the same position they d slept in so many times that holiday years ago on their sides blaise even wore the same kind of red silk pyjamas draco tried to make light of the situation i not wearing a top want me to go put one on she relaxed and replied dryly dontworry about giving a good girl bad ideas i just dontwant to be alone i wonteven notice your perfect pecs or your awesome abs much less your penultimate blaise shook with silent laughter while her voice trailed off his brows drew together penultimate almost the best i afraid to ask what you were about to describe or who got the ultimate one after hearing her snicker he couldntstand not knowing tell me penultimate pulchritude since beauty is in the eye of the beholder of course terry is the most beautiful boy in the world but dontpout because you re bloody gorgeous and number one to gerd frey love really was blind he smirked at the back of her head which wasntnearly as satisfying as to her face they lay in companionable silence until he asked freyja hmmm i always wondered why you wouldntsleep alone in that house care to tell me why she shifted to face him because someone kept trying to break freyja lock and come into my room i was afraid to sleep alone his stomach twisted draco didntask if she knew who the person was he didntwant his fear confirmed instead he said wryly i hope you find it easier to sleep with two other girls in the same room because nocturnal wandering is against the rules this visit mate she said wistfully maybe we could all have a slumber party sometime maybe draco didntknow if he d be able to sleep with ginny lying next to him but it was a nice fantasy to drift off to sleep with impatient with himself draco shook off his reverie he told the photographer now staring at him in irritation i dive in at one end of the pool swim underwater to the other end where blaise is floating and emerge to place a string of black pearls around her neck she so grateful that she throws herself at me and the shoot is over isntthat what you said ansel looked put out that meant he d heard right bet potter couldntlisten with half an ear and be able to retain the information draco fleetingly hoped potty and weasel were miserable at school slogging to finish their load of schoolwork and that it was raining humph very well if you two are ready take your places the man spat to his blonde assistant bubbles check the light meter one more time satisfied the photographer nodded imperiously draco obligingly stepped to the edge of the crystalline pool and dove in with only the slightest ripple his pale defined musculature moved smoothly at the shallow end where blaise was floating with her eyes closed he emerged from the water on cue she looked enraptured to see him and then gasped with exaggerated awe at the sight of the necklace in his hands he almost laughed and ruined the shot but turned it into a roguish smile as he fastened the black pearls the grateful girl threw her arms around his neck and pressed her body close while lifting her mouth toward his the photographer shouted brilliant brilliant i am the best in the world and my photographs will win awards this year i can feel it draco laughed unaware they had an audience until bubbles chirped hulloo where did you lot come from are you models too blaise shrieked terry and pushed away from him to swim toward the steps and clamber up and out of the water draco watched boot face look stunned before he scowled at the sight of his girlfriend bikini perhaps the little black italian job was a bit revealing it hadntseemed like a big deal before while his friend slipped on a coverlet and greeted their guests draco found ginny staring at him unsmilingly freckles were standing out against her creamy skin bollocks determined to talk things out with the girl that was looking like she wanted to hex his arse draco walked up the steps and out of the pool he noticed that his girl now looked torn between wanting to admire his god like body and wanting to do him bodily harm he smoothed his hair back ginny swallowed hard she watched his muscles shift he gave her his best come and get me smile the tip of her tongue licked pink lips he said walk me to my room ginny i ll change into a different suit tarzan had already dragged jane off lovegood and roberts stood watching like they were at a bloody pantomime draco inclined his head to acknowledge their existence before taking his girlfriend hand in a gentle but implacable grip the moment they entered the house draco quickened his steps his girl continued silence was starting to worry him the boys bedroom was on the opposite side of the central courtyard from the girls room the group had figured that three single beds in each of the separated chambers would help prevent sleepwalking inside the dim room he turned to have it out draco never got a chance to speak ginny launched herself pressing him back onto the nearest bed and kissing him until he couldntbreathe after taking a breath to enable him to keep snogging he tried to soften the embrace tenderly stroking fiery strands his freckles wasnthaving it she sucked on his tongue and started moving in a way that almost made him pretend the rules were more like guidelines really instead draco ignored the inner voice that sneered at his gentlemanly resolve and rolled ginny onto her back he lifted his mouth from hers to say huskily i d hoped to be done with that bloody shoot before you came i never wanted to upset you you ve got to know it wasntreal that you re the one i love she smiled hesitantly i know i saw it was a joke more than anything she looked away it was like before all i could think was that everyone at school will look at the new ads and the rumours will start and i went a bit mental he felt it again that warm feeling he was starting to get used to draco grinned ginny said defensively if you didntlook so bloody gorgeous or wear an indecent suit that would tempt a saint maybe i would ve kept my hands off you he brought her hand up and pressed it against his heart dontever keep your hands off me red the little vixen started tracing the definition of his chest she had that mine mine mine look on her face she pressed a soft quick kiss to his lips i love you and i glad that i came it was his turn to look away i donthave a lot of happy memories about this place i want to make new ones good ones with you she touched his cheek the soft look in her eyes soothing the raw edges that being in this house had exposed he smiled i ll grab a decent suit and walk you to your room so you can change we ll go have a snog i mean a swim in the ocean ginny laughter made him chuckle while he pulled black swim trunks from a dresser drawer and headed into the adjoining lavatory he returned to find her gazing curiously at a white canvas hanging on a yellow washed wall did blaise do this when she was younger he snorted looks like it doesntit with that red circle and the bright splashes of colour modern art not my taste but eddy heard joan miro was trendy one year they snickered together at the woman shallowness draco shrugged at least she didntpick paintings that matched the furniture he smirked over the damp spots on ginny clothing and opened the door in the corridor draco looked to the left we could take the long way walk through the house but i thought you d like the shorter more scenic route he walked a few paces to the right to open the door to the inner courtyard it beautiful like a roman atrium not for the first time draco reflected how nice it was to have a girlfriend with brains as well as beauty he said that where the whole concept originated zabini italian great grandmother designed the space that why it mosaic madness he gestured to the mural of sea creatures on the walls the waves depicted on the tiles beneath their feet and the tiled top of a dining table beside a tiled centre fountain i think it wonderful all the pots of plants and flowers add colour and warmth please say we ll eat out here they would eat anywhere she liked as far as draco was concerned she smiled when he nodded following him through the arched doorway leading to the chamber that had been transformed into the girls room the ape man and his woman were chatting with the blonde couple in the corridor blaise was still in the suit boot had disapproved of and terry boy tee and trousers sported damp patches ginny winked when she caught draco eyeing her clothes she said i afraid to see the suits your mum picked up if they re all like the one you re wearing blaise wesley joked a gryffindor not bold enough to show a bit of skin inconceivable draco didntsee the humour he waited impatiently while plans were made to meet on the back terrace in a few minutes resigned to the fact that spending time with his girl included putting up with the two following behind him draco retraced his steps to the chamber the boys would share roberts the clown jumped on the bed furthest away from his very comfy i approve he sat up hey malfoy you dontsnore do you draco caught the fleeting glance of amusement that flashed between his unwanted roommates he said tonelessly no i don t but i know a few good hexes for anyone that does satisfied by their wary expressions he told the pair minky unpacked your clothes your suits should be in the bottom drawer of the dresser by your bed in the outside corridor waiting for the others to change draco leaned against the wall and looked forward to seeing ginny in a bikini la casa de sol y sombra is such an interesting name i wonder if it has some deep secret meaning or if the family just went to bullfights a lot i bet they always sat in a private box in the sombra section since shade costs more a bikini shaken by pale fingers in front of her face brought luna out of her introspection the girls were looking through a large assortment of bathing suits spread out on a white coverlet on one of the three matching single beds ginny had rejected most of them as too skimpy the leopard print bikini luna was getting a close look at didnthave a scarlet letter on the tag like ginny currently ranted that it did she said the only letters i see on the tag are d g i think it for the company not draco and ginny though an arrested look stole over the freckled face ginny muttered maybe it wouldntbe that bad blaise held up a length of sheer leopard print fabric look it got a pareo to go with you can wrap it around your hips and your modesty will be preserved she lowered her voice to coax go try it on it your size it sets off your skin and hair the lavatory right through that door after her first victim had been lured into trying the bikini on blaise reached for another suit and held it up luna shook her head so vigorously that pale locks flew wildly oh oh no no i not ready to dare to bare just yet i think i ll wear this nice blue tankini with the pretty flowers on it once ginny returned looking sexy and rather proud of her boldness luna dashed into the loo when she re entered the room blaise looked up she asked get the back for me luna fastened the back tie to the retro floral bikini i dontthink terry going to think that bikini much of an improvement over the other one blaise held up a long sheer pareo with wide bands of white and red sure he will see it got a cover up she tied the material low on her hips before tossing luna a similar blue wrap ginny held up her wand want me to use a sunscreen spell before we hit the beach a few waves of a wand later the girls headed toward the back of the house signs of remodelling were evident in the long spacious lounge that comprised the back part of the house slip covered sofas and chairs filled the space and a wall of glass showcased an ocean view through french doors at the side they found the boys waiting on the sun terrace where flowering vines twined through trellises against the stucco walls luna heart raced at the sight of wesley his long trunks had a white hibiscus design in the same shade of bright blue as her suit for some odd reason every time their clothing matched she wanted to snog him breathless his eyes bluer than the water visible past the garden and the sands beyond glinted i cantwait to see your hair floating in the water like a mermaid s suddenly a mental image of her as a siren on a rock jutting out from the ocean popped into luna mind the blonde mermaid looked up from combing her long hair to see a handsome golden haired boy staring at her on the beach leaning forward to get a better look she pushed her hair behind a shoulder to keep the strands from obstructing her view of bright blue eyes he smiled charmingly and the cutest dimples she d ever seen peeked out irresistibly drawn the siren dove into the water and surfaced near the shore the grinning youth began to disrobe at the sight of his revealed body she sighed oh wesley an indulgent chuckle made luna blink wesley hugged her whispering in her ear daydreaming about me were you ruefully she nodded he asked impishly if you were a mermaid did you have on a top made of shells it took great effort to keep her face solemn as she shook her head he gave a silent whistle stepped back and announced last one to the beach is a hufflepuff luna and wesley were the first to reach the sand blaise and terry who had been kissing when the others started to run were the last the slytherin girl threw a tote full of beach towels down beside the other girls pareos and muttered while she untied her wrap why am i always a hufflepuff terry slung her over his shoulder and strode into the water making the girl hanging down his back giggle luna eyes widened when wesley raised a golden brow i feeling very piratical buttercup she backed toward the water slightly alarmed by how her heart jolted at the look on his face rushing forward her sexy pirate roberts scooped her up and into the refreshingly cool waves he dropped her with a splash once they d reached waist deep water wesley dove into a gentle swell and surfaced a short distance away he slicked back his hair and opened his arms beguiling better than any siren bella luna before she knew it luna was in her boyfriend arms pulling his head down to hers and grateful that he was tall enough to stand and keep her afloat while she kissed him again and again this was why she d lied to her father about auntie lorinda s invitation so she could spend day after glorious day exploring wesley heart and mind and mouth it shouldntfeel divine to be so devious but it did the couples eventually returned to the beach while they d been in the water the house elf had obviously decided that some towels on the sand were insufficiently grand enough for her mistress minky had conjured a gauzy pavilion that shaded a round table and chairs lunch was left under covers bespelled to keep the assortment of sandwiches crudit s and fat red grapes fresh to one side a table with a basin next to a perpetual water pitcher stood waiting with soap and a stack of fluffy white hand towels draco sauntered over to cleanse his hands wish i d known your house elf would go all out for guests before blaise we never got the royal treatment the last time we came did we luna didntbegrudge draco or blaise their wealth not when she liked the benefits so much she sat beside wesley enjoying the quiet conversation while they ate gradually luna became aware of something and asked blaise without thinking are you really peeling draco grapes everyone eyes travelled from the half peeled fruit in blaise hand to the peeled grapes on the draco plate ginny told her boyfriend peel your own grapes no way blaise said adamantly he a danger to himself and others with a knife luna found the slight tint of red on draco cheekbones quite amusing she wasntbrave enough to smile openly however ginny was i good with sharp objects she said blaise handed her the knife there an interesting bit of symbolism wesley murmured before standing and pulling back luna chair they took a walk down the beach the cool water lapping around luna ankles felt good as they strolled so did wesley arm around her waist they walked in silent companionship for a long while the costa de la luz was undeveloped in the wizard owned areas there wasntanother soul in sight luna began to daydream she and wesley were marooned on a desert island her hero gave her his shirt to protect her softer skin while they trekked inland to gather food and water luna watched his muscles flex while hacking through the underbrush with a conveniently found machete she admired the way his skin glowed with perspiration as they travelled into the heart of the tropical island after reaching the spring complete with waterfall they swam together under the cascading spray he held her close and kissed her are you daydreaming again luna covered her face with her hands nodding she could hear the smile in his voice were we kissing she reluctantly nodded again gentle masculine fingers encircled her wrists and lowered her hands luna opened her eyes his blue gaze was bright with amusement and love she said we re so isolated here i imagined we were marooned on an island wesley chuckled i like the way you daydream he cupped her heated cheeks in his palms why dontyou come have a swim with me before we head back cool off and tell me what else you ve dreamt luna unfastened her pareo it fluttered to the sand as she ran into the waves that evening the group decided to dress casually in shorts and tees for dinner the girls conjured paella for the meal more accurately blaise conjured the paella which she said would normally be too heavy for an evening meal but since they werentgoing dancing tonight they d go for it luna contributed individual chocolate souffl s while ginny set the courtyard table minky terribly jealous of anyone conjuring in her kitchen had nonetheless graciously overseen the proceedings with grudging approval between tidying the rooms and setting faery lights to float around the courtyard after sternly ordering blaise not to touch the dishes the elf left for the evening once the three couples were alone in the house the boys helped the girls serve dinner they ate and drank butterbeer while chatting sociably around the table the conversation took a philosophical turn when ginny asked is anyone else disturbed by how easy it is to lie in order to have what you want when the silence that greeted the statement lengthened uncomfortably luna said it was hard for me to lie to my dad until i remembered how he wouldntthink of me even visiting for the day because mal uh just because draco said dontworry about my tender feelings lovegood i ve had fathers go into hysterics at the thought of a malfoy near their virginal darlings before luna saw ginny place her hand on draco arm watched him give the girl a half smile she said adamantly that doesntmake it right when people act that way it makes it a lot easier to lie to them beside her wesley smiled ruefully i hadntthought of it as lying more a stretching of the truth i am spending the holiday in a spanish beach house with terry and a schoolmate he toyed with a strand of her hair before winding it around his finger my father wasnttoo happy to learn i dating the boss daughter he actually told me that he hoped i d meet a girl out here he stared down at the blue shade his finger had turned before releasing the digit i ll send him a postcard telling him i having the time of my life with the girl of my dreams without a single qualm terry looked at blaise and caressed her cheek i used to feel bad because my folks wouldntgive blaise a chance he shook his long hair away from his face i not going to try anymore if they dontlike it that too bad if i get found out i ll say that they deserved to be lied to they dontrespect me or my feelings so why should i respect them blaise smiled sadly at her boyfriend i wish you didnthave to lie to be with me but i so glad you re here she smiled at everyone i so glad you re all here draco said either that or you re lying while the others laughed ginny said seriously i lied to get here i ve lied to be with draco in the past and merlin knows i going to lie in the future she looked from person to person it might seem hypocritical but i d like us all to agree not to lie to each other while we re here we tell the truth and if the truth will hurt we just dontsay anything agreed they all nodded draco broke the pensive mood if our musketeer moment is finally over may we have dessert now there a hammock i want to try out when this couple time is over he smirked i only telling the truth blaise giggled there are three double hammocks each on a different side of the house terry and i call the one by the pool luna jumped up to get away from disturbing truths and to go get the chocolate souffl s wesley entered the kitchen behind her and took the tray from her hands looking forward to trying out one of those hammocks with me she widened her eyes and bit her lip he began to look concerned she pressed her lips together right before they reached the table luna turned and murmured honestly i cantwait she enjoyed the look on wesley face more than the dessert the curly haired girl leaned forward and placed a large shell on top of her sand castle in lieu of a flag on her knees she put a hand up to shade her eyes in order to see who had walked up to stand beside her it was mr malfoy the man gave her effort a look of condescending approval he drawled all alone where has your little playmate gone she used a bit of twig to carve a window in the side of her castle not bothering to respond he knew very well that draco was off with that witch again after all lucius had been the one to invite the woman to dinner after they d met at some death eater party on la costa del sol the older witch had taken one look at the gorgeous boy and suddenly became incredibly interested in taking in the local sights draco had come home the last few evenings smelling of wine and staggering drunk he d also begun having nightmares the cradle robbing marisol wasntmaking her friend happy the girl planned to do something about it very soon long white blond hair fell forward to brush her shoulder when the man crouched beside her lucius said with cruel amusement blaise blaise pretend indifference all you like but i can feel your anger a pale cold finger slid down her cheek with mock sympathy are you feeling lonely still refusing to give him the satisfaction of a response she scooted away and lined up shells on either side of the drawbridge blaise glared when the man reached out and grabbed her curls to wrench her head back to meet his pale gaze dontignore me little girl she spat dontbother me anymore his grip loosened with surprise at her fierceness a slow smile crossed the features that reminded her of a statue s beautiful hard and without warmth bothering you is so entertaining you ll be an amusing daughter in law one day once that insolence is he paused and deliberately stood on her castle stamped out the dream jolted blaise out of sleep she lay breathing rapid shallow breaths while ginny and luna slept on in the dark room she curled into a ball and wished that memories had no power to haunt that summer started off so well she and draco had been left to their own devices while their parents partied on the other coast they hadntminded the fourteen year olds had learned to windsurf and spent every day surfing swimming and exploring the beach then lucius had brought marisol into their lives and her friend had gone off to play adult games while she waited and worried and started re reading the book she d taken from the malfoy library on her twelfth birthday blaise slid out of bed and stood deliberating what to do she could wake ginny or luna up and what say let have a cuppa because i had a nightmare they d want her to tell them about the dream share things that nice girls with nice families never had to deal with or do silently she exited the room and began walking down the corridor crossed the lounge and entered the passageway leading to the boys bedroom the door was open a pale finger of moonlight entered the chamber through the shuttered window and illuminated terry sleeping face blaise almost slipped inside the room into her boyfriend bed so she wouldnthave to face her fears alone the rules kept her from doing it she was already night time wandering in the mood that she was in blaise was afraid the other two rules would be broken as well if she tempted fate physical comfort really appealed right now all those times she d felt superior to draco what an ignorant little girl she d been blaise sighed her love name and retraced her steps to the lounge the white slipcovers looked ghostly in the moonlight the liquor cabinet beckoned it was the zabini family cure all who was she to defy tradition the hard part was deciding what to drink there was such a wide variety decisions decisions a noise made her jump blaise terry was standing in the doorway long brown hair mussed from sleep wearing navy silk pyjama bottoms he covered a yawn i thought i heard you call my name the sight of his bare chest and feet caused her toes to curl what are you doing up in the middle of the night i had a nightmare couldntsleep i was going to wake you but you were sleeping so peacefully i decided not to blaise gestured to the cabinet i was planning on having a few drinks to knock myself out he frowned that must ve been some nightmare want to talk about it strong arms encircled her blaise rested her head on terry shoulder no i just want to forget about it her body started to shake with the effort to suppress tears but i cant baby dontcry i love you terry placed butterfly kisses to her eyelids her cheeks before reaching for her mouth she kissed him back wanting desperately to sink into his embrace and remember nothing but how much she loved him and loved kissing his lips and stroking his hair and skin they slowly moved over to a soft wide sofa blaise kept her mouth fused to her boyfriend while they sank down together she sighed as his frame aligned with hers in a way that felt so right everything else seemed unimportant when she was in his arms all she could think about was getting closer to terry he groaned merlin baby you feel so good but i dontwant to i mean i do want to make love to you one day when it right but for now blaise tried not to cry you want me to go back to my room his smile made her forget to breathe no i want to lie here with you make you feel safe and help you get back to sleep her heart turned over physical comfort was nothing compared to this to feeling loved she tenderly kissed his lips brushed silky strands away from the face she adored do i get a goodnight kiss his white smile flashed in the near darkness how about a deep satisfying one that lasts as long as you want it to she answered his question by pressing her lips against his the next day sunlight flooding into the room caused blaise to blink and hide her face against her boyfriend chest masculine hands smoothing across her back caused delightful shivers raising her head she smiled at terry and slithered up to kiss him good morning his eyes were so blue waking up with you makes it a great morning a coldly furious voice drawled did you think that the rules were made to be broken zabini or did you and boot just decide they didntapply to you draco stood with wesley just inside the doorway he looked ready to hex and wesley expression was one of concern blaise stood with terry she said i know we broke the first rule but we didntbreak the other two wesley said then why were you sleeping on the sofa together red faced she sputtered none of your business i i had a nightmare and came out to get a drink to help me get back to sleep and terry heard me and and it wonthappen again so i dontwant to hear another word about it blaise turned to make a grand exit ginny and luna were standing in their robes blocking the doorway she pushed past them and ran down the corridor inside the room she snatched a bikini out of the dresser and bolted for the bathroom when she entered the bedroom afterwards the girls were waiting luna held up a turquoise and white bikini do you think this would look good on me blaise knew her friend was trying to cheer her by wearing it she said it will look amazing on you ginny smirked i found a black bikini that actually covers important areas blaise what was your mother thinking she thought that front tie would make a bloke fingers twitch if you know what i mean as she sailed into the loo ginny said over her shoulder it only fair draco makes my fingers twitch all the time the moment the door closed luna said nightmares are hard to get over i think i must ve woken in the night for almost a year after my mum died she pointed to the beds now placed together ginny and i decided we d pretend we re having a slumber party that sounds like fun doesntit blaise thought it was so sweet she just might do something embarrassing like cry she blinked them back yeah almost as much fun as we re going to have today ginny walked into the room how are we having fun today luna had gone into the lavatory so blaise waited until she returned to say today mates we re going windsurfing she led the way to the courtyard draco imperiously ordered them hurry so breakfast could be served he was starving blaise sat beside terry and raised his hand to her lips minky made a disapproving noise while serving a slice a frittata across the table wesley grinned eat cantlive on love you two terry smiled maybe not but i definitely live for it no one argued or claimed to do differently it was the truth a n if readers noted the potc line that seems to be a fave with slytherins and wesley princess bride joke draco didntget i ll say like the grandpa yes yes you re very smart d disclaimer not jk not able to have a holiday without a few burrs sand spurs to step on the chap title is from a counting crows song chapter 33 holiday in spain the sunshine in spain had a quality that luna found hard to describe but easy to appreciate it was bright and yet soft warm but not glaring she sat beside wesley at the tiled dining table in the sunny courtyard that was the heart of the beach house nibbling at a slice of melon luna admired her boyfriend outfit the blue camp shirt with a banana leaf print coordinated with her bikini she was beginning to wonder if the thrill she felt whenever they inadvertently matched was becoming a fetish deciding that she didntgive a toss one way or the other luna smiled when her boyfriend offered her a strawberry she made sure to suck his fingertips along with the fruit wesley leaned toward her rules roberts draco coolly amused drawl made luna head jerk back she reminded calmly the rule is no excessive public displays of affection bending forward she lightly kissed lips that curved impishly adorable dimples got kisses too blaise laughed poor draco he thinks kissing done by anyone other than himself is excessive grey eyes mocked yeah well if you think lying half naked on the sofa isnt then i afraid to ask what you think is too much of a public display luna hid a smile over blaise blush i wasnthalf naked boot was ginny put her hand on her boyfriend arm what about lying half naked on a hammock the airy question stopped the slytherin sniping it also made draco do something almost equal in rarity to a sighting of the crumpled horn snorkack he blushed the tinge of red made him look less god like more human and likeable luna couldntsuppress a giggle the other girls joined her wesley grinned i choosing to regard your question as hypothetical ginny and think that we should agree to keep uh private moments private so no more er sofa and i propose that we be like the yanks when it comes to however one is dressed on a hammock how that luna asked dontask donttell with mock solemnity wesley stretched out his hand musketeer fashion beside him at the end of the table terry put his hand over his friend hand works for me blaise leaned over to place a smacking kiss on terry cheek and set her hand on his ginny slanted a do it or else look at draco before adding her hand to the growing pile he nodded grudgingly and then looked to his left luna smiled serenely and sat patiently after wesley groaned that his arm was starting to ache draco curled his lip and covered ginny hand with his own feeling like the queen of the mountain or at least the hand pile luna placed her palm on top thinking all for one and one for all minky appeared when they finished breakfast she shooed the teens away from the dishes luna didntprotest this was her kind of holiday she followed draco and blaise into the parlour asking curiously where are we going blaise said tarifa we know this bloke named rico who got a house on the wizard end she smiled it surfers paradise you ll love it the winds are light today anyway he gives lessons and rents rigs and boards we ll floo over to his place rico will have you out on the water in no time a short derisive laugh made all eyes turn to draco he sneered rico suave tries to give lessons in more than windsurfing so watch his hands girls the group looked back at blaise she rolled her eyes his name is rico cruz and he isnta perv he just friendly she tossed floo powder sol y mar luna took a deep breath and followed when she stepped out of the rustic hearth into a room filled with various boards sails masts and other pieces of equipment blaise and a man were discussing light sails and beginner boards the back presented to the room while the stranger showed the girl a small sail with mysterious items called battens and cambers was lean muscular and deeply tanned the spaniard turned luna blinked he was in his late twenties and ruggedly handsome with a smile that was blindingly white dark eyes gleamed hola you are luna so pale like the moon you wish to glide across the water like a bird the others had flooed into the room while the instructor was holding her hand in both of his trying to gently tug it away luna said doubtfully i donthave a lot of upper body strength her eyes popped wide when his hands slid up her arm windsurfing is about finesse not muscle i will teach you will learn and maybe even be better than your boyfriend you have a boyfriend an arm slid around her waist pulling her and her arm away from rico wesley smiled but his eyes were glacial yes she does unfazed the spaniard turned to ginny he didnttouch her only promised she would be one with nature exploring the waters of paradise perhaps it was the sight of draco steely gaze that warned the man not to try anything rico cheerfully waved the group toward the door informing them that their rigs and boards were outside waiting over the next couple of hours luna learned to read the wind to find out from which direction it was blowing so that she could build herself an invisible wind clock to keep oriented and know which way she should be going it was funny to think of herself as the centre of an invisible clock but it was logical since when she moved the clock would move with her upwind was always twelve o clock and downwind six as long as she remembered that she couldntsail upwind and to do most of her sailing between three and nine o clock everything would be smooth sailing she smiled a smooth husky voice speaking behind luna caused her smile to fade i have never seen anyone get to the ready position as quickly as you are you always this fast she stared was he using provocative language on purpose or by accident the problem with rico was that she didntknow if he was just a friendly person who had a latin propensity for encouraging by touching or if he was trying to make a move on her that quandary had turned the lesson from something that was supposed to be fun into a nerve wracking experience wesley had been watching rico like a hawk every time he wandered near her she d learned quickly in order to be able not to need the man so called guidance the group first used boards without fins practising on the beach the six steps they d soon perform in the water blaise and draco were assisting terry and ginny leaving rico free to walk around supervising they d learned to go from kneeling to standing and uphauling or raising the sail once they transitioned from a neutral position with feet on either side of the mast along the centreline of the board the teens practiced maintaining the correct sail and body positions amusingly the last three were named ready set and sailing slowly rotate your upper body one more time luna what a lovely straight back you have luna stepped out of position to get away from the tanned fingers trailing down her spine why oh why did she wear a bikini the matching sarong had been taken off in order to practice without being hampered and merlin did she feel self conscious when a dark gaze was appreciating the view with a nervous smile she moved toward wesley are you ready to hit the water i ready to hit something his scowl was one draco would ve been proud to claim luna said do you wish we hadntcome maybe i shouldnthave worn this suit his mood shifted dimples flashed the sight of you in that bikini has been the highpoint of my day it not your fault that rico suave is enchanted by your beauty he gave the spaniard a look that caused the man to move to help ginny instead of continuing in their direction wesley met her eyes and smiled ruefully i ve never acted the jealous bastard with another girl do you wish we hadntcome she liked his protectiveness it wasntwounding implying that she d dressed to invite attention it was flattering luna said i cantwait to sail with you shortly afterwards rico pronounced them ready to go cruising a simple sail from one point to another was all she wanted blaise and draco could freestyle all they liked luna didntcare about learning tricks and manoeuvres a charm made the boards feather light and easy to carry to the water other spells protected their bodies from sun and becoming chilled in the water she sailed parallel to wesley the experience of gliding effortlessly over water so clear and sparkling with sunlight made her laugh joyously the light wind lifted her hair luna could see the muscles in her boyfriend back flex she envied the slight tan that made wesley look even more golden and piratical suddenly luna couldntwait to get back to shore when she finally tired of windsurfing the too friendly spaniard waded into the water to help her with the board cruz grinned you are a natural in the water were you a mermaid in another life pink washed over her cheeks he said laughingly si i knew it she helped him lay the equipment under a shelter at the side of the house to dry luna became uneasy noting that none of the others had returned and she and rico were all alone he moved closer an intent look crossing handsome features luna she took a step back um yes dark eyes entreated i desire very much she retreated oh merlin he way more experienced bad choice of word than me in navigating around piles of equipment what should i do if he touches me scream your help in preparing a meal i am not so good in la cocina he wanted her to make lunch stunned luna nodded behind them laughter chimed dontworry about feeding us rico minky should floo over with a picnic basket anytime now do you still like black grapes rico took blaise board dismantling the rig to lay out the sail mast and other equipment to dry the man looked pleased that she d remembered his preference what a little mother you are always taking care of others i remember how you hovered over your friend like a hen with her chick years ago he a rooster now that one blaise said oh look the others are coming up the beach why dontluna and i go inside and wait for minky while you help them with their gear point them toward the outside shower por favor they ll probably want to rinse off before eating si mamacita tugged by the wrist luna followed blaise over to rinse the salt and sand away before entering the whitewashed home the house elf hadntarrived yet crossing her arms blaise smiled brightly i told you rico wasnta perv he still too friendly for me or wesley the smile became less dazzling but more real i bet wesley stays by your side the whole time we re exploring the reefs after lunch blonde eyebrows rose how will we do that gillyweed cantyou just imagine it going to be so romantic while blaise drifted into a private reverie luna saw herself diving into the waves the water was crystal clear the reef abounding in marine life that made the sea bed home a mermaid with long blonde hair swam toward the man who had just plunged into her underwater world by his black clothing he appeared to be one of the pirates that sent so many to a watery grave pirate or not the man needed aid she reached the unconscious human and took his hand in hers using an ancient enchantment to share her ability to breathe water like air the siren studied the handsome face and golden hair her pulse quickened a school of fish whirled by she smiled a greeting and swam back to her cave the pirate carried effortlessly along inside the underwater cave the mermaid headed toward a patch of light undulating to propel the man up and out of the water onto a ledge in her grotto the moment her hand was removed the pirate coughed up water and took in a lungful of air his thick lashes fluttered eyes bluer than the sea after a storm stared into hers am i in heaven his smile was charming she reached out to touch one of the little indentations in each cheek they were adorable raking strands of golden hair out of his compelling face the man said i must not be dead since you ve got a tail instead of wings although you look like an angel she smiled his voice made her feel fluttery inside irresistibly drawn the mermaid levered herself out of the water and pressed her lips to tempting masculine ones she d seen humans do this and now she knew why they did it was wonderful luna blaise why are you staring off that way draco demanded impatiently waiting for the loonies to snap out of it and fix some lunch he was starving windsurfing was fun and ginny had been impressed with his turns and sail spins but it also made him hungry blinking themselves out of whatever daze they d been in the girls looked at each other and began giggling he frowned what a good influence lovegood was on his mate when the zabini house elf arrived carrying a picnic basket blaise said minky i need your help the back patio is nice and shady but the table not big enough and we need more chairs the two headed toward the back of the house the rest of the group came in through the side door rico suave was flashing that latin lover smile while trying to interest ginny in slalom sailing draco walked over to slip a proprietary arm around her waist he ignored the amused look on her face and informed the group lunch is ready on the patio he held ginny back from following the others something amuses you draco used a fingertip to trace smiling features taking extra time and care with pink curving lips interesting how big and dark her eyes became while she shook her head the black bikini with a wrap skirt was very pretty with pale freckled blushing skin he daringly trailed a finger along the edge of the top whispering what you said about lying half naked in a hammock was that an invitation yes his jaw dropped it snapped shut when she said i want you to lounge around half naked anytime you want draco tried but couldnthold back laughter it burst forth and was joined by ginny s kissing that smart mouth made him smile his girl was sliding her hands down his back when a chorus of voices called from the patio rules out on the patio the elf was nowhere in sight but her work was evident a long weathered cedar table was covered with white cloth and an array of food the others were waiting for them draco sat between his girl and his best mate ginny pointed to a cylindrical light yellow cheese what kind is this draco smiled idiazabal it intense sharp and buttery he pointed to different items on the table try it with serrano ham and some of that crusty bread you must try my brother olive oil rico leaned across the table and drizzled some on a slice of bread handing it to ginny with a smile it extra virgin draco noticed roberts didntlook any happier about the spaniard extra chummy act boot was oblivious to the undercurrents too busy feeding blaise a slice of orange when cruz waving off their assurances that lemonade was fine rose to go get a bottle of a robust red from navarra luna lifted a plate of small pastries rico asked me if i had a fondness for tarts ooohhh piperade yum i love tarts said blaise draco replied sourly so does rico suave blaise fed a slice of orange to her jungle man allowing him to lick the juice off her fingers rico is just friendly and you re just jealous speak of the devil he returned before draco could deny the ridiculous accusation he wasntjealous he also wasntgoing to ask blaise to peel him any grapes either not when he knew where her fingers had been sullenly refusing wine he ate while intermittently peering at green and black globules and considering whether or not to ask his mate to go wash her hands white blond eyebrows rose in surprise a peeled grape had just been dropped onto his plate ginny met his gaze and smiled shyly he picked up the fruit with a grin draco felt all warm inside and it didntbother him a bit minky reappeared to whisk away the dishes she handed blaise a small pouch filled with small balls that looked like greyish green rat tails rolled together and covered in slime draco sniffed when he was handed one it smelled salty blaise said it saltwater gillyweed after eating it we ll be able to breathe underwater for an hour rico started to put it into his mouth she yelped no not until you get in the water gillyweed gives us temporary gills and flipper like feet we dontwant to be fish out of water the couples split up each finding their own spot to wade into the water while suave went off who cared where when he reached waist high water draco turned to ginny and confessed i hate choking down nasty stuff she made a face me too that polyjuice was disgusting holding up the gillyweed ball he said i ll do anything for you he took a bite chewed once and then quickly swallowed rubbery octopus tentacles my favourite ginny looked relieved that it wasntworse she scrunched her eyes closed and ate half at one time he chuckled and finished the rest of his while she forced the final half of hers down her eyes grew wide she clutched at his shoulders he sank down into the water breathing salt water was like breathing air it felt so weird long red tresses floated around them ginny smiled and reached up to touch a spot under his ear he had gills hers were barely noticeable unlike that blue tint her skin had taken small feminine feet now resembled flippers bubbles floated around them while they laughed at the sight of webbed fingers they held hands to swim further out into the ocean it was like a submerged garden the transparency of the water made colourful fish and other marine life seem even more vivid they drifted toward a reef there was a ship to explore it was small with a single mast and of no great historical import he grinned at her and pointed back to where they came the gillyweed wouldntlast much longer there was something else they had to do within swimming distance to shore they paused flipper like feet treading to keep them together brushing red strands out of his way was harder than it looked finally draco anchored them behind her ears a stream of tiny bubbles appeared when she laughed he pulled her close and kissed cool wet lips her legs twined with his while her hands sank into his hair they floated sideways it could ve been upside down at that moment he cared about nothing except the feel of their lips and tongues and mouths moving together grey eyes opened and stared into brown he had never looked into a girl eyes while kissing before he had never wanted to let a girl know what he was feeling before floating underwater with their bodies pressed together it seemed that they were in a private world where it didntmatter if she saw his hand shake while touching her where he didntneed to put on a slytherin front he didntneed anything except air the gillyweed had worn off draco pushed ginny to the surface they tread water gasping at the shock of bright sunlight against eyes that had become used to the shaded depths that was amazing he reached out a hand to push wet strands away from her face you re amazing moving closer she leaned forward and gave him a kiss no we re amazing together ginny floated to shore wishing that gillyweed had lasted longer kissing underwater had been incredible she walked up the beach beside draco holding his hand after rinsing off again the group gathered their things thanked rico and flooed back to the beach house the couples split up to take a siesta out on the back sun terrace in a corner shaded by the house and palms she watched draco stalk over to a hammock ginny giggled at the pout making his classic face cute he scowled what ginny stretched out on the gently swinging fabric are you pouting because you wanted us to try the hammock by the pool and terry called it without asking first silvery eyes glanced away before draco lowered to lie beside her of course not he draped a leg over the edge his foot pushing off the tile the force used caused the hammock to rock violently ginny rolled against her boyfriend side one hand bracing itself against his muscular upper body her fingers smoothed over his torso enjoying every contour of his chest and abs chiselled lips pursed when draco turned his head toward her she kissed him he smiled against her mouth yes i was pouting the look in his eyes made her pulse race surprisingly he pulled her to lie against his chest restricting long fingers to stroking her back firm smooth and incredibly warm his skin felt so good draco touch was so relaxing she fell asleep when ginny awoke the sun had set and the world was wreathed in twilight eyes unfairly blessed with the longest pale lashes were closed in sleep the handsome face had a vulnerable quality to it that tugged at her heart she couldntresist sliding up to tenderly kiss parted lips a hand slid under her hair to curve around the nape of her neck draco held her gently in place to deepen the kiss it became hard to remember to breathe it was like being underwater again in a private world where nothing else existed ahem ginny froze draco said curtly what is it dinner is to be served in one hour minky said apologetically my mistress is asking me to apprise you of that fact excuse me i must go prepare alone once more ginny couldnthelp giggling reluctant to part ginny sighed while she took the hand extended and was helped to rise off the hammock still holding her hand draco lifted it and kissed the back before holding the palm against his cheek thank you she didntask for what he was thanking her for trusting him with her body as well as her heart this was a side that the prince of slytherin rarely showed if only her parents could see how he treated her with love and respect smiling even while inside she felt torn between laughter and tears ginny said huskily thank you after draco had walked her back to the girls room she opened the door to find blaise showing luna a few dance steps blaise wore a short black scarf dress with ivory vines winding around the edge of the fluttery silk luna dress with a halter top looked like a fabric watercolour with its shimmering swirls of pink yellow and turquoise the two girls looked up blaise said we re flooing to seville later so hop in the shower girlfriend ginny said over her shoulder while heading for the lavatory there better be some hot water left girlfriends she could hear the witches cackling on the other side of the door when she came back into the room after using a drying spell on her hair the silence made her nervous blaise arched an eyebrow nice practical bra you ve got on but it doesntgo with your dress since ginny planned on wearing a plain black tank dress her plain black bra certainly did go with her eyes flickered over to her the dress spread out on the bed it wasntanything that she d packed in her suitcase it was a copper over black crochet minidress with a low bodice and a fringe hem next to it was a pair of black slides so pretty she took an inadvertent step forward luna said it ll look gorgeous with your hair luna lovegood was giving fashion advice the girl had gone from radish earrings wait she still wore those and was now telling her what to wear ginny moved another pace closer to the bed blaise tempted like a serpent c mon arentthose manolo calling you they re charmed for comfort you can dance all night and never turn your ankle look luna wearing pink slides and i ve got black ones with buckles we ll make the boys drool over our legs how can you resist she couldn t before ginny knew it the practical bra was off and the crochet dress with a built in support spell was on in a daze she slipped on the shoes that made her feel like a princess her friends led her over to a vanity blaise smiled wickedly and opened a case of siren cosmetics when they met the others in the courtyard ginny thought each boy looked very handsome terry wore a midnight blue silk shirt and wesley a turquoise that only he could get away with of course draco was the most gorgeous in a black on black striped shirt with black trousers his fingers kept playing with her fringe and fingering the metallic crochet he told her three times that she was beautiful had she really considered refusing to wear anything other than her plain knit dress dinner was served in the dining room minky was in alt over finally being allowed to go all out the candlelight was romantic the crystal sparkled and the silver shone a caesar salad and lemon orzo complimented the zarzuela a catalonian version of bouillabaisse with lobster scallops fish and shrimp the conversation ranged from quidditch to what everyone wanted to do over the rest of the holiday luna and wesley wanted to go horseback riding on the beach blaise persuaded that a balloon ride and picnic would be fun terry wanted to drive up to one of the famous pueblos blancos or white villages on mopeds draco thought they should go sailing ginny wanted to explore the reefs again at the mention of gillyweed reminiscent smiles were exchanged the elf wearing a fur edged tea towel cleared the table and served dessert the group moved to the lounge after dinner blaise sat on terry lap in a chair she said what do you think the poor wretches stuck at school are doing wesley grinned most likely they re holed up in common rooms slogging away at a long list of assignments draco sneered weasley and granger are probably ruining the room of requirement he relayed the highland games story the boys all agreed that it was a revolting mental image ginny saw luna and blaise trade glances they didntappear to find the idea of ron in a kilt distasteful but wisely kept silent when the hour grew late enough for spanish nightlife to start the group flooed to a small bar that was owned by a friend of blaise father and thanked the barkeep who told them de nada as they stepped out into the seville night orange trees and palms lined the street the smell of orange blossoms made ginny smile she held draco hand and tried not to gape like a tourist each wanted the others to try a nightclub playing their type of music they ended up in a club that was located in a large city house with several dance floors and balconies from which to watch the dancers the music played was a mix of european and american dance music feeling mellow and loose ginny followed her boyfriend lead on the floor and let herself get caught up in the sensuality of the beat and draco moves she was a good dancer even if she did say so herself luna was almost as good and blaise was a show off ignoring the down shaking spectacle ginny proved that she could work it too it was mad and she wanted to dance until the sun came up eventually the girls had to find a loo returning to their table they found their boyfriends surrounded by a group of senoritas that obviously wanted to have their arses hexed ginny went for her wand when one dark haired beauty touched draco hair she exhaled sharply when she realised that she d left it at home oh well muggle duelling sounded good to her right now blaise patted her arm leave it to me amiga arms waving eyes flashing blaise rattled off a stream of spanish mixed with latin that sounded like a combination of threats and curses the girls closest to their boyfriends broke out in rashes within moments the guys were alone of course the arrogant males thought their girlfriends jealous when the other couples left for the dance floor draco smirked i saw you reach for your wand nice to know you want to keep me for yourself ginny twined her arms around his neck you re mine mine mine and dontyou forget it he gave a bark of laughter she said shut up and kiss me lips curving he bent his head to hers yes ma am blaise smiled when the techno beat slowed and the music changed she moved closer to her boyfriend winding slowly as the song played silky brown hair brushed her face she sifted her fingers through the strands dark blue eyes smiled was he thinking about the way she d hexed those senoritas for making a move on boys that were already taken she said if that girl had touched your hair instead of draco s she wouldnthave any terry mouth moved across hers his tongue traced her lower lip she opened her mouth and gave everything she had to the kiss rules blaise pout made terry chuckle flouncing away from the friends that had cut the kiss short she fanned her face with a hand and sighed ruefully someone touched her arm and asked in spanish eres tu blaise zabini a well dressed handsome spaniard in his twenties stood looking at her inquiringly toning her glare down to a gaze of indifference she pulled away and said in english never heard of her is this bloke bothering you blaise terry gallantry was heart warming but she wished he d called her baby instead of using her name the stranger raised his hands and smiled charmingly lo siento i did not explain my name is diego romero at her blank stare he added your cousin a short laugh escaped i donthave any cousins she stepped back against the reassuring strength of her boyfriend the man face was a study in confusion i have seen your photograph for zabini jewellers is enrique not your father when she nodded a smile flashed white against a dark olive complexion mi padre es su your father cousin enzo romero did your papa never tell you of his family defensively she said after my grandparents died and his grandfather disinherited him maybe my father figured he didnt have family diego acted offended disinherited never your father turned his back on his heritage and broke his grandmother heart yeguada romero breeds the finest pura raza espanola horses in andalusia and he chose to play with jewellery blaise fingered one of her large diamond stud earrings she smirked playing with jewellery has worked out well and donttell me grandpapa was too busy mucking out stalls to owl if the man wanted to keep in touch he could have enrique changed his name sent back his grandfather letters what could the family do she stared in shock her father had never told her but then again there were probably a lot of things her parents hadntshared draco strolled over with ginny tell your father he made an excellent choice blaise romero doesnthave that same ring to it diego stiffened icily he demanded who are you to interfere between family grey eyes iced over blaise said bluntly he more family to me than you are so drop the attitude if you cantspeak in front of my friends then you can ride on back to the ranch spanish cowboy romero smiled like she d given him an idea si you must come and visit la yeguarda i will tell gran abuelo and he will owl an invitacion to you and your friends at she told him that they were staying at the beach house he grinned i knew enrique could not sell la casa that meant so much to his grandmother sol y sombra was her favourite mi padre y great grandfather will be pleased swell kissing her hand in a way that made terry frown and draco and wesley pull their girlfriends closer diego rejoined his party the friends didntfeel like dancing anymore they left the club and returned to the casa starlight looked brighter without competition from man made illuminations the couples reclined on loungers on the darkened sun terrace and quietly contemplated the stars shining over the ocean when the girls headed for bed blaise pretended to go right to sleep beside her ginny whispered i ll go with you if you want to visit your family on her other side luna said me too blaise swallowed around the lump in her throat thanks she eventually fell asleep and drifted into dreams of the past the meal was torturous her parents had already left for a dinner party in malaga leaving her with the malfoys they werentpleasant conversationalists narcissa demanded why are you always scowling girl looking at your face ruins my appetite blaise said then it just as well you re drinking your dinner as usual then next to her draco said in an undertone good one the faint smile that curved her mouth faded when lucius mocked i do believe our baby girl is feeling sad that we re taking her playmate off to a party darling perhaps i should let you two attend without me and keep her company no lucius taunting smile widened if marisol wouldntbe devastated to lose draco company i d be more than happy to let my son remain behind unfortunately he sighed theatrically our hostess has made plans that i cantbreak using the pretext of an upset stomach blaise rushed from the room when draco left she was waiting in the corridor and pulled him out the side door in the near darkness the boy looked ghostly pale his eyes were haunted when she asked why he didnttell his father that he refused to go to any of that woman parties anymore i can t i wanted to go at first but now whenever i try to say no i unable to it like a compulsion i cantresist mrs malfoy voice carried from the house it time to go baby boy unhappily draco shrugged and left blaise alone to stare sightlessly across the terrace her thoughts raced lucius calling her baby girl giving her a meaningful look while stressing plans i cantbreak draco admitting that he was unable to say no that he felt compelled narcissa calling baby boy everything snapped into place marisol was using dark magic and blaise could break the spell if she dared racing to her room she took a small tome bound in leather out of its hiding place there was a counter spell to the one the older witch was undoubtedly using blaise had a prior claim and if the blood magic was done correctly and draco wanted to break the enchantment he could be freed she began to scour the house for what she needed twenty minutes later draco bed was ringed with flickering candles lowering her wand after chanting the words to the spell blaise picked up a knife and cut her forearm a short time passed the bedroom door opened draco stared at her incredulously how marisol said that my life was bound to hers forever she was wrong if you want you can break her spell a pale brow lifted do i have to get bloody yes he took off his shirt after an involuntary look she kept her eyes on his face stepping into the circle he frowned at the knife and made a shallow cut similar to hers on his forearm quickly smearing blood the boy lifted his arm is this all remembering that he thought she didntremember the first spell she acted as though his question wasntfacetious no we need to erm exchange blood tentatively she reached up to lick coppery tasting redness off his forearm draco smirked and leaned down to copy her action she said i think we have to stay together all night to break the enchantment fine by me the awkwardness she first experienced faded to a relief that her friend was in his own bed instead of marisols blaise gradually fell asleep only to awake when a gleeful voice whispered my dear girl i so pleased you didntdisappoint me she stared up into wicked grey eyes lucius stood outside the ring of enchanted candles i knew that if i pointed the way you d take care of my little problem for me she couldntspeak he answered her unspoken question marisol was given permission to play with my son not to try and keep him i couldntact against her myself politics and all that but i knew you d get the job done almost fondly he said really blaise i impressed her uncomprehending stare made the man grin can it be you are unaware of what happens when one spell caster overcomes another she shook her head what lucius crouched down until his eyes were on level with hers blood is life little girl marisol used an ancient spell that ties the caster life to her charm if it is broken then my son controls his own fate and she dies rising gracefully he backed toward the door pleasant dreams blaise turned to stared at the boy peaceful sleeping face could she really lie there and allow someone to die so that he could live free draco smiled in his sleep she made her decision and stoically waited for the sunrise wake up blaise surging upright she looked from one girl to another was i dreaming what did you hear what did i say ginny said nothing you were only crying numbly feeling the wetness on her cheeks blaise scooted to the end of the bed i ve got to take a walk get out of here the other girls followed her out of the house and across the sand to the ocean the sun was rising spreading its rays in pastel colours across the horizon blaise remembered another sunrise and knew that if given the chance she d make the same choice a sharp pain caused her to hop on one foot while plucking a sand burr meeting curious gazes she said o how full of briers is this working day world the cool morning breeze ruffled long blond hair luna said thoughtfully as you like it i admired rosalind very much but i more like celia she smiled they are but burrs cousin thrown upon thee in holiday foolery blaise shook her head i could shake them off my coat these burrs are in my heart in a tone reminiscent of mrs weasley ginny scolded we ll help you with those burrs any time you want blaise but if you re not up to sharing i vote that we enjoy the sunrise and then think of a prank to wake the boys if i going to wake up at dawn then i want draco to share my misery erm joy the girls sat huddled together on the sand for warmth while the sun rose luna said if there any whipped cream we could place some in their hands and then tickle their lips when they go to rub they ll you know get messy ginny snickered would licking whipped cream off draco face be considered an excessive display of affection blaise impulsively draped her arms around her friends and gave them a quick squeeze before standing last one to the kitchen uses sour cream she called racing back to the house no one came in last chapter 34 a lover holiday i so glad the rain in spain stays mainly in the plain contentedly listening to her friends chat over breakfast luna lips curved at the whimsical thought the days spent at the beach with wesley and everyone else of course had been full of sunshine and laughter since arriving at the casa she d easily adjusted to what blaise called spanish time the regimented schedule of hogwarts was forgotten meals were leisurely and served later than she was used to the group slept in until almost noon and didntgo to bed until the night had become morning between two and five or even later was siesta time luna favourite time of day after a few hours swimming and a meal the couples would each head to a different side of the whitewashed home time spent taking kissing and napping with wesley on a hammock shaded by palms and fuchsia flowered bougainvillea was beyond wonderful it helped blunt the feelings of regret she still experienced over lying to her father drinky is bringing the owl post every face around the table looked up expectantly at the elf handing out mail beside her wesley grinned when a small envelope was handed to him luna smiled his shirt printed with hula girls matched his eyes and the tee that she was wearing his denim clad leg pressed against hers when he leaned over to say mum hopes that i ve used sunscreen spells and dad warns senoritas can be very fiery so to make sure and be gentle when i tell the girl of my dreams i have to return home wesley brushed his lips across hers are you going to get all fiery on me do you want me to across the table ginny giggled when he nodded earnestly my mum would like yours wesley she wrote about sunscreen too as well as admonishing me to be a good guest and not bother my hostess with continuous questions about the history of the area draco smirked i dare you to write back that your host is taking you to alcazar palace and looks forward to answering questions while stealing kisses i ll do it when you owl your father that the malfoy heir is dating a weasley drinky bring me stationary draco said with a grin the house elf who had handed blaise and terry their mail nodded and headed for the arched doorway blaise said drinky ignore that command he in one of his moods thank you for bringing the post if you ll wait in the kitchen with minky for a few minutes i ll have a reply for you to bring my father the elf bowed and slipped out of the tiled courtyard blaise frowned at her best mate the last thing we need is to give lucius a reason to escape azkaban cantwe just enjoy the time we have to spend together without bringing our families into it before draco could form a reply luna said reasonably our families are the reason we lied to be here there no forgetting it but i agree that we cantallow them to ruin our holiday at the other end of the table terry lifted a small news clipping here a quote my folks sent from the intruder he said a source close to the zabini family has let it be known that new ads featuring the it couple of malfoy and zabini will put new meaning into the phrase fun in the sun a zabini jewellers spokesperson refused to comment on rumours that the young lovers are spending their holiday at a secluded spanish hideaway after a pause at the end terry said funny how they got things right and yet so wrong blaise kissed her boyfriend cheek enrique writes that eddy and narcissa are spending every galleon he saved using sol y sombra as a location but otherwise they re fine he also warns that any inappropriate conduct toward his innocent daughter by young malfoy will receive the severest of reprisals conjuring a quill she scratched out a quick reply saying as she wrote i assuring father that draco is behaving like a very parfit gentil black knight and not to worry wesley slanted luna a questioning look she said chaucer canterbury tales except for the black part blaise held up a sheet of ornately decorated parchment we ve all been invited to a fiesta being held in honour of cousin diego birthday mi gran abuelo the honourable don vicente jose julio trevino romero bids us to arrive at the hacienda after siesta in two days time terry immediately asked do you want to go blaise nodded luna said i looking forward to it i dontthink i ve seen an andalusian horse before when drinky and minky returned to clear the table and take their replies she realised that her letter had gone unopened luna quickly opened the envelope what she read caused all colour to leave her face what is it mutely she held out the letter looking concerned wesley took it bad news said blaise luna didntknow how to answer she said will you read aloud wesley he cleared his throat sweetheart the paper circulation is rising and all is well except for my best journalist wanting to write human interest stories about wizard scouts helping old witches across the street and a little squib prize pig now if the pig could fly that would be a story i ve been meaning to tell you for some weeks now but i ve been seeing someone it started as getting the scoop on a rival editor and it nothing serious just lunch or dinner here and there but you have a right to know ivanna a widow with kids at hogwarts her twin girls are in your year mary kate and ashley greengrass when you get back from spain we ll go have dinner with her wontbe long now love dad ginny looked horrified mary kate and ashley blaise said hey they wontbe wicked stepsisters she told luna cheer up they ll be easy to outwit sharing a brain the way those girls do she turned to draco remember when we were practising muggle cheering and lorelei said she d go show uh explain to snape and the twins were shocked when the rest of us went eeuwww over the slip i wish i could forget draco mocked no she said explain she wouldn t they arent luna smiled but after the morning meal while waiting for her turn to floo to the stable la caballeriza the hit in the stomach feeling returned her father was dating again not just anyone either the editor of the daily prophet just the thought of having mary kate and ashley as stepsisters much less having a stepmother named ivanna lovegood made her stomach twist she was determined to think about the whole thing later like after she went back to england she liked the stables they were old and quaint jorge the guide seemed kind with patient dark eyes and a full grey streaked moustache luna was thankful that the horses seemed equally well mannered especially when she asked the name of her mare lightning was a colourful name but not comforting the small group dressed in denims tees trainers or cowboy boots followed their guide in pairs luna enjoyed trailing at the end with wesley she got to watch her friends as well as the scenery draco said to ginny do you know how small a horse brain is what if this beast decides to bolt jorge assured from his place in front that the horses were experienced at handling children and the elderly on the brown horse behind draco white steed terry said blaise looks like epona the horse goddess but i d rather be on a machine i have total control over are we going back to one of those white villages we visited a couple of days ago that was a fun ride enchanted mopeds go a lot faster than muggle ones dontthey ginny riding beside draco on a dappled mare looked back over her shoulder yes and they dontneed stinky petrol either she grinned at blaise i d love to shop another open market i need a few more souvenirs teasingly she added creevey doesntneed another present though creevey got a present terry asked blaise shrugged i felt sorry for him being stuck in london so i sent some oranges terry brought his gelding alongside his girlfriend mare and reached out to stroke her cheek that was nice luna glanced over at wesley he shook his head in disbelief he edged his white horse closer to hers that was a bad idea creevey doesntneed more encouragement by the way how the matchmaking going between colin and mindy pleased with her efforts luna smiled she said they had plans to go swimming over holiday that a good sign wesley said you re looking happy now that a good sign to me they were riding on a path through the middle of a field of sunflowers luna sighed when wesley leaned down and lithely broke one off before presenting it to her with a grin she stuck the stem through one of the side plaits framing her face the left side she was taken the stable proximity to the sea made for a relaxing ride through fields to reach the golden sands the horses instinctively headed for the shallows and began to gallop jorge chuckled to hear draco imprecations which were seconded without the profanity by terry luna laughed at the feeling of the spray after a peek at wesley her susceptible mind gave way to vivid imagination they were galloping down the coast away from port royal the dread pirate roberts along with a small band of his most trusted crew had cleverly infiltrated a masked ball and liberated a fortune in jewels from the greedy governor vault the orphanages the man had cheated out of the support sent by the crown would never worry about funds again reaching the beach where a ship named true love waited in deep waters the horses began slowing wesley pulled to a halt beside her his face was alight with pleasure in the night work the wild ride and her company she reached up to pull his mouth down to hers rules luna dazedly luna pulled away from wesley her lips seemed to cling reluctant to part from his the others had a laugh over her confusion wesley grinned like a pirate promise to tell me what you daydreamed during our siesta hmmm she nodded eyes shining as you wish slowly awakening from a nap on the hammock beside draco ginny opened her eyes and drowsily studied her boyfriend sleeping face it looked so relaxed and boyishly sweet her lips twitched at the thought of the disgust that would cross his face if she ever told him so draco liked to pretend to be tough and uncaring but whenever she complimented him a look of pleasure would flash in silver eyes before he scoffed the sentiment away how strange slytherins were to act as if they didntcare what others thought she cared probably too much for an instant when draco had ordered drinky to bring stationary her heart had jolted she had wanted him to owl his father until the voice of reason had reared its ugly head bloody stupid reason ruining her fantasy of telling her white blond romeo deny thy father and refuse thy name or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love and i ll no longer be a capulet she drew in a startled breath when a sleepy voice said huskily shall i hear more or shall i speak at this cheeks pinking at the realisation that she d spoken aloud ginny said i dontwant either of us to change our names i just want to be with you draco hands cradled her head while masculine lips melded to hers they lay together on their sides her fingers sifted through platinum strands and drifted down to stroke his shoulders time in the sun hadntgiven draco a tan thanks to charms but his fair skin had a healthy glow that invited her hands to roam over the defined muscles she sighed was it superficial to be glad that her boyfriend worked out and had a body as gorgeous as his face draco chuckled i want to be with you too and i dontthink i superficial because i glad you re gorgeous she could feel her cheeks burning over the awkward habit of saying thoughts aloud draco lips traced her ear i d love you even if you werentbeautiful now ginny started to giggle i d still love you if your face wasntperfect too now the repressed mirth that reverberated in his chest escaped in laughter that made her heart turn over it sounded so young and carefree hearing it made every lie she d told to be here worth the regret that came with it a malfoy laughing owl the prophet blaise terry please show some loyalty to a friend i owling the quibbler the other couple grinned at them from the french doors both were dressed casually in shorts while draco helped her up from the hammock ginny asked are you wearing that to tour the castle blaise was biting her thumbnail she and terry exchanged a quick glance before the girl could speak wesley came through the doors pulling luna by the hand i cantbelieve you girls haventbeen to a muggle amusement park i dragged terry to one last summer and he loved it wait until you ride your first rollercoaster you ll be hooked abruptly aware that draco and ginny had no clue what he was talking about wesley said haventgot around to breaking the news yet what news draco sounded uncaring but ginny could see a muscle flexing in his jaw wesley hastily escorted luna back inside blaise bit her lip you know i enjoyed the tour of los reales alcacares the last time we came but well this time the four of us are going to isla magica theme park she used big brown eyes in a way that her mother would be envious of we ll still meet back here for dinner and then all go see the flamenco show together are you okay with that draco shoulder rose and fell fine at least i wontbe subjected to you pretending interest in mudpie architecture blaise threw up her hands i was joking i knew that it was mudejar wesley stuck his head through the doorway everything cool ginny looked at draco he nodded she said we re cool go have fun we ll see you later after the others left she hugged her boyfriend dontthink of it as no one but me has any interest in culture and history think of them skivving off as alone at last the wicked smile crossing the classically handsome face made her hurry to change the black tank dress that had been too plain for dancing was perfect for sightseeing when paired with black flats draco black silk tee and trousers had a casual elegance that made ginny glad she hadntworn shorts they stepped into the fireplace and were transported to the seville public floo station centrally located the building which blended with its neighbours due to a concealment spell was filled with locals and visitors alike ginny put on her sunglasses once they stepped out into the bright sunlight she took a deep breath of orange blossom scented air the others could keep their rolly coasters at the palace she was less than impressed with the tour guide monotone speech abd al raman iii ordered the construction of this fortified palace in 913ad the monarchs of spain have since chosen to make los reales alcacares their seville residence currently his royal majesty juan carlos resides here when he visits ginny smiled when draco pulled her to the side and allowed the group to move on without them he said i had hoped the quality of the tour had improved over the last few years but as you heard it hasn t i ll show you around enjoying the way his fingers gripped hers when he pulled her over to view something interesting and the animation of his face while draco pointed out the different architectural styles ginny happily followed him from chamber to chamber the ambassadors room was beautiful he pointed to the dome those wood sculptures are gilded cedar arentthey amazing look at the plaster work it so complex see the three arches each has three horse shoes which is why the name arcos de herradura the islamic architecture was ginny favourite while draco preferred neoclassical the past came alive while they walked through corridors rooms and patios outside extensive gardens were a jumble of different styles the english gardens jarred with the surroundings she said i feel like i on a sugar plantation in the caribbean draco sneered at the choice in planting he led her to the garden of the poets the two ponds inspired by the romans and the arabs satisfied them both sitting together on a bench she rested her head on draco shoulder and sighed contentedly what the sigh for wishing you were with the rest of that lot his face may have showed mild curiosity but ginny could see the uncertainty in the grey eyes searching hers didnthe know by now that she wouldnttrade the time they d spent together for all the muggle entertainment in the world smiling at the thought that no one would remind them of rules she kissed draco giving her answer in a way that satisfied them both after touring the palace they strolled down narrow cobbled streets until they came upon a square with a caf sitting at a table under an umbrella ginny enjoyed a cool drink and watched the activity around them shoppers bustled past with their bags lovers young and old strolled along hand in hand the bells chimed in a nearby cathedral draco gave a half smile we have time for a carriage ride if you d like she liked maybe in the heat of summer when the city smells couldntbe hosed away each night along with the horse droppings the ride wouldnthave been so magical but it was spring the flowers and orange trees were blooming ginny was sitting beside the boy she loved rolling through picturesque streets the coachman paused beside a flower stall draco leaned out purchased a rose and presented it to her ginny held tight to the token she was going to press and keep forever throwing her arms around her boyfriend neck she expressed her affection publicly in an excessive way onlookers applauded blaise felt like a little kid isla magica was the coolest place walking from the floo station she d explained that the theme park was built on the site that had been used for the country last national exposition she d smirked when joking that the park had a colonial theme and they d probably learn more history than draco and ginny once they d arrived and joined the line to buy tickets and enter though a child like sense of anticipation had overtaken her she wasntthe only one terry eyes had gleamed at the thought of riding el jaguar a rollercoaster that people in front of them boasted had 360 degree turns wesley was the amusement park pro he held the map and navigated them around the central lake and through the maze of themed areas with names like quetzal fury of the gods to reach amazonia the atmosphere was incredible are you sure there are no illusion spells wesley this is all muggle made luna asked yes love wesley chuckled muggles may not have wizard magic but they ve got imagination and ingenuity looking around i d say the results are pretty magical blaise silently agreed it did seem as if they were in the amazon instead of seville gazing around at the vendors selling everything from ice cream to tee shirts before glancing up to watch the riders scream past overhead she amended the thought it like the jungle with all the modern conveniences and none of the heat bugs and unfriendly natives when their turn came to step onto the ride blaise and luna looked warily at each other while a metal contraption was pulled down to keep them harnessed in safely their boyfriends laughed at the look on their faces when the coaster started to pick up speed blaise thought terry was so cute with his wide smile it was as much fun to watch his face as to hurtle through loops and around curves after el jaguar came to a halt she took his hand clambered out and said let go again four rides later the couples headed for the bumper cars it was strange how muggles tried so hard not to hit each other in everyday traffic and yet enjoyed crashing into one another in tiny gliding versions of their vehicles blaise steered her car around the perimeter after getting splashed on the iguazu waterfall ride the friends looked at the park map and decided to move on to the eldorado area there was a 500 metre descent down the orinoco rapids they couldntwait to try the ride in a rubber boat was mad soaking them all terry looked fine in a wet shirt an electric blue gaze told her that he felt the same way about her then he frowned can you do a wandless drying spell not that i dontlike the view but that top of yours is too revealing halter tops charmed with support spells upheld modesty when dry but wet was another story hurriedly blaise chanted a spell minky had taught her and was relieved when the thin red fabric concealed once more she quickly repeated it to dry the other three a sopping wet muggle girl who had been on the raft behind theirs exited the ride and stared incredulously at their dry clothes they waved and rushed on to the condor circus a trip to the planetarium and an interesting but perplexing ride on a virtual rollercoaster later the friends headed to the port of the indies they took a break at an outdoor caf blaise wondered aloud why would someone want to create an illusion of a rollercoaster when the real thing is so much better luna answered after taking a drink of bottled water i think muggles are like wizards they do things because they can a band of actors dressed as knights merchants and rogues were inviting spectators to the next show at the comedy theatre wesley said let go maybe they ll need a volunteer and i can impress my girl the comedy of the merchant daughter was amusing wesley was picked to be one of the rogues that kidnapped the fair isabella away from her beloved knight and merchant father blaise was impressed with wesley good humoured acting but she could see luna wasntthrilled with the girl flirtation with her bright haired captor the audience thought it part of the show when the heroine wig appeared to catch fire from one of the flickering torches on the den of thieves set isabella yanked off the flowing locks to reveal short spiky hair blaise laughed harder than most of the crowd she had seen luna lips silently chant the words to a jinx that smile was long gone when the others tried to coax her into taking a free fall drop uh uh no way forget it you three go and i ll wait here to see if you make it off alive the only time i like my heart jumping into my throat is when i kissing terry that argument earned a kiss from her boyfriend and a smile from the other two once the others had plunged down to earth they walked over to a two story carousel snogging while their horses rose and fell was her kind of challenge luna agreed whole heartedly and urged wesley to get back in line for another go round holding hands the two couples meandered through a mayan world and stopped in the pirates cove to try and win a prize at a shooting gallery the muggle weapon took a few moments to get the hang of but blaise soon won herself and luna cute stuffed animals terry who wasntquite proficient enough duly admired the monkeys if i didntknow that you loved me i d be worried about your expertise with weaponry baby she tried to explain that it was just a matter of depth perception reflexes and hand eye co ordination wesley said yes and i a monkey uncle blaise remembered draco calling the other boy cheetah she caught terry eye they both laughed making their way to the gateway of the americas the foursome strolled through the fort themed area and boarded a reproduction of a sixteenth century galleon blaise pointed to the captain bunk rather short werentthey luna gave a slight smile you go on and check out the canons we ll be along in a minute pretending luna and wesley were staying behind to study the cabin in more detail blaise laced her fingers with terry and led him to the cramped space where cannonballs waited to be loaded and fired are you interested in this stuff terry asked with a smile she shook her head while pulling him over to a dark corner no i interested in this stuff giggles interrupted their kiss two little girls stared at them big eyed the parents came into the small area behind them the young couple smiled embarrassedly and sidled around the family and climbed back up to the deck blaise leaned back against terry at the railing why doesntmuggle studies cover theme parks his arms tightened around her does that mean you ve had a good time i had a great time hours later following a long rest and dinner blaise held up a silk dress and asked ginny what do you think i like the ruffled hemline i d wear it blaise handed her the green dress good it for you on your bed are satin sandals to go with she disregarded half hearted protests complimented luna on her lily print dress and pulled a sleeveless coral frock out of the wardrobe ginny said jokingly hey that dress is almost modest blaise held up floral thong sandals i got the dress to match the shoes the other girls admitted that they would have too after sliding on antique spanish gold hoop earrings blaise was ready to go meet the boys she was looking forward to returning to seville to see a flamenco performance before going out dancing while the girls walked through the house to reach the floo in the front parlour she heard a gasp and turned to see ginny slumped against the side wall red hair swinging forward to obscure her expression luna asked are you okay a moment passed before ginny nodded and brushed back her hair with a shaking hand yeah i fine i just felt this really intense pang in my stomach but it gone now blaise said was it a reaction to the gambas ajillo we had for dinner or some psychic something it wasntthe shrimp with garlic i just get these bloody pangs now and then even though they do me no good i can never tell what going to happen i only get a warning now blaise stomach was starting to flip flop a warning yes to brace myself do they help you these pangs luna asked matter of factly ginny laughed ruefully not really and now i ll be wondering all night what going to happen blaise pressed her hand to her stomach so would she a week ago draco had been dreading this holiday not wanting to return to the place that held so many unhappy memories his attitude had changed completely the thought made him smile as ginny reached his side determination kept his smile in place if he had his way they d skip the performance and go club hopping of course he could ve said something when blaise brought the idea up but he hadntwanted her to know ready to go his girl asked no but it was too late now the others had gone ahead reaching out he cupped ginny cheek and softly rubbed his thumb over the freckles you look beautiful tonight she stepped closer he was tempted to kiss her convince that what she really wanted was to stay here with him it would be so easy and cowardly if his girl wanted to see some spanish gypsy stomp around to guitar music he could force himself to endure it he nodded and followed her into the fireplace the club gitanos was exclusive and intimate their party was the only foreign one there by the reverent way the server breathed the name enrique zabini the place must belong to another one of blaise father cronies draco looked around and was pathetically relieved to not recognise anyone catching his girl giving him a questioning glance he gave a brief smile she relaxed and listened to blaise wax poetic about how the persecuted gypsies influenced by the jewish arab and gregorian songs created flamenco as a way to escape the harsh reality of life to find release from the soul torment through embracing sadness and ridiculing their oppressors conversation halted when the singer guitarist and dancer came onstage the technical prowess displayed by the guitarist while he followed the dancer sudden changes of mood was impressive the woman would abruptly follow a series of soft steps with a rapid fire clattering of her heels ginny face was rapt watching la gitana exaggerated facial expressions play of hands and serpentine movements of arms draco listened to combined music of guitar wailing song and sharp steps and remembered another performance attended years ago he wished they d never come to spain brooding in the corner ni o arentyou enjoying my party draco continued to watch the private flamenco performance not bothering to reply marisol knew bloody well that he d soon regretted ever agreeing to show her around the costa de la luz blaise didntknow how right she d been to sneer that a twenty four year old woman interested in a boy of fourteen even if he was gorgeous and could pass for sixteen was a perverted witch sharp red nails dug into his jaw turning his face to meet a glittering black gaze tired of me already mi corazon stop eyeing the door you couldntleave me if you tried a strange shudder passed through his body for the first time in weeks he felt nothing but contempt for the woman whose beauty was skin deep he took a step away and felt no compulsion to return to marisol side heart racing draco kept moving toward the exit where do you think you re going come back he never paused striding out the door and toward the library flooing back to la casa de sol y sombra draco headed for his room somehow he knew blaise had found a way to break the hold marisol had on him inside the chamber his friend stood beside the bed within a circle of flickering candlelight he said how marisol said that my life was bound to hers forever she was wrong if you want you can break her spell if you want he d never wanted anything more after they d done the counter spell draco lay down beside his mate and drifted into peaceful slumber he couldntremember any dreams the next morning but they must have been good because he awoke with a smile on his face facing him blaise returned the smile want to go windsurfing today along the edges of the shutters rays of sunlight shone through lighting the room the way a sense of freedom lightened his soul he wanted to be a kid sail clear waters with a true friend he grinned yeah enthusiastic clapping brought draco out of his reverie perfunctorily he brought his hands together ginny seemed to have enjoyed the flamenco by the look on her face personally he d rather dance with his girl that was interesting are we ready to do some dancing ourselves asked boot draco said i am the girls started debating where to go roberts after listening to the chatter suggested why dontwe go back to that club in the old mansion the music was good luna asked will we have to jinx girls away from you again the deceptively calm query was met with a cajoling smile buttercup you know that we didntinvite any of that but you enjoyed it cheetah looked like he needed someone to throw him a vine resignedly draco promised if any senoritas come within a metre of us i ll hex them myself luna said gracias he clipped de nada and stood ginny rose and hooked her arm through his reaching up to kiss his cheek that was sweet of you he drawled i figured my jinxes would be kinder than my jealous girlfriend s unfazed by the laughter of the others his fiery girl said damn right even mid week discoteca was popular and the dance floor crowded draco led ginny to the middle of the floor moving to the music red smiled happily swaying with him the techno european tracks transitioned into a slower american song close by blaise and boot locked lips ginny sighed draco took the hint kissing while barely swaying was his favourite slow dance of all the tempo of the next song picked up a bit malfoy grinned to see ginny hip drop the girls must have been practicing some moves in their room he placed his hands on her hips enjoying the way they rolled with the beat ginny asked over the music this song is about holding someone down it a good thing draco laughed it means you ll be there for someone although if you want me to be literal i ll be happy to hold you down and snog you on our hammock she shot back maybe i going to hold you down and snog you on the hammock smugly he agreed anytime in that preternatural way of females the three girls decided they needed to visit the loo at the same time sitting at a table waiting for their ladies to return draco contentedly traded quips about flamenco giving headaches and how much more enjoyable this kind of dancing was minutes later a group of four unattached ladies moved in on them rolling his eyes malfoy started chanting underneath his breath when the young women abruptly gave them evil looks and stalked away mid flirtation roberts chuckled what d you do draco said aversion charm a commotion drew their attention to the hallway leading to the ladies room a petite woman with long black hair was screeching at a tall girl with short dark curls draco felt ill boot stood up why is that woman hassling blaise unable to answer draco watched the woman turn the expression on her face was as bitter as her name when she caught sight of him marisol grabbed blaise arm saying something that made the girl shove the woman away ginny and luna rushed to their friend side causing the witch to stalk off the girls quickly rejoined them after throwing draco a wild eyed glance blaise clutched boot arm let go home i cantstay here anymore the group left on the way back to the floo station ginny had a what going on here look on her face she wasntthe only one terry asked his girlfriend what was that all about back there who was that woman why d it look like you two were about to fight a burst of hysterical laughter escaped blaise for an instant her eyes met draco before she looked away she was someone i met the last time we visited i never liked her after they returned to la casa blaise tried to claim tiredness and rush off to bed terry refused to let go of her hand are you going to wake in the middle of the night with another nightmare tell me what really going on let me help draco felt ginny considering gaze before she focused on blaise i dontspeak spanish but i know that woman was threatening you lying by omission is just as bad as doing it straight out we promised to be honest luna cleared her throat all eyes turned toward her she said solemnly i dontspeak spanish either but i understand a few words and muerto is one of them you told that woman something about being dead blaise corrected tonelessly i asked why arentyou dead draco broke the silence who told you she was dead sad brown eyes turned his way lucius came into the room and told me that if i stayed with you and overcame her dark spell with mine marisol would die face crumpling she admitted when i saw her tonight all i could think was how much i wished she had tears rolled down her face terry let go of her hand to encircle her with his arms draco mind was reeling his father had lucius really done that to blaise how had she lived with that secret for years he answered his own question slytherin were born keeping secrets concealing fears and weakness he heard ginny softly say his name numbly he raised his eyes to meet hers she looked pained but determined i have to know the truth about everything he ran tense fingers through his hair let go into the lounge i comfortable right here malfoy said roberts draco returned the challenging look with a level one it a long story i guarantee you ll want to be sitting down the others drifted down the corridor ginny with a lopsided attempt at a smile draco followed slowly trying to figure out what to say a n to go edina dontget miffed with me por favor dearest readers i couldnthelp the cliffie ending to the chapter draco made me sweetie darlings i promise it will be worth the wait cheers thanks bye for now chapter 35 on holiday i have to know the truth about marisol the spells everything didntask for much his girl just that he tell all that he d tried to forget draco studied the darkness beyond the wall of glass before glancing around the room terry and blaise were pressed together on one end of a long sofa with luna and wesley on the other in the chair across from his ginny sat quietly watching him restlessly tap his fingers if he hadntbeen a malfoy draco might have thought he was reluctant to begin his promised story he sat up straighter the heir to a proud pure blood family hesitated at nothing certainly not at recounting a simple tale why how many times had crabbe and goyle begged him to tell them another story whenever he was in a mood to recount one of his many exploits too many times to count boot cleared his throat draco broke off his internal dialogue reluctantly admitting that he was definitely on a mental tangent trying to stall the explanation he didntknow how to begin look i started this whole thing said blaise let me tell the first part when he nodded relieved she turned to boot you know that edina and narcissa have been best mates since our first year that december they threw a party for your birthday said boot blaise nodded and yule fiona and morrigan couldntcome i had no other friends except draco and he was happy to be the centre of attention feeling sorry for myself i pouted in the library snooping through books until i found one hidden inside another text what was the name of it asked roberts you dontwant to know i d looked through it before in the restricted section at school and there was a spell in it that i knew i could do what spell blaise bite her lip nervously at ginny and terry simultaneous question the eternal friendship spell draco tried to gauge ginny reaction she didntlook at him ordering the other girl tell me exactly what you did to perform that spell blaise haltingly described the ring of candles the wand waving and chanting to the four winds before pronouncing the finishing words to the spell boot said levelly flesh and blood you what touched each other skin and drank each other blood that right malfoy yes we pricked our fingers with a letter opener and placed our hands on each other shoulders draco thought that didntsound too bad he looked at ginny she was pressing her lips together his stomach twisted maybe it did he rushed into speech look we were two kids who wanted to be friends forever we ve never kissed much less had it off and the stupid spell didnthurt us he exhaled harshly in fact it saved me after i made the mistake of my life here after third year his girlfriend didntlook shocked something in her eyes said she knew where the story was headed draco wished he didnthave to say it i met a woman marisol she was older experienced and when she asked me to show her around i did ginny eyes closed blaise cried he didntwant to keep seeing that witch she used dark magic compelled him she took a shaky breath he was miserable i knew a way to break the spell so i used it mr malfoy came in while draco slept and told me marisol would die if i overcame her spell that why i thought she was dead the stark confession struck the room to silence ginny stared at the floor boot stared at blaise when you saw that she wasntdead why did you wish that she was because marisol hurt him she evil and i was afraid that she d try to get him back luna asked softly the words echoed in draco head making his skin crawl he could feel his girlfriend staring trying to catch his eye but this time he was the one examining floor tiles grimly keeping bad memories at bay ginny asked flatly tell me the truth blaise are you in love with draco no i love him he my friend and always will be but i in love with terry she threw her arms around her boyfriend who said baby dontcry gods dontcry i love you draco waited for ginny to say something anything when she didn t he stood opened one of the french doors to feel the cool breeze he rubbed a hand across his eyes when soft fingers touched his he pulled away still gazing sightlessly out into the night are you sure that you want to touch me you dontknow where these hands have been i dontcare a mirthless smile crossed his face you cared a few minutes ago grilling blaise about our little friendship spell no i didn t she started to speak and then stopped looking frustrated with the inability to express her feelings it was just what jealousy are you going to start hitting me every time my mate smiles the way granger does your brother he sneered will you begin wondering what i up to every time we re apart how will you be able to sleep at night thinking about it he sounded like his father lucius could get under anyone skin with cool insinuation draco expected accusations in return he was taken aback when ginny said that why i asked her if she was in love with you so i can deal with your close friendship and know once and for all that blaise is truly my friend too he could hear the sincerity in her voice feel her eyes searching for signs that he understood it was impossible to stay hurt and angry turning he wrapped his arms around ginny she stepped close her hands sliding around to stroke his back i love you so much she whispered draco closed his eyes while resting his cheek against her hair i love you too her hands made circles on his back he smoothed back bright strands and bent to bring his mouth to hers luna sweetheart we ve really got to fight so that we can make up sometime draco lifted his head to give a cheeky monkey an impatient glare it was a wasted effort roberts didntnotice asking his girlfriend what the matter luna she said i remember marisol saying that since blaise and draco werenta couple she was going to spill a little blood and see if an old friend came running draco felt his stomach drop he glanced down to see freckles standing out against the pallor of ginny face she whispered what are we going to do serenely as if suggesting they go have a cup of tea luna said how about a co ed slumber party an hour later draco lay on his right side an arm curved around ginny waist she brought his newly cut finger up to her mouth and kissed it on the middle bed terry stretched out with blaise curls resting on his chest wesley and luna cuddled on the last bed laughing softly after the candles were dimmed draco tolerated the sound of suppressed mirth for a few minutes before demanding what so funny over there in the dark he could hear the grin in a mercutio like voice nothing mate wonderful first he and tarzan were friendly and now a cheeky monkey wanted to make nice too draco remained silent deciding that cheetah was best ignored indecipherable whispers caused his lips to twist in irritation the least the others could do was speak up so that he could hear ginny shifted to face him and trace his lips with her fingers he slid his hand down the arm of her silky pyjama top glad that they d changed into nightclothes before bunking down in the girls bedroom her lips brushed his roguishly taking advantage of the concealing shadows draco deepened the kiss he was starting to really enjoy the co ed slumber party when the vague whispers turned into speech sounds people friends that are trying to sleep like innocent children should not be subjected to suggestive sounds roberts was two seconds away from getting that hex affecting private areas when ginny burst out giggling blaise terry luna and funny man wesley started laughing too reluctantly smiling draco turned away from the others his girl scooted back into position against his chest he draped his arm around ginny found her hand and entwined their fingers sweet dreams gee thanks malfoy you too a chuckle escaped refusing to encourage roberts any further draco said repressively goodnight rolling his eyes at the chorus of goodnights that followed draco smiled when his hand was lifted kissed and the voice that he loved most said sleepily goodnight love the first rays of morning sunshine crossed luna face making her turn into the warm body next to hers to escape the light drowsily she murmured yon light is not day light i know it the chest beneath her cheek vibrated with silent amusement wesley said huskily i have more care to stay than will to go let talk it is not day luna raised her head to meet bright blue eyes it is it is more light and light it grows she froze when a grumpy voice said why in the name of merlin are you two quoting romeo and juliet at this ungodly hour wesley golden hair rumpled adorably winked at her before answering the slytherin who seemed to have awakened on the wrong side of the bed you knew it was the bard quoted him yourself have you mate a long suffering sigh was exhaled before draco said none of your business and answer the question mate luna smiled to see her boyfriend rendered speechless by the shock of having the prince of slytherin call him mate his round eyes were so endearing she sat up in bed looking over to see draco brushing ginny hair away from her face i know we didntget a lot of sleep but we re supposed to go on a balloon ride this morning she reminded everyone jack knifing up from the middle bed blaise yelped globo magico we ve got she grabbed luna arm and peered at the watch with a rainbow on the middle of the face and a flying bluebird marking the seconds one bloody hour before our magic balloon ride takes off she shook terry shoulders baby wake up we donthave time for your sleeping cutie routine oh very well luna eyes widened she looked at ginny who looked equally intrigued by the idea of waking her boyfriend with a kiss a soft snore brought her attention back to wesley his eyes were now closed amused she leaned over and kissed him his mouth curved into a smile while his eyes stared into hers she giggled and kissed him again he pouted adorably when she pointed to the door go get dressed we ll meet you in the parlour in forty minutes once the guys had been pushed out the door literally in terry case luna beat the other girls to the shower she brushed her long hair while ginny took her turn in the lavatory and blaise made the beds with her wand she asked curiously i got the impression when you refused to go on the free fall ride that you re afraid of heights why do you want to go ballooning blaise shrugged it different somehow moving with the wind there no turbulence if i dontlook down i can pretend i just admiring the sky and never left the ground that made sense luna pulled on denims and the layers of shirt jumper and light jacket her friend had recommended the outer layers were borrowed from a selection minky had brought in from a wardrobe in another bedroom the ice blue colour of the cashmere garments made luna guess they were narcissa s a tiny empty bottle of vodka discovered in the jacket pocket confirmed it while she tied the laces of her trainers luna hid a smile when ginny chose a black jumper and poncho it seemed that she wasntthe only one who liked to match her boyfriend blaise picked out a red jumper with a denim jacket when they met the boys draco was dressed in black leather terry wore denim and wesley had on a light blue windbreaker the house elf appeared when you is landing breakfast is served blaise said thank you minky one by one the friends flooed to globo magico in a large open field beside the small house that served as home and office a witch and two wizards were inflating three hot air balloons with their wands blaise told them that unlike the muggle variety these multicoloured balloons werentsolely at the mercy of the wind that was very reassuring so was the calm gentle breeze luna hopped into a basket with the pilot a short haired capable older woman named katia and wesley nervously she clung to the railing with a tight grip the wicker wall between her and the slowly increasing space to the ground didntseem very sturdy anxiety rose until strong arms encircled and a cheerful voice teased the view of the countryside is almost as beautiful as you are buttercup luna relaxed and started to enjoy the ride it was like being part of the sky the sun had already risen in the east but traces of soft colours remained far below the landscape looked like a tapestry she could see a few tiny muggle vehicles winding their way along the ribbon like roads aside from a whoosh from magicked blasts of hot air the silence was mesmerising luna tilted her head to smile at wesley she didntknow where they were headed and didntcare if they ever came down gradually descending to an open field the balloon landed gently katia laughed at the dazed expressions of her passengers while they helped with milking or squeezing the air out of the balloon let your minds drift along with el globo eh that good you ll be back they met the others in the middle of the field where the house elf had transported the gauzy pavilion and all its accoutrements the three pilots were amazed by such luxury in a rural setting but quickly accepted the invitation to breakfast a lorry rumbled up the driver hopped out and gestured to the deflated balloons his associates shook their heads and waved him over calling that work could wait luna lifted her flute of champagne in the traditional toast to celebrate a safe landing one of the other pilots tonio said a balloonist prayer of thanks the winds have welcomed you with their softness the sun has blessed you with his warm hands you have flown so high and so well that the gods have joined with you in laughter and returned you gently back into the loving arms of mother earth a short while later luna picked up what looked like a fried donut stick and took a hesitant bite it was good wesley wiped sugar crystals off her mouth and brought his finger to his mouth mmm sweet i ll have to try a churro myself mischievously luna picked up a piece of fruit and took a bite wesley murmured the strawberries look delicious too across the table katia dark eyes sparkled with humour when she told the group these two should take up ballooning they re naturals wesley shook his head modestly that made luna suspicious the dimples that deepened made her expect outrageousness even before he said i dontknow about being a natural unless it natural to think ballooning like kissing tranquillity mixed with an exciting rush of adrenaline si blaise and ginny giggled at the spaniards hearty approval luna kept smiling serenely when the conversation moved to other topics wesley said i didn t er embarrass you with my little analogy did i no i practicing tranquillity so when we get back to the casa you can help me with that exciting rush of adrenaline you were talking about the look on wesley face made her laugh out loud and pop a berry into his open mouth after the house elf returned to magically clear everything away and obligingly whisk the ballooning apparatus onto the lorry katia handed out broomsticks on the return flight to globo magico ginny laughed when draco yelled these old things make cleansweeps look like firebolts she called back better keep your mouth shut if you dontwant bugs in your teeth his lips immediately closed together slowly but surely they made it back and flooed to the casa catching draco elegantly suppressing a yawn ginny said why dontwe take two siestas today wesley hustled luna out of the room so fast terry said dryly he must really be sleepy blaise winked at ginny i tired too she tugged her boyfriend toward the side door terry grinned okay sleeping beauty i coming ginny watched draco curl his lip adorably at the other couple romantic by play she asked did you want me to wake you with a kiss this morning too instantly cool composure replaced envious disdain why do you ask did you want to wake me with a kiss yes so why didntyou a wave of pink washed over her face i was shy grey eyes narrowed you ve kissed me behind every bloody statue at school on my lap in the broomsticks and in the middle of a crowded dance floor and you were shy he was a typical slytherin twisting everything around she nodded while moving toward the bedroom corridor i was shy she giggled when draco repeated matter of factly she was shy he caught up to her in the archway that not the way to our hammock ginny took a deep breath i know i dontwant to siesta on the hammock i want to sleep in your old room he looked startled then angry before a mask of indifference settled over classically handsome features all right this way striding ahead of her he walked past the bedroom the boys were sharing to stop at the last one before the lounge he waved her inside gesturing to the double bed want to sleep on blaise side the room was stark with only a few framed drawings on whitewashed walls ginny refused to rise to the bait she walked over and looked at the art the first picture was a large charcoal rendition of the casa it was brilliant tiny initials caught her eye they were draco s her gaze flickered to his face he said why the surprise you ve known since halloween that i could draw the intricate celtic designs carved into a giant gourd came to mind she confessed i forgot distracted by your other talents i guess the only other drawings hung over the bed she moved nearer to peer at them closely the one on the left was another charcoal drawing it depicted a girl with short curly hair putting the finishing touches on a sandcastle involuntarily her eyes moved over blaise body no my best mate didnthave curves back then but i think i captured her striking features and those long legs he was standing behind her reaching past her shoulder to tap the other drawing i think she did a better job at sketching me not technically but in terms of raw feeling dontyou agree ginevra that silky drawl wasnttrying to entice her to turn around and snog him it was calculated to insinuate to goad and she wasntgoing to fall for his manipulation instead ginny leaned closer to examine the sketch of a boy who had just awakened from sleeping on his stomach he was bare to the waist a sleepy smile curving his lips and lighting his eyes it wasntan example of perfect technique but draco was right there was a depth of feeling to it that compelled the eye to linger a quality his superior drawing lacked quietly she repeated something he d said to her earlier blaise side which one was it the one farthest away from the door ginny slipped off the black poncho and jumper kicking off her flats to lay down in her own black tee and denims draco stripped to a black tee and trousers but continued to stand at the foot of the bed staring down at her she said if blaise had a side then she slept in this bed more than once that means that either she was afraid of something or you were which was it he sat at the opposite side of the bed she was afraid someone kept trying to enter her room at night who his eyes were flinty my father most likely i wouldntput it past him he frowned at her expression lucius may be a lot of things but a paedophile isntone of them i figured out a long time ago that he was trying to push us together it didntwork draco finally lay down beside her staring at the ceiling she studied the profile that was so handsome it literally hurt to think of someone else touching it he said i should ve known that he d just try harder marisol was another one of his pawns father not all knowing i d like to think he wouldnthave brought her round if he d known what she was capable of lucius malfoy didntseem overflowing with parental warmth the few times ginny had seen him in fact she remembered vividly watching through ominoculars during one quidditch match when draco fell off his broom his father had appeared livid at the boy failure to catch the snitch not concerned that his only child might be hurt abruptly the eyes gazing at the ceiling shifted to capture hers she tried not to flinch when he spat want to hear the gory details no his drawl was classic malfoy cold and spiteful really then why d you drag me into this room what bloody damn good is hearing how sad and pathetic my life was does it make you want to kiss the pain away he rolled over and pinned her down kissing her roughly ginny embraced him as tight as she could when he pulled back she said simply i wanted to come into this room to show you that i love you and nothing in your past is going to change that his face was so tormented that tears rolled down her cheeks draco buried his face against her neck she could feel his breath hitch unevenly but he didntcry maybe he couldn t time passed eventually he rolled to his side the look in his eyes made her heart turn over gods ginny i a bastard and i dontdeserve you but i love you and nothing is going to change that either the kiss that followed was gentle and loving she rested her head against draco chest his fingers stroked her hair more and more slowly until the caress stopped and she realised her boyfriend had fallen asleep ginny watched him until her eyes grew heavy and her head lolled to the side pssst ginny draco wake up she woke up and saw red her hair had fallen into her face ginny shoved it out of her eyes blinking at the girl standing in the doorway hey blaise what time is it time for you two to get up and go change we re going to cesares again on the mopeds i need draco to remind terry that muggles get grumpy when you exceed the 110 kph speed limit draco opened his eyes arentyou going to hassle us about the rules haventyou heard i think rules are made to be broken blaise said as she backed down the corridor ginny asked the boy beside her is that what you think too he shook his head no i think they dontapply to me ginny laughter faded when she saw his smile it reminded her of something she twined her fingers with his and then lifted them over his head leaning over him she reminded with a smirk i believe i told you that i going to hold you down and snog you he raised his head toward hers wouldntwant to call you a liar when we promised to tell the truth she kissed him until chiselled lips parted and his tongue glided against hers before someone else came and reminded them of house rules ginny broke the kiss draco saw her smug expression and asked what the look for she winked i hope you enjoyed that because i going to have to do it again what i actually said was i going to hold you down and snog you on the hammock so next siesta you re going to have to make an honest woman of me ginny strutted out of the room with low pleased laughter following her down the corridor is that what you re wearing to the fiesta it so pretty blaise gaze travelled from the beautifully tailored white dress to the redhead eyeing the crystal detailing she said no this is what you re wearing dontargue the dress is bespelled to size itself to fit perfectly she tossed the gown into the other girl arms reaching down to lift a pair of shoes using what luna called her snake charmer voice she tempted peep toe white leather stiletto pumps with gold tone and enamel d g logo buckles dolce gabbana confident that she had her friend at designer the girl smirked dolce gabbana stregone amiga charmed to fit with comfort and support try them on blaise moved toward the wardrobe to find something else to wear the white dress would look gorgeous with fiery hair and freckles but not on her she d look like a little girl on her way to communion that was papa called it the upcoming meeting with her father estranged family was making her nervous the last couple of days had been so hectic what with cleaning skeletons out of closets between holiday jaunts that she hadntthought about what the romero family would think of her until a few hours ago that gown she d picked out was perfect for making a good impression but it wasnther nearby luna was staring doubtfully at her reflection in a cheval mirror do you think this outfit is too colourful the light green cardigan and camisole paired with a tiered skirt in multi colours was stunning blaise said so and ginny seconded the opinion you look great what kind of earrings are you wearing luna fingered the gold coins hanging from hooks doubloons wesley once told me that i was a pirate because i stole his heart blaise was glad luna had picked wesley over harry bloody potter what morrigan saw in the boy other than intense green eyes and a cool scar she didntknow he was always sulking and brooding and not attractively like draco either once in potions when they d both been getting ingredients out of the storage cupboard she d heard potter muttering to mr freckles about what a git snape was impulsively pretending that she needed to ask the professor a question blaise had drifted by potter table surreptitiously adding a drop of hellebore to his cauldron when professor snape denigrated potter ability to read the directions while making the failed draught of peace vanish blaise had giggled snape had whirled around met her eyes and done something that still had the power to make her heart skip a beat in memory his lips had curved ever so briefly into a smile dontsigh we ll find you something to wear said luna unwilling to admit the true reason for her sighing blaise stood back and let her friends rifle through her clothes most of them she d never seen before had eddy and cissy hit fashion week the two girls conferred over several dresses before ginny pulled out a dress they both agreed was fab blaise smiled over her mother favourite word slithering into her mates vocabulary good choice i ll wear it the dress had a halter top of navy silk with a full skirt in tiers of navy aqua and green ending several inches above the knee she could tell terry liked it by the stunned expression on his face blaise liked the way he looked in black wesley looked enviously at luna colourful skirt tell me again why girls get to wear any colour they like but we re stuck looking like crows draco lips twitched the romeros are an old traditional family if you walk in wearing a psychedelic shirt blaise grandfather will consider it and you feminine wesley grumbled but he didntrush out to change and fight for his right to wear colour luna held his hand and patted it consolingly he grinned next to blaise terry ran his fingers down her bare back how am i supposed to make a good impression on your family if i cantkeep my hands off you she smiled and smoothed back his hair dontworry about them just remember that you re going to make a great impression on me his chuckle followed her into the fireplace giving her the ability to say almost steadily hacienda romero stepping out of the enormous stone fireplace in andalusia blaise gaze was drawn immediately to a man sitting on an ornately carved chair facing her he looked nothing like her father vicente romero reminded her of a hawk all lean harsh planes and angles one hand held a silver topped cane the other extended regally to her involuntarily she smiled did he expect her to kiss his ring or something walking forward she clasped his fingers in a courtly gesture the old man kissed her hand you are your father daughter i saw enrique impudence in your smile when her great grandfather rose from the chair she looked into fathomless dark eyes that showed a trace of amusement pertly she kissed his cheek gracias eres muy amable did i hear correctly abuelo did you really say something kind a short stocky man with a friendly smile walked into the room he embraced her warmly welcome home ni a i your father cousin enzo call me cousin too thank you cousin enzo the gregarious man asked to be introduced to her friends his smile faded for a moment when he realised terry was her boyfriend but enzo soon recovered his affable charm grandfather and i would like to show you yeguada romero our family has been breeding what you would call andalusian horses for centuries gesturing for them to follow her cousin informed while leading them along cool dim corridors homer in his illiad praised the pura raza espanola your english duke of newcastle wrote that it is the noblest horse in the world the most beautiful that can be instinctively blaise reached for terry hand when they crossed a grand portal to step outside this imposing home with its severe whitewashed fa ade was where her father had grown up he had gazed across these manicured lawns played under the olive trees ridden through those meadows surrounded by andalusian hills not once had enrique mentioned his childhood or his family in spain to the one he d made in england she didntknow what to think about that her grandfather kept slanting assessing glances her way blaise made sure to appear interested while enzo rattled off his spiel about the superior lineage and impeccable training of their stock while guiding them around the stud farm most of the strongly built yet elegant horses she saw grazing in pastures or being trained in sanded or turfed rings were white some were grey and a few black in a far pasture two riders caught her attention they were galloping toward a small group of bulls here use my omnioculars absently thanking her cousin blaise focused on the men after a few moments she gasped they just knocked down a couple of bulls with poles what in merlin name are they playing at she handed the omnioculars to terry who raised them to his eyes to see for himself her great grandfather gave a rusty sounding chuckle your cousin diego and alanzo are practicing for the upcoming acoso y derribo competition what does that mean luna asked her calm interest merited a half smile we prefer to use the definition of the art of bull running on horseback the garrocha or wooden pole has been long been used to work the fierce bulls of spain applying pressure behind the hipbone tips the bull but does not harm terry said he right blaise the bulls stood right back up one even went after one of the riders he offered the omnioculars to draco the other boy nodded his thanks i cantimagine a businessman like enrique zabini tipping bulls vicente waved them back toward the hacienda come you will see inside what looked to be an office the walls were covered with pictures of horses and riders along with numerous awards for various competitions stiffly walking over to a photograph framed in dark wood the silver haired man took it off the wall and handed it to his great grand daughter her friends crowded around together they watched a young man accept a silver trophy cup and hold it up while those around him applauded at sixteen enrique was the youngest to win acoso y deribo greatest honour the championship of seville my grandson made the house of romero proud that day gravely the old spaniard added your father was obedient respectful until his visit to england when he came back enrique had changed duty no longer meant anything to him and responsibility familia was less than nothing it was something to be left behind and forgotten an older woman with the air of a housekeeper stood in the doorway i beg your pardon senor romero but the guests have begun to arrive vicente inclined his head i will be there to greet them shortly pia ensure that the rest of the staff has all in readiness brusquely he told them i must go greet our friends and family but feel free to stay and view the photographs of enrique there are many of them nodding regally the aristocratic old man left with the woman trailing in his wake terry arm slid around blaise waist are you okay blaise shrugged they stepped forward to examine the photographs encircling the walls her great grandfather had not been exaggerating the back wall in particular held many pictures of her father with large groups of family at work around the yeguada riding in competition and accepting trophies there something about these photographs that bother me but i cantquite put my finger on it wesley said luna pointed i think it that enrique never smiles blaise scanned the photos again luna was right her father face was solemn in every picture not true lovegood here one of zabini smiling draco handed blaise a small photograph of a young boy laughing with a curly haired older woman ginny said the woman looks a lot like you is that your great grandmother reaching out a fingertip blaise touched the face of the only relative her father had ever told her stories about sophia zabini was the one who wanted a summer home on la costa de la luz who designed the courtyard and left the home to my father when she died actually cousin mi abuela left the home to you along with a trust that your father was to administrate enzo wearing a tailored black suit smiled at the surprise on her face moving forward he said i take it that this is news when she stared blankly he invited the others the fiesta has begun may i show you to the terrace where refreshments are being served if you will wait uno momento blaise i will return and show you sophia bedroom there is a portrait of tu abuela that you should see terry stays her cousin escorted the two other couples out of the room once they were alone blaise flung herself into terry embrace he held her protectively an amused voice said lo siento sorry to interrupt but when i saw my father leading your friends to the bar i offered to take you upstairs myself diego romero smile was extremely white against his dark olive complexion holding terry hand blaise followed him along spartanly elegant corridors and up a grand staircase to a bedchamber that reminded her of her own the dark ornately carved furniture the tapestries and rugs enrique must have wanted her to appreciate her heritage although he d never spoken about it over the mantel of the fireplace across from the bed hung a full length portrait of a young woman in a formal white gown sophia i see the resemblance but you re more beautiful said terry diego chuckled i think that the old man hoped to make a match between us kissing cousins so you ve made me extremely happy by bringing your friend along my girlfriend daria is the jealous type she shook her head i didntget that impression great grandfather seemed more intent on sharing how my father turned his back on family duty the full laugh that statement caused made her and terry exchange baffled glances romero explained gran abuelo i meant my father sheepishly he added no offence prima but he really misses that beach house our family spent holidays there every year until until sophia died and willed the home to a great granddaughter that she d never met had the woman hoped to reconcile vicente and enrique blaise felt a smile tug her lips to think her cousin enzo loved the house enough to marry his son off to gain it if sol y sombra is really mine then you can tell your father that the family will always be welcome he grinned let go tell him now blaise waved him ahead with the promise that they d be down in a moment when the other man left she trailed her fingers over the things on the dresser impulsively she headed toward the enormous four poster bed what are you doing propped up against the satin covered pillows she smiled at terry i dontknow i guess i wanted to lie on the bed where sophia used to read my father stories after his parents were killed in a boating accident she became a second mother to him patting the counterpane beside her she coaxed come here baby he glanced uneasily at the door before slowly walking over to lie beside her shifting to her side blaise wound her fingers in long silken hair and sought his mouth with hers the visit had raised questions that only her father could answer and she didntwant to think about him right now at this moment she only wanted to feel terry strong body and his warm fingers stroking the bare skin of her back several sweet deep kisses later the couple parted and smilingly made their way downstairs this is a back terrace terry said humorously on a grand scale strings of faery lights glowed softly around the enormous tiled area leading to magnificent formal gardens to one side a band of musicians played a lively folk tune at the far end tables and chairs were colourfully decorated the crowd of people assembled was divided into small groups most were milling around talking but some were dancing a fair haired couple were turning and whirling to the amusement of those around them wesley bent luna back over his arm dashingly near the other couple blaise saw ginny lean close to draco and say something he lifted an eyebrow before dipping her so dramatically that fiery tresses brushed the tiles in a manner worthy of a spaniard her friend leaned down to kiss his girlfriend masterfully applause broke out blaise and terry exchanged smiles pulling terry hand with an eagerness that made him chuckle blaise led him through the crowd to join the dance a n the i was shy scene was inspired by splash if you haventever seen tom hanks say you were shy to his mermaid girlfriend rent it or watch it the next time the film shows up on cable it hilarious the magic balloon ride and wizard owned yeguada horse stud were fun to research the balloonist prayer is anonymous but i thankful to whoever wrote it and even more thankful to readers who review special note i can still remember august of 04 and the oh crap feeling in the pit of my stomach when i learned rowling had posted ginny birthday on her website as august 11th i had written a great many matchmaker chapters and needed ginny birthday to fall over easter holiday not the end of summer holiday since ginny birthday wasntcelebrated or mentioned in the books only on jo site i chose to keep her birthday as is and tell any who asked did you know yes i did lol now that there is an official canon sixth year i hope readers will accept the alternate birthday along with the alternate story written pre hbp but edited afterwards the title is taken from the song sung by the stray cats in the film sixteen candles chapter 36 sixteen candles i dontwant this holiday to end luna thought with a heartfelt sigh she stood on the sun terrace watching the sun rise above the ocean this was their last day at the casa tomorrow they would floo home and spend the remaining days of break with their families before heading back to school she felt bad for not wanting to spend time with her father and his new friend it was selfish to want him to remain faithful to the memory of her mother forever acknowledging that didntchange luna feelings you re up early hey what the matter warm fingers brushed the tear off her cheek before pulling her into a hug she leaned against her boyfriend and confessed miserably i was thinking about daddy somehow knowing he dating makes me feel like i ve lost my mother all over again his arms tightened around her when she began to cry luna was grateful that he didntspout platitudes or offer advice he just stroked her back and held her close to his heart wesley led them over to a hammock in the far corner of the terrace as pillows went his chest was a bit too firm for true comfort but she wouldnthave moved her head for all the duck feathers in the world the gentle rocking motion of the hammock soothed almost as much as the fingertips sifting through her hair eventually she looked up into sympathetic eyes he asked feeling better are we his curved lips and deep dimples were so cute so was that raised golden eyebrow luna said we wesley smile turned impish well when you re unhappy that makes me sad so if you re feeling less so then i happier too that was so sweet her lips parted while she lifted her mouth toward his c mon red it our last day i say we siesta six times if we want to luna jerked violently like a little girl caught being naughty the motion caused the surface of the hammock to tilt she slid off atop wesley who laughed what in the blazes are you two playing at draco demanded matter of factly as possible luna said dontask and i wonttell ginny snorted with amusement and tugged her boyfriend hand let go grab the hammock by the pool luna waved goodbye while she attempted to untangle her legs from wesley s it proved impossible he wouldntlet her go and my what attractive legs he had felt good too rubbing against hers on the cool tiles she braced her hands on either side of wesley smiling face and kissed him enthusiastically donttake malfoy growling my hammock now ape man personally baby i sure that this one is perfectly nice too ooohhh blaise exclamation prodded luna to point toward the french doors the couple had just walked through my hammock go now hands raised terry grinned fine musical hammocks it is luna watched the other couple duck back into the house a hand waved in front of her face how about we try kissing on a soft surface this time wesley grinned he pulled luna to her feet slid an arm around her waist and waltzed her toward the hammock after a leisurely breakfast the friends decided to return to tarifa this time they took the mopeds and drove to the wizard section of the public beach luna told wesley once they parked i not up for windsurfing again i just want to lie in the sun and enjoy the view i want to sunbathe too said ginny why dontthe rest of you join us after a sail the group staked out a spot with an enormous beach blanket before the boys and blaise went to rent windsurfing rigs lying on her stomach enjoying the gentle breeze luna pillowed her cheek on an arm i going to miss this place me too ginny sighed most of what i ll miss will be spending time with draco i canthelp thinking that makes me a bad person straight faced luna said it does she giggled when ginny shot back like you donthave it bad for wesley luna sighed i have it very bad and it feels very good she contemplated the sunlight sparkling on the ocean through half closed lids time passed in a pleasant daze cool drops of water hitting her warmed skin made luna startle rolling over she smiled up at the boy blocking the sun have a good time yeah it was great at the end we had a laugh too giving blaise a ride on her board blaise dropped down to the blanket beside luna leaning back on her elbows laughing i felt like cleopatra being carried by her big strong bodyguards it was fab terry stretched out beside his girlfriend that bloke waiting by the surf shop stared so hard i thought his eyes would pop out wesley lay on his side facing luna he kidded his best mate good thing he left before you could finish muttering that hex his expression changed from joking to serious when he promised luna if a bloke ever stares at you like that he going to regret it buttercup she reached out to trace his lips with a fingertip i love it when you go dread pirate roberts think it sexy hmmm she nodded solemnly he chuckled blaise gasped stars and stones i forgot about the gillyweed she reached for a carryall taking out a small package she handed a small salty smelling ball to everyone the couples left the blanket for the ocean luna felt her heartbeat quicken wading into the sea with a golden haired pirate she pretended the gillyweed was a delicacy to mermaids and not rubbery icky ness wesley grimaced it seemed that his imagination wasntup to the task of making the mass palatable when they sank together into the clear blue depths it felt like sinking into a dream the mermaid swam toward the pirate who had stolen her heart he was diving down to look at a vividly coloured fish ever since she had used the enchantment to enable him to breathe underwater the human had been fascinated with her world he loved to explore the coral reefs and wrecks especially his white grin would flash whenever they discovered gold and other treasure she smiled whenever she discovered something new about kissing sometimes when he rested upon the soft moss of her grotto her handsome pirate would tell stories about the wonders to be found on land his face would light up and that pleasant voice she loved to listen to would ring with such passion she longed to explore that strange world with him a slender hand rose to touch the pearls around her neck could she really leave the sea her people she stretched out both hands her love took them in his with an inquiring look smiling the mermaid propelled them toward the distant shore flipper like feet keeping her treading water a few metres away from wesley the vision became reality her pirate was lifting an eyebrow his merry blue eyes silently asking daydreaming again she nodded ruefully while swimming forward tracing his features with webbed fingers luna smiled even with blue tinted skin he was incredibly handsome she was so lucky being with him was worth leaving her father worth everything his lips felt cold and yet they warmed hers kissing him underwater felt like being in a bubble they drifted together with the gentle current mouths fused legs entwined long blonde strands floated in a curtain around them blocking the view of the underwater world uncaring eyes closed luna was absorbed in the kiss eventually the bubble popped she swam to the surface and took in deep gulps of air wesley treaded water beside her he asked what were you daydreaming about this time she said the mermaid decided to leave the sea to be with her love something male and primitive gleamed in his eyes he swam forward and kissed her they sank beneath the water a few moments later they returned to the surface laughing the experience wasntthe same without the aid of gillyweed although it was still very sweet they floated on their backs holding hands as they slowly propelled themselves toward shore on three sides of the old farmhouse table three girls stood staring at each other apprehensively ginny gaze hardened with resolve someone needed to make the first move she was willing to take a chance risk life and limb wait knife paused above the cutting board ginny told blaise we agreed to make dinner by hand on our last night i want the extra credit in muggle studies so watch me and you ll see that it not much different from potion making again the blade descent was stopped by a sharp stop ginny made an effort not to snap what the problem looking embarrassed blaise said this reminds me of a novel i read once like water for chocolate when the girl cooked her emotions permeated the food she bit her lip if we make this dinner in the wrong mood our last night together could be ruined you dontseriously believe the expression on blaise face said that she did luna said where does the term culinary magic or kitchen witch come from i d rather be safe than sorry she smiled at blaise what should we do no clue it muggle got any ideas ginny at home mum listens to happy music in the kitchen want to look through the orpheus orbs we could try that too in the lounge the trio stopped a moment to enjoy the view on the beach the boys were tossing the sphere wesley brought to the casa a frisbee ginny watched draco impressive musculature shift to catch and throw the sphere she noticed the other girls appreciated different aspects of the scenery and giggled after a few minutes they walked over to consider the collection of orbs hidden inside a cabinet ginny lifted one out the beatles greatest hits they ve loads of upbeat songs back in the rustic kitchen ginny placed the orb on the table and gave it a spin the song nowhere man played she smiled weakly lifted the orb and rotated again this time hey jude projected luna asked should i try ginny and blaise both said yes after the next spin music poured out cheerfully assuring that the girl had the singer love eight days a week ginny began cutting the stems from the leaves of swiss chard in rhythm with the song she sang off key while slicing the stems on the diagonal and cutting the leaves into thin slivers luckily they ate the biggest meal in the middle of the day the one they prepared now was lighter and easier to conjure or cook salad parador was named after a restored castle in andalusia they had visited the magnificent structure and admired the moorish tile work the view of the olive trees creating a patchwork quilt out of the valley below had been breathtaking along with a bottle of olive oil ginny had asked for the recipe for the salad she d ordered at the parador restaurant the shrimp and vegetable salad seemed easy to prepare on the huge antique that had never been used for actual cookery minky had charmed one of the burners to act like a muggle appliance luna with an enviable confidence heated olive oil in a large skillet and added garlic ginny added the chard and watched it be saut ed to soften before being set aside another spin of the orb resulted in a second lively tune spilling into the kitchen ginny hummed along while trimming the ends off thin green beans they were cooked until crisp tender and added to the chard blaise had been peeling shrimp she added them to a skillet with cherry tomatoes and thyme and gestured for ginny to shake the skillet to cook the shrimp the three friends sang along to yellow submarine after the girls divided the chard leaves tossed with balsamic vinegar among six plates they topped each with crisp beans and saut ed chard stems the shrimp and tomatoes were arranged on top luna sprinkled a few olives while blaise added a sprig of thyme each of the friends carried two plates to the courtyard table the boys showered and waiting hungrily duly admired the salad once the salad was eaten draco asked what the next course three sets of feminine eyes met in a panic ginny rose she told her fellow chefs let take the plates back to the kitchen and bring out the entr e in the kitchen blaise said what entr e ginny shoved dirty plates into the kitchen sink hell if i know luna said calmly why dontwe ask minky to help the house elf must have been listening inside the pantry to pop out so suddenly with only a trace of a smirk she asked is my assistance required the unanimous yes was heard with a toothy smile minky said i will conjure andalusian steak rollos if that is acceptable relieved ginny returned to the courtyard she giggled when after tasting the beef draco complimented her cooking skills as just as good as a house elf s luna heard her and started giggling as well blaise sputtered with amusement and soon the secret was out and their boyfriends were laughing too once the plates were cleared away ginny became aware that draco was watching the arched doorway expectantly she followed his gaze and saw drinky and minky carrying an enormous cake lit with candles torn between laughter and tears she listened as the group sang happy birthday to you ginny said i didntexpect this my birthday not until next week silver eyes smiled into hers the girl heart turned over wesley said puckishly sixteen candles make a lovely light but i think you re supposed to blow them out to receive a wish with a racing heart she made a wish before blowing the candles out after wild applause minky cut the cake drinky extended a basket full of presents ginny said oh no you shouldnthave draco gave her a look that stopped her half hearted protests when she reached for a festively wrapped package he said gruffly they re not much just tokens really intrigued by his expression she opened the first present it was a spyglass from wesley she smiled her thanks and reached for another luna gave her a lace mantilla terry gift was an orb of spanish guitar music ginny expressed her appreciation and opened the rectangular flat gift from blaise it was a small painting of a white village i love it she said i ll put it on my desk and look at it every day i glad but that not the real present blaise fingers pressed what had seemed to be an imperfection in the grain of the wood the frame sprang open revealing two hidden frames inside one was empty the other held a sketch of a couple lying on a hammock they looked happy and in love the couple was ginny and draco on several mornings blaise and draco had quietly sketched together out on the sun terrace ginny had never asked to see what they were working on in the back of her mind she d been afraid that they were sketching each other placing the opened frame carefully on the table she squeezed her friend in a big hug guess you like it huh she nodded and looked toward draco he held out a flat rectangular present her stomach somersaulted trembling fingers unveiled another sketch of her face the image held ginny transfixed was she this beautiful this animated merlin she was glad he saw her this way it beyond beautiful ginny said with a misty smile there a depth of feeling choked up she could only hand blaise the sketch while she kissed her boyfriend to express everything that words couldntsay on the opposite side of the table wesley mused after we devour this delicious looking cake if a person wanted to innocently sleep out under the stars on their birthday would that be considered breaking the rules terry smiled i dontthink so blaise winked that person would need someone to keep them company luna nodded serenely the stars dontshine as brightly without someone to share them with draco looked taken aback but then recovered to smile cut the cake birthday girl with a last look at her sketches ginny closed the frame and placed the painting gently aside smiling widely she stood and served the cake later lying with draco on the hammock placed in the middle of the sun terrace the stars seemed brighter than any ginny had ever seen before the voice that made her shiver whispered in her ear ready for your other birthday present happy that the starlit darkness concealed her blush she nodded a teasingly light kiss was pressed to her eyelids that was an angel kiss you re getting sixteen different ones so fifteen more to go he took her face in his hands and held her gently while fluttering his eyelashes against hers her stomach fluttered too what was that she asked shakily butterfly kiss lifting her hand to his lips the hand kiss was followed by a finger kiss which involved kissing and sucking each digit she sighed when he kissed her earlobe cheek jawline neck and collarbone the muscles in ginny abdomen flexed when his fingers raised her top and caressed them a startled oh left her lips when his lowered to her bellybutton the sensation of his breath blowing where he had softly kissed gave her the shivers and made her giggle draco tongue darted around and into her belly button before kissing and nibbling her stomach ginny clenched her fingers in his hair he chuckled and lifted his shirt to align his belly button with hers that brought their faces into perfect alignment after frustrating her with an eskimo kiss and pecking nipping and licking her lips from the outside to the inside rain cloud eyes opened he stared into her eyes the slow intimate kiss made her long for a deeper one her eyelids closed in anticipation when draco murmured french kiss ginny knew why this was called the soul kiss it felt like she was offering her life and soul with the exchange of breath and meeting of mouths and tongues the best present she received was the knowledge that he was offering his to her in return long deep kisses later draco sucked on her tongue making her gasp i think that more than sixteen different types of kisses he tickled her while she was laughing he kissed her again and then smiled in the way that she loved dontyou want a few more to grow on ginny nodded eagerly the hours that we have spent when we have chid the hasty footed time for parting us the words from midsummer night dream came to mind while blaise watched draco kiss ginny for the last time earlier in their room when the girls had said their farewells a lump had risen in her throat it was still there making her voice husky with suppressed emotion draco nodded to the others and strode outside luna and then wesley stepped into the fireplace when only terry remained blaise tried to smile terry smile was crooked i ll mirror you tonight let you know how much i miss you pulling her into a hug he said it going to be hard to sleep without you beside me last night when ginny and draco retired to spend the night gazing at the stars the other two couples had gone for a swim in the pool afterwards wesley had commented wryly partings may be sweet sorrow but i not much on sorrow luna said then let not part there no reason we canthave another co ed slumber party they had all agreed to meet in the boys chamber this time the beds were kept separated without a ring of candles the enveloping darkness had made curling against terry side less comforting and more exciting he had shifted to face her lips brushing across her cheek to find her mouth one hand cupped the nape of her neck while the other slipped under her pyjama top and slid upwards blaise heart and insides had melted when his mouth moved to kiss and lick her neck before lightly sucking she had breathed softly for his ears only dontgive me a love bite there after her boyfriend had returned to his family she remained staring into the empty fireplace absently rubbing the spot on her chest that proved last night wasnta dream the mark didnthurt he d been gentle but the memory made her heart ache at the thought of the days that would pass slowly until they were together again ruefully laughing at her hufflepuff sentimentality blaise stepped out the side door she saw draco leaning against a pergola post gazing out at the garden and sea beyond she stood beside him together they silently contemplated the view and the realisation that this interlude was over she bumped her shoulder into his i drew a second sketch of you and ms freckles on the hammock she wearing your favourite leopard print bikini in this one want it he pushed her toward the house damn right i do hours later at dinner eddy and cissy who had returned to london from morocco went on and on about their abfab holiday more accurately eddy chattered constantly while cissy inserted the occasional acid remark neither seemed very interested in what their children had done on holiday other than the off hand you re looking gorgeously tanned sweetie darling you had fun eh edina asked no questions about how her daughter had spent her time blaise thought about their friends families deluging them with questions about what activities they had done interesting places they had seen exotic food they d eaten she met draco resigned gaze and rolled her eyes maybe they had it better than they knew in the middle of the night when her father burst into her room she revised her opinion what wrong papa blaise asked enrique activated the illumination orbs i have received a letter from my esteemed abuelo visibly upset he held up a sheet of parchment reading aloud my great granddaughter was kind enough to give me your direction seeing her was like gazing upon my beloved sophia again the family was very happy to meet blaise you have much to be proud of in your daughter perhaps you will accompany her on another visit one day he threw the letter down stalking over to where she stood beside the bed what have you done she shook her head i met your cousin enzo son in a club vicente owled an invitation to a fiesta i went the romeros are good people i dontunderstand why you never told me about them bitter laughter filled the air good people furious dark eyes burned into hers baby girl those good people tried to force me into a mould of their making and when i chose another path abuelo threw me out to make my own way what could she say that was years ago cantyou forgive them forgive your grandfather enrique intense features twisted that man wanted me to leave your mother tell her to abort our child so the romero line would stay pura raza espanol like those damned horses stepping back he vowed before he left i will never forgive that and i will sell the casa they love so much before i allow my daughter to be contaminated by such a family for the second time that day blaise stood staring off after being left alone draco came into the room i heard the shouting are you all right her pain filled eyes gave the answer he hugged her how about we sleep on the sofas in the lounge mind reeling with conflicting thoughts and feelings she docilely allowed herself to be led downstairs the next morning blaise resolved to take action she understood her father anger and pain but she wasntgoing to hate the family along with him they had changed and she was willing to forgive past mistakes she reassured draco that she was fine and he should go on to the quidditch supply centre after breakfast she headed to the library papa was long gone in the safe hidden behind a section of false books there was a folder labelled blaise documents inside proved that sophia zabini romero had indeed left her a trust that included sol y sombra other papers caught her eye it seemed her parents had set up an account for her scanning the statement detailing the amount of company profits funnelled into it she whistled softly two particular documents caught her eye one was a form authorising her to control the account previously administered by her parents the date was left open they must have planned to sign over the fund after she finished school the other parchment was a copy of a letter enrique had sent this morning to a realtor in seville he was authorising the sale of his casa on la costa de la luz papa would forge her signature allowing the transaction no doubt her lips curved she was two steps ahead of him deftly forging enrique signature to the emancipation document blaise gathered the deed to the house along with most of the other data a quick spell copied the papers she put duplicates of everything except the deed back into the file and closed the safe upstairs her mother was resistant to waking c mon sweetie darling let me have another few winkies of sleep eyes bleary the frizzy haired woman grumped all right fine whatever dearest i ll sign your little papers there zzz blaise kissed her slumbering mother on the cheek quickly she returned to her room and took out a navy chanel suit she looked businesslike and chic the matching pumps and handbag completed her transformation a quick spray of chanel no 5 for good measure and she was ready for her outing she left a note for draco to meet her for lunch and left the house there was a squire cab waiting at gringotts an accounts manager immediately ushered her into a private office her request was met with surprise but her paperwork was in order and the signatures matched the ones on file exactly blaise couldnthelp feeling a glow of pride at being her father daughter the bulk of her old account funds were distributed into a new numbered account the rest was funnelled into similar accounts in banks scattered across europe she signed transfer forms and placed her copies of the paperwork into the dragon hide briefcase her father had given as a belated christmas present with a warm smile she thanked the manager for the impeccable service a goblin escorted her to the new vault taking a moment to admire the gold that looked like a dragon horde blaise left the briefcase inside and returned to the lobby outside a lift of her hand caused a squire cab to careen across traffic and squeal to a halt at the curb a couple of mornings later she read the quibbler with a smile on her face the squib stocking snatcher had been apprehended and laundry lines were safe once more minky entered the library miss this mail is being returned for the second time now the mail in question was a birthday card from her and draco although his message was written in invisible ink since he was on a broom ride blaise told the elf to inform him that she was flooing to diagon alley number ninety three the shop was closed but she figured the proprietors would be in the back office so she rang the bell until a red haired young man stormed to the front of the shop yelling stop ringing that bloody bell you stupid blaise once he opened the door she breezed by patting his cheek hello fred how did you know that he was fred george eyebrows waggled blaise met the mischievous brown gaze of the man leaning against the shop counter she winked you re the charmer george ignored his twin laughing protest that he had loads of charm to ask to what do we owe the honour of this visit she held up the card their smiles faded her stomach dropped fred said in an apologetic tone mum and dad have gone off the deep end worrying that something bad will come of our ginny friendship with a slytherin they told her she couldnthave you over anymore but we didntknow they d decided to try and cut your friendship off i m sorry blaise it was almost funny what a nice opinion the family had of her of course if they found out about draco that would probably justify the narrow minded self righteous mindset the boys looked miserable that cheered her somewhat all weasleys werentthe same just like all slytherin weren t or anybody else for that matter the pair was no match for what wesley had called bambi eyes immediately they vowed to hand deliver the card to their sister she d receive it on her birthday tomorrow she thanked the twins and left the shop outside draco leaned against a lamppost with his arms crossed why in the blazes did you come here the burrow is no longer accepting mail from a zabini the twins will deliver our card personally anger flashed across classically handsome features draco looked over at the redheads staring out their shop window and switched into impassivity silently they walked back to the floo station there was nothing to say draco walked beside blaise across the station platform as they neared the hogwarts express he tried not to be envious his mate would get to snuggle up to her boyfriend for the trip while he would be stuck with parkinson crabbe and goyle and whatever other toady jumped at the chance to sit in his compartment instinctively his hand slid into a trouser pocket to grip a small mirror if he hadntbeen able to see and talk to ginny every day that they were apart he knew he would ve been miserable to live with blaise had enough to deal with from her father and his estranged family without her mate taking his frustration out on her he had gone flying a lot are we getting weird looks again blaise asked a few but nothing like before draco sneered at a nearby couple who were staring instead of thrusting their hufflepuff daughter onto the train he met a nervous dark gaze and smirked we haventused polyjuice lately so we should be safe from quibbler articles thanks for reminding me i get paranoid sometimes see you his answering half smile was still in place when draco strode into the prefect carriage ah the joys of being lectured about duties and responsibilities if the head boy would hex occasionally to make sure that he was really listening it would almost remind him of dear old dad one of father infrequent missives had arrived yesterday he had opened it with the mix of dread and anticipation that marred every aspect of their relationship my son the news that i have been receiving about your deepening bond with blaise is most welcoming your choice of a pure blood without ties to blood traitors pleases me continue to excel in your studies and be sure and give our baby girl my regards draco had decided to keep the letter a secret his friend didntneed any more nightmares patrolling the train corridors draco reflected that with no granger giving him disdainful looks behind bushy hair or weasel glaring evilly at him not to mention not having to see potter scar head while checking the compartments prefect duty was almost pleasant true the ravenclaw quidditch team still looked ready to kick his arse and almost every compartment had a silly girl or two who tried to catch his eye or just giggled inanely whilst staring rudely but he was used to that making rounds was less onerous with less people on board in his pocket the mirror turned warm he took it out impatient to snog me are you shut up and get to the storage cupboard now malfoy yes ma am in the tight space pressed against the back of the door by his girl and kissed firmly draco knew that life was good he said i missed you she laughed you ve seen me every day in the mirror shaking his head the boy drawled i didntsee all of you he dropped to his knees lifting her top to press an open mouth kiss to her abdomen i didntsee this ginny bit her lip when he licked her belly button she asked could you do that shivery thing he made her shiver and sigh raggedly it was music to his ears standing he pulled her against him and brushed a kiss across shiny soft hair she whispered i missed you missed being with you so much i love you i love you too upon reaching hogwarts station he exited with crabbe and goyle in tow there was a slight chill in the air draco hoped his girlfriend wouldntbe cold in that thin top of hers he returned blaise wave as she terry wesley and luna piled into a carriage he wished that he could ride with ginny on his lap instead he covertly watched her creevey macdougal and another couple load into a carriage and roll away with an effort he refrained from taking his mood out on the boys what a paragon of restraint he was becoming inside the castle he headed toward slytherin house a tall red haired beanpole came running down the corridor bumping him and exclaiming cor sorry ma malfoy unwillingly amused by how fast the gryffindor expression had gone from apologetic to angry he drawled unless you re apologising for living weasel dontwaste your breath it was tempting to remind the red faced boy that grinding was bad for teeth but he decided simply to walk away draco had only gone a few paces when he heard ron he paused to watch ginny hug her brother the open affection on their faces made him wish once again that his girl family wasntso bloody damned close draco turned away and continued on to his common room the greengrass twins were like leeches attaching themselves to his arms the moment he stepped inside and asking if he wanted any help unpacking shaking them off with an icy not in this lifetime he took the stairs two at a time draco stretched out on his bed thinking of all the things he could do organise the assignments that were due in class tomorrow make sure his quills and inkpots were readied have the boys shine his shoes he laced his fingers together behind his head and did nothing but brood boss er malfoy it time for the returning feast apparently he had bored himself to sleep draco nodded to crabbe right i ll be down shortly he headed for the shower refreshed physically if not mentally draco tried not to pout when blaise came rushing down the girls staircase with wet curls hastily buttoning her school robes sorry i late terry and i took a detour behind the statue of rupert the red must be nice to snog whenever you felt like it and not care who saw wonder when he d be able to do something that simple draco attempted to drag his sorry arse out of the dumps he was wallowing in he teased i would never have known graciously he dried her hair with a charm in the hall his gaze was drawn to the gryffindor table ginny was talking to granger when the other girl turned to talk to weasley brown eyes searched and found his her sparkling eyes made him smile wickedly as he sauntered toward his own table it was hard not to stare at ginny their gazes kept meeting briefly and looking away before anyone noticed surreptitious glances proved that her attention was on him instead of her housemates blaise waved openly gryffindors looked shocked when ginny waved back he made a secret hand sign across the tables his girl returned the gesture draco looked down to conceal a smile at the staff table professor snape looked different usually the wizard scanned the chamber for rule breakers preferably gryffindor tonight snape didntlook angry or bored or suffering from indigestion he looked impassive but relaxed draco decided not to speculate on the reason he didntneed indigestion owls flew in to drop newspapers onto the tables parkinson received her copy of the rag she lived by the intruder draco attention was on ginny when the pug faced harpy shrieked i swear to merlin zabini i am going to get you if it the last thing i do you you slag silencio his wand had been out and pointed reflexively pansy continued to mouth obscenities goyle yanked the tabloid from her hands and handed it to draco the headline screamed hogwarts girl gone wild underneath the caption was a photograph that made his jaw drop it was blaise reclining on a board being carried by wesley himself and terry she sat up to ruffle draco hair before leaning back on her elbows and lifting boot long strands to her lips beside him blaise chanted shite shite shite that was pretty much his thought too the bloke they d seen staring by the surf shop he hadntbeen admiring a pretty girl the bastard had been taking a picture worth who knew how many galleons below the photograph was a short article like mother like daughter the zabini jewellers it girl was rumoured to be spending her holiday with her close personal friend and heir to the malfoy fortune sources close to the wealthy pure blood confirm that the girl and several young men were seen frequently on the beaches of tarifa spain and partying in the clubs of seville when asked for comment infamous party maven edina zabini said get out of my way you horribly dressed man if my sweetie darling has it off with every boy at hogwarts it is none of your bloody business the whispers echoing across the hall had risen to a dull roar boot stood behind them saying let get the hell out of here they rose luna and wesley did too they left their schoolmates gossiping wildly a final glance at ginny showed that she was on the verge of tears draco just felt sick in the entry the couples embraced to give each other comfort there was none for him wesley said where can we go to talk about this albus dumbledore spoke from the staff entrance you may each return to your houses mr roberts not you mr boot your parents are waiting to talk to you in my office blaise cried oh my gods terry boot tried to smile but it was more like a grimace it ll be okay baby i ll talk to you soon when her boyfriend walked out of sight blaise gave up the pretence of hopefulness she started crying silently blaise ginny rushed into the entry placing a sympathetic hand on the other girl arm where terry dumbledore said mr and mrs boot were waiting to speak to their son in his office draco replied oh no what can we do determined not to just stand around draco said i have an idea come with me with ginny by his side and the others following close behind he strode purposefully down the main corridor a n i feeling kinda like yoda the clone wars have begun except it the family wars cue the empire theme music there a sixteen candles one shot in ginny pov that i d love for you to read after you review this chapter of course d special thanks to everyone who read and reviewed ginny pov one shot sixteen candles o captain m y captain rise up and hear the bells i couldnthelp going walt whitman with the title this chap although there is a death mentioned in no way is the chapter dirge like d chapter 37 captain my captain draco white blond hair shone like a beacon of hope a corner of blaise mouth turned up at the fanciful thought she followed her best mate and ginny along with wesley and luna allowing his confident stride to infect her with a cautious optimism they climbed the main staircase in silence until wesley asked where are we going you ll see wesley caught blaise eye and shrugged her lips curved he looked relieved that she wasnthysterical they climbed a final flight of stairs stopping when they reached a door we must be headed for the attics said luna smart girl draco said any guess why are there peepholes into the headmaster office right thinking lovegood but wrong idea we dontneed peepholes to learn what going on follow me draco was really enjoying the role of mysterious leader blaise affectionate smile widened when she heard luna tell her boyfriend dontworry slytherin cantkeep their cunning plans to themselves for long they need admiration too much wesley looked at blaise for confirmation she nodded ruefully he grinned and gestured for the two girls to precede him up the staircase draco activated a series of enchanted torches to illumine the attics he caught her eye and smiled briefly before telling the others blaise and i used to play three musketeers up here mock scowling he added i always had to be the captain of the cardinal guards while she got to be the musketeer ginny reached for his hand that because you re such a good bad boy blaise asked what your plan draco said dramatically by blood and by name i call thee baron malfoy a familiar dark spectre materialised blaise saw luna press closer to wesley side while ginny smiled brightly she realised the other girl had dealt with the ghost before and was on friendly terms that was interesting draco must have shared his fascination with the historical stuff in the attics she asked the baron can you find out what happening in the headmaster office the bloody baron floated towards her up close he looked a lot less intimidating and a lot more like draco with black hair and eyes the spirit wasntas gorgeous as his descendent but he was magnetic all the same a dark brow rose thou art a saucy wench why should i help thee because she is a slytherin damsel in distress my love and you enjoy spying without turning to face the feminine ghost that had appeared behind him the baron drawled i did not ask thy opinion witch i am not just a witch i am your wife the spectre lips twitched when the maiden in medieval dress drifted over to place her arm through his literally the fearsome bloody baron sighed for thou ginevra i shall return shortly ginevra the flaxen haired spirit eagerly asked the three who had exclaimed simultaneously wouldst thou wish to hear our story they all nodded and made themselves comfortable on the scattered furniture and trunks blaise saw draco roll his eyes but she noticed that he was quick to pull ginny onto his lap and rest his chin on her shoulder eager for a distraction from worry blaise listened closely to a knight tale of a love won lost and won again no one asked why the baron was bloody or how ginevra herself had died personally she didntwant to know she was afraid that she would start crying the bloody baron return made everyone sit up straight i also have a tale to tell he said i became part of headmaster black painting within the office a man and woman were most upset with their son they accused the boy of betraying their trust in order to carry on an illicit rendezvous he admitted to lying but denied that his relationship with the maiden was sexual in nature much shouting crying and accusations resulted blaise covered her face with her hands the ghost must have realised that she was the maiden he floated closer the parents demanded their child take verisimilitude potion he complied they now know that terry was untruthful in order to be with the girl you the youth also admitted to certain knowledge she looked up to see dark eyes flickering over her chest of your person but stated that does not include carnal knowledge oh my gods this was officially a nightmare blaise shook so hard luna wrapped an arm around her shoulders before asking the spirit what did mr and mrs boot say they threatened to send their son to durmstrang blaise felt light headed no they will not do such a thing the baron said not after the boy threatened to run away instead the parents requested their son be confined to his house between classes and meals for the rest of the term no the slytherin ghost looked uncomfortable with the tears streaming down her cheeks he said gently regretfully the headmaster agreed professor flitwick was informed and ravenclaw prefects were summoned to escort young terry back to his house blaise ran for the stairs the others tried to call her back but she couldntbear to talk anymore she had to act no running in the corridors focused on getting back to her house and reaching the melusine mirror as soon as possible blaise ignored the prefect command rapid footsteps sounded she sprinted a hand grabbed her wrist pulling her to a halt the girl struggled to get away let me go what wrong the gruff concern in the boy voice made her stop and look up into a lightly freckled face her face crumpled terry parents saw the intruder they know he was really with me over holiday i have to see him blue eyes were confused how is running to your house going to ron shook his head i dontwant to know but you cantrun come with me and walk really really fast they swiftly traversed the corridors the gryffindor escort halted the protests of several prefects reaching slytherin house blaise impulsively kissed his cheek in gratitude thanks dashing into the common room blaise pushed past several nosy housemates to stumble up the girls staircase her room was empty opening her trunk the girl reached for the padded box containing her precious mirror with trembling fingers she quickly lifted out the small square and spoke terry her stomach tied in knots when his face didntimmediately appear oh merlin what if they had found the mirror and taken it away what would she do just when she was about to run find draco and beg to borrow his broomstick terry face appeared he looked awful long brown hair obscuring stormy eyes he tried to smile hey baby his voice was hoarse she said draco asked the bloody baron to spy he told us what happened in the headmaster office are you okay his lips turned down i not being sent to durmstrang but i pretty much under house arrest terry expression turned defiant i told them that they set it up acting the way they did about you and nothing they do is going to keep us apart he smiled a little acted like a dramatic teenager just like they expected but i dontgive a damn her fingertip traced his features in the reflective surface if they tried to send you to durmstrang i would ve run away with you his eyes smiled more than his lips i wouldntmind living on love she sighed and then smiled lopsidedly we wouldntstarve i ve got control of my money now and there are numbered accounts across europe that no one could trace to us when did this happen after we got back from holiday daddy told me he was going to sell my house so i decided to make sure he couldntdo that the money was an afterthought but i glad i changed my accounts the look on terry face was startled and admiring you re so slytherin and you love it i love you blaise stared into the face that she already missed touching i love you too and nobody keeping us apart we might have to wait a few days but i ve got an idea what this poor little rich girl going to buy an invisibility cloak terry didntmention the exorbitant cost or protest her dealings with the dodgy mundungus instead he returned her smile why dontyou buy two draco watched his mate run off and automatically moved to follow ginny held his arm let her go she needs to see terry in her mirror and hear about what happened from him so they can work things out he cupped her cheek all right luna slightly protuberant eyes were staring off draco might not think she was loony anymore but the girl was still odd the blank stare was starting to make him uneasy he snapped what are you doing lovegood the girl said dreamily i was wondering do you still have musketeer costumes around why do you want to play dress up yes it would be an amusing diversion draco had never fought more than one musketeer before he eyed the three considering he would bet none of them had ever held a sword trying to appear indifferent he looked at his fingernails and drawled i suppose i could find a few costumes in a trunk will you be the cardinal man ginny asked his girl sounded breathy liked the way he looked in red did she well it wasnthis favourite colour but he d humoured blaise and all in all enjoyed the playacting how much more satisfying would going along with ginny be he said i a good bad boy remember waving goodbye to the spirits he imperiously crooked his finger the three followed while he navigated through the piles of accumulated history to reach the right area throwing open the lid of a large ironbound trunk the teen lifted out three costumes embroidered with the trite fleur de lis placing a floppy gray hat with a feather on red fiery locks he promised i going to show you no mercy petite musketeer promise laughing softly he nodded and moved away to change when draco sauntered back the three musketeers were looking at their swords dubiously he said they wontstab or cut the blades are charmed to bend harmlessly whenever they touch human skin wesley waved his sword about how do we play grey eyes narrowed when ginny smiled at the other boy she couldntfind the cheeky monkey attractive could she he smiled dangerously musketeers try to find a place to hide and get the drop on the enemy while the captain tries to hunt you down and dispose of you luna said do we get a head start of course five minutes to be precise go they went roberts and lovegood to the left red to the right hmmm which way should he go practising a few lunges draco adjusted his black hat and gloves deciding to take care of the couple first and save the beautiful musketeer for last he turned left slipping into historical fantasy while stalking his prey cardinal richelieu wasnta good man but he was the power behind the throne of france the musketeers threatened his power and that of the men wearing his colours adjusting his red cape the captain of the cardinal guard silently unsheathed his sword an informant had revealed that three of the recently disbanded forces were refusing to acknowledge that the musketeers were no more he would retire their uniforms at sword point if need be not resting until every threat to his ambitions was nullified a harshly indrawn breath halted his steps inside the next chamber miscreants awaited slithering into the room the captain waited patiently for the musketeers to make another misstep a stifled cough gave away their exact location with cat like tread he pounced his blade met another one musketeer sat on the floor rendered unable to fight due to a coughing fit that sounded remotely like giggling the other was a worthy adversary swords clashed and parried eventually the man in red wore down his opponent in blue a bold thrust and engagement of the musketeer blade disarmed his foe the captain stared in disbelief when the other man dropped to his knees and pleaded simply please please i need to live why he hadntplanned on killing the wretch but refrained from saying so this was vastly entertaining true love i suppose that sorry excuse for a musketeer wench over there is your true love oui sacra bleu he was getting soft scowling the captain stalked away leaving the pair cooing in each other arms forgetting those he left behind the man concentrated on the last musketeer to elude capture stealthily searching chamber after chamber he reached a vast space filled with more items than he could count the pretty vixen had gone to ground the hunter would have to try another approach to capture his prey taking off his hat the man tossed it onto a table the other musketeers were such a disappointment no challenge this one probably even more boring watch your tongue before you lose it capitaine pulling off his gloves one finger at a time the captain dropped them beside the hat smirking it will take more than an empty threat to silence my tongue cherie removing his cape the man slung it negligently over a chair whistling from her place of concealment the fiery vixen snapped what do you think you re doing his fingers paused and then resumed slowly untying the laces of his white shirt i am making myself comfortable you object he pulled his shirttails out of his breeches and began to draw the garment up in preparation to remove it a sword point stopped him midway a white blond eyebrow rose at the sight of the blade tip pressed against an interesting part of his pectoral he smiled devilishly at the pink cheeked angel before him you seem to have the advantage of me dropping her sword to help drag his shirt over his head and throw it aside the girl glided her palms up his chest before sliding possessive fingers into his hair to pull his head down to hers against his lips she murmured dontyou forget it mon capitaine he felt it was a bon thing to have one tongue silenced in such a way if only she were not a musketeer ruefully acknowledging that the traits that had captivated him were the ones that made her such a worthy opponent the man willingly gave up duty for the woman he loved nimbly removing his girlfriend cloak to enable his hands to pull out her shirttails and smooth his palms up the slender plane of her back draco knew his playacting had a ring of truth to it he would willingly give up what father called his duty to the malfoy name to keep ginny in his arms he tightened his hold mon coeur my goodness these two are taking the game to a whole new level roberts said to his smiling girlfriend draco growled if you donttake that smart mouth out of here bowing with a flourish that matched the uniform perfectly wesley grinned ma belle luna and i are going to change and head back to our house good fight capitaine malfoy we ll have to duel again one day something about that cheeky grin made draco suspicious why are you smiling the musketeer unsheathed his sword tossed it into the air and then grasped it with the opposite hand i am not left handed he jauntily saluted before taking his appreciative girlfriend off draco eyes narrowed wesley had been holding back during their swordfight next time he would not let the musketeer off so easily slightly disturbed that he was even considering that there be a next time his scowl transformed into a smile when gentle fingertips traced his lips an amazing fighting ferret can beat a cheeky monkey any day he was no longer sure of that but knew better than to admit it especially not when his girl was looking at him with admiration in her soft brown eyes he stepped away to gather his costume saying regretfully i think it time that we return to our houses too enjoying the way her gaze lingered on his body draco lifted her hand to his lips she sighed and then brought his hand up to kiss his palm before holding it to her cheek mon coeur draco felt guilty blaise and terry were separated because of their holiday while he and ginny were closer than ever while his girlfriend went behind a screen to change clothes draco drew on his school robes he was broodingly studying a tapestry when slender arms reached around him in a hug je t aime happiness outweighed guilt he would find a way to help his mate and somehow things would work out in the meantime he was going to make the most of every moment that he could spend with ginny softly with a sincerity that caused her to lift her lips toward his he said i love you too ginny entered the gryffindor common room manoeuvring around the chamber to avoid the trio sitting on a sofa in front of the main fireplace she had almost reached the girls staircase when hermione called ginny over here shite the last thing she wanted was to go have a natter since running up the staircase and refusing to chat would only make them suspicious she slowly turned the three watched as she sat in a chair across from them after an awkward silence hermione brushed back a length of bushy hair do you know the real story on boot and zabini why do you care said ginny hermione said everyone talking about the intruder article and saying that terry parents have come to transfer him to another school i was wondering if it was true want to know it all do you ron said hey that not fair hermione only asking what other people are thinking ginny nodded sorry it just that i get sick of all the gossip at this school everybody wants to talk about everyone else business why dontthey just live their own life and let other people do the same thing hermione said i dontknow probably because those other students have way more interesting lives mate colin had joined the group ginny stood and hugged her friend he smiled will you think i nosy if i ask about blaise too her brother wide mouth turned down i thought you were going with macdougal colin i am but blaise is still my friend and i hope she okay ginny said i dontknow much more than you all i ve heard is that terry isntgoing to be transferred but his parents have pretty much confined him to ravenclaw house harry spoke up i dontlike the girl but i think that harsh boot parents sound like people my aunt petunia would like he laughed a little if they were muggles having a girlfriend was good for harry ginny said wryly they do wear matching jumpers a lot harry grimaced ron said i saw blaise running in the corridor earlier and escorted her to slytherin house she seemed really upset you escorted her said hermione that was nice of you yeah she said she had to see her boyfriend how could she do that hermione replied thoughtfully maybe she scrys in a bowl of water or the girl looked stricken perhaps she using dark magic ron said unhappily i dontwant to believe that but ginny shot to her feet every time i think you might be fair and give a slytherin a chance you prove that you re just as prejudiced as ever she told the three dontask me about blaise anymore as far as i concerned you re not her friends so whatever she does is none of your business there was a group of girls whispering furiously in another corner ginny sneered get your gossip from lavender or borrow somebody intruder as she stomped away ginny thought it was no wonder draco stalked off so much it really helped to vent temper and keep you from hexing bloody idiots a hand touched her arm and got a stinging hex ouch damn ginny i just wanted to talk to you she halted sorry colin what up how was your holiday funny you should ask when no one else did her face softened with memories it was the most amazing time of my life then i happy for you jealous but happy mate ginny swallowed hard thanks colin trying to steer the conversation away from subjects she didntwant to talk about in a room where eavesdroppers were everywhere she asked how did you get together with mindy still rubbing the redness on his hand the boy smiled angelically a group of passing third year girls practically swooned his grin turned devilish she came over for a swim the day blaise sent me a basket of oranges mindy got jealous and started throwing them at me smugly he concluded she grabbed me snogged my brains out and declared that she was my girlfriend mindy crazy about me what can i say are you crazy about her i think so that wasnta vow of devotion but maybe colin enjoyed playing hard to get mindy dramatic actions seemed to be what he liked she said then i happy for you too ginny waved goodbye determined to go up and get her assignments and supplies organised in preparation for school the next day inside the chamber two of her roommates were poring over a familiar tabloid rosaline kells was writing something at her desk the icy blonde girl remarked without looking up that photograph is good but not worthy of rapt attention unless you girls are just drooling over the gorgeous male bodies isabel and grace giggled madly lifting the page to show ginny isabel said i love the way she kisses his hair i wish my boyfriend had long hair like boot or his face or even just that body grace snatched the paper away and cradled it against her chest are you blind woman draco malfoy has the bod of a god eros apollo i dontknow waggling her eyebrows at ginny she asked doesntwatching all those scrummy muscles in action make you want to run your hands all over that divine skin yes it did it also made ginny want to hex the girl now kissing draco image she wanted to hex so badly her fingernails were digging into the hands she clenched in anger rosaline said to ginny you and zabini are friends arentyou turning to the others she advised if you dontwant to wake up with purple pustules on your faces i d lay off slavering over her mate boyfriends ginny took a step toward rosaline terry is blaise boyfriend not draco a pitying look crossed the other girl face if you believe your friend when she says that then you re too trusting for your own good weasley you re too cynical for yours kells time will tell yes it would one day when she and draco were able to walk down the corridors holding hands rosaline would remember this conversation if she didn t ginny would be happy to say i told you so isabel and grace were fighting over the intruder article they each had a hold on a side of the photograph tugging it mine said isabel you gave it to me that was before i saw how fine malfoy looks in a swimsuit ginny incinerated the picture the girls jumped back from the curling ashes why did you do that grace whimpered are you mental no she was angry that stupid girls were drooling over her boyfriend picture wanting to touch him and she couldnteven tell them to shut the hell up or get their arses hexed maybe she was mental because ginny lifted her wand and cast a hex anyway her roommates started to scream she watched for several satisfying moments before rescinding the bat bogey hex the girls snivelled that they were sorry they wouldntdo it whatever it was again unable to confess what really upset her she made them promise not to gossip they promised before she had finished asking ginny reached into her trunk for some nightclothes and her melusine mirror she walked into the lavatory and turned on the water draco his smiling face appeared the smile faded when he saw how upset she looked what wrong her lips trembled my bloody roommates were practically snogging the intruder picture not the first time desperate females have obsessed over my image i ignore the idiocy red why dontyou because i understand when i thought potter was hovering over your shoulder trying to look down your quidditch robes i wanted to hex him biting her bottom lip ginny said in a small voice i did hex them silvery eyes opened wide you didn t i did draco boyish grin made him appear even more scrummy thank merlin he didntunleash it on the female population at large what was the hex bat bogey his delighted laughter made the knot in her stomach dissolve a knock sounded are you all right ginny she called yeah rosaline i about to shower ginny watched draco eyes darken to rain cloud as she said goodnight she laughed at his request no i not taking the mirror in with me so you can say we ve showered together when luna and wesley returned to ravenclaw house conversations in the common room literally halted it was decidedly odd and for her to think that was saying something she began to realise why they were the centre of attention when mindy rose from a chair hey lindy you wouldntbelieve some of the rumours going round some unintelligent people think that roberts ran off to spain to be one of zabini boyfriends isntthat the most asinine thing you ve ever heard in shock she replied honestly no harry potter being the heir to slytherin house was the stupidest thing i ever heard this comes close though wesley smile deepened his dimples he raised a hand and rubbed a lock of her hair between two fingers thanks love any chance of you wearing braids anytime soon she gave him a serene smile for you i ll braid my hair tonight the whispers of those who heard the conversation and spread the word started to rise luna led her boyfriend over to a sofa and picked up a book on a low table nearby the passionate pilgrim someone else likes shakespeare i see wesley slipped an arm around her shoulders read a bit to me your voice is very soothing buttercup and will help me resist the urge to go knock the teeth down a few blokes throats on the other side of the room he made a face i have a feeling that i d better get used to snickering and pointing sighing he confessed i also a bit worried about how my folks will react when they get my owl i figured it would be better to confess than have someone see my picture and give them the news luna opened the book a stanza caught her eye if love make me forsworn how shall i swear to love o never faith could hold if not to beauty vow d though to myself forsworn to thee i ll constant prove well that interesting what it mean wesley asked when she read it aloud luna said i can tell you what it means to me she smiled but her eyes were serious remember when we admitted that we d all lied to be together but promised not to lie to each other it something like that vowing to never be untrue to love saying if i have to i ll give up everything else but you i feel that way about you luna a sense of peace washed over her it had nothing to do with the mess that photograph put them in and everything with knowing that wesley was committed to staying together no matter what she reached for his hand and smiled when he softly squeezed her fingers good because i feel the same way their housemates probably thought that they were the most boring scandalous couple ever they talked quietly occasionally laughing at the absurdity of the situation ignoring the stares and whispers at curfew they rose and strolled over to the girls staircase wesley would have kissed only her hand but luna had been hanging out with a bold gryffindor and a slytherin who never hesitated to take what she wanted she kissed her boyfriend in front of anyone who cared to look he grinned and strolled away with a strut in his stride she knew there was a bit of a sashay in her own the next morning bindy shook her awake exclaiming lindy lindy you ve got to hear what people are saying pulling her pillow over sleep mussed hair luna said in a muffled voice no i don t bindy rudely snatched away the pillow yes you do almost everybody in our house is telling anybody who asks that roberts was just trying to help his mate be with his girlfriend and the intruder article is gobshite viewing the less than ecstatic expression of her roommate she said hesitantly isntthat good news do they say that about malfoy too uhm no our friends still think he and zabini are pulling one over on boot luna said flatly that not fair draco wants terry and blaise to be together as much as wesley does the students at this school believe the worst about slytherins way too easily that because they re the ones who go bad everybody knows that malfoy dad is a death eater and he ll be one too someday luna swung her legs over the side of the bed that not true and i tired of hearing it she looked her friend in the eye i dontwant to hear any more gossip okay if more people refused to listen to it maybe everybody wouldntbe such humongous arses okay seeming intimidated by her friend words and air of determination bindy tried to lighten the tense atmosphere i didntgo on a reducing diet to become a humongous arse luna giggled at the thought bindy joined her during breakfast the news that professor smalley had suffered an unfortunate death reached the students that had been on holiday the man had apparently given into depression and sadly taken his own life the teacher death overshadowed the intruder scandal until terry and wesley entered the hall after the boys sat down a feeling of expectancy hung in the air luna looked past her boyfriend to say good morning terry dark blue eyes showed their appreciation of her acting normally good morning luna she was calmly eating porridge and listening to her roommates share what they had done on easter holiday when the low hum of voices rose to an excited buzz draco and blaise had strolled into the great hall if she didntknow better luna would ve thought the pair arrogantly contemptuous of the little people who gossiped about their betters she observed them closely though and saw how blaise looked immediately toward terry while draco gaze covertly slanted ginny way hi wesley luna terry stayed face forward while the girl he was forbidden to associate with stood behind him pretending to talk to her friends did you enjoy your holiday luna blaise asked amused at the contrast of calm conversation and the slytherin girl surreptitious fingering of her boyfriend hair behind the cover of her schoolbag luna said i loved it i had the best time of my life that good flitwick rose from his stack of books at the staff table to shake his head blaise smile turned wobbly she whispered bye terry whispered back before lunch meet me in the unused corridor near the library the slytherins moved on luna appetite vanished what if her boyfriend parents reacted like terry s she turned to wesley walk me to ancient runes in the main corridor she hugged him tight i never going to hide the way i feel about you again i love you and i dontcare who knows it luna froze when a coolly amused voice said i hate to interrupt such a touching scene but i need a guide to my classroom say goodbye to romeo juliet her name luna i wesley the girl looked up to see a wizard in crimson velvet teaching robes his clear blue eyes gleamed upon hearing the boy terse comment charmed i sure not wanting wesley to get detention luna said are you the new ancient runes professor wavy slightly longer than shoulder length brown hair slid forward when the man inclined his head guilty as charged luna told wesley she d see him later and gestured for the professor to accompany her up the main staircase they climbed the steps in silence a couple of times she snuck curious sidelong glances at lean compelling features the wizard caught her looking and raised dark brows she said i sorry you look familiar do you know my father larry lovegood editor of the quibbler never met him when they reached the classroom the professor looked askance at the mirror covered in a white cloth luna explained professor smalley used that for self affirmation pulling off the cover the man gazed into the mirror and murmured i good enough i smart enough and doggone it people like me stuart you poor dumb bastard beg pardon sir he waved a hand you may go thank you for your assistance miss luna uhm i in your class ah well then by all means have a seat the new teacher rifled through the desk drawers until the rest of the class filed in and took their seats after several minutes of silence the professor stood and smiled enigmatically i only arrived today and have no lesson planned sitting on the edge of the desk he riveted the class by reaching up to smooth his small neat moustache instead of a right hand the man had a hook the curving steel glinted today i ll introduce myself and assign some silent reading while i look over your late professor notes and plans lips curving with private amusement he said my name is hook professor james hook no relation only a few students made sounds of recognition luna was one of them she stared at the teacher thinking wesley earlier response was the very natural reaction of one pirate meeting another just when you thought i couldntuse another princess bride quote i found a way and threw in captain hook for good measure d with our gang being all for one and one for all i couldntpass by the opportunity for a little musketeer fun review and let me know how you liked the swashbuckling chapter 38 good intentions it was much more interesting to speculate about the new professor than to read about runes luna wasntthe only one who felt that way she saw most of her classmates sneaking covert and not so secret glances at the man who looked more like a pirate than an educator when a folded piece of parchment landed on her desk she looked around and then unfolded the note her muffled laugh echoed in the eerie silence of the classroom that was not a good sign with foreboding luna looked up into the face of her new teacher she hadntnoticed him moving away from his desk toward her the captain er professor plucked the note from her hand really miss lovegood passing notes in class i am shocked my predecessor wrote only praise for your exemplary conduct in his notes he continued smoothly i afraid i ll have to read this aloud to discourage such behaviour in the future the man deftly opened the parchment she had re folded with his hook luna could almost see the words as he spoke hey lindy i saw you jump when the captain whipped out his hook are you wondering if he going to become a nutty professor like smalley and gut somebody with it i dare you to ask him how he got it if you re not too afraid that you ll be the first victim muahahaha mindy by the end his voice had changed from mocking to musing crystalline blue eyes studied her inscrutably before prompting is there something you d like to ask me miss lovegood she asked calmly how did you lose your hand professor hook smoothed his eyebrow with the gleaming curve of steel a youthful escapade while i was a curse breaker with gringotts his lean features tightened even while he said in a genial manner now if curiosity is appeased perhaps you or someone else in class could tell me exactly why professor smalley was referred to as a nutty professor almost every hand raised in eagerness to share the details of the late professor last day in class smalley unkempt appearance smell of firewhisky and disturbing rambling speeches given while the man divined his own future was told hook appeared mildly interested but luna noticed that his clenched fist was at odds with the amiable demeanour bindy raised her hand professor hook yes m dear what did the runes professor smalley chose really mean a strange expression crossed the wizard face he strolled over to the desk and picked up the white cloth that had covered the mirror snapping it out onto the floor he said while snagging a bag of runes out of a drawer with his hook he used the roman method three runes foretelling past present and future in a startling move the man tossed up the bag and slit it open with the curving steel the runes clattered onto the cloth motioning with his hand for a wide eyed girl in the front row to come forward he instructed pick out the runes and hand them to me in the same order smalley received them the girl bent down and picked up the same trio of runes that their late professor carved himself for his final divination luna watched her feeling sad that a man who chose to end his life had used apple wood a symbol of choice hook glanced down at the rune placed on his palm puriaz the obstacle rune perhaps symbolising a problem from the past affecting the present he considered the next rune before declaring raioo for journeys spiritual and corporeal also associated with the norns and their threads of fate the last rune looked rough and crude held next to velvet teaching robes lifting it to eye level hook brow creased uruz the death rune i think the meaning is self evident miss brocklehurst he said levelly professor smalley was confronted with an obstacle that he couldntovercome and so chose to end his journey abruptly the man gestured with his steel appendage toward the door this has been a memorable first class you are dismissed luna stuffed her text into the carryall preparing to leave miss lovegood yes sir you were such an excellent guide i wonder if i might make use of your services again that silky tone of his might work on other females but she had a pirate of her own and he could give the teacher a few lessons in charm curious she nodded serenely his lips twitched excellent i d like to visit the dungeons her three roommates were waiting outside she told them professor hook wants a guide to the dungeons mindy asked may we accompany you too professor the man gave an airy wave by all means lead on the walk to the dungeon corridor took little time luna didntthink hook actually needed a guide she wondered what his true motive for wanting accompaniment was when they reached the stairway leading to the underground corridor the man thanked them descending a few steps he paused and half turned one last thing ladies which dungeon is professor lorelei classroom bindy said dungeon five again my thanks good day luna watched him walk out of sight mindy said i wonder what captain hook wants with lorelei we could find out said bindy she brought a pair of extendable ears out of her pocket i got these for neville over holiday but when we met in the greenhouse yesterday our passionata fruit tree didntlook very healthy so we uhm encouraged it to grow and i forgot to give them to him the girls snickered over their friend euphemism for snogging as they headed down the stairs at the bottom they quietly made their way to dungeon five bindy and luna took the first turn each listening to the end of an extendable ear placed underneath the massive door lorelei was speaking i afraid i didntknow stuart all that well she said we were friendly acquaintances and colleagues more than anything else a long pause made the eavesdroppers eyes meet in silent question what was going on in there hook spoke the low menacing tone made luna eyebrows rise really professor smalley wrote about you at great length in his journal but that wasntmy question i asked what you knew about stuart last day is there some reason you dontwant to answer is there a reason you re asking if it morbid curiosity i find that distasteful and frankly none of your business luna had never heard the potions professor sound so snape before the cool disdain in her voice made the new runes teacher laugh shortly stuart smalley was a fellow ravenclaw and my roommate for seven years the man could have been a slytherin with his desire for fame i find the story that he killed himself without achieving his life goal very hard to believe bindy and luna stared at each other in shock behind them mindy and cindy were craning their necks trying to hear as well the girls jumped when an icy voice demanded explain yourselves bindy placed the extendable ears in professor snape outstretched palm we were curious to know why professor hook wanted to talk to lorelei so the man ferocious scowl made the girl stop mid explanation he pointed to luna tell me what you heard be concise hook and smalley were in ravenclaw together he asking lorelei what she knows about the professor last day very well move along the girls silently backed away from the door and headed for the stairs luna couldnthelp dragging her feet she heard snape drawl before the door to the dungeon chamber closed professor lorelei i require your assistance luna hurried to catch her friends thank merlin the next class was history of magic and binns never gave detention for tardiness they walked in while the ghostly professor was asking in 1492 which wizard conjured the winds that enabled columbus to sail the ocean blue anyone anyone after class she raced toward the side entrance wesley had care of magical creatures next when luna him strolling toward her with terry she waved his dimples deepened bella luna you look bursting to tell me something she quickly recounted the recent events should i owl my father ask him if the paper has any information on james hook a piratical gleam lit bright blue eyes do you want to yes wesley grinned then anchors away buttercup as ginny left arithmancy class with colin she shifted her schoolbag to a more comfortable position on her shoulder she listened with amusement to her friend rant against sadistic professors who punished students for having a holiday by assigning loads of homework when they returned today classes seemed to pass with agonising slowness she tried to focus on schoolwork but that backfired when ginny completed assignments early the only thing left to do was to sit and watch the clock tick tick tick was a very irritating sound hey weasley creevey wait up moving to the side of the corridor to allow blaise to catch up to them she watched the girl push through the crowd heading toward the great hall for lunch blaise was scowling when she reached them being scandalous sucks there was a small mark low on the other girl neck in an unconscious imitation of her mother ginny briskly buttoned up her friend blouse and pulled up the tie nodding just like molly she smirked like malfoy so we see been meeting terry have you yeah colin grinned do something about those stars in your eyes they re blinding me what blinding you mindy asked walking up to her boyfriend he seemed amused by her narrowed eyes the stars in blaise eyes it was a joke mindy smile was tight oh well are you ready to go to the hall honey pale blond brows rose at the endearment lips twitching colin said sure thing honey let go ginny said when the pair strolled off that girl going to hex your arse one day indignantly blaise protested for what being friendly uh huh if she tries she ll regret it blaise promised i dontlike that witch ginny nodded understandingly she wasnta big fan of macdougal sharp tongue either when they reached the great hall blaise waved goodbye and moved toward the slytherin table ginny headed for gryffindor after a surreptitious glance at draco he made their secret hand sign and smirked when she returned it she ate lunch quietly listening to the conversations of those around her not everyone at her table was consumed with curiosity about what exactly zabini had done with malfoy boot and roberts most people still cared about quidditch and doing well in school but some had one track minds she heard her roommate isabel say did you hear what ashley greengrass heard from pansy parkinson grace giggled no but if it was anything like what mary kate told everyone in divination i want to be malfoy love slave more than ever ginny hand unconsciously gripped her knife in a threatening manner she wished that she could be a shrew like kate and say my tongue will tell the anger of my heart or else my heart concealing it will break and rather than it shall i will be free even to the uttermost as i please in words she blinked when colin said are you okay you look scary he laughed nervously not planning on using that sharp pointed object on something besides food are you ginny released her white knuckled hold on the knife i donthave to grace and isabel are breaking their promise colin followed her gaze what are you mother of merlin what happening to those girls her roommates were crying running disbelieving fingers over the purple pustules that had appeared on their faces spelling out the word gossip from one cheek to the other the gryffindor table erupted into startled laughter the girls were sitting on the same side as ginny so draco got a good look at the disfiguring charm too his face lit up with an admiring smile that made her hot weasley temper cool blaise gave her thumbs up giggling madly hermione frowned i wonder who gave them that hex the pustule ridden girls jumped up and ran toward the staff table mcgonagall rose from her seat to listen to their snivelling resigned to the inevitable ginny start to push off the bench even before her head of house commanded ginny weasley come forward at once these girls inform me that you are responsible for their condition is this true mcgonagall asked yes the professor said sternly while gossiping is truly a deplorable habit it is not your place to correct fellow students miss weasley you will be spending detention with mr filch this evening she turned to the distraught girls run along to the hospital wing and learn your lesson about the perils of gossip yes ma am sorry ma am grace whispered isabel whimpered yes i will professor mcgonagall the girls rushed out of the chamber ginny turned to head back to her seat i afraid that your attitude leaves much to be desired the professor said sternly since you failed to apologise you must leave the hall report to filch for instructions on the detention that will start immediately after your final class go when ginny stopped for a moment to pick up her carryall ron said disbelievingly you did that ginny uh huh oh a corner of his mouth turned up good one ginny smiled thanks his answering grin lifted her spirits almost as much as seeing draco half smile out of the corner of her eye leaving the hall there was a spring in her step that bounce was long gone when she stood outside filch office the squib loathed students almost as much as he hated adult wizards and witches magic envy was an ugly thing the door opened abruptly the stoop shouldered man who seemed to personify the word gray snarled what do you want she said simply mcgonagall sent me i supposed to have detention with you after school waving her inside he said that some nerve not even asking if i was agreeable go sit there were two chairs in front of a battered old desk she moved toward the upholstered one filch barked not in mrs norris chair he shut the door with a snap another weasley in detention should i do this the easy way or the hard way the man rasping tone woke the cat napping before the sullen fire with a meow that made the hairs on the back of ginny nape stand up the feline stretched and looked at her with eyes that seemed to cross and uncross crooked tail twitching mrs norris stalked toward the girl filch scratched the large bald spot on top of his head i ll let mrs norris decide what should i do my precious ginny had heard stories about this feline ron always swore that an evil spirit possessed her her other brothers and harry had said the cat had an uncanny ability to sense what the caretaker called wrongdoers mrs norris twined around her ankles and then leapt into her lap the animal had such interesting eyes the feline stretched up putting small paws on her shoulders and intent shining orbs at a level with ginny s the oddest notion popped into mind was mrs norris an animagus she stared in shock when one slit pupil eye closed and opened again merlin had the cat winked at her purring filled the room filch frowned jealously and snatched his pet off ginny lap he cradled mrs norris in his arms muttering aw i wanted those trophies polished by hand again what am i going to do with the little witch now the feline yowled looking up the craggy face softened disturbingly before becoming hard again mrs norris says if you dontwant to polish trophies girl think of something else i d like better draco had complained that pansy kept pestering him to have a snack in the kitchens after curfew ginny said i could help you catch a couple of wrongdoers purring sounded again inside the dim cold office after looking down indulgently filch did something ginny knew would give her nightmares he smiled blaise was getting tired of making do with hasty stolen moments with terry since they had returned from holiday almost a week ago he had been restricted to his house outside class meals and a few supervised outings with the quidditch team if she couldnttalk to him for hours every night via melusine mirror she would ve gone mental no holding hands in the corridors no chats or snogs between classes that werenthidden and hurried no hanging out together in the library or on the grounds no wonder draco got shirty over having to sneak around with ginny it was frustrating as hell slumped over her desk in muggle studies she rolled her eyes when professor hands clapped his hands for attention today mr creevey will sing an old song enjoying a new popularity on the muggle charts thanks to an artist by the name of sir cliff richard give a nice round of applause to your classmate students always enthusiastic about hearing an alternative to hands prosing every student clapped colin strolled to the front of the room sat on a stool and strummed a few chords on his guitar the boy sang dream dream dream dream struck by the pure clarity of the boy voice she enjoyed the slightly angst y song until she heard the words when i feel blue in the night blaise didntwant to dream her life away she wanted to be with terry both luna and ginny turned to look at her sympathetically creevey was looking uncomfortable blaise kept hoping he would stop singing say his voice was strained that he felt sick anything he kept on playing the words were tearing her up inside the girl breath started to hitch she blinked her eyes furiously after the song focusing on her work helped blaise keep it together for the rest of class when class dismissed she slung her carryall over a shoulder and rushed out the door blaise wait she shook her head refusing to turn or halt colin footsteps quickened hers did too the gryffindor kept following hurt turned to anger nearing the statue of bertha the behemoth the girl darted behind it when the boy followed her she swung her carryall with all her strength damn oh gods that hurt blaise had knocked creevey into the back wall his schoolbag spilled out onto the ground while he wrapped his arms protectively over his bruised chest i think you broke a bloody rib she grabbed his robes hauled him up from the floor and shoved him against the wall good i want you to hurt like you hurt me colin her face crumpled i thought you liked me i thought we were friends voice thick with tears she demanded how could you sing that song knowing how it would make me feel i sorry i didntrealise until halfway through and then i needed the extra credit his misery filled eyes didntappease her draco taught me muggle duelling i could kick your arse do it she shook her head tears rolling down her face it wontmake me feel better nothing going to make me feel better his arms wrapped around her after half heartedly muttering get away from me she allowed him to hold her while she cried colin whispered huskily i sorry blaise i really really sorry she gained control of her emotions and wiped her face with the handkerchief he offered feeling numb she picked up her bag i ve got potions next snape probably going to give me detention for being late bye forgive me yeah but if you do it again i really am going to kick your arse looking relieved colin said fair enough when she turned to leave he called wait a minute i want to make it up to you how smiling the boy told her his scheme blaise entered the dungeon classroom fifteen minutes late she expected to be blasted with sarcasm the moment professor snape saw her instead he looked into her eyes and then merely told her to take her seat perhaps today class being only slytherin made all the difference draco gave her a what have you been up to look she mouthed later he shrugged and turned back to chopping an ingredient for his potion fiona said i prepped the ingredients for you is everything okay yeah thanks blaise scanned the directions on the blackboard and began to catch up to the rest of the class toward the end of the period her inflamarae potion was giving off bright sparks and a sulphurous odour the same as the other successful ones about to fill a special flameproof flagon blaise looked up when pansy called her name smiling maliciously girl waved her wand flipendo blaise cauldron received a magical push toppling the contents onto the floor the fluid burst into flames classmates yelled and backed away from the growing inferno snape quickly extinguished the liquid fire he gritted how did this come to pass several fingers pointed to pansy the girl shrugged it was an accident stygian dark eyes looked into muddy brown and then narrowed was it miss parkinson report for detention after dinner i have several specimen jars in need of freshening yes professor snape the man instructed the rest of the class to finish their assignments he told blaise you will receive credit miss zabini your solution was proved effective most demonstrably she smiled in relief thank you sir fiona smiled too but pansy continued to glare when snape walked away blaise held up two fingers in a v at the scowling girl it wasntthe peace sign after dinner blaise rushed back to her dorm room to change she fastened her school robes and hustled downstairs brushing past her friends with tell you all about it later in the outer corridor blaise turned and headed for a certain side door at a particular side of the castle colin was waiting for her outside he smiled with anticipation hefting his guitar let get this serenade started they walked until they were beneath terry dorm window blaise pointed her wand at a few small pebbles on the ground iacio immediately the little rocks magically hurled up to clatter against the windowpane she took off her robes smirking when creevey wolf whistled at the sight of the red dress she had worn to the valentine dance a warming charm kept the breeze swirling her short skirt from feeling chilly when the window opened and terry leaned out she engaged an emineo voice projection charm grab your omnioculars baby blaise laughed when she heard him yell wesley throw me the omnioculars off my desk from her vantage point she could see her boyfriend long brown hair tell that he was holding omnioculars but she didntneed to see the expression on his face the only important thing was that he be able to see hers and hear her voice a golden blond head appeared in the window beside terry blaise waved at wesley before looking to see if colin was ready he began to play this time the words to all i have to do is dream made her smile when she sang i love you so and that is why the drawback to projection spells was that the sound wasntconfined to one small area everyone with an open window heard the song soon spectators craned their necks to watch the serenade at the end of the song colin bowed to the cheering audience thank you thank you i available for parties blaise hurriedly threw on her robes c mon let get out of here before we get detention she blew terry a kiss and ran for the side entrance near slytherin house she leaned against the wall to catch her breath you more than made it up to me she said gracias colin grinned as he answered de nada draco was trying to be good and it was putting him in a bad mood ever since they had returned from holiday he had slipped just once in his resolve not provoke potty and weasel ginny family and friends were going to find out about them sooner or later so if he could just keep from taunting and deriding gryffindors maybe his civil behaviour would temper the mutual loathing into a dislike everyone could live with if only resolutions were not so bloody hard to keep he strode toward an enclosure with the rest of the doubled care of magical creatures class his eyes flickering toward the sound of potter laughing over something his new girlfriend said blaise had told him morrigan was revoltingly infatuated with the boy who lived draco smirked thinking the couple was scar head meets crazy in the head loco en la cabeza probably described his restraint too but he was determined to keep his tongue between his teeth alright alright less talkin if you please gather round now gather round draco let the rest of the class crowd up to the fence choosing to observe at the back with blaise crabbe and goyle weasley called out what the matter malfoy afraid a monster going to get you merlin it was hard to pretend the prat hadntsaid anything to keep from saying like what one of your giant spiders beside him the boys started cracking their knuckles in preparation for teaching weasel some manners a look from him caused them to cease although the two sulked as if he had denied them a sweet that enough ron there ll be no more talk of monsters in my class the half giant stern expression relaxed now then onto today lesson i had ter return the jabberwocky we studied before holiday ter the mimsy troves while i was doin tha however i came across a truly remarkable find he opened the top of the heavy iron cage reached in and drew out a writhing snake like creature three sets of long claws clenched and unclenched in an attempt to rip and shred lifting the wide mouthed sharp toothed reptilian thing into the air hagrid asked anyone wantin ter take a guess what billy here is strange noises came from the creature blaise raised her hand that sounded like whiffles and burbles is that thing a fruminous bandersnatch ten points ter slytherin well done miss zabini draco said t was brillig blaise just brillig crabb and goyle began to snicker they didntrecognise the phrase from muggle writer lewis carroll jabberwocky but heard his dryly humorous tone and reacted automatically a half smile remained on draco face throughout the lesson on how to differentiate between the fruminous and venomous bandersnatches he almost demanded to know why if the blasted things lived in the middle of the forest and students were prohibited from rambling through it did they need to know how to tell which bloody bandersnatch was poisonous resolve in mind he didntsay a word blaise nudged his arm with hers you are the sultan of self control the raja of restraint the zip it zabini her humorous flattery made him feel better somebody realised how much effort it took to keep the peace damn it at the end of class when potter swaggered inside the fence to ask the creature a few questions in parseltongue and translate the answers so many derogatory remarks came to mind it almost hurt to remain silent draco gritted his teeth concentrating on a happy thought ginny on the hammock in spain wearing a leopard print bikini the distraction worked and definitely improved his frame of mind over the next few days he began to document certain instances in a journal to prove his strength of character for posterity weasley bumped my arm reaching for the same jar of rat spleens in the student cupboard during potions this afternoon after blurting an expletive and insisting he d seen the jar first the cretin waited for me to retaliate i merely shrugged and took goyle jar the slytherin quiddich team had practice after gryffindor today arriving early to watch the other team practice and know thy enemy as father always said i sat in the stands and counted the number of errors potter and weasley made they were numerous temptation to use the sonorus charm and helpfully point them out was great but since ginny flew by and smiled i found the willpower to resist after a week of refusing to take any of the many opportunities to put the dynamic duo in their places potty had the gall to place his hand on my arm and demand to know what i was up to wonder boy accused me of hiding some dire plot with false composure his sidekick eloquent as ever said yeah my smile of honest amusement caused the pair to jump back and threaten me with their wands thankfully professor snape appeared behind them and sent the two on their nervous way later in the library ginny pressed kisses to every inch of my face in admiration of my poise the memory of virtuous actions rewarded with kisses made draco smile in dada hearing weasel mutter malfoy smiling that creepy smile again he got to be up to something made it vanish the dark urges he had been fighting all week returned full force why couldntweasley be thankful his enemy was ignoring him why did he have to comment on it all the time stinging remarks made draco long to remove the stinger with a hex good afternoon class one of the precepts of defensive magical theory is to expect the unexpected in real life a dark wizard doesntwaltz up politely inform you he about to hex and then whips out his wand laughter greeted professor tonks speech she held up her hand for silence and continued in order to get a feel for what a real encounter might be like we ll be dividing into two groups each person will be designated either a light or dark wizard or witch in your assigned role you will jinx counter jinx hex and use defensive spells on your enemies white blond eyebrows rose this was interesting much better than the usual this is a nasty creature here how to defeat it if you ever run into one lesson draco gaped in disbelief after the teacher divided them into groups professor granger said in that annoying tone of hers yes malfoy should be in the other group the woman dark eyes twinkled should he well today he in your group so make the best of it tonks was rather attractive today usually draco he didntcare for the professor chameleon like appearance but platinum hair was quite striking the news that he would be part of the goody goody group was not so pleasant looks like i ll be on the losing team now that you ve gone to light side let make a pact not to hex each other okay mate blaise grumbled he said in an undertone if i ever blocking your shot of you know who or his pals just cough and i ll step out of the way blaise winked and strolled over to the rest of the dark side group all right gather round people we ve got five minutes to plan some strategy in the light side huddle potter was droning on about double teaming the better opponents first and dealing with the weaker spell casters afterwards the plan was almost slytherin in cunning draco frowned granger saw his expression and demanded you will remember not to hex your side wontyou thankfully tonks called for the class to line up and follow her into a nearby empty classroom before he could say something cutting inside the dark wizards immediately clustered together in the middle of the space when the professor said begin his group broke into pairs and headed for their targets who were flanked by two other classmates cries of stupefy protego tarantallegra and rictusempra filled the air neither side appeared to be gaining advantage until potter took out crabbe and goyle with everte statum the two sent flying were knocked out cold that left parkinson without cover granger who had trip jinxed bulstrode whirled around and placed a tremo hex on the pug faced girl fine trembles intensified into violent shudders that made parkinson collapse a few on draco side were taken out but many more on the dark side were eliminated from the role play exercise a coughing sound reminded draco of his promise he stepped aside instantly weasley grabbed his ears with both hands aaahhh the twitchy ears hex it hurts like bloody hell oh fine stop whimpering finite incantatem then blaise ended her hex but thankfully retained enough slytherin sense to use a body bind curse to immobilise weasley while she took out mr freckles the boy bushy headed girlfriend yelled confundus at once blaise became confused what am i doing here where terry she smiled at weasley i like you catching sight of potter she frowned i dontlike you at all i wonder why not draco noticed potter smirking at him green eyes focusing past his shoulder locomotor mortis someone cried it was nott the last of the dark wizards draco legs became stiff and rigid from the leg locker curse because potty had allowed it gritting out the counter spell he turned and blasted his housemate with the contremiso curse donthurt me i ll throw down my wand i ll surrender just donthurt me the paralyzing fear in nott voice was exactly the result lucius had promised would come from the spell potter chuckled a malfoy on the light side think your father is rolling over on his cot in azkaban draco pointed his wand before the other boy had finished pulsus harry bloody potter reeled back under the onslaught of magical blows unfortunately professor tonks rescinded the curse chastised and dismissed draco stalked away from the classroom he didntwant to return to slytherin house instead he decided to go up to the attics before the evening meal he sat on the window seat in the medieval solar he had re created staring broodingly at a tapestry depicting a maiden with long red braids sitting under a tree with a dragon after the sunlight had started to fade a soft voice said i thought i d find you here ron told me what happened in class i sure he did his tone was petulant but he couldnthelp it all that effort to control his temper wasted ginny sat beside him on the velvet covered seat you cantpull a fighting ferret tail and not get bitten he grunted ha ha she giggled a knight who double crosses a dragon gets singed draco lips twitched in a sudden move he pulled her onto his lap a beautiful maiden that braves a dragon lair what does she get soft brown eyes issued an invitation kisses a rumble of laughter escaped him before her lips met his and he accepted her invitation with pleasure a n poor malfoy such good intentions yay for everyone liking captain hook joining the hogwarts crew in 1994 the newly sir cliff richard sang a duet with phil everly of the classic all i have to do is dream that went to number 14 on the uk charts what goes around comes around in more than a justin timberlake song heh

helmet in spaceballs i cantbreathe in that thing d chapter 39 things revealed when the first rays of pale morning sunlight washed over the landscape friday morning a cloaked figure stealthily made her way across school grounds to the gates marking the boundary of hogwarts spring was finally making its mark but the shrouded figure paid no heed to the emerging leaves and flowers instead she remained focused on the man pacing on the other side of the iron bars do you have what i ordered mundungus yellow stained teeth bared in an avaricious smile aye when a slender hand extended imperiously the disreputable man held up a bag instead of handing it over he scratched his unshaven chin finding two of these handy items was a bit more effort than i d expected missy a small bag landed on the ground in front of the man foot he picked it up and smiled pleased with the heavy clinking sound the scoundrel tossed her bag up and over the iron fence silver and bronze shimmering fabrics spilled out of the sack blaise bent and placed a hand beneath the sheer material it became invisible she nodded to the man bowing obsequiously she picked up the bag and headed back to school on the front steps a group had just finished putting on sunglasses to watch the sunrise blaise sat beside her roommate cassandra i see you re back in black did you have a good holiday lips painted to match black hair kohl and fingernail polish curved yes you yeah she said hello to the others in the small group they returned her greeting lexx ran a hand over his waxed spikes you dealing with that intruder stuff okay we ll greet the sun every morning if it ll help thanks after the group dispersed blaise ducked into a lavatory and pulled on the silver invisibility cloak she waited for an early riser to leave ravenclaw house before the portrait closed she slipped into the common room at the top of the boys staircase quiet steps took her to terry room inside each of the beds had their curtains drawn pulse racing in anticipation she crossed silently to her boyfriend bed he lay facing her reaching out her hand smoothed down lightly tanned musculature terry rolled onto his back leaning over his sleeping face she uncovered her head and softly kissed her sleeping cutie dark blue eyes blinked sleepily up at her either i dreaming of your face or you got the invisibility cloaks a warm palm curved around the nape of her neck bringing her down for a lingering kiss hey boot time to get your lazy arse out of bed blaise hurriedly covered her head with the invisibility cloak again wesley opened the bed curtains and said jokingly do i have to drag you out his words slowed to a halt from the shock of reaching inside the curtains to encounter an invisible body where he d expected empty space he called to the other roommates terry going to be a few minutes late to breakfast boys tell our illustrious prefects that i ll ensure the prisoner goes straight to the great hall without detours would you the good natured ribbing of the others made terry smile blaise couldnthelp it she had to put a hand out of the cloak to trace his lips with her fingertips they were so gorgeous when the last boy had left the chamber roberts stuck his head back in i going to have nightmares about roving hands thanks to you blaise she pulled off the invisibility cloak just imagine they re luna s buena idea amiga but what in the world are you wearing blaise glanced down at the figure hugging black leather outfit vampire chic why do you think luna would ever wear something like that wesley noticed terry pointed stare and hastily added we can ask her later i ll just go sit at my desk now terry sat up and hugged her tight she ran her fingers through silky brown strands your cloak is in a bag under the bed when do you want to use it he kissed her and smiled tonight after curfew let meet at the room of requirement she nodded happily and used her hold in long hair to bring his mouth down to hers well well look what i ve found horrible hexes for randy roommates my my this lip swelling spell looks particularly nasty though it would prevent innocent ears from hearing sounds blaise kissed her boyfriend goodbye and slipped under the invisibility cloak she tiptoed over to the boy leaning back in his desk chair with his eyes closed and his hands behind his head she playfully pinched wesley cheek his eyes opened with a yelp at the sight of a floating hand he returned all legs to the floor with a thump that a fine way to repay a friend he grumbled over their laughter downstairs blaise heard luna tell mindy i going to wait for wesley go on ahead unable to resist she shoved a book off a nearby table mindy jumped when it hit the floor she scurried away ignoring her friend calm assertion that ravenclaw house was not home to a poltergeist that wasntvery nice blaise luna said when her roommate left but it was fun i ll bet luna said after a moment i donthear footsteps not that i mind appearing to talk to myself but why are you still here underneath the invisibility cloak blaise smiled widely you ll see terry and wesley bounded downstairs in the outer corridor blaise walked up behind her boyfriend she pinched his bum he whirled around she giggled blaise is that you he said laughingly she pressed herself against his chest whispering nobody else better touch your arse terry grin matched hers she slipped her arms around his waist and walked backwards to the hall that evening blaise found the door across from the moth eaten tapestry of barnabas the barmy slightly ajar inside the tree house looked the same a round single room built into a massive tree trunk overlooking a jungle except for the flowering vines everywhere she looked colourful perfumed flowers bloomed it was beautiful leaning over the balcony railing to look out into the jungle she felt a pinch on her backside baby is that you she whirled around to see terry remove his bronze coloured invisibility cloak he wrapped his arms around her nobody else better touch your arse her laughter faded when she noticed that she was now wearing her short skirted jane outfit terry looked gorgeous as tarzan in his embrace she had had everything she needed to be happy wanting to make the most of their short time together blaise traced his lips with her tongue before opening her mouth for a deep satisfying kiss on the saturday morning following their return to school luna smilingly accepted a piece of bacon from wesley she was thankful students werentrequired to wear school robes on weekends her boyfriend eyes looked so incredibly blue against his bright blue jumper a dish of strawberries had just appeared on the table before her when the first owl swooped down from the rafters to deliver the post numerous owls followed across from her cindy pale blonde curls shook in distress after she began to look through her teen witch magazine oh no there a new set of ads for zabini jewellers wesley asked may we see his polite request brought a smile to the cherubic girl face she handed it to him of course luna and terry leaned in to view the magazine while wesley opened the publication and flipped the pages the first ad wasnttoo inflammatory it portrayed a couple dancing with an elegant blond giving a brunette with short curls what looked like an anniversary ring the second layout with malfoy diving into the pool and emerging to place a strand of black pearls around zabini golden neck was another story luna mused aloud funny how something that didntlook half as sexy during the shoot turned into a photograph like this long hair falling forward terry agreed dryly yeah real funny over at the slytherin table blaise was staring at her boyfriend biting her lip in worry luna said your girlfriend is about to cry why dontyou look at her the tense expression on terry face softened into a rueful smile he stood and walked over to whisper quickly in his girlfriend ear before a ravenclaw prefect made it clear he had to leave immediately blaise smiled at luna until an owl glided down to drop a black envelope onto the table in front of her opening by magic the plummy tones of edina zabini gushed out oh sweetie oh darling oh gods sweetie are you ready for this that little romantic faux pas of yours has turned out to be a goldmine or at least a silver one profits are so fab i ve bought all sorts of glam fashions and gorgeous expensive things without your father complaining the least little bit cissy and i cantpossibly attend all the parties we ve been invited to thanks to our lovely photogenic darlings when your tedious little term is over what fun we ll have showing you off bon soir suddenly luna was glad that her only complaints about her father were his prejudice and poor taste in lady friends draco and blaise left the hall after the gusher exploded into black confetti a few pieces drifted over to the ravenclaw table luna wondered if they were an omen as if in answer an owl dropped an envelope in front of wesley he swallowed hard and smiled lopsidedly at least it not a howler not wanting an audience she suggested let go someplace private before you open it good idea buttercup they decided to walk to the greenhouse holding bindy and neville passionata fruit tree as they stood before the spreading branches of the tree now fifteen metres tall a slightly hysterical giggle escaped before luna could prevent it a golden eyebrow arched dashingly how much encouraging to grow have your friends been doing bella luna quite a lot obviously he chuckled and offered the envelope if you ll do the honours she nodded and slid her fingernail under the wax to break the seal taking out a sheet of parchment luna handed it to wesley who took a deep breath and then read aloud in the droll voice he used to hide emotions wesley your mother and i are deeply disappointed you deliberately misled us about your holiday nevertheless we are proud that you confessed your wrong instead of continuing to perpetuate a lie we have not yet decided what the exact consequences will be for your actions community service at the least will be expected of you this summer in hopes that destructive self interest will be negated by serving others luna said at least he signed it mum and dad her observation was an attempt to look on the bright side but it was hard for easy going mr roberts to sound like professor snape he must be upset a corner of wesley mouth turned up is my wanting to be with you really destructive self interest to parents it is she hugged him i so glad you re not under restrictions like terry in an attempt to make wesley smile she gave him a mock chiding look just think of how depressed the books in the restricted section would be if we couldntgive them hope of being read one day that would be tragic indeed looking down into her face his lips turned up although blue eyes were shadowed how about we encourage each other of all the kisses given wesley the one she pressed to his lips then was done for a reason she had never thought of before comfort mutual reassuring with touch eased the tension caused by an unknown future when they drew apart luna glanced at the passionata tree her boyfriend followed the direction of her gaze and smiled looks like we ve encouraged it to bloom plucking a delicate white blossom on a stem he slid it into her tiny side braid and gave a smile of more natural appealing charm than a certain runes professor whose voice she heard outside they crouched behind the enormous pots stacked in a far corner of the greenhouse listening as the door squeaked open and professor sprout said i didntknow stuart all that well i afraid we said good day and happy christmas but otherwise we were two different samples of soil the woman bustled around the tables likely checking the condition of her beloved plants she asked what kind of information are you digging for james luna peeked between pots in his tailored black shirt and trousers hook looked every inch the pirate he smiled roguishly deftly using the hook to deadhead a flowering plant well since you ve brought it up pomona i was hoping that someone as observant and intelligent as you would know if my old roommate had a lady friend on staff professor lorelei perhaps luna grimaced at the thought so did wesley sprout burst into laughter before saying earthily i wish i had some of that shite you re shovelling to fertilize my plants james it high quality after a last chuckle she said lorelei been keeping company with another wizard she may be part siren but the woman never looked at another man as far as anyone on staff knows indeed who would that be between the gaps luna saw sprout give a look usually reserved for students asking questions that should be self explanatory who else would a potions professor find irresistible our potions master of course hook snorted in disbelief snape blue eyes became contemplative well split my infinitives what an interesting development the man thanked his fellow professor for her time with a gleaming calculated smile sprout activated the watering system with a charm and soon followed when the two had left wesley held luna hand and led her out from behind the giant pots i dontthink i d call it interesting precisely but i definitely think we re right to keep an eye on hook he up to something i agree on their way back wesley said if your message doesntget an answer by the end of the week let go into the village and send one through the owl post office deal depends they were inside the school near the statue of daniel the daft her boyfriend manoeuvred her behind it on what his lips were twitching hers were trembling with amusement on if we seal it with a kiss wesley moved closer and closer until their lips gently touched his eyes stared into hers the intensity of his gaze combined with the slow sensual kiss caused butterflies to flutter in her middle luna eyes closed as she leaned into him to seal their deal with another kiss ginny usually spend sunday mornings huddled under warm covers delighting in the fact that she didnthave to get out of bed some of her best daydreams came during these times of drowsy contentment this morning she hoped to have another one slowly her eyes closed as her mind drifted easily into fantasy it was the happiest season of all light snow began to drift down as ginny sat on a bench to put on her skates she came to the muggle skating rink at least once a week the festive christmas tree and strings of lights encircling the outdoor area made her feel like a little kid looking forward to a visit from father christmas she wasnta little girl anymore even though her flatmate luna told her she was just as messy as one you ll turn your ankles with that lacing here let me do it masculine artistic fingers nimbly tightened her laces running her own fingers through the platinum strands of the man whose head bent to his task ginny smiled have i told you how sexy you look in that jumper briskly tying the last bow draco stood and pulled her to her feet looking down past the opened coat to the red jumper she d knitted he smirked not in the last five minutes good to know i haventlost my appeal holding hands they stepped onto the ice and began to glide her smile widened her love wasntfond of the colour red but it looked abso bloody lutely scrummy on him chiselled lips curved while he drawled have i told you how beautiful you look in your early christmas present she glanced down at the luxurious coat that made her feel almost as beautiful as the way he looked at her running her free hand over the soft black trim framing her face she asked this is faux fur isntit his chuckle made a lovely shiver race down her spine as far as you know he pulled her into waltzing position cleverly distracting ginny from insisting that he answer it was probably better not to know circling the ice her brown eyes darkened shrewd grey narrowed you re not worried about tomorrow night are you shaking off her misgivings she smiled and thought only about enjoying this night and her partner the next evening the burrow filled with weasley friends and family their christmas eve parties were legendary looking out the kitchen window ginny thought with a trace of hysteria that this year party might go down as the most memorable of all time looking for father christmas ginny cantwait for coal and switches sister she gave fred and george a wicked smile if i get switches i know just who to use them on molly bustled into the room and nodded admiringly at the festively decorated table smiling happily she told her daughter lovely job decorating the table dear pleasant round features turned mischievous when she asked her sons did you get her to tell you who the mystery guest is it driving me spare to have to guess who coming to dinner just then the doorbell chimed heart pounding ginny rushed into the lounge pushing past ron hermione and harry to place her hand over arthur as his began to turn the handle on the front door looking at the roomful of loved ones gazing expectantly at her she said i ve been trying to get up the nerve to introduce someone very special to me i hope you ll welcome him for my sake taking a deep breath she opened the door gasps and inarticulate expressions of disbelief filled the air as draco malfoy stepped into the room slipping her arm through his she met his rueful smile and tried to return it with trembling lips my precious daughter and malfoy i feel so molly fainted fred and george caught their mother and dragged her over to a sofa ron whipped out his wand red faced hermione grabbed her fianc e arm to prevent the curse he uttered from hitting his old enemy deflected the spell careened toward the christmas tree which hurtled across the room knocking people onto the floor before bursting through the picture window to land on the front lawn a group of neighbours arrived at that very moment songbooks in hand they gaped before singing a carol with wavering voices are you alright in there weasley that hysterical laughter is scaring isabel and grace so if you d kindly stop we d appreciate it rosaline cool words snapped ginny out of the daydream that had started so dreamily and ended like a nightmare she opened the curtains and swung her legs over the side of the bed two girls huddled together on a bed across the room you you re not going to hex us again are you gin asked isabel shaking her head wearily the freckled face was solemn as she assured no of course not just watch it with the gossip because i think that jinx has long lasting effects she was gathering clothes out of her trunk when hermione stuck her head in the door ginny i glad you re up i have a favour to ask ronald was having trouble in transfiguration and needed to borrow a solid gold bracelet hermione had bracelets but they had semi precious stones in them none was gold alone ginny waved at her open trunk sure i ve got a couple in the top drawer of my jewellery box pick whichever one you like i ll see you later after a shower she impulsively decided to wear her valentine day present opening the bottom drawer to her jewellery box she reached for the gold bracelet it wasntthere her stomach dropped even while her mind tried to rationalise that perhaps she just hadntplaced it in the same spot that she d returned it to every other single time she d worn the gift she yanked open the second drawer the bracelet wasntthere either pulling out the first drawer ginny dumped the mix of bracelets and costume jewellery onto a stack of jumpers looking for something in particular asked rosaline did you see hermione take a bracelet pale eyebrows rose yes actually when i said i thought you d specified the top drawer granger snapped at me to mind my own business i think your brother temper has rubbed off on her ginny pressed a hand to her cramping stomach did you notice what the bracelet she chose looked like almost pityingly the girl nodded it was the gold bracelet with a heart charm slamming down the lid of her trunk after snatching up another gold bracelet ginny raced down the girls staircase the situation wasntas bad as it looked she d find ron tell him that she d been planning on wearing the bracelet hermione took exchange it for the one in her pocket and everything would be fine at the bottom of the steps she called out colin where ron the boy looked up from his seat on one of the sofas in his room with harry and hermione he said he didntwant to practise where people would laugh at him thanks she quickly ascended the boys stairway and ran toward her brother chamber the door was ajar inside ron said i ll get you a bracelet like that hermione except that i d have our initials engraved on the heart so you could kiss it like this and be kissing me harry groaned merlin that corny ginny pushed open the door watching in horror while her brother looked down at the charm ron brow wrinkled in confusion look initials are appearing d m g w what said harry somebody gave my sister this bracelet said ron who the bloody hell was it doug montgomery drake martin devlin macgregor asked her to the valentine dance hermione said thoughtfully but she said she didntlike him ginny walked into the room the first person to see her was harry he said i think i know who gave her that bracelet the same person she been sneaking off to meet at the library ron stared at her unhappily you ve been sneaking around with somebody why why wouldntyou want me us to know ginny who is it his expression told her he suspected but still hoped that she would say a name any name other than the one he dreaded draco malfoy she said her brother silently mouthed the name features crumpling after a long painful silence he repeated draco malfoy his face started to flush as his voice rose my sister has been sneaking around with draco bloody malfoy he shook off the restraining hand his girlfriend placed on his arm are you insane after everything that happened you pick a death eater for a boyfriend ronald please take a deep breath and calm down i sure that if we just talk things through we can bring ginny round he not a death eater ron and hermione nobody talking me out of anything ron said angrily then you re officially mental sister and they ve got a ward at st mungo for you how are mum and dad going to feel when they find out huh didntthink about that did you he grabbed his hair with both hands mum already gutted over percy damn it you re going break her heart again how can you be so bloody selfish i not selfish ginny yelled back i ve tried for six months to make you see that slytherin doesntmean evil but you like the rest of our family are so bloody minded and prejudiced six months whispered ron the door slammed shut behind her ginny looked from harry who had his wand out to her brother who seemed ready to cry finite incantatem incredulous ginny looked at harry what was that for do you think draco put a love spell on me he hasn t harry turned to ron he didntuse a spell what about a potion what if my poor little sister was given a love potion ginny said i right here you can talk directly to me he didntgive me a love potion ron told her if you re under a love potion you wouldntknow it would you he asked hermione can you make a counter potion of course but i d have to make sure she d actually taken a love potion first how can you do that said harry ginny fingers splayed against her stomach ron if i agree to do whatever test you want will you promise not to tell mum and dad i ll tell them i promise but i want to do it in a way that wonthurt so badly i promise to determine whether a love potion had been ingested they needed to examine the contents of her stomach in the lavatory ginny grimly stuck her finger down her throat afterwards she chewed a brushing flossing mint and tried not to cry you know draco hasntcompelled me to do anything so keep your end of the bargain let me owl mum and dad all right but why ginny why malfoy her brother face scrunched up as if he was trying not to cry hermione hugged him while harry placed a comforting hand on his best mate shoulder they all looked at her she couldntbelieve they didntknow tears rolled down her face i love him in the attic draco whistled weasley is our king the original version as he bent to remove a knee length coat of mail out of a trunk the hauberk was what the best dressed warriors had worn in the eleventh century he placed it over a headless mannequin next he lifted a conical helmet and put it on made of four sections of leather and wood set in a metal frame with a metal bar protecting the nose and face the spangenhelm was more comfortable than he would have thought when he heard light footsteps approaching draco struck a pose with a wooden practise sword that was a hell of a lot easier to heft about than the real thing how do you like the spangenhelm red she didntanswer he pulled it off i know i playing dress up again but you ve got to admit its more fun than reading hogwarts a history draco her voice sounded choked up he took a closer look at his girlfriend her face was streaked with tears her eyes red rimmed he tossed the priceless artefacts down and pulled her into his arms she buried her face against his chest they know hermione wanted to borrow a gold bracelet she didntget one from the drawer i told her to look in i didntget to his room before ron de activated the concealment charm oh gods they know he tightened the embrace whispering it okay it ll be okay draco felt weirdly relieved he had wanted to tell the world from day one now weasel knew his sister was dating a ferret he suppressed the urge to laugh knowing that his girl wouldntunderstand why he did it red would think he was gloating when in reality he was so damned happy that the secret was finally out will he owl your parents ron promised to let me owl them draco kissed ginny forehead waiting for her to compose herself before asking when and what will you write she exhaled shakily i dontknow i feel so numb after everything that happened grey eyes hardened even while the boy forced himself to ask quietly what else happened his stomach began to twist into knots with the effort to listen and not rush off to hex the trio who thought their end justified the means the bloody hypocrites they looked down at slytherins while acting every bit as ruthless i dontwant to go back to gryffindor right now fine with him he wished that she could transfer to slytherin house and never have to go back a thought struck draco smiled how about we spend some time in the room of requirement she wiped her eyes with a handkerchief and nodded they held hands on the way to the seventh floor entering the room was like entering a lavish noble home in verona draco ruefully noted his change in clothes he now wore a slytherin green doublet slashed with gold and embroidered with gold thread his elaborate white sleeves matched the feather in his hat he admired the crimson velvet and gold gown that ginny wore with a smile he brought the slender hand almost hidden by a long pointed sleeve to his lips come hither the banquet awaits she curtsied hither i come a long table was loaded down with beef mutton pork rabbit and venison fruits of all kinds and a wide assortment of sweet and savoury pastries were available as well he pointed out the dietary differences between nobles and commoners ginny said didntbelieve in vegetables did they he chuckled there are a few dishes of onions garlic and leeks at the end if you d like some no thanks i prefer sweet breath me too she smiled and held up a round cheese what this nettle cheese delicate red brows winged upward ouch nettles in the cheese no left to drain on a bed of nettles oh the way her pink lips curved made him suspicious did you know all this already she prevaricated like a slytherin i like the way you explain things even a bed of nettles sounds sexy he grinned if i was on it it would be he mentally patted himself on the back when she giggled they decided to eat outside on a bench in the courtyard ginny took a bite of a mushroom pastry if i ignore the fat content and questionable cooking methods renaissance food is quite tasty he carved and offered a slice of pear with a jewelled dagger before he ate one himself no worries about food poisoning here my lady reaching out to cup her cheek draco said o she doth teach the torches to burn bright her pleased laughter was worth the time he had spent reading the so called romantic play romeo and juliet were both idiots in his opinion who had some good lines after they d finished their feast and snickered over the anachronistic brushing flossing mints he d pulled out of a pocket ginny looked at him and asked almost shyly would would you do the holy palmers kiss scene with me since he would have suggested it if she hadntasked he smiled in a way that made her blush inside the stately manor the room had transformed into a romantically lit chamber filled with music they stood in the middle of the room and slowly lifted their hands to place one palm against another not feeling half as awkward as he would have if he hadntbeen in costume draco remembered his lines and said if i profane with my un worthiest hand this holy shrine the gentle fine is this my lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss he was startled in a good way when ginny threw her arms around his neck and kissed him he half heartedly protested when he was given opportunity to draw breath i know more that nice you re brilliant have my lips or as we say in modern times shut up and kiss me he complied with his lady wishes removing the gold net containing bright tresses they spilled over his fingers and tunic like a fragrant waterfall tender kisses turned passionate ginny sighed feel free to profane this holy shrine any time you like happiness rumbled like laughter in his chest he swung ginny around until she lay dizzy against his shoulder parting was sweet sorrow when they finally had to leave he said i ll wait in the corridor a few minutes before i follow she blew a kiss draco did something he had scoffed at when terry did it for blaise he caught the kiss and pressed it to his heart ginny melting smile made the hufflepuff sentimental gesture worth it after she left he looked down at his shoes thinking that they were a huge improvement over the renaissance variety petrificus totalus draco stood unmoving but conscious he thought with black humour that he had played this scene before last time romeo and mercutio had disabled him with frozen pain this time potty and weasel were the ones attacking from the shadows to immobilise their enemy when the two faces came into his forward frozen view their stony expressions told the helpless boy that this time he wouldntbe getting off with a word and a blow a n i couldntresist using one of hook famous lines or the quotes from romeo and juliet anyone wondering how draco going to get out of the bind he finds himself in you ll soon find out d chapter 4 a kiss a dance luna meandered down the corridor pondering the possible ramifications of the scene just witnessed in the great hall rounding the corner of a seldom travelled corridor she decided that overall she was quite satisfied with the progression of the little play from a play she was directing once she reached the statue of gregory the smarmy luna scrutinized the girl seated near the statue and said i love your earrings sniggering at the dry tone blaise rose to her feet and turned her head playfully the emerald eyes of the silver serpent hoops glinted eerily lifelike i wore them for draco knew they d get a laugh i saw him laugh among all the other things he was doing her noncommittal tone fazed the taller girl not a bit oh my gods i thought i was going to fall off the bench when he started playing around malfoy is a love god he should give lessons every girl in school would thank him more to the point will ginny weasley thank him she looked pretty upset when she rushed out i ve never had so much fun being so bad and yeah i saw our beatrice looking green dontworry it was good for her was it good for terry boot he bolted from the hall not long after you and draco started getting into your little act luna lips twitched at the dramatic reaction she received for the mild remark oh my gods i totally forgot about what terry would think blaise grabbed her brown curls and gave an inarticulate shriek of frustration shoulders slumping the girl scrunched her face in dejection now he ll never ask me out and the first hogsmeade weekend is only a week away unable to stop herself luna giggled reassuring her pouting friend she said firmly stop worrying terry looked like he wanted to pull you away from malfoy and drag you off to his cave when he left primal reactions are very encouraging seeing the instant brightening effect of that observation she pressed her lips together to retain much needed composure blaise shoulders slumped again i couldntgo to hogsmeade even if terry did ask me draco wants me to go with him to help torment ginny some more resignedly raising both brows since she could not raise a sardonic single one luna sighed obviously tonight drama has affected your intellect you donthave to spend all day with malfoy you only need a few hours if terry asks tell him you ll meet him for lunch at the three broomsticks no the bludger it a small restaurant decorated in quidditch memorabilia unperturbed by the unusual sight of a slytherin dancing about joyfully luna wondered aloud how best to arrange an eavesdropping scene like the one in much ado about nothing we can hardly stop in front of draco in a corridor and say most wonderful that ginny should so dote on draco whom she hath in all outward behaviours seemed ever to abhor blaise got into the shakespearean mood and quoted drolly istpossible sits the wind in that corner luna nodded returning by my troth my friend i cannot tell what to think of it but that she loves him with an enraged affection it is past the infinite of thought at the phrase enraged affection luna watched her new friend dissolve into laughter and thought shakespeare really had a way with words they talked over plan possibilities deciding to work out a few details out prior to any attempt at execution before they parted blaise took something out of her pocket and pressed it into the other girl hand shrugging she said brusquely before heading toward slytherin house here i didnthave any snorkacks so i transfigured these into something i thought you d like no big deal luna opened her hand to contemplate the earrings resting on her palm two small silver radishes dangled from hooks smiling luna took off her jewellery fashioned from the real thing and rambled back to her own common room tucking long hair behind her ears so everyone could admire the radishes swinging you just spent the weekend trying on new robes and chucking out every non girly item in your wardrobe you look good stop worrying blaise stood outside the dungeon classroom contemplating skiving off to the nurse and complaining of cramps her stomach was bothering her butterflies were manically performing loop de loops over the thought of sitting across from terry for double potions hogwarts infamously whimsical and erratic schedule meant loads of randomly doubled classes in order to promote house unity equalise class time or some other rot why does this have to be the monday before hogsmeade weekend snape will revoke my permission if i miss one of his classes i dontblame you for staring off thinking of me blaise but please move on now a coolly amused voice drawled behind her shaking her head the exasperated girl entered the classroom without looking back she held up a two fingered salute to the insolent boy he gave a huff of laughter reluctantly amused blaise turned slightly toward draco and stuck her tongue out he said suggestively stop giving me ideas dontwant me to get all hot and bothered and melt a cauldron like longbottom do you kindly refrain from melting a cauldron mr malfoy no matter how hot and bothered you get the satirical voice of professor snape echoed from the doorway behind them blaise smiled sheepishly at draco and kept smiling straight into the deep blue eyes of terry boot he wasntsmiling he was searching her face looking for something thanking her parents for olive skin that barely showed a blush she smiled tentatively terry face softened moving past his table she felt something slide into her pocket waiting until everyone was busy assembling ingredients for the day potion blaise unfolded the note i need to talk to you meet me after class under the dragon claw willow terry say yes dummy fiona was grinning like a pixie beside her the rule of private correspondence being private more of a guideline really in ms nosy parker opinion crossing her eyes at her cheeky friend blaise shot back we re making the draught of incapacitation not taking it peeping at terry she was glad to see him peeking back at her he raised a brow in question and she nodded in answer he gave a slight smile in return before concentrating on his potion blaise noticed professor snape strolling around checking student progress and hurriedly returned her attention to her work as well the last thing she wanted was a detention over the weekend at the end of class blaise was first in line to place her test flagon on professor snape desk the saturnine face relaxed slightly lifting a brow snape observed eager to be off are we ms zabini she smiled apologetically at her head of house snape was never going to win a popularity contest but he was a good teacher always pushing his students to do their best she enjoyed his biting wit unless directed at her draco banter in the great hall had always reminded her of snape cruel but dead on she knew gryffindors couldntstand the professor but he had always been fair to her and she liked his voice it was sexy all at once blaise became aware that she d been staring and snape dark eyes glinted with amusement blaise quickly exited the class making her way to the lake she fervently hoped he couldntreally perform legilimency without a wand sitting on her school robes under the willow blaise looked out at the lake until she heard terry approach she nodded to the robe spread on the ground have a seat he sat down taking his time studying her before glancing toward the lake that the infamous outfit you showed malfoy she gazed in surprise at his handsome profile yeah i wanted to show you that it wasntthe lingerie the grapevine is currently rumouring it was how d you know his fair skin showed embarrassment much easier than hers did lips curving he admitted i ve been sitting diagonally across from you at the next table for years malfoy not the only one who got flashed blaise was stunned years yeah it been a ravenclaw joke terry voice deepened as he imitated why isntboot going with anyone oh that right he waiting for blaise zabini to prove that she a girl so he can finally make his move dryly he added in his own pleasant voice you can imagine what they re saying now some emotions even olive skin couldnthide her jaw dropped grinning at her speechlessness he teased getting the picture you ve wanted to go out with me luna was right you are smart for a slytherin blaise bumped his arm with hers what did luna say he smiled lovegood just happened to sit by me in the common room after the you know terry grabbed his robes pretending to rip them open she started talking to herself hoping no one misunderstood her poor friend actions laughing at blaise indignant look he said well it got my attention luna really good at letting information slip on purpose she told you about our little project what project luna told me you were tired of the whole is she a girl thing leaning closer terry bumped blaise arm and coaxed c mon tell me i ve confessed my embarrassing secret so it only fair he held his fist over his heart and vowed by rowena ravenclaw i solemnly swear that even under cruciatus curse i will never terry put his hand down quickly to prevent being unbalanced by the sudden push all right i ll tell merlin you quiet types kettle calling the cauldron black hmmm do you want to hear this blaise ruined her stern look with twitching lips she started to explain i had to take muggle studies this year giving the details of how the matchmaking came about and what they d done so far she tried to make it plain that she wasnttruly fooling around with malfoy even if she was fooling around with malfoy that didntsound right it was for a noble cause best not to mention the ignoble sheer enjoyment factor afterwards blaise attempted to read terry reaction he nodded his head as if he understood then quickly shook it as if he didn t he ran a hand through his long hair and asked have you kissed him no she cried i dontwant to kiss him we re just friends looking satisfied at blaise emphasis on him terry said seriously keep it that way his eyes narrowed in playful warning no dodgier flirting either or next time i will jinx malfoy and jelly legs will be just the beginning wow luna was right primal reactions were very encouraging blaise said okay feeling bemused as he stood and helped her to her feet bending down to pick up her robe he handed it over and said as she put it back on you d better wear more than that when we meet at the bludger saturday it pretty chilly for october blaise had a sudden suspicion did luna bump into you coincidentally this morning mention this willow as a good place to talk and the bludger a great place for lunch seeing terry amused nod blaise started to think she owed her matchmaking friend more than jewellery she d have to find out who the blonde had her eye on and return the favour she felt her eyes widen in alarm when terry reached a hand up to cup her cheek tilting her face up to meet his descending lips he whispered relax you re acting like you ve never been kissed before his lips were so close she admitted simply i haven t before he changed that statement to past tense terry smiled so tenderly that tears sprang to blaise eyes lying on the most comfortable sofa in the slytherin common room draco clasped his hands behind his head and sullenly refused to speak to anyone want to play wizard chess crabbe query received only a sneer like anyone in the house could begin to give him competition during the sorting ceremony that stupid hat had asked draco if he was sure he wanted to be slytherin blathering on about his ready mind and some wit and learning nonsense as though he d toss over a brilliant future as a slytherin to be a ravenclaw how about a game of exploding snap closing his eyes at that hopeful question from goyle he thought snidely let not and pretend we did draco darling why donti come up to your room and make you feel better pansy offered reminding him of those hydras his greek cousin herc always bragged about fighting on one of his treasure hunts cut off one of her daft ideas and three more attack you when you least expect it still debating whether to fake snoring or use an impediment curse to escape the pernicious creature digging her claws into his arm the put upon boy eyes snapped open when another voice said coolly sorry pansy draco promised to escort me to the library malfoy ignored pansy sour face rose and tucked his rescuer hand into the crook of his arm as they strolled into the corridor he raised an amused brow to ask why exactly am i escorting you to the library not that going someplace parkinson free isntreason enough the inexplicably affectionate girl hugged his arm for a moment and said a little redheaded birdie in moronic muggles was overheard to say she d be studying there blaise is really getting into this game he thought draco had never had a co conspirator who was as intelligent and amusing before perhaps he had been a trifle sexist girls could be just as slytherin as boys as they strolled through the library he wondered whether he was now one of those sensitive males who saw women only as genderless people he admired blaise backside when she bent over to ask loony lovegood if she d seen their quarry and smirked happy the answer was negative on the second floor draco pulled blaise close and jerked his head toward the shelves of muggle literature a flash of red could be seen bent over a book looking around he wondered what they could do on a corridor open to the view of anyone in the library below his partner in payback whispered are you willing to get a detention of course if i canttalk snape round to letting us off smiling in anticipation he asked what are we going to do dance at his look of disbelief blaise rolled her eyes draco girls are driven mad with jealousy when they see a boy they like dancing with someone else you do know how to tango he let his lip curl disdainfully the nerve of her i ve had bloody dance lessons like every other malfoy since time began if you d gone to the yule ball ms cheeky you d have seen me in action i made that cow parkinson look good and i ll show you and weaselette a thing or two a feeling of recklessness swept over him he glanced over at ginny and then smilingly challenged go on it your idea the girl winked and said loudly come on draco i thought you said you d dare anything how fun it was to sneer i dontconsider a silly tango around the second floor corridor a dare worth taking i cerberus dog dare you leering in a way that would make his father rotting in azkaban prison proud he said silkily are you sure that you can take the consequences of a cerberus dog dare her eyes sparkled i can take anything you can dish out my gods this is fun and it is only the beginning draco caught blaise wrist and pulled her flush against him masterfully he moved their bodies into a tango embrace with their audience in mind he bent his head close to his partner and gazed deeply into her eyes lowering his voice to the level pansy called dark seduction he commanded sing something so we can dance engrossed in her commentary on the plays of shakespeare ginny didntbecome aware of the nearby couple until she heard blaise raised voice daring draco to tango with her in the corridor she had to cover her mouth to stifle a laugh at the ridiculous thought malfoy would never lower himself in such a way he was too proud to dance in the library disbelief grew while she listened to the pair surely he wouldn t she moved back and to the side in order to watch from the shadows the arrogant boy pulled blaise into a close embrace and commanded her to sing so they could dance ginny entire body heated in a flush she knew rivalled her hair as she watched from her place of concealment the girl unconsciously started swaying the couple glided effortlessly in sensuous rhythm rock step rock step turn i ve never danced with a partner who could move like he does what is blaise singing the melody with its smooth walking and double time beats fit the dance in same way that malfoy was fitting his body to zabini s sensual and mesmerising he was mesmerising ginny told herself that she would throw her book at them and make him stop moving in that tormenting rhythm but not just yet the words of the song slowly became clear it was about a woman wanting to be held in her lover arms like a spanish guitar being held like a guitar didntsound very romantic ginny thought being played throughout the night sounded a little better if the couple wasntslytherin watching them sway together as blaise huskily entreated that he hold her to his heart and caress her with tenderness was harder to do by the second an unfamiliar feeling was sweeping over her bloody damn malfoy i will not let you or that song make me cry i dontwant you to hold me in your arms look my way hold me to your heart i don t what is the meaning of this madam pince voice carried from the floor below ginny could hear students furiously whispering by dinner the great hall would fill with speculation about what exactly malfoy and zabini had been doing in the library blaise looked aloof and indifferent to the indignant shrieks of the librarian she smiled regretfully before making her way downstairs to face the music so to speak the girl partner paused at the stairs and looked back directly toward ginny place in the shadows draco eyes were stormy he opened his mouth to speak but halted when professor snape called imperiously from below pressing his lips together draco shook his head with a last unfathomable look he made his way down with the same natural elegance that had captivated her during the dance ginny numbly re shelved her book she noted with detachment two other texts shelved out of order she stared at them wondering what the bloody hell was going on and what she was supposed to do about it a n tony braxton sings spanish guitar which really is a fabulous song to tango to and aye me hearties i did borrow more of a guideline really from potc d chapter 40 backlash the last thing he remembered was a fist flying toward his face from the ache in his jaw weasel had a decent right hook draco tried to evaluate whether his jaw was bruised or broken but his hand wouldntmove he heard a rattling sound opening his eyes with effort it was hard to believe that this chamber had once been softened with tapestries rugs and candlelight now the room of requirement had changed to serve a different purpose it was a dungeon in the torchlight his gaze scanned the dank stone walls looked up to see the small barred window and the thick iron chains from which he hung suspended his feet barely touched the floor putting strain on his upper body good thing he worked out if he had creevey arms the pain would be unbearable draco smirked when he realised that he was fully dressed the prats wouldntbe whipping him literally then probably didntwant to get a bigger inferiority complex viewing his god like physique hah look at him harry even chained like a dog malfoy so bloody arrogant his captors had returned at least i a pure bred dog weasel instead of a mongrel like your mangy friend the sputtering redhead punched him in the stomach if he didnthave abs of steel he might ve whimpered draco inhaled sharply he probably deserved the blow the satisfied expression on the freckled face rubbed him the wrong way however so instead of trying to be conciliatory he drawled i ll be sure to have your sister kiss that better later the psychotic gleam in weasley eyes made draco regret his words even before another punch rocked his head back he looked ruefully at the pacing cursing gryffindor he had definitely deserved that ron stop reacting to his taunts that what he wants malfoy obviously trying to distract you from finding out just what he been up to with ginny actually he had been reacting to being chained cursed and beaten if wonder boy wanted to think he was acting out some cunning plot though draco was content to let him keep that wrong impression it was easier on his ego what have you done to my sister you bastard weasley demanded punching him again nothing she didntwant me to do oomph even abs of steel bent under extreme force merlin he was going to have to stop baiting the lunatic the emotional pleasure wasntworth the physical pain closing his good eye and counting to ten in english latin and norse draco said levelly i ve never taken advantage of your sister feelings for me frustrated by ron continuous rant of accusations and disbelief he gritted i damn it you gormless psychotic git of a manky weasel i love ginny and she loves me and there nothing you can do about it once he and blaise went to mexico over easter holiday they had been amused by the sight of children beating a colourful tissue paper covered figure of a donkey hanging from a tree with a stick the paper mache had eventually broken open allowing candy to rain down now draco knew how a pi ata felt ron stop it he had enough stupefy harry bloody potter stepped around his immobilised friend he raised his wand and silently began a series of healing spells how ironic the boy who hated draco more than anyone besides the dark lord and snape was relieving his enemy pain it was tempting to believe potter did it only to keep weasley out of trouble but his face looked unhappily determined to do the right thing damn to show his grudging thanks the slytherin refrained from goading or sneering enervate weasley looked at draco blinking in confusion didnti just beat the shite out of you yes you did so here a little something to return the favour while he spoke draco reached up and used his grip on the chains to pull lift and kick in a smooth motion that propelled weasley across the chamber to fall flat on his back the boy sat up and rubbed his head this isntworking out the way i planned his face was a study in frustration malfoy such a bloody snake we canttrust anything he says yes we can i brought a sneakoscope and it hasntwhistled once potter brought a small object out of his pocket it looked like a glass top and glowed spun and whistled shrilly whenever someone dishonest was nearby draco had several people in slytherin house did have trouble telling truths when lies would better serve it was just their nature like beating first and asking questions later was apparently a gryffindor trait weasley looked like he d just found out there was no father christmas a discomforting sensation almost like pity made draco say i not lying ginny and i have been seeing each other all year i didntwant to sneak around but your sister wanted time to get the family to accept it a bitter smile crossed his face i knew lovegood would see a snorkack before that happened wide mouth turning down weasley pointed to the sneakoscope in his friend hand maybe it broken yeah maybe it is said potter immediately the device began to whirl glow and emit a shriek weasley groaned stars and stones harry what are we going to do now he said wildly let obliviate his memory make him forget ginny be like lockhart ron have you forgotten the brain damage those spells can cause potter lifted his wand and released the prisoner from the manacles draco fell to the ground rubbing his wrists potter shook his head we ve got to stay out of this mate let ginny tell your folks maybe it wontbe so bad gee thanks said draco shut up ferret nobody talking to you calling yourself a nobody weasel finally we agree on something after draco said the words he wanted to hit himself habits were so hard to break insulting these two was as natural as breathing he rose to his feet making a supreme effort to keep his tone civil look i dontlike you or your friends weasley but for ginny i ll stay out of your way i d appreciate it if you d let me go and then stay out of mine weasley looked at potter who shrugged the sneakoscope wasntgoing off so they knew he wasntlying finally potter nodded and opened the door harry i i dontknow if i can stay out of it weasley face looked tormented this is my baby sister malfoy been putting his hands on i supposed to just let her make a choice that could ruin her life without doing anything to try and stop it draco averted his eyes he didntwant to understand weasley feelings much less sympathise with them if mr freckles couldnttake his sister dating a malfoy then that was his lookout no matter how many people hated the idea of a weasley and a malfoy being together draco wasntgiving ginny up since there was nothing he could say to change her brother mind he didntsay anything merely walked out of the room of requirement and made his way to slytherin house in the common room he brushed past crabbe and goyle parkinson the greengrass twins and several others who tried to get him to stop and chat to go directly to his room he sat on the bed with his melusine mirror calling ginny name when her face appeared he said dryly in one of the understatements of his life i had a little talk with potter and weasley your brother not going to come round he could see his girlfriend open her mouth to ask what exactly the talk had consisted of before she bit her lip after a tense moment she said i haventwritten mum and dad yet and now i wonder if ron going to save me the trouble if he does what will you say to them her smile was bittersweet the same thing i told ron i love you the owlery was one of luna favourite places owls were such fascinating creatures watching them takeoff and land was one of her favourite things to do today she d been waiting for her father to send information on james hook this morning daddy tawny owl had swooped down from the rafters to land on the table in front of her her heart had jolted when she discovered that the message case was empty she and wesley had looked at each other with the same thought owls didntjust drop in to say hello someone had taken her letter wesley had transfiguration first class and couldntbe late she was more fortunate she had history of magic and binns with his eternal perspective was much more lenient when it came to tardiness after breakfast luna gave wesley a quick kiss goodbye and ran toward the tower what are you doing out of class missy argus filch rasping voice was precisely the one luna wanted to hear she turned and smiled serenely i wanted to talk to you mr filch no one at hogwarts is more knowledgeable about what goes on than you are the unpleasant man showed a glimpse of teeth that made the girl want to stuff every brushing flossing mint she could get hold of into his mouth homeless muggles had better hygiene since gently reminding three mints a day keeps halitosis away would not be prudent at this time she gazed at the squib stubbly chin as she asked have you seen anyone else enter the owlery this morning not personally but mrs norris said she saw that new professor nosing round earlier other people might automatically discount testimony given by a cat but the luna knew mrs norris was no ordinary feline the animal had an almost eerily strong bond with filch several times in the past she had heard the man respond to the grey tabby and he really did seem to understand her if harry could talk to snakes why couldntfilch talk to his cat although squibs werentsupposed to have magical abilities werentthere always exceptions to the rules she clarified hook that the one swaggering around the place waving his hook at defenceless kitties lips twitching madly at the thought of mrs norris being a defenceless kitty luna thanked the man politely he brusquely ordered her back to class during lunch she whispered what filch had told her wesley said drolly well if mrs norris said it that good enough for me buttercup she lightly smacked him on the arm i know it wouldntstand up with the wizengamot but we re not that picky he grinned after our last class why dontwe meet behind the statue of rupert the red we can follow hook and see for ourselves what he up to i ll bring omnioculars unable to resist touching one of his adorable dimples she said good idea i ll bring the extendable ears bindy said that neville didntneed them but i might didntsnape confiscate those she said yes but he gave them back today a note of discovery entered her voice he said he hoped we would put them to proper use in the future together they gazed toward the staff table professor snape seemed to be impassively listening to mcgonagall but every few moments he glanced down the table to where professor hook was trying his best to engage professor lorelei in conversation look at how he holding that goblet the bat going to snap the stem if he squeezes it any tighter she nodded snape doesntseem to appreciate his new colleague interest in lorelei maybe we can find out why that is when her boyfriend turned to talk to terry luna asked mindy how it going with colin good yes matchmaker it good it would be great if he d just stop hanging out with zabini i want to slap that witch every time i see her mindy pushed away her plate his carryall was open last night in the library i saw a certain magazine inside and i dontthink colin been reading the how to create a closer relationship article he might be mindy rolled her eyes yeah right shortly after her friend left the hall colin did too that was a good sign she turned back to wesley he asked how the taming of the shrew going luna waved her hand in a so so motion he laughed i dontsuppose she d appreciate it if i gave her a pithy quote from the play he recited asses are meant to bear and so are you when she giggled he winked didntthink so wesley escorted her to arithmancy and bowed with a piratical flourish after kissing her hand her smile stayed fixed throughout the rest of the day until she waited alone behind the statue of rupert the red captain hook had just left the classroom she looked down the corridor still no wesley the professor turned a corner luna decided to follow on her own it was a lot harder to trail someone without being noticed than she had thought several times to prevent detection she had to duck into a classroom behind a statue or even hide behind another student when the piratical looking professor strolled out the side entrance toward the lake she took out her wand and quickly performed a disillusionment charm hook headed for the dragon claw willow by the time luna caught up and began to move the claw tipped fronds aside to see what the man was doing she heard waiting eagerly were you how flattering in his journal stuart mentioned several times your fondness for this willow a favourite trysting place i assume assumptions are dangerous things i only met you here to say that my private life is none of your business stop questioning my colleagues about it crouching forward luna parted the last layer of fronds and felt her eyes widen the runes professor was standing next to lorelei his hook lifting long black spirals while he mused beauty is a dangerous thing in the hands of a siren that lures men to their doom in a quick move the curving steel wrapped around the woman hair and pulled her face close to his i ll question whoever i please and you ll be beguiling guards in azkaban if i prove that you lured stuart to his death release me he set lorelei free at once she backed away i had nothing to do with stuart death he made his own decision if you feel guilty for not being there for him deal with it but donttry and put the blame on someone else hook remained staring after lorelei returned to the castle he lifted the curve of steel to smooth his moustache well do you believe her little eavesdropper luna became visible how did you know i was there the willow fronds parted and stayed that way as if by magic oh yes oh a dark brow lifted i donthave all day answer the question m dear i do believe her alas so do i before she could gather the nerve to ask what he had done with her post wesley burst into the clearing under the willow he slid his arm around her waist and kissed her cheek sorry i late he told hook hello sir sorry to intrude we ll be on our way yes leave me to my thoughts when they had gone a safe distance wesley and luna broke into a run back in ravenclaw house the couple sat together on a sofa mcgonagall made us stay after the period was over since people had talked and wasted her time during class luna twined her fingers with his and shared what had happened to her wesley said it hogsmeade weekend next saturday we could head for the owl post office first thing i ll have daddy send the information care of bindy that will ensure it arrives clever thinking luna smiled they sat together gazing at the fire that burned year round shapes formed in the flames making her giggle what do you see buttercup us kissing immediately wesley stood and pulled her up luna found herself led into his room and over to his bed she smiled at terry when he looked up from his desk he grinned finally asking your opinion of his new bedding is he hello luna dontmind me i ll just spin one of my favourite orbs like so and sit here reading horrible hexes for randy roommates sitting on her boyfriend bed enclosed by curtains that darkened the interior and cast intriguing shadows across the handsome face leaning closer luna thanked merlin for imagination as wesley lips parted hers invisibility cloaks were one of the most brilliant inventions of wizard kind using them blaise and terry were able to sneak out of their houses and meet in every out of the way place they could think of the attics unused classrooms the room of requirement even the space beneath the quidditch stands were used as meeting places on the way back from spending time with terry in a large linen cupboard on the fifth floor after their last class she patted the messenger bag containing the cloak affectionately psst zabini over here a freckled hand was gesturing urgently blaise strolled behind the statue of bertha the behemoth why the secrecy mr freckles surely granger knows that i like you but dont like you by now the redhead wasntreturning her smile just staring in a way that made the girl nervous her eyes searched his what is it i know about malfoy and my sister she had felt hexes that packed less of a punch draco hadnttold her since since when yesterday her best mate had gone up to his dorm yesterday afternoon without more than a nod and wave crabbe and goyle had informed her that draco was eating in his room on the way to dinner when she ran up to check on him after the meal he had been sitting up in bed reading basic hexes for the busy and vexed draco had accepted the chocolate chip cookies she brought with a smile while she conjured a glass of milk he told her he chose to have dinner in his room to avoid looking across the table at potty and weasel now his explanation made even more sense abruptly realising that she hadntheard what ron had just said blaise smiled apologetically say again i said how long have you known why do you care his hand wrapped around her arm and tightened implacably when she tried to pull away over christmas holiday did you and ginny really go see the nutcracker or did you just set it up for her to meet malfoy a blush spread across her cheekbones freckles stood out against skin white with fury harry and i knew you were up to something but i thought he shook her you came into my room to distract me anger made his eyes blaze did you laugh at me for asking what was in it for you huh did you of course not it wasntlike that she wrenched her arm away his fingers imprisoned her wrist they squeezed as he whispered i wish i d never touched you that i actually kissed you makes me sick tears sprang to her eyes blinking them back she wrenched out of his grip and cried out in pain her wrist hurt but not as much as the spiteful words ron looked shocked at the sight of the livid marks his fingers had made his hand reached out to touch the imprints she backed away cradling her arm against her chest before running toward the hospital wing madam pomfrey made a disapproving sound as she smoothed lotion over blaise skin physical assaults are not tolerated at hogwarts miss zabini if you wish to report your the person responsible they will be punished it wasntmy boyfriend ma am clucking again like a disapproving squirrel the mediwitch told her brusquely to lie on the cot until the marks faded and left a boy entered i sorry ron said gruffly sitting on the edge of her mattress i ve gone mental ever since i found out about you know doing things i would beat the shite out of anyone else for doing saying the freckled face scrunched in utter misery she couldnthelp feeling sorry for him he looked desolate i had no right to hurt you and that stuff i said was a lie all i could think of was all the times ginny gone to the library or run off with you she was really with malfoy it drove me spare his eyes met hers as if trying to make her understand mum and dad are going to go round the twist when they find out and thinking about mum lying in bed crying like she did when percy left made me want to hurt somebody did it make you feel better hurting somebody no i feel worse will you forgive me he was sincere she nodded ron i saw you coming this way what s wrong granger concerned speech trailed off halfway down the hospital aisle when she noticed whose bed her boyfriend was sitting on he stood to face her mione i the girl looked uncertainly at her boyfriend is there something i should know about yeah ron glanced at blaise she said go on i okay bye they walked out blaise looked down at her wrist the dark purple bruises had faded away moving her arm without pain she hopped off the cot and slowly walked back to slytherin inside the common room she went across the chamber to sit beside malfoy on a long sofa he nodded to the tea tray in front of him want a cup yes please make one for me too while you re at it will you a laughingly disgusted voice protested merlin you re a chauvinist pig i ll say make her a cuppa for a change prince of slytherin fiona and morrigan plopped down beside their roommate on the sofa hazel eyes sparkling fiona cheekily ordered be mother and pour for all of us draco sneering at the auburn haired girl the blond nevertheless complied and made the homey ritual a thing of elegance handing blaise the first cup he muttered just because i like you to pour doesntmean i a chauvinist of course not and i enjoy doing it back at tarifa rico called me mamacita he smiled and then frowned i bet rico suave put a sexy in front of that the smarmy spaniard had a point though grey eyes darted away and then back you ve always been caring and i appreciate it for the second time that afternoon she had to blink back tears these were happy ones hey malfoy if you re finished with the touching friendship moment morrigan and i are dying of thirst over here blaise smiled when crabbe and goyle lumbered over heard fiona words and helpfully tried to pour a large mug full of tea down the protesting girl throat in order to save her beside her draco smirked and clinked his cup against hers drawling cheers footsteps slowing as she neared the entry on friday evening ginny finally understood why blaise had once avoided the great hall it was hard to take having someone you loved be so upset with you in the days since ron had broken the concealment spell on her heart charm they d spoken only a few times none of the occasions had been pleasant monday night she d seen him sitting alone on a sofa staring into the fireplace sitting down beside him the girl said whimsically in an effort to make him smile how fares my brother why is he so sad without looking at her ronald asked dully what that shakespeare i suppose malfoy knows every line of romeo and juliet that was from as you like it and no he doesn t remind me to owl the prophet give them the scoop right after dad submits the obituary lips twisting ron said bitterly for mum when it kills her to find out that her baby dating a death eater how many times do i have to tell you draco not like that jumping to his feet her brother shook his head before reaching into his pocket and tossing her the heart bracelet dontbother saying it again i ll never believe it watching ronald take the steps to the boys staircase two at a time she sighed unhappily everything okay gin colin gestured over to a table with a book and parchment on its surface i was finishing up an assignment when i saw you go talk to ron his blue gaze silently asked a question that she answered by lifting the bracelet kissing the heart and showing him the engraving with a simple he knows practically falling onto the sofa cushion beside her the blond shook his head in disbelief and malfoy is still breathing because she laughed without humor because ron trying to give me time to tell the folks in a way that wontmake them keel over in shock shaking her head at the look on his face ginny admitted i haventbeen able to get past dear mum and dad painful huh now remembering her friend comment caused the redhead to smile wistfully as she paused before the hall doors it was painful to go from having a normal up and down brother sister relationship to having one that was so strained it was like not having a relationship at all if she walked into the common room ron left it in the corridors he would look past her as if he didnteven see her harry and hermione always smiled and waved half heartedly but ginny could tell that they werenthappy about the situation either the other girl asked how are you doing at meals but their conversations were brief and falsely cheerful sitting beside three people who showed their disapproval by talking to everyone else but her at gryffindor table caused the girl stomach to knot until it was hard to eat after dinner on wednesday malfoy had met her in an unused classroom on the 5th floor he d taken one close look at her pale drawn features and asked what she d eaten when she couldntsay the teen marched over to the fireplace and commanded slinky appearing almost instantly the house elf bowed deferentially yes young master we re going up to the attics i want a light supper delivered to the solar looking toward her he asked what was the name of that salad you made on holiday salad parador right named after the castle we ll have that is that all young sir a bottle of grey eyes flickered to brown before continuing cider bowing until his bat like ears almost brushed the floor slinky backed into the fireplace and returned to the kitchens what are you smiling at draco tone as they headed down the corridor toward the stairs was playfully challenging she challenged just as teasingly were you going to say champagne steering her up to the attics a platinum brow arched did you want me to ginny shook her head no and then nodded up in the attics the slytherin drawled i think you ve been hanging around lovegood too much holding hands they made their way back to the re created medieval solar in the center of the chamber a table and two chairs stood ready under warming covers on gold chargers their food awaited taking the cider out of a nearby silver bucket her boyfriend poured the sparkling beverage into a rare venetian glass and handed one to her after seating her malfoy sat across the table and ordered eat the romantic atmosphere helped ginny regain her appetite they talked quietly about things that had happened in class that day in the candlelight his face was compellingly handsome and pensive do you think we could do this in hogsmeade share a meal in public because we dontcare who knows that we re together that gave her ten days to think of how to break the news to her folks in a way that wouldntget her confined to gryffindor house like terry boot was to ravenclaw she could do it pink lips curved upwards are you asking me to go with you to hogsmeade his boyish smile made her heart turn over yes i am will you spend the day with me i d love to the memory of time spent with draco gave ginny the nerve to open the enormous hall door slipping inside her eyes were drawn to the slytherin table malfoy was watching her he smiled she made their secret hand sign before taking her seat what that thing you ve been doing some kind of sign language whatever star ronald had been born under it was her unlucky one wherever she wanted to see him least he appeared and recently when she wanted him to remain unobservant he decided to be mr i spy pushing her fiery tresses back she shrugged that not an answer sick of her brother trying to be her keeper ginny snapped that the only one you re getting oh yeah yeah hermione held up a restraining hand toward each of the siblings honestly you two are acting just like a bigger prat than percy a little girl too stupid to figure out that she being used somebody been using ginny neville artless question made ron flush with embarrassment he shook his head no no bad joke forget it and tell us about that passion tree you ve been growing uh does it make you want to snog somebody if you eat the fruit sweat drops didntroll down her brother cheek when the other boy started explaining about the passionata fruit but his relief was palpable all the same he met her eyes and gave a grimace of apology she smiled faintly in return a tawny owl swooped down from the rafters and glided over gryffindor table to land in front of mcgonagall ginny idly wondered what the contents of the letter were her curiosity was soon satisfied ginevra weasley please come forward colin looked from the stern mien of the head of gryffindor to his friend are you in trouble ginny she tried to smile guess i ll soon find out a quick glance showed that draco was watching a frown of concern on his face standing in front of mcgonagall she said yes ma am in a low voice the teacher informed your parents have sent for you child professor mcgonagall will accompany you to the three broomsticks where you will floo home my dear dumbledore eyes werenttwinkling her stomach dropped am i being removed from school sir kindly he denied of course not but time is of the essence so please step this way his hand gestured to the staff entrance mcgonagall had already headed in that direction unable to help it ginny gaze gravitated to her boyfriend he was starting to rise from his seat but her shaking head and blaise restraining hand kept him from making a scene at gryffindor table ron was staring at her with an unhappy look on his face her eyes widened in realization he d owled mum and dad they were dragging her home because her self righteous lying bastard of a brother had gone back on his promise giving him a look of absolute loathing she ignored the whispers that were starting to swell and followed her teacher down a spartan corridor to the entryway outside the stars were beginning to shine the beauty of the night was lost on ginny all she could think was do they know if they know how much do they know what will they do what will i say what did ronald say oh merlin i could give him a bat bogey hex so easily right now the night breeze rustled the leaves of the trees alongside the path in silence mcgonagall led the way to hogsmeade with her wand providing illumination the severe expression and rigidly upright posture were more nerve wracking than if the older witch had expressed her disapproval verbally in the village the transfiguration professor briskly ushered gin into the pub and told rosmerta this student has been called home may we use your floo wiping her hands on the apron slung around her shapely waist the barkeep nodded of course go alon the back office once they d crossed the threshold of the small chamber ginny grabbed a handful of floo powder and stepped onto the hearth her head of house unbent enough to say i sure the matter will be resolved soon miss weasley i look forward to seeing you upon your return unable to do more than nod the girl said thank you professor taking a deep breath she threw the powder while saying her destination the lounge of the burrow didntlook like she remembered it the furniture was arranged the same the same books stood on the same shelves but everything was tidy the clutter was missing the items placed momentarily on tabletops and bookshelves that were normally forgotten and allowed to become part of the cozy ambiance were gone no magazines were scattered on the sofa table no owl post was stacked up on a shelf no piles of spare change muggle artifacts or empty teacups were strewn around all the surfaces were bare and dust free the window panes sparkled in the candlelight seeing the result of spring cleaning didntgive ginny a thank merlin i didnthave to help rush of enjoyment for some reason her insides cramped up in a spasm so great she dropped to her knees holding her abdomen as if trying to hold back the sight that told her something truly awful was about to happen ginny love are you alright her father kind concerned face came into view arthur lifted his daughter and held her close for a moment after she reassured him that she was fine he gently disengaged everything seemed slightly out of focus as she watched her dad step away ginny blinked away the sheen of tears and saw that beneath the anxiety for her health was a graver worry that frightened her terribly in dread she whispered daddy why did you send for me running a hand through his short ginger hair her father said your mother wanted to bring you home on sunday but i knew that wasnta good idea while her brain froze thinking shite sunday ron didnteven wait a day shite shite shite his lopsided smile made her throat start aching very emotional woman our molly i well i insisted she wait until the weekend when she we could talk with you more reasonably glancing around the room arthur noted absently i dontthink she ever done the spring cleaning with such enthusiasm before what your father means is that i ve been a madwoman why else would i clean underneath the bookcases turning slowly ginny met her mother bleak gaze and pressed her lips together tightly in order not to break down mum had looked like this before when gran died dragging around in an old bathrobe hair uncombed eyes red rimmed alternating between a zombie like state and raw anguished fury they had all stepped warily until molly had worked through her grief did did ron owl you mum shaking her head molly said distractedly ron dad asked why would ronald owl mum continued disregarding her husband question to focus on her child no ginevra your brother didnttattle on some little prank ginny watched apprehensively while her mum face began to harden brown eyes and twisted smile projecting the bitter humor in her voice you gave yourself away dear out of the pocket of her bathrobe molly took out a rectangular card staring at it in shock the girl mind flashed back to her sixteenth birthday the day had been bittersweet start to finish her family was beyond wonderful taking her to diagon alley for a shopping spree making her the center of attention all day fred george and bill had more than made up for her other brothers absence after the twins conjured paella for dinner they remembered that blaise had come by the shop the slytherin had asked them to hand deliver her birthday card since post from the zabinis wasntaccepted at the burrow anymore while mum dad and bill cleaned up after dinner fred and george gave her the card and left the lounge to give her privacy to open it after reading the birthday wishes from blaise and secret message from draco the twins came in and told her it was time to blow out the candles on her cake not wanting mum to see the card and ask questions ginny placed it on a bookshelf intending to come back and take it to her room later but she hadn t she d forgotten in the excitement of meeting draco in her father workshop later that night when he made her birthday wish come true just by being there and loving her a slender hand rose to cover her mouth she d blamed ron when all this time the card was just sitting there on the shelf with all the other clutter molly walked over to the bookshelf she d found it on and re enacted picking it up i thought nothing of a birthday card even one from that zabini girl until i read her message and the last line struck me as decidedly odd mum don t donttell me what to do ginevra molly weasley i ll thank you to keep your mouth shut until told otherwise do you hear the deep anger in her mother tone made ginny glad that they d waited to bring her home what must mum have been like sunday molly wrath flashed across her face before fading into a mirthless smile that was even harder to take you must admit say happy birthday sweet sixteen is quite strange even read aloud i couldntunderstand why the girl would write such a thing until i saw the message that became visible looking down at the card mum read tonelessly ginny i wish i could write this for the world to see but i guess my feelings like the sketches are better hidden for now happy birthday and when you blow out the candles if you make a wish about us i ll do my best to make it come true love draco smoothing the card over and over in a repetitive disturbing motion molly eyes blinked furiously for a moment before she took a breath and uttered numbly love draco it finally made sense then the way you d been acting over the last holidays the things you d said and your new friend now dearest i told you we should talk to ginny before jumping to conclusions walking to arthur side the plump sweet faced woman smiled briefly and affectionately stroked his cheek before turning to transfix her daughter with a grim gaze have i jumped to conclusions ginevra the girl buried her face in her hands wishing that she could go back and pick up that card or write the letter that she d never got past dear mum and dad she couldntgo back and she couldntlie anymore wiping her tears with the backs of her fingers like a little girl ginny whispered no a n this chap felt like the end of the empire strikes back you donthave to wait years to find out what happens to han solo and princess leia though does that perspective make it better didntthink so lo siento mucho wonderful understanding forgiving reviewers yes perceptive people i did indeed have draco use a variation of capn jack sparrow i may have deserved that lines from when he kept getting slapped in potc had to add a little humour luvs to help our love boat ride the waves of angst d chapter 41 turn turn turn ginny saw first hand the power of the spoken word the moment she said no that molly wasntjumping to conclusions in thinking that her daughter past actions had been driven by a secret relationship with draco her mum bent forward as though absorbing a body blow arthur placed an arm around his wife and led her toward the sofa molly gazed despairingly at him was it something we did have we tried to protect her from evil and horror too much should we have told her exactly how harry parents died how our family and friends were tortured and executed without mercy her hands clutched at him what could we have done to prevent this we ve raised our children the best we could there comes a time when they alone are responsible for their actions arthur told his daughter firmly have a seat we re going to talk ginny sat in a chair diagonal from her parents brushing away hair that had clung to her tear streaked face what do you want to know molly had a dull faraway look on her face when did you first start seeing m that boy october her mother shifted from apathy back to anger all that time you ve hidden this this folly brown eyes turned hard why would a slytherin like him a boy with the reputation he earned stay with one girl all this time what did you give him to keep his interest young lady now molly arthur restraining hand was pushed away as her mum leaned forward are you still a virgin ginevra if ginny could apparate she would be long gone hurt and furious at the assumption that draco would only want her for sex she shot back yes and not because of me i said he didnthave to stop he the one who said i was too young that it wouldntbe right i did not raise my daughter to be a slut cheeks flushed with anger ginny glared at her equally red faced mother i not a slut if we had made love i wouldntbe any different than you mum molly jerked her head back as though she had been slapped i i dontknow what you re talking about oh really then someone else carved molly prewett loves arthur weasley with all her heart body and soul on the back wall of the large linen cupboard on the fifth floor it was her mum turn to look shocked and horrified they stared at each other in taut silence arthur drew his wife attention by taking her hand he gave her a small smile that the way i ve always felt about you molly face softened i promised to wear your ring forever i ve never taken it off and i never will the deep love her parents shared made ginny turn her face away blinking furiously why is my loving someone any different just because he a malfoy he a slytherin from a family of death eaters and you canttrust him before ginny could do more than open her mouth her father interjected your cousins the blacks were a family of death eaters and my family told me not to trust you dear molly surged to her feet she went to stare out the window arms crossed defensively arthur saw his daughter disbelief yes i afraid the weasleys have always been a narrow minded clan it wasntuntil gideon and fabian prewett died working for the order in the fight against you know who that my family came round to the idea of us getting married they didntjust die molly said furiously they were murdered in cold blood by death eaters she pinned ginny with a gimlet stare saying in a low cold voice and your boyfriend father was one of the killers dearest please we dontknow that for sure molly took a step toward her husband i know because the bastard told me so himself hearing ginny gasp she smiled cynically wondering how lucius malfoy could let something like that slip i wasntalways plump dear once upon a time i was quite pretty you were beautiful and you still are her mother fleeting loving smile upon hearing arthur sincere words made ginny remember those old photos she used to love to watch mum had indeed been vivacious and so pretty that it wasntany wonder her dad had fallen for her molly smile turned bitter when we first married i tried to stay in touch with the other side of my family the blacks always threw a yule party and we attended the one narcissa held in her mansion she leaned over the back of the sofa to place her hand on her husband shoulder i never told you love because i didntwant you to retaliate but lucius cornered me in an upper corridor after i d gone to find a loo and did he put his hands on you she nodded he tried to coax me into a nearby bedroom said no one would ever know he wanted to give me a present when i refused lucius said i made him regret sparing a single prewett arthur jumped to his feet moving to gather his wife into his arms ginny cried draco is not his father why cantyou see that why wontyou give him a chance molly looked at her daughter with haunted eyes i cantrisk it i just can t arthur cleared his throat ginny why dontyou go make a pot of tea while i take your mother upstairs yes yes i too tired to talk anymore said molly we ll we ll speak on this again later she leaned against her husband shoulder shuffling out of the room like an old lady numb from all the revelations ginny walked over and picked up the birthday card from blaise and draco unconsciously she smoothed it several times before placing it inside her pocket in the kitchen she added water to the kettle on the aga her dad had brought it home out of a love for all things muggle the range didntwork but they used magic instead of heating elements anyway she made two cups of tea adding two cubes of sugar to each upstairs she paused outside her parents room everything will work out darling wait and see arthur said bracingly we ve been through rougher patches than this my love but what if he hurts her or uses her to get to harry or puts our baby in vol his clutches again i wontsurvive losing another child i won t throat aching with the effort of suppressing another round of tears ginny knocked on the door when he opened the door she silently offered the mugs thank you sweetheart why dontyou run along to your room for awhile kissing her on the cheek he closed the door and returned to the woman whose pitiful keening was so gut wrenching ginny ran to her room to escape it sobbing into her pillow to muffle the sound she cried herself to sleep hours later a hand smoothed back her hair she murmured draco no it fred and george he cut me off at the stairs to get here first dontbe jealous brother i ve always had the better moves not with the ladies old man and that where they count the cheerful banter brought a reluctant smile to ginny face i guess you know huh they exchanged a quick glance before explaining together ron owled glad now that she hadnthexed her brother she tried to smile but the effort was pitiful and the identical faces looked back at her in concern they enveloped her in a double hug now now it not the end of the world gin blossom gin blossom crikey fred you promised not to call her that anymore when she turned ten oh yeah sorry she smiled more naturally i dontmind so much anymore carrot top running over to the mirror fred and george both scrutinised their red hair not carroty at all is it gred indeed not forge why just last night you said that alicia l uh liked it amazed to find she could actually laugh at the guilty look on her brothers faces she said alicia i heard a rumour you two were dating french twins who alicia alicia spinnet george examined his fingernails fred smirked cantyou see that our brother is in the throes of true love george punched him in the shoulder why dont you tell her that you and angelina are back together big mouth returning the jab fred snapped take a look in the mirror and shut it big mouth no you shut it be quiet or be hexed ginny said loudly the smugly curving mouths revealed that the pair were pleased the contrived squabble had distracted their little sister from her worries and tears pinching both of them on the arm ginny ignored their yelps and threats to tell on her she asked have you seen mum is she any better if lying on the bed staring off like the living dead instead of crying is an improvement then yeah she better said george a tear rolled down ginny cheek do you hate me for breaking her heart again two identical sets of brown eyes flickered sideways in wordless communication turning as one to look at her the pair shook their heads if we hated you would we give you this ginny recognised the bold handwriting and felt her heart slam in her chest george said dad asked us to make sure you dontrun off or do something equally rash so we ll be watching the corridor outside your room sorry they exited with remorseful smiles she couldntbe angry that her brothers had been officially made her keepers not when they d given her a message from the one person she d most longed to hear from ginny took the precious letter to the window seat carefully sliding a fingernail underneath the wax seal she smiled through tears an hour after curfew luna tossed and turned in her bed sleep was impossible when her mind was racing with so many unanswered questions why had ginny been sent home did her parents know they had lied about easter holiday if they did did her father know yet was he going to yank her out of school too she sat up and punched her pillows flat before fluffing them back up she flopped down to stare up at the canopy overhead first year she had affixed night glowing stars to the fabric so she would have something interesting to look at in the darkness the softly luminescent constellations were relaxing to gaze upon although they didntmake her drowsy staring fixedly at the stars did allow the girl to drift into state between waking and sleep that allowed her imagination to form a vision she had seen before once upon a dream luna her stepmother shrill voice wafted up through the open attic window with a resigned sigh she trudged down two flights of stairs and stood in the doorway of the master suite yes cease standing there gawking girl and come in luna stepped into the room that had been redecorated after her father remarriage into something resembling a pink bordello she avoided looking into a narrowed green gaze ivanna lovegood was always looking for an excuse to discipline her new daughter and she had learned to avoid giving her one scrubbing and cooking the muggle way were not how she wanted to spend her time mumsie mumsie did the invitation come did it did it two young ladies burst into the chamber the woman lying upon the bed with an eye mask pushed up to rest like a bizarre tiara on a pile of blonde hair was distracted from whatever scold she d been about to deliver identically blonde and petite mary kate and ashley werentwicked stepsisters just annoying ones they followed their new sister about asking empty headed questions like do you like sleeping up in that pokey room in the attic and you re so good at cleaning and conjuring spells is that why mumsie always has you doing them they practically quivered with eagerness while waiting for the answer to their simultaneously asked question when a thin red tipped hand lifted a small enveloped embellished with a lavish crest the girls shrieked in unison yay yay we re going to the ball together ashley and mary kate bounded over to luna and danced around her is this not the most exciting news ever we have to go shopping ivanna waited for her girls to quiet yes darlings we will go shopping turning to her stepdaughter the older woman frowned even you ungrateful wretch that you are the malfoys have invited all pure blooded young ladies in the hopes that the heir will finally choose a suitable bride will he choose us mumsie ivanna spoke slowly and carefully as she explained not for the first time no darlings he can only pick one of you unless you want to go live in a tent in the desert my loves husband sharing is not an option oh they said together dismissed to allow the witch to prepare for a gruelling day of shopping the three girls made their way downstairs the twins gave their orders for breakfast and luna continued on to the kitchen to conjure the requested food she didntmind too much waiting on her stepsisters they were rather amusing at times and merlin knew the girls were a trial to their mother which was their best quality she laughed to herself over the thought of them marrying an arab sheik and asking their new husband why they had to wear veils later she followed behind the trio leaving a trail of devastation in their wake searching every diagon alley dress shop luna paused to gaze into ye olde curiosity shoppe on the other side of the glass a handsome young man smiled at her she smiled back and impulsively entered the shop when he gestured for her to come inside hello she said shyly he returned her greeting merrily bright blue eyes twinkling shopping for the ball hmmm looking for that special gown to catch a pure blood prince eye she shook her head no i am not interested in princes a golden eyebrow rose with a smile that caused adorable dimples to deepen he said really what kind of man are you looking for miss luna luna lovegood and i do not know actually maybe a pirate a flashing white smile accompanied the pleased laughter that rang out at her words on the other side of the shop a clerk said your spyglass is wrapped and ready captain roberts luna stared wide eyed the captain winked lifted her hand to his lips and murmured please call me wesley the piercing sound of her name being called caused the girl to back away she said regretfully i must go goodbye captain wesley watched her walk backwards with a roguish grin until we meet again bella luna sharp fingernails dug into the girl arm causing her to gasp and whirl around to face the woman who would never replace her mother stop flirting like a common trull ivanna said and go inside madame defarge and try on the gown i picked out for you after one last wistful glance back luna dutifully went into the dress shop she tried on the gown turning from side to side to see if there was possibly one redeeming feature to the ballgown there wasn t the velvet looked as though it had the mange with all the worn patches on the beige surface the overwhelming plainness was highlighted by the lack of lace trim or embroidery with the high neck and empire waist the gown looked like it belonged to a a pregnant governess that is what luna dress reminds me of ashley said mary kate remember when we paid a morning call on the notts and their third cousin by marriage had gotten in trouble and had to come be a governess her dress looked just like that no it did not it was grey oh the girls noticed their stepsister overheard them and had the grace to blush mary kate said at least you do not look pregnant that was such a consolation rushing into the dressing area luna wondered why it still hurt whenever her stepmother showed how much she despised the living reminder of her husband beloved first wife she admitted to herself that she d had a fantasy of dancing at the ball with a handsome pirate and the dress had shattered it who would want to dance with a girl as frumpy as she was going to be thankfully father had gone on another business trip so she didnthave to pretend that she was content going to the ball in a glorified potato sack when she sat facing the three decked out in satin and jewels on the carriage seat opposite luna was glad that she d never had a problem with motion sickness although she wouldntmind heaving onto her stepmother gaudy scarlet and black ensemble identical in blue ruffled gowns the twins were arguing over who looked prettier you look gorgeous mary kate no you are going to be the fairest of them all ashley i must protest draco malfoy is going to fall instantly in love with you mk sister spare my blushes i know he is going to want to dance only with you and that for the rest of the night he will tell every other man that you are his partner stop that inane babbling this instant ivanna screeched luna giggled inside to hear the woman have to placate the twins in order to avert a crying jag that would ruin their makeup and her plans for being the mother in law of the heir to the malfoy fortune once at the mansion that made the ironically named mrs lovegood sigh with covetousness a footman assisted the ladies down from the carriage inside the stately entry three of the guests moved toward the ballroom luna lingered behind when she heard someone call her name pssst up here come upstairs quickly dramatic as ever luna childhood friend blaise didntstop gesturing imperiously until the girl had slipped up the grand staircase in a gossamer creation of silver and gold the curly haired young woman looked every inch the pampered princess dark brows rising at the sight of the gown she condemned as a crime against couture the zabini heiress pulled her former playmate into her bedroom she told the redhead waiting inside look what those witches forced our dear friend to wear i think the tweenie who empties the chamber pots is wearing a nicer gown to the servants ball yes she is but do you have to be so blunt ginny weasley said with a smile hello luna it has been a long time your stepmother never admits visitors and returns letters so we figured it would be easier to grab you as you entered being hugged was a strange experience familiar and yet not since it had been years since anyone had placed their arms around her luna returned the hug hello my thanks for saving me from the embarrassment of entering the ballroom in my pathetic finery how are you ginny lifted a chain out of the bodice of her emerald green gown her lightly freckled face glowed with happiness i am betrothed secretly until tonight when we announce it to everyone luna eyes widened you mean but this ball blaise laughed at her amazement yes it is all a plot once a noble formally announces his betrothal it cannot be broken are we not clever an admiring smile accompanied luna nod oh the cleverness of you wait until you see your dress cinderella blaise winked you shall say it like you mean it then ginny pressed a portion of the wall which slid away to reveal a hidden dressing room leading the wary blonde into the chamber she pointed to the dress hanging from a mannequin in the middle of the large space what do you think the ice blue gown with silver embroidery and lace was like nothing to be found in a diagon alley dress shop it was parisian exquisite and it is too costly i cannot you will the unanimous expression was followed by waves of two wands in a trice her friends had shredded her beige gown smiling all the while left with no alternative luna remembered her mother family motto flecti non frangi may we bend not be broken she said oh the cleverness of you laughing and hugging her again the friends quickly summoned a house elf the reflection in the mirror once they had finished was like something out of a fairytale maybe it was the intricately curled upswept hair or the charmed glass slippers whatever the reason luna had never felt more beautiful and for once in her life actually looked forward to going to a party instead of longing to be home with a book downstairs the young ladies were announced to the gathering in the ballroom with a courtly flourish two men approached one brown haired one blond the blue eyes of the darker man smiled as he reached blaise side and bent to kiss her hand after complimenting his partner he said good evening miss lovegood i must say you are looking exceedingly lovely thank you mr boot the blond man whose classic features put the nearby statuary to shame echoed the sentiment bent over ginny hand and swept her off to join the dancers in a waltz luna watched draco and ginny circle the room she turned to blaise and terry saying please do not feel you have to keep me company not when i am so eager to keep yours said a voice from luna daydreams vivid blue eyes gleamed with an interest she returned in full smiling widely as wesley captain roberts thanked his old schoolmate terry for procuring him an invitation luna acceded to the formal request for a dance he told her about himself as they waltzed and asked how she spent her days held closer than absolutely proper to a man who would probably scandalise half the pure blood snobs in the room by his cheerfully admitted mixed parentage and dubious occupation of privateer she gladly allowed him to manoeuvre her out a set of french doors on the terrace standing together in the moonlight he said if i pay you a call in the morning would i be admitted sadly she shook her head stepmother does not permit me to entertain callers he cupped her cheek with his hand bella luna if i told you i fell in love with you at first sight and ask you to run away with me sail into the horizon explore the world with me as my wife will you come her lips curved kiss me the touch of his mouth made everything she d ever longed for coalesce into one need to leave her old life and begin a voyage of love the shrill voice of her stepmother sounded inside the ballroom people were clapping and two young ladies were sobbing luna took wesley hand and ran with him to the stables never once looking back still lying on her bed in ravenclaw tower luna breathing became slow and deep against the blue velvet canopy enchanted representations of stars glimmered softly with a contented sigh she drifted off to sleep with a smile on her face two hours past curfew blaise tried to sleep but couldn t in the great hall she d been so afraid that draco would storm up to the headmaster and demand to know why ginny was being removed from school after dinner he had paced like a caged lion in the common room snarling at everyone who tried to ask what was wrong that it was none of their damn business all she could do was try to reassure him that ginny would use her melusine mirror sooner or later as minutes crawled slowly past until hours had eventually gone by her best mate mood had become so dark and brooding that she had said why dontyou go for a ride take your broom out over the lake or something the weasleys are probably just trying to make sure their little girl isntunder a love spell or pregnant white blond brows had arched disdainfully even while sculptured lips twitched you cantget pregnant from kissing zabini so stop worrying what a relief maybe now i ll stop dreaming about having triplets the short laugh her sarcasm earned had made blaise smile draco said thanks for putting up with me i think i ll go take that broomride good night good night the greengrass twins had trailed blaise up the girls staircase what made malfoy so grumpy are you two fighting easily shaking off two sets of twig thin fingers blaise said none of your damn business the thought of how much the twins had resembled fish opening and closing their mouths in disbelief made her snicker softly even while considering slipping out of the dorm to go see if ginny had mirrored draco yet waiting sucked she felt her own mirror become warm beneath her pillow and sat up a whispered lumos minor provided soft light in her enclosed bed blaise pulled out a small square to look down into terry reflected face hey baby did i wake you he said no i cantsleep worrying about everything his slow smile made her pulse leap in anticipation how about a ride in the moonlight suddenly she noticed that long brown strands were blowing across his face are you yes go open the window blaise slid off the bed and tiptoed over to the window after performing a warming charm no way was she going to go on a romantic ride in the moonlight bundled up in layers of clothes to keep from getting chilled when she clambered onto the wide ledge her boyfriend said uh arentyou going to get cold he was wearing denims and a long sleeved jersey she grinned warming charm why dontyou like my outfit she was wearing a white tank and hip hugging fitted white boxers terry wolfish smile gleamed in the darkness oh i like it hop on blaise sat leaning back against his chest his arm anchored her while she closed the double windows almost all the way she turned her head to the side to gaze at him happily as they rose into the air and headed toward the lake terry said i was studying by candlelight when a bloke on a broomstick rapped on my window he offered me his spare firebolt and suggested that you might enjoy a ride in the moonlight he chuckled i sat gaping for about two seconds before grabbing the broomstick all i could say was thanks mate did draco fall off his broom no he said yeah fine whatever keep the broom hidden because if someone finds it i ll say it was stolen his husky laugh made her giggle and sent a shiver down her spine you slytherins donttake compliments or gratitude easily do you feel free to compliment me all you want i will terry fingers slipped underneath the tank to caress her abdomen while he told her how much he loved the contrast between her skin and the white fabric he went on to describe other things he loved flying above the lake with the moonlight glimmering on the surface was a magical experience after circling the water they touched down beside a familiar willow beneath the fronds ending in tips resembling a dragon claw blaise saw the blanket on the ground she stretched out on it i was reminded tonight that kissing doesntcause pregnancy good thing hmmm terry removed his jersey before stretching his warm firm body against hers too bad i wanted to go for triplets when she laughed he leaned over her silky hair brushing her cheeks think that funny do you how about this this was a kiss that took breath and laughter away returning the sweet pressure her hands began to slide over the muscular planes of his back while his fingers slowly pushed up the hem of her tank outside their shadowy hiding place a man spoke you finally came i wondered if you d ever have the nerve blaise froze it was the new ancient runes professor hook terry held her close while they silently listened a woman said you have a nerve james hook sending owl after owl to flap against my window with one note after another to meet you at this this willow you were seen leaving after a tryst with lorelei a tryst why sybil haventyou heard that the potions professor is faithful to her lover the potions master no perhaps you should come down out of your tower more often m dear blaise could see terry eyes widen in amazement she felt the same way what in merlin name was going on here the indignant divination teacher cried stop wrapping my hair around that blasted hook you gave up any and all right to touch my person when you left me james the girl fingers tightened their grip on the boy shoulders in surprise on the other side of the concealing branches the man said you told me if i left on my last assignment it would be over between us because i would die a grisly death hook voice lowered what twists your knickers tighter sybil the fact that i stayed away when you told me to or that i didntdie i had a prophetic vision james i saw the crocodile guardian of that egyptian tomb drag you down to a watery grave i was horrified distraught trelawney voice rose how could you stay away when you knew i didntreally mean it the eavesdroppers held each other tighter in reaction to the emotion in the woman voice before she ran away sobbing silence fell before the sound of a match lighting and the smell of cigar smoke drifted through the fronds hook said reflectively i thought you did mean it m dear what a fine kettle of fish i didnteven ask my questions ah well perhaps i should observe my colleague s class after all as headmaster dumbledore used to say if at first you dontsucceed try try again once the mysterious professor had ambled back to the castle terry kissed her briefly we had probably better get back to our dorms she hugged him where should we meet tomorrow to try try again blaise smiled at his suggestion of the linen cupboard on the fifth floor and laughed throatily when he offered to try for those triplets through kissing a little while longer tonight when the lights of hogwarts had been dimmed for three and a half hours draco lay sleepless he was tired of waiting for ginny to contact him if patience was a virtue then virtue was overrated earlier he had written a note and swallowed his pride to go to gryffindor tower the first year he had ordered to go tell ronald weasley that someone wanted to see him out in the corridor had looked curiously at his hooded and cloaked figure but hadntscraped up the nerve to ask for his name not that he would ve told the little snotrag if questioned he had stood in the shadows across from the nosy painting that kept trying to guess his identity waiting impatiently for weasley to get his arse outside finally the portrait lifted a lanky redhead had looked around saw him and called oi who are you and what do you want i a ferret who wants a favour blue eyes bugged out in a way that might ve been amusing if draco had been in a mood to appreciate the humour of the situation as it was he gestured sharply for the other boy to leave the doorway and walk over to where the avidly listening guardian painting would be unable to hear he held out and envelope would you owl this to those twin brothers of yours they ll probably be called to go home when they do they can slip this note to ginny weasley had demanded tell me what it says first several deep breaths had enabled him to calm and quote from memory ginny i sorry things turned out this way if i could i d be like the bloke in one of those sonnets you like saying he broke off reluctant to share something so personal what if you donttell me i wontsend it draco had closed his eyes unable to force out the words if he had to look at weasley face such is my love to thee i so belong that for thy right myself will bear all wrong let me know you re okay looking as though he was about to spew a slug the boy scrunched his face unhappily fine i ll go to the owlery but it isntbecause i feel guilty about anything it for ginny and this is the only letter i sending i ll accompany you weasley had said over his shoulder keep your hood up i dontwant anyone to see me walking with you like i d be overjoyed shut the bloody hell up ferret draco had shut up and ginny hot tempered brother had sent a note attached to a message to his siblings in diagon alley as the hours passed his slytherin inner voice kept coming up with ominous reasons why she hadntcontacted him maybe her parents have called in aurors to make sure she isntunder a spell potion or an imperius perhaps they re just making her tell them all the details of the relationship the how what when where and why or they could be taking her out of the country transferring her to another school so a wicked malfoy cantcorrupt an innocent weasley anymore the thought of his girlfriend being interrogated crying made sleep impossible he tried to think happy thoughts but even imagining ginny in a leopard print bikini on a hammock became darkened by the knowledge that he might never see her that way again draco blaise had opened his bed curtains she held a wand with a softly glowing tip he frowned what are you doing up here at this time of night where your invisibility cloak she sat on the edge of his bed when terry brought me back to my room i saw the messenger bag i keep the cloak in and had a flash of inspiration i threw on a robe and hurried up to see you why werentyou wearing a robe even in dim light he could see her blush warming charm and that has nothing to do with anything dontinterrupt when he smirked she pretended to glare before grinning i ran down to the common room with the bag called for slinky and asked him to pop over to the burrow and give it to ginny along with a message he jack knifed upright tell me what you wrote i said that you wanted to see her i asked ginny to reply and say whether she thought that she could use the cloak to sneak out of the house and meet you in her father workshop she offered a scrap of parchment here merlin his fingers were shaking he unfolded the message draco i wontbe okay until i see you fred and george have guard duty but i know i can sneak round them and meet you in the workshop he yanked open the curtains and checked the time on the fireplace mantel clock i ve only got half an hour what do i do draco bounded over to his trunk and began to dig through meticulously folded clothing unselfconsciously he changed rapidly while commanding dontjust stand there staring think of something blaise placed her hands on her hips hey if you strip i going to stare it one of the perks of being your best mate what mine well since i not going to flaunt my body you ll have to make do with my brilliant ideas she placed her hand on his arm squeezing it reassuringly fly over to the hog head since it never seems to close and use their floo he smiled i ve said it before and i ll say it again you re the best draco bounded downstairs he jogged through the empty corridors to the shed holding his firebolt a quick counter spell to unlock the door and he was soon pushing off into a vertical lift and headed toward hogsmeade he sauntered into the hog head tavern the unsavoury patrons watched curiously as he headed straight for the back room where re you going demanded the barman draco tossed him a pouch of galleons without stopping he quickly entered the bare chamber and crossed to the fireplace stepping out onto the workshop hearth a few moments later he barely had time to brush off the remnants of powder before ginny hurtled across the space and into his arms i so happy you re here i loved your note but i needed to see you so much kisses were rained over his face between words ending in an urgent moulding of her lips to his he responded the anxiety he d felt over the last hours expressing itself without words passionate almost rough kisses and caresses reassured that he was really there they were really together slowly the embrace changed to softer deeper kisses when his lips finally pulled away from hers ginny buried her head against his chest this night been the worst of my life worse than finding out dad was in hospital worse than when gran or sirius died he didntwant to ask but made himself did did they say you couldntsee me anymore no they re still in shock that i lied about it all this time she saw his expression and took his face in her hands i dontcare what they say i not giving you up i love you good because i love you and i wontlet you go the tender kiss he pressed to her forehead led to kisses being brushed against her eyelids over the cinnamon coloured freckles sprinkled across her cheeks and rubbed across her mouth before his lips parted hers and his tongue glided inside he slid a hand through silky red tresses to cup her nape gently holding her in place while he explored her mouth her fingers clenched in his hair while she pressed closer there was a soft tapping sound draco eyes snapped open to see two identical faces pressed against the window staring in their expressions were disbelieving and resigned at the same time ginny sweet drowsy look changed to alarm one of the twins raised his hand in a half hearted wave closing her eyes his girl groaned oh merlin his thought exactly a n i have to thank elspethbates who reviewed sixteen candles and imagined fred and george peeking in the window to see draco kissing ginny very inspiring mental image that was the sonnet draco quoted was number 88 luna dream was inspired by grimm fairy tales and way too many regency romances peter pan saying oh the cleverness of me and mercedes in the count of monte cristo telling edmond that she d never removed the silk thread ring that she d used for a substitute engagement ring did anyone else wonder why it hadntrotted in sixteen years lol hook and trelawney was anyone surprised yes i did enjoy making it a crocodile guardian who got his hand i promise it doesntcome after him at hogwarts ticking d if anyone wants something to read while waiting for the next chapter to post they could always read the fred angelina one shot halloween treat or the george alicia story christmas sweet chapter 42 when dreams do show me thee draco held ginny tighter returning the stare of the identical weasels on the other side of the glass if they came in trying to kick his arse the jokers would find out they needed more than potty to get the better of him these days when the twins entered and stood looking from him to their sister like they couldntdecide what to say or who to say it to he made the decision for them i came to make sure ginny was all right the redheads exchanged glances before the one on the left said seemed like you came to make out right george right fred some nerve the ferret has coming here after all the trouble he caused ginny said draco hasntcaused any trouble if you want to blame someone blame me i the one who wanted us to hide the fact that we re together i thought i could bring the family round you re the one going round round the twist if you think that ever going to happen i think she knows that fred so what are we going to do hell if i know george march them up to the house wake up mum and dad no the twins crossed their arms in unison after hearing ginny protest give us a reason why we shouldn t draco slipped his arm around his girlfriend waist he said it only going to upset your parents more is that what you want the pair shook their heads after a few minutes of uncomfortable silence fred asked what do you care if they re upset last i heard you thought our dad was a useless loser and our mum fat and ugly was what you called her before the sneer was beaten off your face george finished draco didntdeny meaning the words at the time he could only say that was then whoever is happy will make others happy too he shrugged i wasn t the twins gaped did he just quote that muggle girl we learnt about at school ginny said why shouldnthe quote anne frank because you expect him to be a pure blood snob and you re too prejudiced yourselves to give draco a chance fred and george were looking at each other in that weird silent communication thing twins did one set of red eyebrows lifted the other contracted in a frown one weasley stared meaningfully the other rolled his eyes before blowing a breath that lifted an overlong fringe the duo said as one okay we wonttell the frowner probably still holding a grudge over the sore lip draco once gave him said in return malfoy going to leave right now and promise not to come back a slytherin inner voice hissed that promises made under duress could not be enforced in a court of law draco was tempted to say anything they wanted to hear and do what he wanted later realising that he had to find some way to get along with his girlfriend family he chose to be honest no matter how much it went against everything he had ever been taught i ll leave but i promise nothing except that i love ginny faces scrunching like they d eaten a puking pastille out of one of their skivving snackboxes the brothers groaned blimey he said the l word i heard george ginny left draco side you donthave to like me dating a malfoy i not asking you to go to a quidditch match together just respect the fact that i love him and donttry and break us up could he get us box seats fred asked george elbowed his brother i ll try he told ginny but i promise nothing fair enough draco said catching the girl who had thrown herself back into his arms he returned her hug i suppose i d better get back you re not going anywhere until somebody tells me what the hell going on the four inside the workshop startled in the subdued light cast by a single illumination orb the man in the doorway face was as shadowed and sinister as his tone unimpressed by the man dragon hide clothing and tough guy act draco watched impassively while george stepped forward fred jerked his head toward the fireplace george ll distract him make a run for it ginny gave draco a little push hurry go draco went but not fast enough petrificus totalus frozen in place his eyes could only stare helplessly at a shelf holding numerous small copper cylinder shaped things beside him ginny yelled you let him go bill weasley or or or what you ll hex me since i the one with a wand sister i not too worried fred said tell mum and dad he came to see her in the morning if you have to but dontwake them up they ve dealt with enough for one night if draco could have blinked in surprise he would have but he was totally immobilised listen to them bill this isntthe way to go said george a laugh of disbelief rang out a malfoy a slytherin is in the workshop with his arms around our little sister in the middle of the night and you want me to let him go bill said harshly i finish an assignment find dad owl with the cryptic message to come home soon as possible and then i step out of the fireplace to see you two sneaking out the back door he took a deep breath to bellow what the bloody hell is going on in this family ginny tone was pleading we ll tell you everything i promise after you release the spell no the sound of something crashing to the floor immediately followed the unequivocal answer oomph get off me you nutters sorry bill no can do grab his wand ginny she immediately broke the spell draco whirled around to view the twins wrestling their older brother ginny pointed the wand in her hand petrificus totalus instantly bill struggles ceased rising to their feet the twins shook their heads george moaned this is a bigger fiasco than that broomstick panty raid we tried to pull fifth year speak for yourself angelina gave me her panties ballocks you never turned in oh gods you kept her panties you pervert fred lifted his hands hey i tried to give them back but she a blush to rival his hair covered weasley face when he caught sight of the two listening uh he said let take billy boy to the house before we counter the spell yeah say goodbye to malfoy said george i have a feeling we re going to be having a he put his fingers up and made quoting motions family talk the twins used locomotor mortis to transport bill prone form out of the workshop once they were alone draco gazed down to see his girl eyes shining with a combination of tears and laughter he used the pad of his thumb to wipe away the moisture from dark red eyelashes tenderly he placed a tender kiss to her lips you need to go she said he took her hands in his that why i going to stay no i yes i going to talk to your family tell them how i feel how we feel if they still hate me hate us being together then fine at least i ll have tried when they walked through the back door bill was slumped over his arms at the kitchen table a platinum brow winged upwards prompting the twins downing beer by the fridge to start talking he was a bit tetchy so we thought a good night sleep might improve bill temper fred and george seemed to realise at the same time he was in their home they demanded of their sister in unison what he doing here we want to talk to the family together said ginny the duo silently conferred one shook his head the other nodded the first one made a face his brother shrugged as if to say what else can we do they both heaved aggrieved sighs the brother who had originally objected said flatly mum and dad need their sleep so no waking them up we can talk in the morning hearing his girl thank george draco told the other twin fine where do i bunk automatically his eyes slid to ginny she smiled george scowled donteven think about it slytherin you re lucky to get a sleeping bag on our floor draco walked upstairs behind the twins holding ginny hand it was strange to be in this house and be memorable throwing a wistful and nostalgic glance at her bedroom door he kept his audience in mind and merely kissed her hand before whispering good night a short time later the twins were snoring softly in their bunks while he stretched out on a sleeping bag on the floor he d comfort charmed staring up at the ceiling in the midst of wondering what the morning would bring draco fell asleep in those same early hours when the sky over hogwarts had not yet begun to lighten and morpheus god of sleep reigned over its inhabitants a girl in the slytherin dorm began to dream blaise stood beside her father while the boat tied up at the dock she looked out at the exotic landscape and felt oddly at home on the shore a group of native people waited to bear their equipment to the distant unexplored mountains of the mutia escarpment a lean blond man joined them at the railing africa uncivilised dangerous and without a decent pub remind me why i returned she smiled you wanted to find the fabled elephant graveyard full of ivory and become filthy rich colin the incorrigible adventurer replied lightly that my excuse you zabinis are already filthy rich what yours her father flashed a white smile around his cheroot adventure creevey colin dogged blaise steps as they made their way from boat to land he said the only adventure i need is you a bottle of champagne and dancing in the moonlight that kind of adventure dangerous too you almost fell into the thames during our bon voyage party after conferring with the local guide on the route in the man native language and sending him back to oversee the baggage train after a handshake colin said i was only trying to steal a kiss you didnthave to push me so hard laughing at the man who looked like an angel but was such a charming devil blaise fondly kissed his cheek yes i did your lady friend wouldnthave appreciated the display of affection and i like you too much to lead you on when i know i need someone else enrique zabini called impatiently for his daughter and their english guide to join him the safari was ready to begin the pair hurried forward that night after camp had been set up and dinner served and cleared away blaise stretched her feet toward the fire she told the man lounging in a camp chair beside her arentwe thankful for wizard made gear the thought of trekking through jungles and up mountains in muggle clothing that easily rips and stains and boots that blister would make this adventure a lot less enjoyable colin gave her fine white cotton blouse and long khaki skirt an admiring glance before smirking canthave little rich girls roughing it taking a sip from a silver flask he asked earlier today you started to mention the type of bloke you need if it isnthandsome witty and charming what is it she stared into the flames intense i a one man woman so i need a one woman man a sidelong look caught the grimace her companion made blaise giggled dontthink you re that type well one day you ll change your mind but until then i like you anyway my friend focusing on the fire once more she said wistfully is it too much to want someone that not only handsome and charismatic but loyal and loves me as passionately as i going to love him no but are you sure you wontsettle for wants you passionately she snagged his flask and tossed it across the fire into the dense underbrush no and lay off the firewater bwana because if you sneak into my tent trying to convince me otherwise i going to hex the parts you value most on the way back to her tent blaise couldnthelp laughing softly when the rouge called that was your father flask the safari progressed uneventfully until the party reached the base of the escarpment and began to climb the trail was narrow and treacherous in places but the group pressed onward and upward colin shared that a muggle expedition would have lost several bearers to precarious ledges and crevices due to the weight of gear not lightened by spells shaking her head over the sad loss of life blaise adjusted her pith helmet to block the sun and kept climbing once they reached the trail their african guide assured them lead to a river enrique called for the expedition to halt for a much needed break after a simple noon meal the safari continued at the edge of the riverbank elephant tracks evoked cries of excitement from enrique colin and the workers blaise gazed at the untouched beauty of the river and jungle beyond that was the real treasure large rafts were constructed to cross the river sitting beside her father on a crate blaise pointed to approaching shapes in the water are those hippos he frowned yes a herd can be dangerous if they overturn us crocodiles would enjoy the snack he called to colin on the other raft get your wand out we may have to use them aversion charms kept the hippos from swimming close enough to capsize the rafts once the party was safely on land the animals followed them up the riverbank before the three had to resort to harsher curses to ensure safety a cry echoed aaah eee aaah the hippos retreated to the water relieved and curious blaise wondered aloud what or who colin laughed nervously surely you dontthink something human made that call it was an animal of course and only a co incidence that the herd lost interest in us the safari regrouped and entered the jungle finding a safe place to camp for the night warding the perimeter against predatory animals and creepy crawlies the young woman heard the sound of rushing water and decided to find its source father colin and the african guide were busy planning the next leg of the expedition she would return before they noticed her absence blaise followed the sound pushing through flowering vines to see a sight that made her forget to breathe it wasntthe water cascading down to a clear pool but the man standing on a rock beneath the waterfall who was breathtaking wide eyed she stared down at the unique individual her gaze followed the path of the water as it trailed down his long brown hair and over lightly tanned muscular flesh covered only by a loincloth when he turned raising his hands to slick back hair from a handsome face she exhaled sharply immediately his eyes snapped open and focused on her blaise yelp of alarm turned into a scream when the earth crumbled beneath her feet and she slid down the bank to land in the pool with a splash striking her head against a rock when she opened her eyes the first thing blaise noticed was that she was lying on a leopard skin in a large round tree house a few metres away the jungle man watched her intently she sat up and put a hand to her aching head an egg sized lump was her penalty for staring at a stranger meeting cobalt blue eyes she couldnthelp but think it was a small price to pay smiling hesitantly after chanting a healing spell she said thank you for fishing me out of the pool with a start she noticed her only clothing was a sheer white slip a blush burned across her face my shirt and skirt erm have you cleaned them he made no answer merely stared at her with his head cocked slightly as if trying to understand what she was saying blaise gasped you dontspeak english do you espanol no oh merlin help me his steady regard was unnerving her looking down to view the smooth musculature of his chest made her feel so fluttery nervous in a smooth fluid motion he crossed the space and began tracing her features with his fingertips a small smile curved his mouth when he brushed over her fuller softer lips that intense gaze then became riveted by the rapid rise and fall of her chest when his fingers lowered to feel the differences between them first hand as it were she scrambled away the extremely attractive if underdressed man followed gracefully smiling he took her hand and placed it against his chest unthinkingly she copied his circling motion before snatching back her fingers all right we both have pectorals and you have a gorgeous body smile as well but i need to get back to my camp so be a good wild man and let me go her eyes darted around saw her discarded clothing heaped in a corner and scooted toward it holding up the torn fabric she fished her wand out of the skirt pocket and scolded did you have to rip the buttons opposable thumbs are useful for more than circling ahem give that back he had grabbed the garment to examine the cleaned repaired cloth with an inscrutable look he tossed it over the edge of the railing to drift down to the jungle floor rushing over she saw a chimpanzee pick up the blouse and scamper into the underbrush a ripping sound brought her disbelieving stare back to her rescuer captor destroyer of women clothing she was not going to traipse around in a slip merely because he seemed to enjoy the view of her body through the sheer fabric she snatched up the leopard skin smirking as she waved her wand and transfigured it wriggling like crazy to put the outfit on beneath the slip because the man would not turn away no matter how she gestured or tried to order sternly blaise finally removed the slip and glanced down to see the result of her effort at spell sewing the halter top and skirt were shorter than she d intended but the important areas were covered her silent watcher grinned running his hands over the soft material she slapped them away stop that he gave a bark of laughter she said you can talk he stared unblinkingly blaise dragged her fingers through her hair in agitation i mean you ve got vocal chords you could talk if you knew how right disregarding the nimble male fingers sifting through her curls to restore order she said excitedly we could communicate and you could take me back to my father she captured the hand that was now tracing her ear placing it on her chest me blaise ack i cantbelieve i said that i blaise blaise his eyes were so blue mesmerised by them she placed her hand on his chest and looked at him with a question in her eyes smiling he said me terry i terry blaise her eyes grew huge before narrowing do do you mean that you ve understood me this whole time and never said a bloody word she tried to push him away but strong arms encircled and refused to budge i understood but i am not used to speaking after my parents died i had no one to talk to when i saw you on the river i used a memory charm to remember the language i had started to forget jaw dropping at his english accent she stammered a a m memory charm you re a wizard his hands stroked up her back how else could i live in a tree house in the jungle commanding animals except by magic oh of course how silly of her a thought struck she said if you knew that i was with a group of explorers why didntyou bring me to them why bring me here his gaze caressed her face i have long wished for a mate who would love me as deeply as i would love her last moonrise i performed a summoning spell you came instinct brought their lips together in a kiss that was everything blaise had ever dreamt of sliding her fingers into his hair and opening her mouth to explore his she knew that while her father and friends would be shocked she had found a love that promised to be the adventure of a lifetime blaise eyelids fluttered the dream made her sigh aloud oh terry the sound of laughter woke luna she blinked sleepily at the roommates who had opened her bed curtains to grin down at her what so funny she asked mindy lip curled you were singing in your sleep loony luna blinked warily singing yeah yo ho yo ho a pirate life for me i didntknow i never woke up bindy chuckled we know we re the ones you woke up instead sorry said luna what time is it cindy sat on the edge of the mattress it too early for breakfast to be served in the hall and i dontfeel like conjuring so let go to the kitchen okay she hopped out of bed and quickly dressed the corridors were deserted at such an early hour on the weekend turning the pear shaped handle to the kitchen luna waited for her roommates to enter before closing the door house elves were beginning to bustle about in preparation for the morning meal the ravenclaw elf appeared and bowed before saying thoughtfully if you will step this way i is happy to be conjuring you breakfast sitting around a well scrubbed work table the four girls gave their orders within moments an omelet french toast crepes and porridge and bacon were delivered and accepted with enthusiastic thanks bindy mopped up some extra maple syrup with a bite of french toast this was a brilliant idea we should be awakened at the crack of dawn more often luna smiled serenely she took a bite of bacon remembering how good it tasted when eaten from wesley fingers after the first rush of hunger was appeased she said i so glad it saturday i dontthink i could concentrate on schoolwork the other three nodded bindy asked does anybody have plans cindy nodded shyly jason wants me to help him clean out his trunk you re joking mindy said cleaning and organising are almost as bad as studying we need to do something fun or adventurous adventurous the doubtful intonation made mindy smile i not talking about bungee jumping off ravenclaw tower bindy i thinking solving a mystery like the gum wrappers in neville parents room at st mungo s luna remembered the story bindy had told after easter holiday neville had brought his girlfriend to st mungo to meet his parents while sharing about his parents he said that mysterious gum wrappers had been found on their floor during neville and bindy visit they had discovered but not caught the man who had dropped them she said if you and neville had more help people to ask questions and watch the exits for example it might be easier to catch the person would you help this summer bindy asked eagerly thinking of a long lonely summer spent re reading all the snorkack books in the library of lovegood house luna nodded i bet wesley would too creevey brilliant at thinking deviously he could help you figure out the bloke next move said mindy she smiled wryly i always good for hitting things with blunt objects bindy placed her hand on the other girl arm that could come in handy cindy looked alarmed by her roommates plans she stood i think i ll go wait for jason to come down to the common room after the girl exited the kitchen mindy said i wonder if he sleeps in how long will she wait luna said calmly it cindy choice we have to let her make it if she starts chewing his food though i going to throw up eeuwww satisfied with her friends simultaneous expressions of disgust mindy snickered luna asked smilingly are you serious about solving a mystery they nodded when thinky returned to clear their dishes she smiled sweetly at him what a lot of work you do taking care of ravenclaw tower professor flitwick quarters and now cap professor hook s how do you do it the tips of the elf bat like ears turned red i is always happy to serve and professor hook is most easy to please i only has to clean his rooms on saturdays when he is away from hogwarts luna concealed her inner glee she said thank you i think you re quite extraordinary and a role model for other elves bowing and blushing the elf backed away her friends were watching her with a mixture of awe and horror you sounded like a slytherin thank you mindy the other girl stuck out her tongue as long as you dontstart acting like one since a chat about prejudice and jealousy would not be helpful at this time luna said i think we should ask our boyfriends if they want to solve a mystery with us you two could go to gryffindor while i find someone to wake up wesley we ll meet back in the restricted section her friends agreed to the plan and the time returning to ravenclaw house she asked a first year to run up and wake wesley ten minutes later her boyfriend descended the stairs his hair was still damp her mouth dried the last time he d worn that shirt with psychedelic blue swirls she had slowly removed it and oh dear he had said something that she hadntheard mouth curving in a way that showed off adorable dimples wesley repeated what up bella luna want to go to the restricted section given the breathy quality of her voice he couldntbe blamed for murmuring this shirt brings back fond memories for you too hmmm sure who needs breakfast i ll nibble on you instead i d like that i mean that not what i meant to say was mindy bindy and i were hoping you colin and neville would like to help us do some sleuthing on hook since we found out that he ll be out of the castle on saturdays after you have breakfast of course her rapid embarrassed explanation made bright blue eyes twinkle sounds good but why is cindy out of the loop at that moment her sweet faced roommate walked by on jason arm waving to luna while she said i cantwait to start sorting your jumpers tell me she not choosing cleaning over snooping wesley said sorry golden blond hair shook in mock despair sad but we ll manage without her somehow do i have time to grab breakfast she nodded in the great hall she sat beside wesley thinking that waiting was enjoyable when the company was so pleasant afterwards they strolled to the library after a stop behind the statue of fezzick the faithful in the restricted section two other couples awaited from their perch on the window seat colin and neville nodded their greetings while their girlfriends said hello neville since you ve allowed your hair to grow i guess you re shaggy wesley said with a wide smile colin said who are you freddy of course luna daphne and bindy velma luna found the conversation fascinating if baffling the blond gryffindor looked ready to burst into laughter so you re saying that mindy and i are scooby and scrappy doo between chuckles colin explained to his girlfriend that they were referring to an old muggle mystery show on telly scooby doo where are you luna asked wesley who is daphne he leaned down to whisper the hot chick and i think my characterisations were spot on thanks you re very welcome the scooby gang as colin insisted on calling them unanimously decided to use hook time away to try and snoop around his quarters disillusionment charms got them from the library to the ravenclaw staff corridor neville prevented colin from touching the door handle don t since the professor doesnthave a guardian painting it probably warded after drawing a series of runes in the air that flashed red and faded away the brown eyed boy looked at the others anybody know a counter charm before wesley could do more than nod the sound of footsteps echoed hastily the group pressed back against walls after re engaging their disillusion spells luna eyes became more protuberant when she saw professor trelawney the woman wore a long blue dress that was flattering and without wrinkles clearing her throat while tucking a flyaway strand of hair behind an ear the divination teacher said clearly sybil trelawney to see james hook green coloured runes glimmered briefly the door opened tentatively pushing the panel wider magnified eyes behind thick glasses peered into the room she called the man name when she received no answer the woman muttered you must not pry he would find out and think it meant more than idle curiosity inflating that colossal ego beyond bearing you will step back shut the door and return another time several times trelawney stepped out and then back into hook lounge finally she pulled the door closed with a snap and practically ran back down the corridor becoming visible once the professor had gone the six stared speculatively at the door wesley cleared his throat sybil trelawney to see james hook nothing happened luna looked at mindy i ve heard you mimic mcgonagall it uncanny why dontyou try to do trelawney voice okay i ll give it a shot taking several deep breaths mindy widened her eyes pushed a reddish blonde strand behind her ear and twittered sybil trelawney to see james hook green runes sparkled before fading away mindy accepted everyone praise with a smile bindy said in my parents restaurant everyone has to use sealant spells for health reasons why dontwe use them to keep from leaving anything behind that could be traced back to us brilliant idea said neville he smiled when his girlfriend blushed from the praise they performed the spells before entering hook quarters the lounge was sparsely furnished with only a desk and two chairs beside a fireplace neville tested the desk it was warded wesley tried a counter charm he d learned from a book in the restricted section the roll top slid upwards inside they found nothing but a quick notes quill and some sheets of parchment six faces fell colin said i ll conjure a pencil and shade in the top piece of parchment if he wrote something and took the note maybe the impression will show he pulled a pencil from behind mindy ear smirking at her surprise he bent and deftly shaded the parchment done this before have you wesley asked no my dad muggle said colin i watch mysteries on telly you my mum muggle i watch telly with my cousins sometimes cool colin held up the parchment neville said lumos and held his glowing wand tip behind the paper pale words stood out against the lead mindy frowned the first bit blurry i can only make out a few words the rest is clear she read aloud v london saturday the name of the file i wish to read is lorelei i will bring the usual payment h the group searched but nothing of a personal nature was found in the quarters wesley humorously termed shipshape once they returned to the library luna sat on the floor leaning back against wesley chest listening to the other five debating exactly what the message meant they all agreed that trelawney and hook were involved in some way hard as it was to fathom and that he must still believe lorelei had something to do with smalley death the group decided to meet again the following saturday before heading into hogsmeade luna rose to her feet to say goodbye to her departing friends she jumped when wesley arms stole around her waist and shivered happily when he kissed the side of her neck pulling her back toward the window seat he whispered laughingly scooby dooby doo the melusine mirror warming beneath her pillow woke ginny she tossed aside the pillow to reach for the small silver backed square a quick glance at the clock on her side table showed that it was just gone seven draco face appeared in the reflective surface his platinum hair was sticking up in rumpled spikes she wanted to smooth it down and kiss him breathless marvelling that he was just down the hall ginny smiled good morning his lips twisted is it those brothers of yours snore louder than crabbe and goyle i ve tried to wake them up but they keep muttering five more minutes mum and rolling over i hungry oh merlin that pout was adorable her smile widened i ll run downstairs and fix you breakfast in the kitchen bill was still sleeping at the table with sisterly callousness she left him there and quickly pulled out conjuring cookery made easy concentrating fiercely she managed to scramble several dozen brown eggs produce a pile of slightly over crispy bacon a rack of brown but not burnt toast and a pot of porridge that had a consistency nearly resembling the dish served at hogwarts what all this ginny whirled around wand and spatula held defensively morning dad you startled me i was just making breakfast that very considerate of you she gestured to the enchanted coffee pot that had just finished perking why dontyou fill a couple of mugs and i ll bring you and mum a tray excellent idea sweetheart perhaps i can coax her into eating something he filled two mugs and went upstairs again scurrying around to make two trays up ginny carried one and locomotored the other she placed the one she hand carried by fred and george door before grasping the other out of the air after her father had thanked her and shut the door she heard molly say i not hungry words too low to make out were followed by fine i ll eat a few bites for you dear ginny retraced her steps to the twins room said the password mischief managed and unlocked the door draco was standing at the window staring out at the back garden and the countryside beyond he looked like the brooding hero of a gothic romance until his gaze flickered to where she stood inside the doorway his smile made her heart turn over she placed the tray on the desk in order to kiss him the embrace grew more passionate than she felt comfortable with in a room with her brothers she drew back smiling i did some reading last night shakespeare sonnets since you quoted one to me i thought it was only fair that i quote one for you his pleased smile made her sigh it from sonnet forty three all days are nights to see till i see thee and nights bright days when dreams do show me thee his hand cupped her cheek his lips lowered george groaned merlin fred haventwe done enough for those two do we have to listen to sonnets we bloody well shouldn t above and beyond the call of brotherly duty that is the good natured complaining made her giggle be quiet you two or no breakfast in bed the silence was immediate placing a warmer covered plate in each of her sibling identically eager hands ginny sat in a chair draco had placed flush with his and waited for him to comment on the food silvery eyes noted each item imperfection and then softened as they met hers thank you her boyfriend knew that she was no natural mamacita like blaise and appreciated her efforts all the more for it ginny eyes started to get misty he kissed her hand she lifted his and returned the kiss before rubbing her cheek against his palm merlin george i d lose my appetite if i hadntfinished my food already indeed worse than ruddy sonnets that mushy business is ginny gave the equally grumpy looking brothers a mock glare pull the covers over your head if you dontwant to see it boys her glower became real as the two immediately did exactly that draco drawled the porridge looks good you remembered the honey how sweet she giggled when fred and george said as one corny when she and draco had finished their amazingly good for her meal ginny loaded the plates back on the tray and fished a couple of brushing flossing mints out of her pocket she handed one to her boyfriend loftily informing the two mutterers that she didntreally care if they had sweet breath or not a knock on the door had draco reaching for the invisibility cloak her brothers had forgotten to return once he was concealed she opened the door her father stood in the corridor with a sad disappointed expression on his face bill was staggering down the corridor behind him let me by dad i going to choke those bloody weasels a rare steely look from their father halted the enraged man you ll do no such thing go on and take a shower that restorative spell will have taken effect by the time you re done afterwards we will have a family talk and you will have your say arthur steady gaze travelled from his daughter to the sons sitting up in their bunks you heard what i said get dressed and come downstairs george flopped back against his pillow family talk sure family interrogation more like with me and fred taking the heat because no good deed goes unpunished draco removed the cloak i ll go downstairs right now and tell them the truth no there was panic in all three voices what am i supposed to do then wait up here going mental wondering what going on until i allowed out of hiding ginny smiled despite her worry of course not come downstairs but wear the invisibility cloak and dontintervene no matter what anyone says let me handle my family please draco pulled her into a hug she nestled against his chest and held on to him until her brothers insisted that she leave so they could get out of bed and go take care of pressing needs smiling a bit at the euphemism ginny took the dishes downstairs and then returned to her room to get dressed for the day defiantly she picked out an embroidered white peasant top she d found at a market in spain to wear with her denims when she entered the lounge dad mum and bill were seated on one sofa fred and george on the other she took a seat in a chair across from the twins shifting to face the three whose faces were more solemn than the wizengamot unseen fingers squeezed her shoulder reassuringly it gave ginny the confidence to say to her parents i suppose bill told you that draco came to see me arthur nodded solemnly molly lips tilted in a mirthless smile that wasntthe first time you met him in the workshop was it ginny face grew hot no he visited christmas morning and on my birthday too her father leaned forward you never once considered that you were betraying our trust she stared into pained blue eyes one of the reasons she had lied for so long was to avoid having to see that expression bill said ginny knew she just chose to do it anyway chose malfoy over her family it not that simple ginny snapped i ll thank you to keep your intolerant opinions to yourself or what you ll hex me again gladly that enough everyone stared in shock at the normally mild mannered wizard who had yelled arthur pointed his finger warningly at them both not one more bickering word this situation is distressing enough without adding strife to it he sat making a visible effort to remain calm ginny if i understand things correctly because you thought we would not approve of your relationship with young malfoy you have repeatedly lied conspired to thwart our wishes and involved your brothers in doing the same with a sinking heart she said i never wanted to hurt or disappoint you any of you i just thought if i gave it enough time if i tried hard enough you would her voice was becoming thick with repressed tears you d see that it isntsome stupid crush that draco not a bad person but nothing i did or said ever worked and now i dontknow what to do bill said stay away from malfoy that what you can do keep out of it said george like you did fred pulled out his wand need another nap brother try it silence when their mother commanded the boys obeyed after exchanging a long look with her husband molly took a deep breath and slowly released it she told ginny perhaps your father and i haventalways been approachable however now that this situation is out in the open we have to find a way for this family to cope with it she rubbed her temples sounding emotionally drained as she said i donthave the first clue how that going to happen the twins gave ginny a speaking look her pulse pounded while she tried to suggest calmly would it help if you talked to draco mum laughed shortly would he agree to take verisimilitude potion i picked some up at the apothecary s intending it for you yes i would draco pulling off the invisibility cloak set off a chain reaction that would ve been funny if it had happened to someone else family bill went for his wand and was promptly tackled to the floor by the twins molly fell back against the sofa cushions hand pressed to her heart dad jumped to his feet sternly ordering behave yourselves or leave the room he turned to the boy who had appeared behind ginny not content with seeing my daughter last night you returned this morning i never left the twins catching sight of their mother expression cried in unison he slept on our floor arthur said levelly why are you here ginny walked to stand by her boyfriend she slipped her hand into his he tightened his fingers around hers she watched anxiously as draco took a deep breath and told her father the words he d first said to her on a hammock in spain i wanted to look you in the eye and tell you that i love ginny and that i ve never taken advantage of her love for me he looked at molly i cantdeny who my father is or say that i haventacted like him in the past i dontexpect you to be happy to see me with your daughter his gaze flickered over bill fred and george or your sister he said i not going to go away though so i hope for ginny sake you can accept it in the silence that followed she squeezed his hand and mouthed i love you as a tear rolled down her cheek the corner of draco mouth turned up ginny hugged him as tightly as she could he brushed a kiss across her hair dontcry red it ll be okay she smiled when the twins stared incredulously you call her red without getting hexed merlin george it must be love ginny looked at her mother molly was blinking furiously she turned to her husband oh arthur what if it is a n i know i know another evil cliffie pinky promise next chap wontleave you hanging even if it does leave you wondering what happens next mea culpa lo siento etc etc etc blaise dream was inspired by the old tarzan the ape man film with maureen o hara i looked up info on tarzan films and preferred the classic plot to the remake in the original film jane her father and harry the guide with the hots for jane safari to find the elephant graveyard lose several members of their party to cliffs and crocodiles in the river poor muggles tarzan uses his call to save them from hungry hungry hippos and then swings jane off her feet d i personally liked the second film in the series tarzan and his mate better more lovey dovey but the summary of the first film made for a simpler dream thanks for taking the adventure through this chapter if you review i ll go ape chapter 43 wonderwall oh arthur what if it is ginny felt suspended between hope and fear her father expression usually so open and easily read was shuttered mum was looking for him to make the decision to tell her how they should respond bill shrugging off the twins restraining hands gazed at his dad with a go on tell her slytherins are incapable of love look on his face fred and george shot her encouraging smiles before turning their attention back to the man proving who wore the trousers in his family draco arms tightened around her she glanced up his face reminded her of an avenging angel or a black knight s ready to fight all comers to claim her she sagged against her boyfriend in relief to hear then we d best have a talk with them dear bill hot protest received a cool ultimatum to be quiet or leave ginny smiled she could almost physically feel the load of guilt and regret she had been carrying for so long slip away it was liberating she kept hold of draco hand as they sat and faced her family silence stretched out the tick tick of the family clock seemed abnormally loud a whistling noise came from the kitchen molly jumped at the sound she said distractedly is it time for tea i ll go make it shall i standing abruptly the woman turned to her unexpected guest do do you have a favourite biscuit grey eyes widened at the unexpected consideration draco stared blankly for a moment before saying chocolate chip or ginger er anything is fine thank you it it no trouble bill said i ll carry the tray for you mum after the two left the room ginny noticed that the twins were regarding draco speculatively you like chocolate chip and ginger biscuits malfoy that interesting said george reminds me of christmas eve when harry accused us of nicking his chocolate chip biscuit and replacing it with a gingerbread man what had his head bit off wasntthat the one with black icing hair and green eyes george i do believe it was fred quite a coincidence that if her brothers expected to fluster draco they were sorely disappointed he merely smiled enigmatically yes it is her father observed them without comment ginny smiled hesitantly when he glanced her way the corner of his mouth turned up mum and bill returned and placed the tea tray on the low centre table strangely the routine of pouring passing and offering tea appeared to relax everyone after several minutes of silence arthur placed his teacup back on the tray he said i dontrequire verisimilitude potion only your word mr malfoy do i have it that you will continue not to take advantage of my daughter feelings george choked on his last sip of tea fred pounded him on the back while bill glared and draco returned the older wizard steady gaze yes sir ginny knew her blush probably highlighted every freckle on her face why oh why had she blurted that she was a virgin only because of her boyfriend restraint her brothers were looking extremely uncomfortable with the subject matter they werentthe only ones she and her mother locked eyes in mutual embarrassment arthur said are you planning on becoming a death eater or serving you know who in any way bill dragon claw earring swung when he leaned forward to hear the reply a muscle in draco jaw flexed but otherwise he stayed calm no sir her father seemed reassured by the answer after a moment contemplation however a trace of worry shadowed the man eyes once more how will your father react to the news of your relationship although his fingers reflexively squeezed hers draco remained outwardly impassive i dontknow he sends messages every now and then but we do not correspond molly face wore an expression that ginny had seen before the boy stoic resignation triggered the woman motherly nature she was glad her mum was starting to see him as a person and not malfoy spawn at the same time she hoped her mother wouldntimpulsively say or worse do anything if she called draco a poor boy patted him on the back or hugged him he would be deeply offended pure blood snobbery might change but ingrained pride remained she held her breath when her mother drew breath to speak will you keep hiding the relationship from others ginny couldntdecide whether her mum wanted the answer to be yes or no we re through keeping secrets arthur and molly exchanged glances his hand patted hers when she nodded slightly her father said i wontpretend that i pleased or that you have our blessing but if you feel so strongly about this we will not forbid you to see each other ginny wanted to laugh in release of the tension that had been building but smiled widely instead draco smiled fleetingly thank you sir her father stood and held out his hand a wizard handshake isntmerely the friendly gesture muggles use it is a binding act magically transforming word into bond will you shake on what you have spoken today ginny smile faded would draco be offended that his word alone wasntgood enough before today she d worried that her father wouldntaccept him even with a wizard handshake she hoped slytherin pragmatism would make him realise the gesture was a small price to pay for goodwill he did draco stood and took arthur hand in a firm clasp she leapt to her feet and rushed to hug her dad thank you daddy he held her close before clearing his throat well this has been quite an eventful time now that we have an accord i have a few things in my workshop in need of attention ginny dear say goodbye to draco he should be getting back to school i ll have your brothers escort you back before dinner he nodded to the boy whose expression showed the consternation he felt at the use of his first name and strode out of the room bill stood and pointed his finger threateningly if you hurt my sister in any way malfoy the twins flanked their brother rolling their eyes yes he knows you were a big bad curse breaker said fred george wrapped his arm around bill shoulder malfoy understands he ll be on the receiving end of every curse you can remember if he steps out of line let go down to the basement and play skittles with a wink at ginny he steered his scowling brother toward the door molly gazed at the couple uncertainly you ll want to say your farewells i ll leave you to it come up to my room when you ve finished ginny goodbye she only paused a moment before forcing out draco when they were alone he smiled wryly at least your parents are saying my name even if they sound like they re going to spew a slug when they do it ginny said do you think your parents will ever accept me he pressed a kiss to her forehead my mother too self absorbed to care one way or the other but my father well he in azkaban and can rot there for the rest of his miserable life for all i care she heard the underlying hurt in his voice and reached up to wind her arms around his neck she kissed him softly in comfort he said i glad your parents are better people for your sake but all i care about is being with you draco kissed her as if he was trying to prove it she was more than willing to forget about everything outside the circle of his arms when his lips parted hers she returned the sweet pressure and didnthesitate to tease his tongue with hers yeah yeah beer and crisps i got it george loud call to her brothers caused draco to pull away her brother faltered when he entered and saw the look she was giving him oh you re not done saying goodbye sorry i ll just nip into the kitchen for beer and crisps we heard she said irritably her brother pursed his lips probably to keep from having the smirk hexed off his face in the kitchen he rattled around for a few minutes and returned with his arms full muttering sorry again be seeing you malfoy he all but ran through the room draco smile simultaneously made her melt inside and want to do a little melting of her own amused are you i wonder if you ll be laughing the next time i see you she reached up to smooth platinum strands wherever you are when i find you i going to kiss you he stared what if i in the middle of a school corridor the great hall i dontcare i going to walk up to you and give you a snog you ll never forget he had a beautiful mouth even smirking looked sensual seems pretty bold even for a gryffindor i hope you dontloose your nerve red she brushed her lips against his not a chance slytherin draco kissed her hard before moving away to take a pinch of floo powder i ll be waiting ginny was still smiling over the heated look in his eyes and the promise in his voice when she knocked on her parents door hearing come in she opened it and went to sit beside molly on the bed her mum was looking at a photograph album molly pointed to a picture of a young couple in dress robes your father and i had that taken before the yule ball we slow danced in a corner all night even when the music didntmatch which was most of the evening ginny chuckled over the story and at her father eating molly up with his eyes you were flirting outrageously mum i know the smug pleasure heard in her mother voice made ginny smile she said would you tell me about some more pictures mum tell me about you and daddy so you ll remember what it felt like and understand how i feel their eyes met understanding passed between them molly caressed her daughter cheek before pointing to a picture of three couples grinning in front of the shrieking shack that one involved a bottle of butterbeer that your father charmed to land on me after he spun it the vividness of her dream caused blaise to awaken early saturday morning with a pounding heart and an urgent need to kiss every millimetre of terry face after trying to fall back asleep she finally gave up and reached beneath the pillow for her melusine mirror aaah eee aaah no i mean terry after a few minutes sleepy dark blue eyes smiled at her morning baby it was funny how a term of endearment affected girls so differently fiona said she couldntstand for david to call her that found it creepy while blaise got a tingle down her spine every time terry called her baby abruptly aware her boyfriend had called her that again with a question attached she said yes he pushed back long strands of brown hair laughing you really want to show me the dance of the seven veils in the room of requirement her heart was starting to race again one day sure but why did you ask blaise said teasingly what kind of dream were you having i was a sheik and you were my dancing girl he grinned what kind of dream were you having she tried not to blush oh an adventure one when he asked what kind she said airily the usual i was on safari in africa with my dad trekking up mountains through jungles me tarzan you jane so much for trying to play it off mmhmm want to have breakfast in our tree house he gave a slow smile that reminded her of a jungle man reaching out to discover anatomical differences first hand i ll grab a shower and my cloak and meet you in thirty minutes after replacing her mirror and making the bed with a wave of her wand blaise remembered that she had sent her invisibility cloak to ginny shrugging she picked out denim trousers to pair with a red and blue bandana top and hurried into the bathroom thirty minutes later she was pacing inside the room of requirement worried about her boyfriend when the door opened she called terry he pulled off the invisibility cloak prowling toward her she backed toward the area where breakfast awaited he scooped her into his arms and carried her masculine lips curving when she kept her arms twined around his neck while he lowered her to a cushion thinking of her dream she asked huskily are you going to be a good wild man terry gently placed splayed fingers against the sides of her face lightly holding her head in position for a kiss he stared into her eyes lowering his mouth so slowly that her heart began to pound in anticipation expecting a soft romantic kiss blaise gasped when his tongue teased her lips with sensual jabs before gliding between them for a slow deep kiss a deliberate thorough unhurried series of french kisses drove her crazy she clenched her fingers in his silky hair and kissed him passionately until he rolled away breakfast eat now blaise trailed her fingertips down the muscular back that flexed at her touch she knew he could hear the smile in her voice when she said you re a great wild man he gave a huff of laughter they moved over to the picnic blanket holding an assortment of fruit and pastries after eating a bite of clair he grinned finger food how appropriate she pretended to pout you re ruining my terry king of the jungle fantasy his fingertips trailed across the bottom edge of her leopard print halter me like dress blaise returned the gesture on his bare chest me like everything about you suddenly the door handle rattled as though it was stuck terry dove for the invisibility cloak together they ran to the side of the tree house and huddled beneath the enchanted fabric she whispered close your eyes and concentrate on the room transforming back to its original state when blaise opened her eyes the jungle home was gone and bare stone floor and walls had taken its place the door to the room burst open the feared and despised mr filch stood in the doorway his cat mrs norris rubbing against his ankles never had the door refuse to open before precious the man cautiously entered the chamber suspicious is what this is filch eyes and those of his cat seeming to glow in the dim light the caretaker torch in hand began to examine the far end of the space for signs of wrongdoers the young couple took the opportunity to leave the room once outside they heard the eerie feline begin to yowl they quickly descended halting halfway down the main staircase when the vigilant squib and his cat appeared on the landing overhead what do you see mrs norris is it a mischief maker the grey feline padded forward blaise could see the creature sniff the air she held her breath the cat meowed in a way that sounded uncannily like no filch bent and lifted his furry patrol partner into his arms mrs norris began to purr loudly as thin greyish fingers stroked her fur let us go up and search the attics my sweet blaise didntknow which was more disturbing the way the squib talked to his pet like a human or the way the cat leaned her small head to look directly toward the hiding place of invisibility cloaked students when the spooky pair climbed out of sight terry said why dontwe find someplace filch wontpatrol for awhile okay she willingly followed close behind while he led her down to the dungeon corridor outside dungeon seven he said wesley and i found out about this dungeon in hogwarts a history no one ever uses it he opened the door blaise was shocked to discover someone was using it a couple of fencers were sparring the sound of steel striking against steel filled the chamber blades thrust and parried the shorter person was driven inexorably back obviously outmatched soon the duel ended professor lorelei yanked off her protective mask you were going easy on me how will i ever improve after removing his mask in a methodical manner professor snape replied coolly i did no such thing you are improving slowly but surely underneath the cloak blaise turned her head wide eyes meeting those of her boyfriend he looked as astounded as she felt the potions professor lunged and pointed her foil at her partner chest i wanted to touch your heart with a flick of his wrist the potions master engaged lorelei blade and sent it clattering across the floor he threw down his own and pulled the woman close she reached up and freed his hair from the tie holding it back black strands fell forward concealing the lean man expression nothing could disguise the quiet conviction in his voice you already have witnessing professors kissing wasntquite as shocking as say one parents but it still wasntsomething blaise wanted to see she eased out of the room with terry pressed tightly to her back beneath the invisibility cloak in the corridor she whispered we re not the only ones who thought the dungeon would be a good place to be alone his arms slid around her waist she wished the jungle outfit she had worn in the room of requirement hadnttransformed back into original attire when they d stepped outside she wanted to feel his hands on her skin his fingers slid underneath the bandana top hem and stroked her abdomen that worked just as well he murmured wesley told me he heard from malfoy that you re pretty good with a sword yourself she smiled what about you i know the basics but i could use a few lessons especially if my instructor rewards my efforts with kisses blaise leaned against his chest turning her head to meet his lips down here my precious arentyou clever tracking the little wizard brats they both froze when the oily tones of filch echoed in the corridor the man phlegmatic chuckle made them shudder with distaste he crowed at the sight of the not quite shut chamber door and rushed forward mrs norris leading the way come out of there at once you randy little miscreants when professor snape stalked out of the room filch looked ready to faint i i am so sorry professor mrs norris here she was so sure we d tracked down randy little miscreants the wizard curled lip and sardonically raised brow made the icy tone more threatening an honest mistake sir filch gave mrs norris an angry look she snape held up his hand a man who blames a cat for his poor judgment is sorry indeed i suggest you patrol the grounds or somewhere else far from my sight go bowing and apologising profusely filch picked up mrs norris and hurried off lorelei stepped out of the doorway gear in hand how lowering for the youngest most brilliant potions master in the world to be called a randy miscreant a gleam of humour lit dark eyes i suppose your response of that nasty little man needs a hex meant you were flattered to be termed such of course not now if he d said amorous lovers the pair continued their banter while they made their way to the corridor leading to private quarters once they were alone in the dim passageway the unseen couple emerged from beneath the cloak terry said if snape and lorelei hadntbeen in dungeon seven we might ve been the randy little miscreants dragged out by filch i prefer amorous lovers since i love you and you definitely make me feel amorous he kissed her let your amorous lover escort you to slytherin before he sneaks back into house arrest blaise sighed beneath the invisibility cloak they clung tightly as they walked slowly toward the dungeon stairs the library was such a lovely place padded window seat in the restricted section notwithstanding just looking around at shelves upon shelves of books lifted luna spirits not that they needed it earlier this morning she and wesley along with the rest of the newly christened scooby gang had done some sleuthing and found out that hook was busy doing some snooping of his own on his day off after their little group had dispersed wesley had remained to talk a little and kiss a lot before he had to go meet terry the boys were working out with the quidditch team so she had decided to finish a few assignments before beginning to study for her owl exams pleased to complete an ancient runes essay she rolled up the parchment and stored it in her carryall hello luna meeting emerald green eyes she wondered why hearing those two words still made her stomach clench must be old habits dying hard giving him an absent minded half smile she said hello harry may i sit down if you d like he nodded and sat across from her unruly black hair and round glasses reminding her of the days when this t te t te would have been a dream come true how ve you been fine you oh good i guess pointing to his scar he made a face aside from the usual worries luna heard the self deprecation in his voice and smiled this was the harry potter that she had always liked even before her unrequited infatuation a day without you know who is a good day he chuckled yeah it ace they chatted about inconsequential things his face still lit up at the mention of quidditch her amusement caused him to pretend offence are you daring to laugh at the cannons record this year she nodded although she was laughing at herself actually the way she had drifted around mooning after him was amusing in hindsight they were still smiling albeit due to different reasons when harry asked are you and roberts still going together the smile on her face dimmed why was he asking didnthe see them sitting together during every meal at the ravenclaw table she refused to speculate yes she said what about you and morrigan yeah yeah we are after looking down to drum his fingers on the tabletop harry glanced up i like her a lot it just that sometimes i wonder if she d be better off with someone a little more uncomplicated harry looked into luna eyes or if i d be better off with someone who takes complications in stride instantly an old daydream replayed in her mind she and harry were standing together on the rock strewn edge of the lake he bent down and picked up a stone skipping it across the dark water with a flick of his wrist picking up another stone he said i sick and tired of being harry bloody potter i wish everyone would stop staring and whispering and looking to me to save the ruddy world i not looking to you to save the world although i know you will i stare for a different reason hearing her soft words a smile transformed the boy snarl into something that made her heart leap he dropped the stone to pull her close and say huskily before his lips captured hers what reason could that be this the image of her in harry arms became another vision they were strolling down the main corridor toward the great hall a girl laugh rang out wesley stop you cantsnog me in the middle of the corridor pulling her hand out of harry s she turned and saw a slytherin girl pressing herself against a ravenclaw boy while pretending to protest fiona used her hold in golden blond hair to draw her partner smiling mouth down to hers the sight made luna physically ill a cold chill ran down her spine luna realised she had been staring off for several moments while her mind had been elsewhere she released the breath she had been holding leaning forward to say think about morrigan going with someone else would you be okay with it strange that she would ask him to consider what she d just finished experiencing herself the slight thrill she had experienced from the first image of harry kissing her had been nothing compared to the anguish of watching wesley kiss someone else a similar evolution of expressions flitted across the face she had thought the most handsome in the whole world until a boyish pirate had come along no i wouldn t all of a sudden she was no longer ashamed of having crushed on harry he wasntdark or bitter anymore and she was happy for him luna smiled when he raked his hand over his hair in that familiar futile gesture he said i hadntthought about things that deep thanks for being a friend green eyes turned apologetic i sorry i haventalways been one to you she smiled we re still friends looking up she saw a dark haired girl approaching hello morrigan the girl glanced from her to harry and back again before smiling uncertainly hello luna how are you did you have a good holiday the best you the girl dark eyes flew to harry it was wonderful after a few minutes of chatting luna hefted her bag and said i ve got to get back to ravenclaw she smiled at the couple and left the library with a light heart approaching her house she saw wesley walking toward her even knowing that her vision was the result of imagination only luna couldntstop herself from running forward dropping her bag and reaching up to kiss her boyfriend around them giggles snickers and a get a room sounded her lips clung to his when wesley came up for air what brought on this enjoyable display of public affection he asked smilingly luna absently twined a strand of hair around her finger while she answered well i wanted to be the girl you kissed in the middle of the corridor does that make sense looking thoughtful he nodded and then shook his head gently capturing her hand and releasing her purple finger wesley dimples appeared yes and no but i glad whatever the reason glancing sideways he called cindy could you do your roommate a favour and take her bag to her room cindy who appeared to be returning to the common room with her boyfriend said brightly i d be happy to i was just about to go up and do a little re organising before dinner my desk is so untidy thanking the girl with only a trace of laughter in his voice wesley waited until the other couple had moved out of hearing range to ask is her desk really untidy luna traced his arched eyebrow with her fingertip no cindy just gone on a perfectionist streak i d try and talk her out of it but she promised to organise my trunk his unrestrained laughter made her giggle a thought struck she said were you looking for me when i uhm saw you he grinned roguishly yes i was while we were lifting weights terry told me that he and blaise were chased by filch and mrs norris this morning and almost got caught in dungeon seven he looked at her expectantly she said dungeon seven yes the dungeon said to contain a secret passageway to the room of records since hook went to hogwarts his file would be in those records and ours for the reading if we could find it she was impressed i hadntthought of that where is the room of records he leaned down to whisper in a gripping voice it deep beneath the dungeons in a secret passageway that few enter and fewer still successfully navigate the shiver that made her way down her spine now was the kind that usually followed his lips trailing down her neck resisting the urge to pull her hair to one side and hope for more shivers luna said while they quickly made their way to the dungeons if the passageway is secret then how do you know about it bella luna i am not the average student looking for a lark irrepressible he confessed laughingly while guiding her into the dungeon i exceptional at asking friends for help terry and i took the clues from hogwarts a history and put them together he looked up at the ceiling first we need to find a splotch in the shape of an opened book the globs of frogs brains and other even less appetising items were very interesting to view one clump looked like flowers sort of and another was in the shape of a snorkack if she squinted so its horn would crumple look at this apparently scanning the splotches for one particular shape instead of analysing each one was the most effective search method luna agreed with wesley opinion and smiled when he counted off four paces stepped on a flagstone and whooped in excitement when the stone slid back a stairway leading to an underground corridor was revealed holding hands and using softly glowing wands to illumine their way the couple climbed down into darkness do you think we should go back luna had been off in another daydream in this one she and wesley were intrepid explorers out to find lost treasure shaken out of her reverie the girl heard an almost unintelligible voice calling go back gooo baaccckkkk aware of the compulsion behind the command she said wesley it a trap dontlisten think of us using gillyweed to explore the reef in spain and nothing else okay closing his eyes for a brief moment he opened them and nodded they moved forward luna easily slipped into fantasy she lifted a colourful shell for wesley inspection why did they look so much brighter underwater his hair looked darker like a gold coin from a spanish treasure ship luna leaned forward and kissed him his lips curved before pressing hers in return they floated together with the gentle current masculine fingers stroked the small of her back before circling upwards when his hands encountered no tie at the middle of her back wesley eyes opened he stared down incredulously you took your top off blinking luna met wesley accusing stare are you saying you re upset that in a daydream i took my bikini top off no it just that the shock jolted me out of it and i never got to enjoy the view she returned his smile while inwardly musing how odd it was that their daydreams matched after she pointed out that the compulsion had ceased they continued down the corridor it looked magically carved from the rock beneath the castle luna thoughts returned to the daydream she said out of curiosity what colour bikini was i wearing her eyes grew round when her boyfriend said green with pink polka dots he saw her expression and stopped in his tracks are you saying you wore the same bikini in your daydream his tone was a bit spooked she pointed to distract him look there a fork in the passageway he lifted his wand odd place for someone to drop cutlery she giggled the passageway splits luna and wesley peered down the corridor branching off to the left a light twinkled doused and then flickered again further toward the end as though trying to lead them they agreed it was a trap and took the other corridor she smiled when he joked when it right its right after several more turns and twists they came to a section of rock decorated with a moth eaten tapestry of a wizard sitting at a large stone dinner table with trolls they pelted him with cutlery luna said i think we can safely assume that barnabas the barmy so the room should be right here wesley had extrapolated the door coordinates and walked back and forth when it appeared he opened the door with a chivalrous wave of his hand after you cherie merci beaucoup they entered the chamber the walls of file cabinets too wide and tall to begin to search awed luna the sound of someone turning the door handle echoed in the vast chamber wesley tugged her over to a huge librarian styled desk surrounded by piles of books scrambling to hide behind it they clung to each other i require immediate assistance an imperious voice demanded it was hook another voice answered coolly i am mushu entrusted with facilitating all visitor searches what file do you wish to access professor lorelei s luna bent down and crooked her neck sideways to peer up from the narrow space at the bottom of the desk hook dressed in black that matched his scowl took a file floated to him by the spirit guarding the records he began to read the spectral chinese dragon was breathtaking luna wished he were alive so she could touch his scales as if sensing her regard the large chrysanthemum like head turned in her direction she froze reptilian eyes behind half moon spectacles seemed to twinkle transparent sharp looking teeth glinted the professor snarled what is the meaning of this one ghostly claw waved the folder out of the man hand the spirit read in a melodious voice sing siren for thyself and i will dote spread o er the silver waves thy golden hairs and as a bed i ll take them and there lie that not information about lorelei peering over his spectacles the dragon demurred shakespeare may have written a comedy of errors but a lorelei is indeed a siren so i must beg to differ a rumbling sound emitted from the spectre perhaps you were unaware of records policy professor any person without express permission from the headmaster receives only misinformation the dragon blew an ethereal smoke ring into the man face no exceptions professor hook slammed the door on the way out wesley looked reluctantly admiring when he saw his girlfriend raise her eyebrows he shrugged hey that door is heavy the red dragon peered over the edge of the enormous desk do you require assistance children they shook their heads the rumbling sound that luna now recognised as laughter sounded again perchance then you would care for a cup of tea a teapot and two cups materialised on the desk along with plates of sandwiches and biscuits wesley stomach rumbled he said while lifting a strand of her hair we should probably wait before heading back and i really liked his quote buttercup me too luna happily accepted mushu invitation asking him if he had read any good books lately she and wesley thoroughly enjoyed their tea with the dragon upon his return to the hog head tavern draco walked to a corner and released the concealment charm he d placed on his firebolt after a quick inspection assured him no one had tampered with the broomstick he strode quickly out of the room amid the odorous grime of the main chamber several bleary alcoholics with charmed livers slumped over mugs of beer the barkeep appeared the same as ever surly and unattractive the grizzled man looked up from wiping a mug with a stained cloth to demand where have you been the boy reaction caused one patron to lose his balance in his tipped back chair and crash to the floor another sprayed a mouthful of beer across the table into his companion face the proprietor reached for his wand draco smile widened he threw a small bag onto the scarred surface of bar next round on me the barman picked up the moneybag it the end of the world as we know it draco snickered on his way out the door and i feel fine he strolled across the lawn of hogwarts after storing his broom back in the shed his mood was so good he began to whistle the sight of a group of students dressed in black lounging on the front steps was intriguing he left off whistling weasley is our queen a girl in black leather waved him over she stood to greet him did you talk to her parents are they okay with you two the look on his face gave her the answer she shrieked yes oh merlin i was so worried for you and now i so happy blaise proceeded to try to squeeze him to death while crying he hugged her back before saying gruffly i know i told you to contain your hufflepuff tendencies to me but mate please hold it together she laughed shakily and kissed his cheek before punching him in the arm that what you get when your best mate a girl so learn how to deal about to reply he noticed that their conversation was being watched with more concentration than a quidditch match was blaise smiled and pulled him forward draco these are some friends of mine you may have seen them around the common room one by one she introduced a group that he had always considered weird he shook hands with blokes named lexx and edge and amiably greeted scarlett and cassandra girls who wore black makeup to match their clothing idly curious he asked after taking a seat beside his mate on the front steps what brings you out here before lunch cassandra the one rumoured to call herself a prophet intoned i saw it in a vision she held out her hand to the others pay up unbelievers only one person didntplace a sickle in the strange girl hand when dark eyes ringed in black stared blaise confessed i ll have to owe you this outfit too form fitting for pockets draco smirked lexx waggled his eyebrows scarlett promptly smacked him across the top of his head the spiky haired bloke grinned as if it was a love tap considering the way the girl smiled back maybe it was sing me a song scarlett ordered lexx obediently strummed his guitar singing today is gonna be listening to the lyrics of the song draco thought they fit his situation he didntbelieve anybody felt the way he did about ginny the roads paths of life whatever that had led him to her had been winding there were so many things he wanted to say that he didntknow how to express if luna and blaise had never tried their hand at matchmaking if he had never hooked up with ginny he still would refuse to be his father pawn but he wouldntknow love hell maybe she did save him after all clapping along with the others he asked what a wonderwall lexx said it means an object of fascination scarlett tugged the boy earring i heard it means the one you want to spend the rest of your life with your only reason for life oh yeah you re right absolutely lexx agreed draco said so you people have a little sing a long often on the other side of blaise cassandra said we greet the sunrise on mondays a mysterious smile curved black painted lips why are you going to join us you dress the part he wore black a lot that didntmean he was interested in hanging out with a bunch of slytherin misfits draco opened his mouth to say no and surprised himself by saying i might the girl smiled knowingly you will he rose pulling blaise to her feet she frowned at the other girl dontyou dare bet him even a knut the small group stood around in awkward silence draco said i going back to the common room anybody else lexx gave him a sceptical look you saying you d walk through the main corridor with us the prince of slytherin willing to be seen with the little people he couldnthelp smirking you d be surprised who i willing to be seen with cassandra stared yes i am surprised impatient with the psychic act he snapped come on blaise you need to change boot could choke if he saw you in that outfit the impudent wench hooked her arm in his the rest followed inside the entry she whispered he already seen it and he likes it draco curled his lip i bet thinking of how a redhead would look in black leather he smiled persuasively why dontyou order another outfit in the wrong size his mate winked i ll send an owl today students in the corridors sent curious glances the slytherin group way nosy idiots stared in the common room too but no one was foolish enough to comment after he grabbed a shower and a change of clothes draco escorted blaise to the great hall during lunch crabbe and goyle kept looking at each other as though wondering why he didntberate them for execrable table manners bad taste in jokes or breathing too loud listening to the pair earnestly ask blaise if she had to use magic to get her trousers on he grinned across the table a pair of beady eyes narrowed into slits you ve been acting very oddly draco pansy looked at her hag friend millicent the girl only a troll would find dainty nodded her agreement feeling vindicated he supposed parkinson turned back and accused you ve got a secret girlfriend usually the pug faced twit irritated him today he found her amusing she looked stunned when he smiled inexplicably his mate leaned against his shoulder to look directly at the other girl wontbe secret for much longer with a tinge of malicious enjoyment that he couldnthelp but share she said i do hope some pathetic delusional girls wontbe too devastated to know their dream will never come true remembering a similar conversation he replied ha good one blaise she giggled thanks draco pansy stared at them with dawning horror no not you two together i couldntstand it anyone is better than zabini draco blaise said through helpless giggles remember you said that later unable to help it he laughed aloud his cronies started chuckling crabbe asked with a smile that showed his large teeth what re we laughing at boss draco pointed to pansy and laughed again which set blaise off hearing her peal of laughter the boys beside her succumbed to mirth all around them students watched mystified goyle leaned out to ask hopefully hey malfoy want to go play exploding snap not particularly but he was feeling charitable so draco shrugged all right blaise stared slack jawed he put a finger beneath her chin and pushed up gently stop gaping like a hufflepuff you re playing too the dense but likeable pair looked as though their dream had come true they immediately surged off the bench while he assisted blaise to her feet giving the lummoxes a steely look when they started to move ahead of him in eagerness draco escorted his friend out of the hall nodding to the three ravenclaws viewing the by play interestedly crabbe and goyle in their proper place followed behind in the entry hall he turned when ron weasley called hey malfoy hold on blaise said why dontthe boys and i go on ahead we ll grab the cards and i ll try again to explain why they got their eyebrows singed off last time buena idea mamacita she smiled at weasley before slipping her hands into the crooks of crabbe and goyle beefy arms the three continued toward slytherin house watching without comment draco waited for ginny brother to say whatever it was he had to say he didntwait long the moment the others moved from sight the lanky redhead said do my parents know about you and ginny yes are they making her transfer to a school in america and change her name to mary sue no why would you think that weasley muttered i had a nightmare before saying they canthave been happy about it tell me what happened i went to see ginny ended up talking to your brothers your parents and in the end i promised your father a few things and your parents arentgoing to forbid your sister to see me how which brothers why no i dont want to know rubbing his eyes with the heels of his palms weasley finally said almost calmly these promises why d my dad believe you i gave him a wizard handshake oh granger and potter exited the hall and stood looking from one boy to the other is everything okay granger asked weasley laughed shortly not by me but my opinion doesntcount so it good as it going to get he said when is ginny coming back before dinner nodding the taller boy left with his friends draco returned to slytherin house feeling as though he d survived a gauntlet following a game of exploding snap he and blaise watched the boys try to build a castle out of the cards only three levels went up before the thing exploded vincent smiled triumphantly we ve still got our eyebrows actually you ve got most of them draco said half the left eyebrow is gone that was good for a laugh but otherwise the afternoon seemed to drag he did a few assignments organised his already painstakingly arranged desk worked out and took a long hot bath drying his hair with a charm draco combed platinum strands and pulled on a fitted black silk tee and trousers refusing to stare in the mirror wondering how to improve on perfection any longer he left the chamber he would go to dinner and ginny would arrive when she arrived the mirror in his pocket warmed snatching it out he looked down into a smiling face and barked where i climbing the front steps hurry draco shoved the mirror back into his pocket striding briskly to the stairs once he descended to the main corridor he began to jog a hufflepuff prefect yelled slow down no running in the oh my is that any kind of gesture for a prefect to make in the entry students were milling around inter house couples talking and spending time together before they had to separate for dinner draco shouldered his way through halting when he caught sight of a bright haired girl standing just inside the front doors she was scanning the room when their eyes met she smiled almost shyly gasps and furious whispers made it plain that others had noticed the direction of her gaze and steps standing in front of him blushing she said when i said i d kiss you i didntrealise we d have such a large audience an unnatural hush descended over the room unable to take his eyes off ginny draco said lost your nerve red never her lips lifted draco bent and lowered his mouth to hers their lips met and melded together he felt the need to connect to claim flare inside and gave into the feelings he had kept restrained she leaned closer and parted her lips inviting him in his hands buried in her hair his gryffindor stroked her tongue along his playing boldly with fire it made him go hot and cold at the same time he loved it he loved her through the crowd of stunned witnesses blaise pushed through to cry parkinson ran to tell snape you re snogging out here better break it up or go somewhere else draco lowered his voice to ask ginny what do you want to do a beguiling smile crossed her face i want to go somewhere else impulsively because he had always wanted to draco swept ginny up into his arms and carried her through the crowd when he reached the main corridor he set his girlfriend down romantic gestures were good but not being caught was better he pulled her into a run a n wonderwall was a 1995 and ever after hit for oasis a band that seems very slytherin to me heh i had a rem moment the band not the sleep stage in draco pov although i sure they werentthe first persons ever to use those lines mushu the half mulan half r a macavoy wonderful tea with the black dragon inspired misinformation specialist was originally used in a story that parallels this one i was so fond of the dragon and his warped enjoyment of others frustration that i had to use him and the room of records again if you were fond of any bits this chap review and let me know d chapter 44 actions and reactions professor hands was droning on about the british postal system but ginny didntmind she was occupied with note taking along with the price of different kinds of stamps and the length of time it took for a muggle letter to be delivered she was drawing hearts on the parchment inside the hearts she drew the letters gw dm sometimes she printed others she used cursive handwriting a few times she attempted calligraphy she shaded each heart or added lines squiggles tiny hearts or arrows for decoration twenty two hearts might be a bit excessive but she had only officially had a boyfriend for one school week there was a lot of missed doodling time to make up last saturday draco had carried her off to their solar in the attics for a private dinner the memory still made her smile she couldntremember what they d eaten but she remembered the look in his eyes and could almost still feel the touch of his hand and taste his lips when she had finally returned to the gryffindor common room her brother had been waiting for her ron jumped up from a sofa as though he was about to start questioning her right there hermione hand on his arm had restrained him jerking his head toward the boys staircase he had bounded up the steps while harry and hermione had followed behind her ginny hadntobjected she was resigned to the trio being inseparable inside ron dorm he had waited for the door to close behind her before demanding why did you have to kiss malfoy in the middle of the entry not giving her time to respond he spluttered then you let him carry you off to who knows where and everybody in the hall was talking about it giving her a look that reminded her uncomfortably of molly he finished what were you thinking at least he didntsay young lady that would have been too eerie she moved forward and reached up to kiss his cheek i was thinking that finally i could show how i feel and not care who knows it i ve never been happier cantyou be happy for me the blue fire in his eyes instantly extinguished wide mouth turning down ron said aw cripes ginny i want you to be happy but merlin sister it malfoy hermione held his hand and squeezed harry patted him on the shoulder he exhaled heavily i wontgive you any more grief about it but dontexpect me to make nice i won t ginny hermione sounded reluctant a bearer of bad news i wouldntsay anything except i really feel you should know so you can be prepared given an okay she stated matter of factly those two roommates you hexed were pretty vocal and bitter about the whole thing and they werentthe only ones listening to hands finish up his lecture ginny reflected that the news hadntcome as a shock she had known that some maybe a lot of girls were going to be upset when they found out draco was taken she just didntcare if anybody got in her face about it they d find out what other hexes she knew at the head of the classroom the pontificating teacher got her full attention when he gushed today class you have a treat in store mr creevey has generously offered to sing a muggle song about sending a letter and miss zabini has agreed to accompany him please give your classmates a round of applause ginny looked up from her work to see blaise standing beside colin with a half smile on her face that was different she usually dragged her feet as though heading to the guillotine and scowled fiercely a glance at luna showed that the dreamy eyed blonde was mystified by this duet as well colin said the song we re going to sing is by the beatles it called p s i love you ginny heard a few classmates snigger but she thought their voices blended well as i write this letter the song was about sending a letter to a lover so they would remember that while the couple wouldntalways be apart they would always be in love ginny sighed to keep all draco love forever what a thought the song was catchy with p s i love you you you you sung several times blaise sang with her eyes closed probably imagining singing to terry only one classmate didntappear to enjoy the duet mindy posture seemed to get upright and stiff as the song progressed the sight reminded ginny of a girl talk one night during easter holiday blaise had shared that on the day after the valentine dance hermione had misheard a conversation in the library between blaise and ron and hexed the other girl for it she had laughed about going beyond the call of matchmaking duty ginny frowned if colin didntstop smiling at his singing partner history might repeat itself she did not think blaise would find another hex amusing clapping enthusiastically along with the rest of the class she covertly tossed colin a note when hands turned to conjure the homework assignment onto the blackboard the message read are you trying to make mindy jealous her devious friend twisted in his seat to smile before winking and turning back around she shook her head at his machinations gathering her text and rolling up parchments to place them inside her carryall ginny hoped that draco would come walk her to lunch since monday morning he had escorted her numerous times on that first day he had sauntered over to her table after eating breakfast conversations had come to abrupt halts when her housemates caught sight of the prince of slytherin headed their way in the dead silence that greeted his appearance malfoy drawl had sounded even more insolent i ll walk you to your first class noticing her astonishment a platinum eyebrow rose i suppose you expect me to carry your books only if you want to i ve never carried a girl books before he grabbed the strap to sling her bag over his shoulder holding out his hand let go when she had slipped her hand into his draco chuckled over the look on her face you re keeping my love god reputation up smiling like that i canthelp it you ve never carried any other girl books but mine i ve never carried any books crabbe or goyle lug mine around now i know why these things are heavy the rest of the class filing by snapped ginny out of the memory she watched mindy press jealously to colin side while he thanked blaise for singing with him he caught ginny evaluating stare and waggled his eyebrows before leading his girlfriend out of the classroom rolling her eyes she told blaise you re asking for another hex girlfriend totally ignoring the important words dark brown eyes slanted a triumphant glance at luna she called me girlfriend luna smiled in serene approval saying a huffy goodbye to the two loonies ginny marched out of the classroom looking to her right she saw a sinfully handsome boy making his way toward her a line from as you like it came to mind the sight of lovers feedeth those in love the quote might refer to lovers in general but her heart was fed by the sight of a specific love ginny heart leapt while her cheeks heated and her lips burned to kiss his that incredible feeling was worth dealing with sullen roommates whispers and dirty looks draco took her carryall and brushed his lips across hers if you keep looking at me like that i going to have to do something about it she couldnthelp herself now that she didnthave to hide her attraction anymore her eyes ate him up at every opportunity he encouraged her by doing something about it any chance he got they headed toward the hall the feel of their shoulders pressing while his talented fingers played with hers made ginny hope that she would get a kiss soon steered toward the statue of bertha the behemoth she smiled in anticipation the smile faded when she heard voices speak it hasntbeen that bad has it seeing them together it was hermione voice trying to soothe ron answer was grudging i know it not like he goes round grabbing her arse but still the mental image is enough to ruin a bloke appetite grey eyes were gleaming with amusement at the other boy expense until hermione suggested throatily let me take your mind off it ginny had to put a hand over her mouth to stifle giggles when draco hurried her away from the sound of ron and hermione snogging her boyfriend lip was curling so adorably that when they had walked out of hearing range she burst into laughter he tried to keep looking disgusted but ended up smiling briefly after she finally stopped giggling he said i know it not like we had to see your brother and granger tongue locked but the mental image is enough to ruin my appetite they were nearing the statue of gregory the smarmy ginny slowed and began to pull draco toward the niche at the back of the monument her heavy lidded gaze travelled from his platinum hair over his classically perfect features down his gorgeous body and slid back up to linger on his tempting mouth it was hard to speak when her throat dried at the answering promise in his eyes but ginny finally swallowed hard and whispered then let me take your mind off it the flare of heat in his eyes was fulfilled by a scorching kiss at lunch blaise toyed with the food on her plate at lunch while peeking at terry for the fifth time in as many minutes meeting draco knowing smirk she asked when our situations were reversed did you feel happy for me and yet envious too his smile flashed white no you re a better person than i am mate i tolerated it and was envious as hell a startled laugh escaped her across the table pansy demanded what so funny zabini none of your business parkinson are you laughing at me saying anyone was better than you well i meant it pretending to cry on her mate shoulder blaise said boo hoo i d be gutted if i gave a damn about your opinion since i don t why dontyou shut up before you remove all doubt what a fool you are draco chuckle enraged the pug faced twit oh you you wontbe laughing when i millicent stood come along pansy no need to talk to that witch anymore blaise said as she watched them leave i think i d better watch my back with those two the last time we had words i ended up in the hospital wing it was the stuff that happened before the hospital wing that worries me said draco smiling at his dry tone she leaned back and surreptitiously peered over at terry he was looking her way lips curved enticingly she sighed they had double potions with snape last class the prospect was simultaneously brilliant and frustrating it was hard to concentrate on brewing a successful potion when she was constantly scheming how to brush his fingers or body with hers blaise returned terry smile and then forced herself to eat another few bites of food crabbe gave her a gentle nudge that almost knocked her off the bench before pointing to the uneaten half of her sandwich she picked it up and silently held it out swallowing a huge mouthful the husky boy gave her a childlike smile of thanks and ate the half in one bite on the other side of crabbe goyle bottom lip started to turn down blaise looked at draco in alarm he snorted and tossed the other teen a sandwich off his neighbour plate the slytherin boy who had his lunch taken started to protest noted who was now eating his food and kept quiet blaise glanced over and saw ginny unsuccessfully hiding a smile she bumped draco arm with hers gerd admiring your slytherin cunning frey he looked up and gave a slow grin that made the nearby greengrass twins whimper running his eyes over his girlfriend in a way that was likely raising blood pressure all over the hall he murmured the admiration is mutual the suave tone turned sour her pal loki though is another matter creevey keeps staring this way and he not looking at his girlfriend freyja she looked the gryffindor was looking blaise remembered her dream colin saying are you sure you wontsettle for wants you passionately tearing her gaze from colin s she traced the rim of her goblet with her fingertip his best friend is openly dating a slytherin he probably just curious about how you re handling all the attention uh huh luckily ginny soon left the hall after a magnetic glance toward the slytherin table the former boy of steel followed soon afterwards blaise figured it was a relief for draco not to have to fight the pull anymore forcing herself to remain at the table until at least half of her housemates had gone on to their next classes she heaved a sigh of relief on the way out creevey had already left the hall the respite was short lived passing the statue of bertha the behemoth she heard pssttt zabini blaise over here seriously tempted to keep walking and claim selective hearing disorder if questioned later blaise instead moved slowly toward the boy and a conversation she really did not want she leaned against an ample marble hip keeping a safe distance between herself and the blond leaning against the back wall colin smiled i wanted to thank you again for singing with me her smile felt tight well you were really cool with the serenade thing terry and i appreciated it i didntdo it for him for a gryffindor he sure slithered over to where she stood incredibly fast uncomfortable with the closeness blaise took a step back he followed she said i know but it was still nice and i had fun singing today so what are you up to creevey he had manoeuvred her up against the sidewall and his baby blues were too close for comfort i trying to thank you her eyes widened thank me how the corners of his mouth turned up revealing the little devil inside the angelic exterior with a friendly kiss she stuck up a hand just in time while his lips moved against her palm blaise said i dontkiss my friends especially not my male friends colin not even if i really really like them because i love terry and it not worth losing him to satisfy my curiosity about what it would be like to kiss you them you ve thought about what it would be like to kiss me when blaise had ignored ginny warning to brag on being called girlfriend she had not thought she would be getting her own back so soon glad that creevey had taken a step away she lowered her hand and said bluntly sure back in fourth year i almost said yes when you asked me out i thought you were cute she smiled wryly i still think you re cute which is why i ve never kissed you all those times i could ve i dontwant to ruin our friendship i like being your friend searching his eyes she asked what about mindy she seems to really care about you his short laugh was bitter does she or am i just a challenge is mindy jealous of you because she cares or because she doesntwant to lose another boy to blaise zabini she didntknow the girl well enough to say he said look i like being your friend too so i wontroger it the sincerity in his voice turned teasing so you almost said yes blaise shook her head at his ego she backed away directly into a girl who had been listening to the conversation by the look on her face hello blaise colin we need to talk hello mindy i ve erm got to go to class bye relieved that the determined look in the girl eyes wasntdirected at her she quickly walked away a few hours later blaise passed the couple on her way to potions they smiled she noticed that they both had puffy lips and bet that most of that talk had been non verbal in the dungeon corridor she saw terry up ahead and scooted through the press of students to come up behind him and whisper hey baby he didntturn around only whispered back hey i ll try to be one of the first to get to the student cupboard falling back so snape wouldntthink they had been conversing blaise moved into the classroom fiona was already at the table her hazel eyes sparkled we re making another one of those funky medieval potions today she said in a low voice if pansy blows smoke your way duck blaise looked at pansy and millicent they were cackling together like the hags they were the pair smiled nastily at the girl behind them she gave them a dismissive glance but whispered to fiona i really think they re stupid enough to try i ll watch out for them snape voice carried across the chamber stilling all conversation the instructions are listed on the board this potion should be simple enough for even the maladroit to brew so there is no need for discussion begin jotting down the list of ingredients needed blaise caught fiona eye and indicated that she d grab them from the student cupboard her friend mimed filling and heating the cauldrons they stifled laughter the professor was not amused are you performing pantomime instead of potions miss flint miss zabini blaise looked up into the sardonic countenance and shook her head silently apologetic she couldnthelp thinking that although snape looked best in black he d been surprisingly attractive in white fencing gear she almost giggled lorelei had sure thought so untimely laughter was no longer a problem when fathomless dark eyes looked into hers and then narrowed alarmed she glanced down surely wandless legilimency could not be performed that quickly very well snape said curtly you may proceed rushing back to the student cupboard to get the necessary ingredients from the stores she made sure to pick out her items in the same order as her boyfriend so she could brush her fingers against his terry smiled sharing her amusement that they could meet and snog like crazy in every out of the way place and yet get such a thrill from clandestine touches she returned to her table handing fiona a stalk of yarrow after a quick glance assured that the professor was occupied with chastising another student she picked up her knife and mouthed chop finely more pantomime fiona whispered the girls had to cover their mouths and look away from each other for several moments before they could begin their potion at the end of class when the solution was simmering gently and turning a pale blue colour blaise heard someone call her name millicent had uttered the rough whisper the girl cauldron was spewing ominous gray fumes the hag smiled evilly causing the hairy mole above her upper lip to twitch doing her mate dirty work the girl used her wand to direct the smoke in one direction blaise turned and saw her boyfriend eyes widen upon seeing what had happened she took a step toward him breathing his name terry met her halfway his arms enfolding as their lips met she ran her fingers through his long hair while they exchanged deep sweet kisses her mind felt nicely fuzzy but she didntthink he was odin or that she was freyja all she thought was how lovely it was to have an excuse to be in his arms cease that inappropriate display at once professor snape command broke them apart blaise smiled at terry before turning to face her teacher while the rest of the class watched avidly he closed his eyes and exhaled a long exasperated sounding breath before fixing them with a level stare if you had read the background text pertaining to today solution you would have known that the effects were those of an analgesic not an aphrodisiac his icy glance quelled the class whispers and stifled laughter thin lips turning down the man clipped ten points from ravenclaw and five from slytherin for inadequate preparation return for detention tonight for the improper display he speared millicent with an icy glance for instigating this whole debacle you have lost your hogsmeade weekend privileges miss bulstrode swooping back to his desk snape ordered all samples attempting to earn credit are to be labelled and placed on my desk forthwith class dismissed ladling her solution into a flagon blaise completed the label and looked up to see pansy and millicent glaring at her she glanced past them to see draco gazing at her with a half smile sheepishly she returned it after class he walked beside her up the dungeon stairs he said cheer up hufflepuff you got to snog terry boy in front of the class and later you get to spend time with him in detention looks like a win win situation to me at the top of the stairs she looked down the corridor and saw terry turn to gaze back he grinned smiling widely she blew him a kiss blaise sighed contentedly as he caught it and pressed it to his heart glad that the day was almost over luna sank down into an overstuffed chair and allowed her gaze to drift around the divination classroom even though she thought the tower chamber fussily decorated in a barrage of floral patterns she approved the use of fairy phlox the subtle vanilla aroma was far far better than the one trelawney had previously inflicted on her students idly watching the professor flit around the space like some giant gray moth the girl lifted a tiny blonde braid away from her face and absently twined it around her finger something was different about the woman today after a moment contemplation luna realized that trelawney wasntoff in her own world smoothing down her hair constantly adjusting her oversized glasses and fiddling with the long strand of amber beads around her neck the teacher appeared to be nervously awaiting someone it professor hook bindy hushed exclamation brought everyone attention to the trapdoor a shiny hook had appeared followed by the rest of the piratical teacher of ancient runes wearing crimson teaching robes the man shook back his waving dark hair quite conscious that he was the centre of attention smoothing his neat moustache with the curving steel his blue eyes gleamed with wicked enjoyment even while he demurred please i only here to observe dontpay me the least bit of attention like that ll happen in a class with all girls said mindy her sarcasm made luna smile hand fluttering up to her throat trelawney took a deep breath and said in a pale imitation of her usual dramatic tones class in divination we observe with our physical senses and use established guidelines to interpret the meaning of physical objects and events after a fleeting glance toward the man who appeared extremely masculine lounging in a chair covered in chintz the flustered woman continued this year headmaster dumbledore has asked that scrying be included in the curriculum scrying is not divination the class turned to stare the man raised his hand and hook with a patently false smile of contrition i interrupting so sorry please continue trelawney smiled thinly luna noticed that the teacher was wearing lipstick she never had before unlike divination said trelawney scrying uses supersensory powers to perceive events that transpire beyond the physical warming up to her theme she enthused to scry means to see with the mind not the eyes to hear with the inner ear and so on transcending our limited senses and translating the images and impressions we gain into information we can understand and use to guide our lives hook cleared his throat sounds conveniently vague is that what so called clairvoyants do see a vision with their inner eye trelawney tucked a long strand of hair behind her ear while she faced the satirical questioner luna noticed that the colour was now ash blonde a potion or spell had been used to cover the grey almost as interesting was the slight pink tint to the woman skin when she corrected the man slowly and calmly no clairvoyance is not scrying it is a type of prophetic vision with images coming unsought holding out her hands to her class trelawney said stirringly open your minds to the possibilities move beyond what you know and embrace the extrasensory embracing the possibilities my mind is definitely open to that drawled hook giggles sounded throughout the room at the suggestive inflection squaring her shoulders trelawney ignored hook to ask miss cornfoot miss lovegood will you take the box off my desk and give each of your classmates a conch shell please following the teacher instructions the girls handed out the shells luna offered one to the runes professor who smiled charmingly and snagged it with his hook once everyone had a seashell trelawney held a conch to her ear the class followed suit with a smirk their vocal silent observer did so as well behind lenses that magnified pale eyes glowed with enthusiasm the teacher said listen closely what do you hear a girl in the back raised her hand the ocean trelawney pleased smile dimmed when a hook rose in the air after she nodded he said i hear the sound of blood flowing through the vessels in my ear through gritted teeth his fellow teacher said you are both correct however if you listen long enough class eventually fragments of conversation perhaps even whole segments for those who are more psychically attuned will become clear in time it is possible to become part of the conversation and what said hook who will they be talking with some spirit themselves trelawney snapped if you could stop interrupting every other minute james you would learn that it is the subconscious that is trying to connect with the conscious mind how rude of me sybil i apologise sincerely nay ardently titters broke out at the teachers use of each others first names luna smiled thoughtfully although blaise had relayed the conversation she and terry had overheard by the willow tree this latest slip of the tongue told her that the history between these two wasntgoing to stay in the past curtly trelawney told her students to listen closely and make an effort to hear with their inner ear what their subconscious wanted to tell them luna listened unsurprised to hear the sound of the ocean after several minutes passed she still had not made out any cryptic messages from her unconscious mind cindy was smiling and scratching out a short paragraph so was mindy trelawney drifted around the room checking notes and either nodding approvingly or clucking in exaggerated sympathy at the lack of psychic ability when she reached luna table the professor read the other messages before asking had you no snippet of communication however meaningless it might seem miss lovegood a series of coughs from the runes professor made the girl change her mind instead of telling the teacher she had heard nothing she said in place of a clear message i felt an urge to laugh then i felt dizzy and after that i experienced a gripping sense of danger it was all a load of rubbish but trelawney beamed excellent most excellent did everyone hear surprising though it is in one with so little innate psychic aptitude miss lovegood has been contacted by the deep mind whose pronouncements struggle to be understood by our limited cognitive abilities hook now sounded like he was about to cough up a lung marching over and pounding the man on the back with a grim smile his colleague voice was sugarcoated poison did you drink a cup of tea out of the pot on your table how unfortunate it been standing there all day professor hook had a very charismatic laugh girls sighed when the man flashed his white smile and said drolly only a day it tasted as bitter as those week old pots you used to leave round the take your shells with you trelawney cut in listen and record the wisdom provided by the subconscious a half scroll will be due next class you are dismissed luna didntblame the woman for shooing everyone out before hook could make her an even bigger target of gossip it was bad enough that by dinner the hall would be speculating on the current relationship between the ancient runes and divination professors the rumours would get even wilder if he d confirmed that they d had a past one although she respected her teacher for wanting to have a private conversation luna along with bindy and mindy didntleave the divination tower completely extendable ears slid through the crack in the trapdoor and allowed the girls literally hanging on beneath to hear the conversation what are you playing at james i was going to ask you the same thing sybil the wards on my door disengaged and then re activated after i left came to visit without leaving a sorry to miss you note eh the listening girls eyes widened when the man voice dropped into silky menace did you enjoy looking through my things i i did nothing except enter your lounge and call your name when it became apparent that you were not at home i left trelawney voice sounded panicked what do you think you re doing why i giving you another chance to run your hands all over my clothing m dear i dontwant your robes take them back not my robes then you must have wanted to touch my silk shirts here luna glanced at her friends mindy appeared ready to burst out laughing bindy on the other hand looked ready to burst into the tower to save a woman from a man who seemed determined to give her his clothes item by item trelawney shrilled stop it stop taunting me and hounding me and leave me alone she broke down into sobs that became muffled it was a strain to hear hook say i cantleave you alone sybil even if i didntneed your help in finding out what really happened to stuart i d still hound you because of this this had luna yanking one extendable ear from in between her and bindy and snatching the other end from mindy when the girl showed no signs of detaching voluntarily placing the handy invention back into her pocket she followed her friends down the ladder and out of the tower once in a passageway leading to the main corridor the girls stood looking at each other after giving what they had heard some thought luna said how could trelawney help hook you mean besides snogging his brains out no clue mindy laughed at her friends expressions you should see your faces you two look like i said they were merlin the girl yelp caused luna to pivot on her heel hook stood regarding them with a half smile and a raised eyebrow flattering but no i only a humble professor who couldnthelp overhearing part of your conversation do you ladies always take such an interest in others bindy looked ready to sink into the floor with embarrassment mindy appeared on the verge of a cheeky remark luna said calmly yes when others are interesting inclining his head slightly in a touch gesture a smile tugged at the corner of hook mouth it widened when he drawled is that so i afraid that after what happened to the cat it is my duty to encourage you girls to direct your attention elsewhere tapping his chin with the steel hook the man debated now which measure would be more effective taking house points or giving detention mindy said taking house points hook interjected facetiously you are absolutely right miss macdougal i too am ravenclaw very well detention it is meet me at the side entrance to the school monday night at eight o clock sharp watching hook swagger off the trio silence was broken by bindy asking what happened to the cat mindy made a face curiosity killed it the girls met wesley in the main corridor his usual good humour was conspicuously absent hook just gave me detention next monday for running in the corridors luna said the captain must want a full crew he gave us detention as well smiling at the brightening effect of her pronouncement she asked why were you running his dimples peeked out adorably when his lips curved some girls in the common room were talking about hook visiting your class and i began to worry that the fair half of our scooby gang was in peril so off i ran merlin that almost sickeningly mindy paused when she saw colin and neville hurrying toward them sweet she finished with a bright smile for her boyfriend after the girls brought the boys up to date on hook neville said why dontwe go to the kitchen and grab a snack mysteries make me hungry everyone in the group agreed wesley slid his arm around luna waist i hungry too but it not for food she smiled when the others entered the chamber concealed by a pear shaped door she pulled her sexy pirate close and gave him a lingering kiss before leading him into the kitchen to join their friends saturday morning dawned bright and clear draco knew firsthand because he had been awake to see the first rays creep across his dorm room crabbe and goyle suitably heavy sleepers had merely rolled over to avoid the sunlight streaming across their broad faces he threw on the first jumper and pair of trousers he came across in his trunk and headed downstairs once he reached the quidditch pitch he closed his eyes and waved his wand with his left hand to make the wards on hagrid shed more of a challenge to counter it was still laughably easy to retrieve his broomstick flying across the lake gave the teen a sense of peace that had been lacking in the early hours of the morning excitement over finally going to hogsmeade with ginny and dread over what his father would say once he learned of his son romantic interest had effectively murdered sleep after a series of rolls he dove toward the lake pulling up to glide above the surface in order to trail his fingers in the cold dark water suddenly the giant squid surfaced in front of him a hard right saved draco from smashing into the creature the expletives he yelled before during and after the near collision caused another flier to explode with laughter a vertical lift brought the slytherin to the level of the gryffindor hovering on a firebolt grudgingly admiring the other boy taste in brooms he said i suppose the squid never pulled that trick on you no she tried to play tag with me several times it was just funny seeing her do it to you how do you know it a she potter do you speak squid as well as snake the smile potty gave made draco uneasy wonder boy acting civil was suspicious sure during the tri wizard tournament hoggie told me that she gets real lonely hoggie platinum eyebrows rose incredulously potter said yeah loch ness has nessie and hogwarts lake has hoggie how charming draco curled his lip like your jumper the gryffindor looked down at the knitted garment with a letter h emblazoned upon it before saying dontworry you ll get one next christmas mrs weasley is probably already looking for just the right shade of green jaw dropping at the thought of being expected to wear a jumper with a d on it draco was just about to say where the boy who lived could shove a jumper when he heard a snicker he scowled go snog your squid potter sorry malfoy she only likes blonds draco realised potter had been having him on he bent low and accelerated until his firebolt was hurtling across the lake impulsively he shot past the shed and flew to gryffindor tower hovering outside ginny window he took out the melusine mirror he carried in his pocket and said her name the face that appeared on the reflective surface was drowsy and sweet draco what time is it he shrugged i dontknow morning she rubbed her eyes and smiled what up i up outside your window to be precise soft brown eyes widened really yes really so get over here will you ginny nodded and then faded from sight the window soon opened she was wearing that old robe that he liked it was thin and soft and made him want to cuddle not that he would admit something so hufflepuff he helped her climb over the wide sill the fraying hem caught on a splinter of wood the subsequent view of her legs put draco into a decidedly better humour allow me he freed her robe and considerately recovered her legs after trailing his fingers along her thigh the way he had done earlier to the water her skin was warm and infinitely more pleasing to touch she playfully slapped his hand before clasping it with hers where are we going nowhere anywhere i just wanted to see you i glad draco kept the speed slow and steady while they flew across the grounds following the edge of the forbidden forest he brushed his lips across red hair do you remember our little jaunt to see the faeries i consider that our first date he could feel her giggles against his chest some date i couldntdecide whether i wanted to slap you or snog you he enjoyed the way she shivered when his lips grazed her ear you snogged me under the slytherin table in the great hall red gave me a jolt i ll never forget her hands tightened over his cantyou set this thing down for awhile i need a break how nice that she had suggested the very thing he wanted to do most the moment their feet touched the ground he allowed the broom to drop and drew her into his arms ginny lips moving and parting and pressing against his made draco even more determined to let nothing come between them again he lifted bright strands and rubbed them against his cheek she sighed against his mouth if your hair was long i d want to rub it all over there was a brilliant incentive fine i ll order hair gro potion the moment we get back until then tell me what part you want rubbed first so i can practise her hands clenched in his hair i was just thinking aloud it wasntan offer damn i was going to give legolas a run for his girly locks too she giggled maybe i spoke too soon a girl can change her mind his fingertips traced her cheeks is this where you d want to feel my hair he lowered his fingers to trail down her neck draco asked silkily or maybe here continuing the downward slide his fingertips drifted across the front of her robe just let me know she nodded dazedly i will as soon as you grow your hair when he pouted she kissed him soundly i need to get back playfully she said i going to hogsmeade with my boyfriend and i d hate to make him wait assisting her back onto the broomstick he said quietly i feel like i ve been waiting for this day forever before she climbed back into her dorm she said i ll make it worth your wait draco was still smiling when he descended the boys staircase following a quick shower and change of clothes he was pleased to see that blaise had ordered breakfast watching her make an art form out of drizzling honey over porridge draco smiled wistfully remembering the way ginny had dumped half a jar atop the bowl she had made for him someone woke up on the right side of the bed this morning blaise said with a wide smile he countered i not the only one enjoyed detention did you mmhmm sprawled on the floor across from them crabbe and goyle seemed to be competing for who could stuff the biggest scone into their maw around a mouthful of crumbs goyle asked wot ye ave to do aise fiona and morrigan were giggling madly blaise smiled at them before telling the interested boy we cleaned cauldrons by hand after taking a bite of porridge draco frowned i dontremember that being such a thrill all three witches cackled this time getting a grip his mate explained with a reminiscent grin snape left to assist lorelei with some potion so morrigan interjected she came back to the dorm looking like the winner of a wet robe contest fiona sniggered and there was soap in her hair handing him a cup of tea blaise lifted her cup and clinked it against his to detentions he would drink to that cheers later strolling past the line of students waiting to have their passes verified by filch draco strode directly to ginny ignoring the disgruntled muttering of those who thought he shouldntbe allowed to cut the line he admired the way his girlfriend black tee and denims accentuated smooth freckled skin and bright hair her pretty face lit up when she saw him hi he kissed her in a casual claiming gesture hello holding her hand he addressed the boy staring at them with a pained expression weasley the redhead nodded stiffly before turning around ginny gave draco a pleased look it made calling her brother something other than weasel a lot easier she said i thought we d match but you re not wearing black he glanced down at his grey silk tee and blue denims are you saying that i only look good in black her cheeks turned pink he smirked she said almost shyly no but i think you look really sexy in black draco was starting to feel warm playing it off he asked straight faced really really really he said good because i feel the same way about you red they were still smiling at each other filch demanded to see their passes the caretaker cross eyed feline twined around draco ankles yowling once they had started on the path to hogsmeade ginny pursed her lips in a cute attempt at a slytherin smirk i think mrs norris remembers your cologne he scoffed that stuff blaise gave me for valentine day i could ve thrown it in the trash after that cat almost got us discovered his girlfriend appalled expression made him laugh inwardly draco said i wouldnttoss the cologne he waited until his girlfriend smiled at what she thought was consideration of her feelings to say not when i know how bloody expensive it is she punched him in the arm he laughed aloud ginny nudged his shoulder with hers grinning as if she had made him laugh on purpose his gaze narrowed maybe she had he slipped his arm around her waist and returned her smile as they walked toward the village inside honeydukes the sight of weasley and granger feeding each other chocolate samples encouraged him to drag ginny out as quickly as possible over at zonko s he pointed out a few of the most blatant weasley wheezes knock offs with a sneer that made his girlfriend collapse against him giggling what so funny he asked you are you sounded just like my brothers his grimace set her off again draco said dryly so happy to amuse she slipped her arm around his waist they decided to check out the new orpheus orbs at the sound of music scanning the new music display in the store he held up an orb and asked why are the weird sisters good and the bizarre brothers so bad ginny wasntlistening her gaze was darting around the store he asked what was wrong she shook her head nothing really i just noticed that everyone seems to be staring at us he coolly surveyed the other customers rude blighters are staring ignore them you ll hardly notice after awhile ginny said you once told me that you were used to gossip are you saying you re used to people staring too draco perused the tracks on an orb while saying offhandedly of course i draco malfoy pure blood heirs of ruthless businessmen and their outrageous socialite wives are always stared at his lips quirked at the corners now that my image has been plastered across magazines someone is always looking at me like donti know you if they ask i tell them no you don t she said i still feel uncomfortable shall we go get a butterbeer at the broomsticks he put down the orb and took her hand inside the crowded pub a table was impossible to find ginny clutched his arm i see a table at the back i ll go hold it while you get the butterbeers amused by her brisk tone and idly wondering who it reminded him of draco sauntered over to the bar the brassy haired proprietor gave a wide scarlet smile when she saw him coming hello malfoy i hear you ve got a new girlfriend draco tried not to fidget not so new two butterbeers please she improved your manners who the lucky girl he placed galleons on the bar and picked up the frothy mugs he smiled politely ginny weasley g ginny draco left the stuttering woman behind strolling to the back of the pub he nodded to the slytherins who greeted him when he reached the table he almost dropped the mugs ron said he d be happy to share his table with us said ginny stars and stones it wasnteven their table ginny had invited them to join weasley placing her drink on the table he muttered thanks weasley nodded at least he looked as uncomfortable as draco felt slytherins and gryffindors must be staring bug eyed in disbelief over them appearing to get along he kept his cool and took a drink ginny and granger carried a conversation about something or other after several minutes of chit chat draco stood i ll be right back inside the lavatory he made for the end stall even though he had no pressing need to make use of it he leaned against the sidewall thinking how lowering the prince of slytherin is hiding out in a loo he heard the door open a voice snarled never thought i d see the day malfoy turned blood traitor it was montague the bastard kept running his mouth i heard he was doing the weasley girl and that bad enough but to sit with a mudblood like she a real person instead of a freak of nature that needs to be eradicated is the lowest heaving a sigh at his quixotic nature draco stepped out of the stall you always were a bloody fool montague silencio when the burly chaser started to raise his wand he said accio wand sneering at the puny stick he tossed it into a toilet his team mate showed his objection by rushing forward fists raised in a fluid motion draco ducked and then shoved the larger boy face first into a stall door montague dropped to his knees hands lifting to stem the blood streaming from his nose one of the two boys who had watched in shocked silence began to protest you you cantdo that malfoy he a slytherin he a cretin bletchley and anyone i hear repeat any of that shite he was spouting will get more of the same warrington raised his wand i cantlet you get away ow who hexed me hey give that back ronald weasley stepped further into the lavatory holding the other boy wand between two fingers like it was covered in bogies his own wand was raised threateningly ginny asked me to come see if you needed to eat more fibre malfoy giving the slytherins a steely glance he said open your mouth and something a lot worse than slugs will be spewing out he pointed his wand at bletchley throw your wand into the toilet after the boy hastily complied weasley threw the other slytherin wand over a stall face set he stepped forward and kicked montague onto his back while draco checked his manicure weasley bent over the chaser and warned the next time you mouth off will be the last time draco waited until the gryffindor stormed off to peer down into montague defiant face he said conversationally you dontlook like you ve learnt a lesson so i going to perform a curse father taught me if you behave for the rest of the year i ll reverse it on the train back to london if not well the world will be a better place without another generation of montagues wontit when he left the lavatory draco was surprised to find ginny brother waiting outside what did you do to him weasley asked draco arched a brow let just say no one will worry about receiving unwanted advances from montague the freckled face started contorting it took a few moments to realise that weasley was trying his best not to smile despite heroic efforts the gryffindors mouth turned up at the corners in unspoken accord they headed back to the table ginny smiled uncertainly at draco when he sat down is everything okay he nodded i think i d rather have lunch somewhere less crowded though want to go to the bludger although she gave him a you ll be telling me all about it later look his girl said that sounds good she turned to the other couple do you want to come with us uh well i not sure it depends granger blathered yeah let go draco didntknow who was more surprised at weasley answer him or granger affecting nonchalance he held out his hand ginny took it and gave his fingers a reassuring squeeze as they walked out of the pub on the way to the bludger he instinctively looked at the sky amazingly it showed no signs of falling chapter 45 something wicked this way comes if draco thought the sight of him walking through the streets of hogsmeade smiling had once startled the reactions villagers and students had to seeing the foursome strolling toward the bludger made the prior shock pale in comparison gasps exclamations and stares followed their progress on the inside of shops people pressed their faces to the glass for a better look weasley shoulders hunched in reaction as though he were trying to become less noticeable granger returned the stares with a challenging gaze ginny squeezed his fingers tighter she said with dark humour that made him smile i always wondered how it felt to be a celebrity i dontthink i want to be famous anymore her brother snorted infamous is more like it and you d better get used to it he straightened to his full height if harry can put up with notoriety so can you after all you re a weasley the boy strode ahead and opened the door to the bludger holding it open for the rest to enter draco stepped into the restaurant decorated in quidditch memorabilia and stopped in his tracks most of the tables and booths were filled with students who normally wore accents of scarlet and gold if the broomsticks had seemed to be the hangout of choice for slytherin house today the bludger was the pick of gryffindor conversations hushed dramatically when the four entered spying an empty table in a far corner draco offered look if you want to go sit with your friends weasley ginny and i can take that table over there no problem weasley look was steely you saying you dontwant to eat with us malfoy no although he didn t i giving you an out feel free to take it looking mulish weasley jerked his head toward a booth two couples were leaving dontdo me any favours let go sit over there the girls were exchanging glances of long suffering draco shrugged and followed the other boy sliding into the booth after ginny so he wouldnthave to touch knees with her brother a minute later the server brought menus and glasses of water after the group ordered an awkward silence fell granger asked with determined cheer so ginny are you ready for your owl exams i studied for ages beforehand yeah like years weasley said honestly ronald it was only months ginny smiled at the happily bickering pair draco been helping me prepare telling me what to expect testing seems pretty straightforward weasley grimaced merlin that history of magic exam was brutal remembering all the ruddy dates of goblin riots as well as wand legislation and mandates of the confederation of wizards fried my brain who cares about history anyway draco kept his expression bland beside him ginny smirked those who dontwant to be doomed to repeat it brother dear weasley made a face before asking draco did you get bitten by that fanged geranium sprout threw at us for herbology hadnteveryone he refused to admit it though of course not me either granger gave her boyfriend an oh really look before she told her friend you ll do fine potions will probably include polyjuice again it isntthat hard especially if snape doesntshow his ugly mug er inwardly amused by weasley discomfort draco said i found the exam less stressful without him hovering too the relief on the freckled face almost made him smile turning to ginny he allowed his amusement to show i bet you ace defence against the dark arts the way you jinx and hex she laughed think i could perform a bat bogey for extra credit as long as you dontexpect me to volunteer once was quite enough thanks ask your brother weasley shook his head in alarm ginny laughed after their food was delivered conversation dwindled until hunger was blunted picking up his sandwich draco almost choked on a bite when granger asked him will you be coming to our house party tonight he took a long drink after his coughing fit had ended levelly he replied i d planned on ginny coming to slytherin house one look showed that she had thought the opposite he tried not to envision walking into the gryffindor common room and being hexed into oblivion hoping that his smile didntseem tense he said we could spend time at both parties if you d like ginny face became beautiful when she smiled very much he relaxed and teased you might want to keep your wand ready to defend me her laughter drew the attention of a trio entering the restaurant behind potter and macduff blaise sulky look transformed smiling widely she edged around the couple and hurried over fancy seeing you lot here that sandwich looks good mate hello ginny mr and mrs freckles draco chuckled over her frantic good cheer he said in an undertone before the other couple reached the booth having fun being a third wheel she waited until the other two couples were chatting before leaning down to say hell no and after lunch i rolling back to school where two company if you know what i mean believe me i know they shared a commiserating smile potter saw a table become available the couple said their farewells before heading toward it their reluctant satellite trailed after them turning his attention from the table where his friend seemed startled that potter had pulled out her chair draco saw ginny eyeing his chips and offered her one she winked and leaned forward to take it from his fingers with her lips her brother immediately said hermione and i have some shopping to do so uh we ll see you later tossing galleons onto the table weasley scooted out of the booth the second his girlfriend stood up with a grimace that was probably intended to be a smile he said goodbye granger seconded it before she was pulled out of the restaurant i knew a display of affection would get us some alone time ginny said adorably smug giving her a feigned look of disdain he drawled you call that a display of affection his mouth covered hers in a greedy kiss when her lips began moving against his he whispered this is affection she didntlaugh like he d expected her to she shook her head no this is love when ginny mouth lifted to his draco gallantly allowed her to have the last word that evening after a shower in his dorm the slytherin returned to his chamber towelling his hair his fringe was starting to fall into his eyes but memory of the expression on ginny face when she had talked about him having long hair made draco decide not to trim it why didntyou use the prefects bathroom boss the boys had been waiting patiently for him to finish by the piles of towels and clothing in their beefy arms the bathroom had separate showers but they knew better than to intrude crossing to his trunk draco said mildly it hogsmeade weekend gregory every prefect is lining up to take his turn idly wondering if the dead silence was a result of poor comprehension or him using goyle first name he asked does a malfoy queue up for a bath he surveyed his clothes while he waited for an answer the black on black striped silk shirt reminded him of spain he chose it and black trousers while his cronies pondered his question finally crabbe answered hesitantly no his slight smile caused the two to grin proudly over guessing the correct answer realising that they would stand and smile at him all night if not prodded draco pointed got it in one vincent now go take a shower they lumbered off he chuckled and dropped his towel when he was half dressed a loud cawing sound brought his attention to the window a giant raven was beating its wings against the glass a black envelope held in its claws he padded barefoot to the window a drop of sweat rolling down his back draco opened the aperture only enough to snatch the envelope before he closed the window with a snap and backed away from the evil looking bird it seemed to caw mockingly before flying off dread pooled in his stomach yanking open his bed curtains he sat on the bed and looked down at the envelope it was blank he turned it over the sight of the malfoy seal pressed into blood red wax tied his stomach into yet another knot breaking the seal he took out the note and read the message words cannot express my disappointment apparently the lack of my direct guidance has caused you to forget the duty owed to your name and blood rectify the unfortunate situation promptly or face the consequences draco didntneed to see his father bold signature to know who had sent the letter someone at slytherin house had owled their parents who had in turn passed information on to lucius he took the note and envelope to the fireplace inflammo it took only a moment for the stationary to turn to ash but the message remained burnt into mind he thought of mr weasley asking how will your father react to the news of your relationship a bitter smile twisted his mouth lying back across the green velvet coverlet draco rubbed a hand across his face trying to decide what to do hey malfoy are you not wearing a shirt to the party crabbe thick fingers rose to start unbuttoning his own buttons draco chuckled despite himself of course i wearing a shirt you mate he drew on his shirt saying while he buttoned i ve got a secret mission for you two tonight while you eat drink and listen to everyone talk i want you to remember if anyone mentions my father goyle frowned this is a secret mission because draco clapped the larger boy on a broad shoulder and said patiently because you dontwant anyone to know you overheard what they ve said that makes it a secret after the house party you can tell me what you ve learned and have a secret party reaching into his trunk for a bottle of firewhisky draco lifted it out he said before he headed to gryffindor house yes crabbe we will definitely be having a secret party ginny finished her shower and returned to the room to find isabel and grace gathered by her bed staring fixedly at a box while she clutched the ends of her white robe together they speculated wildly do you think he sent it said grace ooohhh i wonder what it is across the room rosaline blew gently on the newly painted scarlet nails of her right hand why dontyou ask ginny she right behind you the girls whirled around so fast that they staggered and held onto each other for stability we didnttouch it grace said quickly isabel straightened her shoulders and said defiantly if you hex us again we ll tell the initial kick ginny got out of having the silly twits acting scared of her had long worn off she had ignored them whispering sulking and glaring daggers since they found out she and draco were a couple but she wasntgoing to do it anymore hands on her hips she replied bluntly i hexed you two because you were drooling over my boyfriend and i was angry if you could act like decent gryffindors instead of tarts i might introduce you to him during the party tonight the girls grew round eyed malfoy is coming to our house party grace echoed her friend and added you d introduce us really oh my gods isabel our friends will be so jealous they thanked her profusely and rushed over to their trunks to begin tossing clothing in search for just the right outfit soft laughter brought ginny attention back to the blonde who was now admiring her left hand manicure maybe i am too cynical weasley since it seems you were right to trust malfoy you want me to take your picture together sometime will you promise not to sell it to a paper or use it for any other purpose i promise smiling ginny said then sure i d love it she picked up the box should she open it yes she should first she read the card attached g i could say i bought the wrong size but i figured you d like to know draco wanted to see you in leather b slowly removing the lid off the box ginny reached down to lift the outfit it consisted of a leather jacket and miniskirt i like that shade of brown it ll look good with your colouring said rosaline ginny left off stroking the soft supple material i cantwear this the other girl reached past her to lift an ivory camisole and a pair of matching leather boots out of the box may i wear it no then come off it weasley you know that outfit is tastefully sexy stop thinking about what your mother would say and go change ginny smiled thanks she looked down at the pile in her arms what no knickers she quipped the other girl laughed the camisole seems to have built in support and a quick sort through tissue paper ensued as i thought matching panties were included rosaline tossed them on top of the pile laughing softly as ginny rushed pink faced into the bathroom after a bit of makeup and many deep calming breaths ginny descended the girls staircase isabel and grace after gushing over her clothes and advising her on makeup had decided to back her up when she declared that ready or not she was going down to the common room at the bottom of the stairs ron hermione harry and morrigan were chatting with neville bindy and colin her brother glanced up and then did a comic double take creevey gave a wolf whistle she walked over shaking her head good thing mindy not here colin he grinned irrepressible yeah i henpecked bindy giggled i ll tell mindy that when we go over to ravenclaw later colin gave an exaggerated gasp of horror now i really in for it ron said dontneed to ask where you got that getup he sounded resigned instead of angry which was a vast improvement she teased want me to ask blaise to find an outfit for hermione ginny expected a shouted denial she was shocked when he eyed her and asked in a considering tone d you think she could get one in red before she could do more than nod someone said loudly hey what malfoy doing here ginny looked toward the entrance with a pounding heart and sweaty palms she pushed back her hair moistened her lips and kept walking through the crowd of staring housemates draco stood just inside the room managing to look coolly unconcerned that numerous gryffindors were staring daggers his expression thawed when he saw her elegant and gorgeous in black grey eyes gleamed silver while taking in her ensemble sensual lips curved as he lifted her hand to press a kiss you look beautiful he kept her hand clasped in his she held tightly to his fingers so do you draco smile made girls behind her sigh ahem ginny waved her free hand introducing isabel and grace my roommates draco malfoy my boyfriend the wicked glint in grey eyes said that he knew what a thrill she got out of saying those last two words he listened politely to the girls prattle for a few minutes before saying nice talking to you gin blossom dontyou think we should go say hello to your brother once she closed her mouth ginny replied sweetly sure baby boy let go bye girls she led the way slanting a sideways glance to see how he had taken her retaliation for the gin blossom crack a platinum brow arched but otherwise he seemed amused her breath caught and held when his fingers let go of hers to slide beneath the leather jacket and stroke her back through the soft material of her camisole colin met them halfway across the room with a couple of butterbeers she accepted a bottle with gratitude taking a hasty swig of the drink ignoring the boys who smiled knowingly at her ginny placed the cold bottle against a flushed cheek draco breathed in her ear is it the leather making you hot or something else nobly refraining from dousing the seductively insinuating slytherin with butterbeer ginny allowed her gaze to roam his muscular body eyes narrowing she accused you re letting your hair grow out both white blond eyebrows rose beneath the long fringe are you complaining the image of him rubbing long hair across her skin was making her head spin hoping her smile didntshow it ginny shook her head she took draco hand and led him to her friends the group had halted their conversations to watch their progress ron was grudgingly civil ginny malfoy weasley the others added their greetings she and draco moved to the side where he leaned with negligent grace against the wall in a low voice he said well this is different when does the party get started she pointed to the orpheus spinning weird sisters and all the different small groups laughing and chatting eating and drinking it started this is what a gryffindor party is like i let you think we danced like slytherin that time in the shrieking shack to make you jealous to keep you from dancing with blaise it worked his gaze flickered around the room guarded assessing i sorry if i ve brought up something that you d rather forget ginny said those pictures i dontthink of them when i talk about dancing i think about us his carefully blank expression changed into a rueful half smile good because i thinking that we donthave to wait until we get to slytherin house to dance ginny laughed nervously weird sisters fantabulous moondance is long on the bagpipes and short on romantic melody if i ve got you i dontneed music to feel romantic she couldntargue with that ginny felt the same way about him twining her arms around his neck she swayed in sync with the rhythm draco set they stared into each other eyes slow dancing to music of the heart distantly she heard first ron and then neville before finally harry ask their partners to dance colin groused about being the odd man out and walked off a few minutes later an oldies song that had played during the valentine dance wafted through the room colin shouted hey somebody dim the lights we ve got people trying to get romantic here the atmosphere in the common room became hushed in a shadowy corner pale artistic hands cupped freckled cheeks as draco bent and kissed ginny her body moulded to his in the same way his mouth was melding to hers it was sweet passionate and apparently too much for her brother to watch ron said pssttt ginny take that outside will you she couldnthelp but giggle asking draco will anyone in slytherin mind us snogging his mouth curled in an adorable smirk no we re not so repressed fabulous ginny said i ve always wanted to see a bacchanalian blow out she waved jauntily to her unhappy sibling and the rest of her friends strolling from the room on draco arm her confidence began to fade when she neared the entrance to the slytherin common room she had to remind herself that she was a weasley and a gryffindor before she could step into the chamber it was like walking into an underground club techno dance music pounded strobe lighting made the dancers in the middle of the room look surreal a group of writhing black snakes the sight was compelling and intimidating at the same time one girl slithered down her partner body and back up again in an erotic motion that made ginny turn to draco you dontexpect me to dance like that do you his smile gleamed white in the near darkness not unless you want to they walked around the dance floor ginny pointed to what looked like a couple of anacondas spinning another serpent between them dressed in black the same as almost everyone else crabbe and goyle were surprisingly light on their feet when she and draco neared the other slytherins blaise was affectionately yelling spinning is fine but if you bounce me back and forth again i hexing your arses catching sight of their boss the boys stopped grinning and stepped back in unison draco scowled i told you to keep her company not maul her the two looked down abashed blaise hooked her arms through theirs mr c and mr g were dancing not mauling me so dontbe dissing my homies or however you say it i d ask morrigan but she off with potter she turned to ginny smiling brightly you look gorgeous but arentyou hot here let me hold it as ginny handed over the jacket blaise said the boys and i will go fetch drinks while you two have a dance bye alone with draco and all the other slithering dancers ginny smiled self consciously until he began to move soon she was caught up in the music and the heady freedom of dancing openly with the boy she loved blaise sat on a table swinging her legs while drinking a butterbeer she watched draco and ginny dance and was glad that at least her friends were happy on either side of her crabbe and goyle were making contented sounds while inhaling platters of food earlier vincent and gregory had declared themselves her date for the evening fiona had sniggered but she d been touched the party hadntbeen as depressing as she d thought it would be because of her homies company they were endearing and gallant if bumbling she put down her bottle in order to ruffle their hair fondly they were doing draco bidding but they were still sweet her double date as fiona called them smiled in pleasure at the gesture on the dance floor ms freckles was down shaking in a way that had draco smiling admiringly and blaise lifting her butterbeer in a silent toast hearing a group of pissed housemates laugh uproariously in a corner she smiled wryly if the newly nicknamed mr c and mr g hadntattached to her like barnacles she probably would ve done something stupid like sit all night by the beer disguised as butterbeer keg and drown her sorrow that she couldntbe with terry once plastered merlin only knew what she would have done probably weaved her way over to ravenclaw crying for terry when her friends left the floor to come grab a drink blaise asked about the gryffindor party what it was like what kind of music they played until draco interrupted curtly are you drunk on drugs your eyes are too bright and you re talking too fast what wrong with you blaise pressed her lips tightly together looking away crabbe patted her on shoulder in a gentle way that would probably only leave a small bruise he said she not on anything boss blaise is just sad about pretty boy and trying to hide it is all she leaned forward to give him a smacking kiss on the cheek you are so sweet vincent i going to have to find you a girlfriend he blushed and smiled shyly gregory said i ve been sweet i want you to get me a girl too two girls who like the tall hulking quiet type might be hard to find would you boys mind sharing they shook their heads draco snapped now i know you re mental get over it mate blaise scowled she had supported him when he was brooding why couldnthe let her have a pity party if she wanted one she tossed back i will the minute you unbreak my heart unbreak my heart gods no i never want to hear that song again fiona said walking up with her boyfriend i wanted to break that ruddy orb after christmas holiday when blaise kept playing it over and over she put an arm around her roommate go get us some drinks will you david her boyfriend nodded amiably and walked toward the bar fiona eyes widened when she saw draco date hullo er ginny right yes hello fiona blaise gazed down at her outfit this is the outfit i wore the first time i crashed terry house party she said wistfully the midriff baring sleeveless top and short black wrap skirt with splashes of blue looked just as pretty as it had months ago maybe it was because she had only worn it the one time whatever the reason the clothing that she put on to cheer her up with happy memories only made her feel worse that beer in the corner was starting to call her name blaise it whispered oh what to stop you from crashing the party again said ginny terry under house arrest he isntallowed near me so he doesntleave the house and you keep your distance say you re there to see luna and wesley you could at least see him and he could see you that was such a slytherin idea blaise liked it could she do it she glanced at draco he said ginny right go crash stop moping blaise felt her spirits rise hugging everyone she asked draco what the password he whispered it ginny frowned at him how do you know the ravenclaw password the techno music transitioned into a sexy slow number draco led his girl toward the dance floor i have my ways ginny waved goodbye over her boyfriend shoulder blaise returned the wave before accepting crabbe and goyle offer to escort her to ravenclaw she asked while they crossed the common room what exactly are you boys looking for in a girl once they arrived at the ravenclaw corridor she waved goodbye to her friends who wanted a girl who loved conjuring food and eating it too and faced the guardian painting the raven sitting on the sill of the opened window turned to the shadowy man sitting in the library chair and cawed using his finger to mark place in the book he was reading the man inquired in an american accent password please a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore the painting rose blaise gathered her slytherin nerve and entered the common room disco was playing overhead a spinning ball cast sparkles across the dancers lined up to do the hustle standing on tiptoes she craned her neck to see terry he was leaning down to line up orbs dark hair brushing the musical spheres lucky orbs she wanted to walk over and brush his hair back but she couldn t her throat began to ache had eurydice felt this way gazing upon orpheus in the underworld what are you doing here ignoring the ravenclaw chaser who had once offered to keep her company if terry dumped her blaise looked for wesley and luna they were dancing toward the back she waved until they saw her and hurried over blaise what took you so long the charming boy had changed his question upon seeing his surly housemate smiling in a way that made the other boy grind his teeth wesley steered her toward terry asking what are you doing here unofficially i crashing the party officially you two invited me admiring luna tie dyed pink sundress she smiled love the dress thanks i did it myself with a few rubber bands and a spell groovy they ended up on the last row next to colin and mindy astonishingly mindy smiled when her boyfriend said wondered when you d show blaise went through the motions of the dance while looking back at terry she said too quietly for anyone else to hear i couldntstay away it was torture to be so close and yet not be able to go up to him and talk or touch over the next few hours she danced a little stood by herself a lot and relied on wesley to pass messages from one friend to the other before a slow song he came over saying that terry wanted to meet in the room of requirement early tomorrow morning when the other students would be sleeping in she agreed wesley said humorously what am i your nurse juliet she kissed his cheek no you re mercutio heir with charm wit and a happy ending ask terry if six o clock is early enough flashing the engaging smile and adorable dimples that luna got so dreamy over he saluted jauntily and headed back to give the message blaise told his moony eyed girlfriend go on dance i a big girl i promise not to wander off looking for snorkacks i ll just admire the view of my boyfriend go luna went blaise watched her and wesley move toward the dance floor she saw colin hand terry an orb and then grin mischievously over at her before pulling mindy into his arms when the current song faded terry said huskily this is a dedication from a ravenclaw to a slytherin tears pricked her eyes and clogged her throat when the music began the song was one she and colin had considered for the serenade it was the beatles till there was you blaise started walking slowly toward terry when the music ended she was in his arms wesley voice broke them apart time to go blaise a prefect just ran to tell flitwick she followed luna and wesley into the outer corridor she took a shaky breath i ll be fine go on back to the party tell terry i ll see him soon i just want to be alone get myself together all right blaise wandered the corridors until she knew the slytherin party would be over when she entered the common room she was shocked to see crabbe and goyle passed out on sofas draco was sprawled in a chair his hair was dishevelled his feet bare an almost empty bottle of firewhisky dangled from his fingers she quickly crossed to his side tell me what wrong i know ginny didntbreak up with you his eyes were so bleak the tears she had been repressing rolled down her face i may have to break up with her pushing himself to his feet draco started to throw the bottle against the wall and then dropped it with a bitter laugh father sent me a note expressing his disappointment and threatening to do something about ginny if i dont rectify the situation she slid an arm around his waist let get you up to your room the feeling of d j vu became overwhelming when he sat on the edge of the bed and wrapped his arms around her i dontwant to be alone he whispered roughly she caressed his hair feeling torn between being selfish and doing the right thing it made her feel good to be needed but she couldntgive him the comfort he wanted only one person could blaise pushed him gently back onto the bed murmuring a question when he slurred the answer she said dontworry you wontbe alone long running downstairs in heels she was grateful to charms that made the activity safe instead of death defying a quick trip up to her room and she was on her way to another house the girl she awakened said groggily blaise what are you doing here that seemed to be the question of the night she answered softly in the dark i asked draco for the gryffindor password because lucius sent him a letter that got him drunk and miserable he thinks he has to break up with you for your own good will you go to him the other girl felt for the invisibility cloak ducking underneath it yes always halfway back ginny said did he ask for me there was a dicey question when the answer didntcome ginny said if he didn t why did you come get me blaise couldnthelp her voice wavering because he needs you and i need to let my baby boy go ginny fierce hug made her feel better wiping her eyes she said merlin what are we hufflepuffs come on inside the common room blaise handed over the invisibility cloak and decided to go wait for terry in the room of requirement on the seventh floor she went through the motions to open the door on the cushioned floor of the tree house a wild man slept a sense of rightness filled her she wanted to sleep in terry arms and nowhere else he smiled sleepily at her when she stretched out beside him his soft kisses made her sigh with happiness she rested her head on his shoulder lips curving as her eyes slowly closed by the pricking of my thumbs something wicked this way comes something about professor hook made the quote from macbeth spring to luna mind perhaps it was the way he sauntered over to the small group waiting on the side steps it could be his propensity for dressing in black when not in teaching robes or maybe it was the hook after considering the expression on the lean piratical face the inscrutable smile and mockingly raised brow she decided that it was all of the factors added together which gave the man a wicked aura punctuality after a hogsmeade weekend too how delightful the sardonic blue gaze flickered over bindy mindy and wesley before lighting on luna she asked what is our detention to be sir his mouth curled with private amusement before he could answer professor trelawney stormed out of the school waving a note what is the meaning of this james i did not ask you to procure more phlox for my classroom and most certainly do not wish to accompany you into the forest to retrieve it the man placed his hook against his heart with patently false contrition he said you didn t i am so terribly sorry sybil i misunderstood last friday when you said that my scent was overpowering you did you mean something other than the phlox scent was diminishing due to the magical properties of the castle hand fluttering nervously at her throat the woman gulped no no i meant nothing else nothing at all i wondering what my note meant professor lorelei stood behind trelawney dressed in a black hooded cloak hook exclaimed behold our lovely guide you know when i sent the owl with a note asking for you to share your vast experience with the fae and lead our party into the forest i just knew you would accept within the hood lorelei face was pale and set her features relaxed when she brushed past the runes professor to hold a jar out to luna you remember faery ointment yes we need to put some on our eyelids to prevent the faeries from tricking us with glamour luna took the jar opening the lid to gather some on her fingertip wesley grinned while she smoothed the ointment flecked with bits of four leaf clovers across his eyelids he returned the favour while lorelei anointed trelawney and then tossed the jar to hook the man affected a mournful expression i afraid i canthold the jar and apply the ointment m dear sybil would you very well give me the jar and close your eyes bindy and mindy had finished by the time the professor began to lightly rub ointment onto her smug colleague eyelids along with everyone else the girls saw the way trelawney expression changed dramatically when disconcerting blue eyes were shut mindy smirked knowingly while bindy grimaced wesley murmured in luna ear when she mentioned scent i dontthink our dotty professor meant cologne buttercup luna smiled dreamily the green make your eyes look even more like the sea after a storm unfazed by the non sequitor her sexy pirate kissed her hand you re absolutely right bella luna we re going to visit a faery ring in the forbidden forest thinking about anything but romance is inconceivable he smiled impishly at bindy velma you and scrappy have scooby duty tonight daphne and i will be his eyebrows waggled roguishly otherwise occupied softly rounded face alight with laughter bindy nodded sure thing freddie professor hook strode past them making a shooing motion with his hand hurry up children we donthave all night lorelei hooked her arm through trelawney in what looked like female solidarity i know the way so i ll lead you can bring up the rear and protect the students if needed hook crossed his arms looking disgruntled at being relegated to the back he didntargue falling into line behind mindy who cupped her fingers into a hook shape and pretended to slash her throat with it luna found her very amusing the gentle tug of wesley hand brought the girl he d called daphne around with a smile she squeezed his fingers and began to walk the last time she saw faeries luna had walked with harry he had informed her of all the dangers he d encountered in the forest centaurs and giant spiders were two of the most harrowing this time wesley told her that she looked like a goddess in the moonlight artemis aphrodite any goddess she liked as long as they were kind and beautiful what a difference he said professor lorelei a bloke named william blake wrote by the moon we sport and play with the night begins our day is that true are faeries nocturnal the woman answer drifted back to them no that another misconception the fae sleep because they want to out of whim not need like we do i sure you d know professor hook tone was snide lorelei either didnthear him or chose not to respond she said the way into the forest is narrow so please enter single file and dontwander off the path whatever you do luna pressed close to wesley reaching up to play with the ends of his hair it looked good down but she d bet that pulled back into a short queue would look even more dashing tiny shimmering insects glowed in the dense underbrush darting across the small company and softly illuminating the pathway one hovered over wesley head making his hair shine golden the minute insect caught in the bright strands frantically beating it wings her fingers slid through silky hair releasing the iridescent creature before continuing her exploration behind her hook said dryly unless a swarm of insects burrowed into mr robert hair miss lovegood such excessive grooming is hardly necessary she lowered her fingers giggling when wesley muttered it necessary to me they had reached a clearing deep within the forest the small circle of mushrooms surrounded by sweet smelling grasses and ferns looked just as luna remembered it inside the ring tiny flowers in vibrant colours bloomed in a carpet of grass and moss lorelei said we need to hold hands around the ring as miss lovegood already knows when seven supplicants bring stones and song faeries are drawn to the circle and may grant requests while the students spread out hook stepped between lorelei and trelawney the potions professor deposited a handful of colourful stones and gems onto a flat mushroom in the circle before standing and clasping hook and luna hands she said for the song to travel on the night air to the realm of the fae our thoughts must be free of discord and strife think only of those you love taking a deep breath and closing her eyes lorelei began to sing a lilting gaelic song when glimmering lights began to fill the ring luna enjoyed the look of wonder on wesley face almost as much as she had her own first sight of the tiny winged faeries clothed in green zipping around the circle the fair folk laughed at the astonishment and joy their appearance provoked one faery that the girl recognised by his startling resemblance to draco malfoy flew to lorelei and pulled her hair saying if you want faery phlox from us we want silver from you he spied the chain around the teacher neck he grabbed it flying backwards we ll take this no it isntfreely offered the frantic whisper seemed to make the faery determined to see what was so special about a silver chain he tugged harder luna dropped lorelei hand when the woman gently pulled hook held on why canthe have the chain what so important about it the fae had tugged the chain free from the dress mortal and immortal males wore identical frowns puck lifted the objects hanging from the chain he frowned the emerald ring is platinum not silver and so is the band with looking up he cried infinity knots these are joining rings luna watched lorelei eyes dart around wildly the other faeries were entertaining the rest of their group only she and hook had heard the pronouncement dark eyes shining with tears implored them to keep silent puck reached out a hand to taste a teardrop before reaching into a pouch dangling from his waist tossing some dust at the man and girl after sprinkling some on his own head the faery chanted secrets not meant to be known will remain untold so mote it be he let go of the rings lorelei dropped the chain back into hiding flying to luna puck ordered tell me the secret girl she opened her mouth but couldntspeak a quick glance showed hook doing the same luna had to strain to hear him ask did stuart know lorelei said i ll tell you again i was in severus bedroom in the middle of the night when stuart burst in all i can say is that he had the poison when he entered and no one forced him to drink it her voice rang with sincerity i canttell you how sorry i am that your friend made that choice you can question everyone i ve ever known try to access my file from mushu or our mutual friend at ministry intelligence keep looking for conspiracies but you wontfind any slowly hook nodded wesley looked over and asked is everything all right luna offered the faery her silver nixi the pixi bracelet it was one of her favourites but the cause was worthy puck took it with a wink he said impatient mortals shrinking the bracelet with its smiling pixie face until it fit onto his own wrist the faery commanded give us a dance and we ll give you the phlox lorelei pulled her hand from hook loose clasp sybil you dance with james wesley will dance with luna while the girls and i will show the faeries a proper circle dance luna said i hope we donthave to sing the school song this time she felt a sharp tug on her hair and exclaimed ow satisfied with her reaction puck nodded that for thinking we d allow our ears to be assaulted again we shall provide the accompaniment girl golden instruments materialised unearthly beautiful music spilled into the clearing the chiming laughter of the fae only enhanced the compelling sound luna followed wesley lead in a waltz that was spirited instead of stately she hardly noticed when the faeries began sprinkling dust over the dancers she was caught up in the music and the look in wesley eyes when they began to rise he asked drolly i take it this occurrence is supposed to happen yes and the more a couple loves the higher they float he cradled her face in his hands kissing her sweetly forgetting the dance they clung to each other while faery dust sparkled all around luna eyes widened when she saw that hook and trelawney were rising fast staring intently at one another she told wesley if they float near us my happy thoughts will pop like soap bubbles wesley smile made her temperature and body rise he kissed her tenderly and thoroughly his hands gliding over her hair and down her back lifting his mouth for a moment he whispered our love will lift us up her fingers clenched in his hair when his hands lowered and boldly caressed their next kiss was a passionate mingling of breath and tongues luna opened heavy eyelids to see that they were still rising she smiled dreamily how high do you think we ll go he laughed huskily while bending his head to hers with us bella luna the sky the limit a n i always felt sorry for luna in chapter 8 only lifting a little higher than lorelei and dumbledore i d been waiting for an opportunity to get her back for a dance with wesley hope you re glad i did chapter 46 sitting waiting wishing in charms professor flitwick instructed the class to make eggcups do cartwheels for review ginny sent her eggcup rolling fighting the urge to roll her eyes when colin whispered did you hear about that hufflepuff who went mental over the stress of owls and ran screaming out of her common room she lost the fight rolling her eyes in a slow exasperated motion hilary duff ran screaming because she had a massive zit on her forehead and somebody asked if she d become a hindu no yes just because someone a hufflepuff doesntmean they canthave a slytherin moment colin grinned yeah after all we know a slytherin who can act like a hufflepuff her giggle over the reference to blaise cut short by the sound of a throat being cleared professor flitwick stood nearby he gave them an admonishing look she mouthed sorry while wishing her teacher was a bit taller so she could have seen him coming to appear properly studious she waved her wand and made the eggcup cartwheel once more the teacher beamed his approval ginny closed her eyelids so she could roll her eyes again without risking detention she was sick of reviewing for owls except for her practice sessions with draco he gave kissed as an incentive to excel after finishing with the practical review flitwick assigned silent reading of m poppins essay on levitation charms she knew the material by heart so pretended to read while thinking about her boyfriend instead in the weeks since she had used the invisibility cloak to visit draco ginny often went over the events of that night wondering what effect they would have on the future her mouth curved in a smile how excited and apprehensive she d been climbing the slytherin boys staircase in the stress of the moment she forgot which door was draco s opening the wrong one she walked in and clamped a hand over her mouth to stifle a gasp the sight of montague hairy chest caused her to shudder and close her eyes tightly before whirling around to make a speedy exit inside the next chamber two single and one double bed proved she had the right room ginny opened the bed curtains and slipped inside you back blaise she pulled off the invisibility cloak and whispered lumos minor the softly glowing tip of her wand revealed draco sprawled body his black trousers made the pale musculature of his torso look like something sculpted out of marble eyes closed he reached out and touched her arm i need a hug a pouting lower lip and a tug accompanied the faintly slurring words off balanced she fell against him he rolled placing his head against her chest instinctively her fingers lifted to caress his hair tha nice i don wanna be alone bad things are in the dark before she could do more than take a breath to speak he rubbed his cheek against her and chuckled did my pillow get fluffier you didn have to do tha you were jus fine she hastily uttered a sobering spell learnt from her brothers one set of thick white blond eyelashes lifted after a moment what draco saw registered because grey eyes opened wide ginny his head and body jerked away from her the quick motion made him press his palms to his temples with a hiss of pain sitting up and leaning toward her he repeated all trace of slurring gone how did you get here she offered a brushing flossing mint he took it with a snort of amusement reaching out to rub his temples ginny said blaise came and got me she said that you needed me his gaze slid away the corners of his mouth turned down she could feel the tension beneath her circling fingertips even though his tone was impassive did she say why your father sent a letter that her voice halted when he abruptly pulled away from her swinging his legs over the side of the bed and putting his head in his hands she stroked his back the letter upset you so much that you brooded got drunk and turned to blaise for comfort some comfort what she have plans with her ape man is that why she went running to you she pulled hard on his shoulders he fell back onto the mattress pushing him down when he tried to sit up ginny bent and whispered fiercely drop the self pity she wasntcrying out of relief to have you off her hands kissing him possessively she declared blaise did the right thing i your girlfriend i the one who should be here to hold you the ease with which he pushed her back against the bed and shifted to hold her body down with his would ve been embarrassing if she could feel anything except a startled thrill draco smiled in a way that sent shivers skittering down her spine then hold me his lips seduced hers to part her lids became heavy as he pressed deep drugging kisses to her mouth she closed her eyes and fell into a silken darkness that enveloped and obliterated all thought except pulling him closer when he rolled away to lie beside her ginny automatically turned to bring him back to her draco held her against his chest huskily he said that kind of comfort goes to my head and could get me in deep trouble gin blossom the wry note in his voice made ginny lift her head to smile regretting that wizard handshake his silvery gaze focused on her mouth yes he shook his head i mean no giving a short laugh he said right this minute yeah i wish i hadn t but overall i dontregret it his fingers sifted through her hair and then gently pushed her down to lie against him after several minutes of silence he admitted blaise was right i do need you my father is disappointed in me and obliquely told me to stop seeing you or else his arms tightened around her she could hear his heart pound soothingly she said lucius wontharm you you re the heir of a pure blood family draco said thy love is better than high birth to me ginny smiled shakespeare yeah his tone changed i not worried about myself the sombreness frightened her in her mind she heard blaise say warningly over the breakfast table in spain the last thing we need is to give lucius a reason to escape azkaban ginny deliberately kept her voice light dontworry about me if you think your father will try and harm me my dad has connections that can help she said i pretty handy with a hex or jinx as well rubbing her cheek against him she teased good thing i prefer firm because my pillow not very fluffy his chest shook with repressed laughter before his tone became serious i drank because i thought i d have to give you up and i couldntdo it sober ginny lifted her head to gaze into shadowed eyes you cantgive me up i refuse to go he grinned appreciatively feisty one of the reasons why i love you so damned much she slithered up to plant a kiss on his mouth you d better because that how much i love you rudely jolted from the memory of draco embrace ginny glared at the boy who had shaken her arm what she snapped colin laughed pointing to the students filing out of the classroom time to go space case when she frowned at the unfamiliar muggle term colin snickered did you switch brains with luna or something the thought made her laugh softly something mate definitely something well if malfoy doesntshow up to walk you to lunch i ll escort you shaking his head her friend said you must have really low blood sugar to act this way ginny insisted that they wait for several minutes outside the classroom before she reluctantly accompanied colin toward the great hall nearing the entry he smiled and nodded toward the boys lavatory nature calls go on and save me some red grapes okay sure when ginny passed the last door before the entry hall she wasntoverly startled when her robe was snagged and she was tugged inside she thought it was draco re enacting one of their covert encounters she smiled at the romantic gesture her smile froze to see it wasnther boyfriend who had pulled her into the room it was montague thought i was malfoy weaselette too bad for you i not she yanked her arm out of his grasp no that too bad for you because then you d be a decent person she turned to leave his wand dug into her chin you dontleave until i allow it blood traitor it was hard not to sneer at seven measly inches of willow but she refrained sliding her hand into her pocket while she said all right have your say the pressure against her throat eased her fingers tightened around her wand while the bully said i know people in high places and they dontwant the likes of you mucking up malfoy future since you re a pure blood you get a warning stay away from him or pay the price ginny bit her tongue until she could reply calmly what price is that his wand rose to slide across her cheek it felt as slimy as its owner did his broad coarse face broke into a gruesome smile how d you like to lose your pretty face bet malfoy wouldntwant you if these cute freckles were scars through her robe pocket she pointed her wand while saying expelliarmus his wand flew across the room when montague raised his fist she cried petrificus totalus he froze she jumped when the door behind her slammed open leave her alone you bastard draco stormed into the room wand at the ready he stared at the petrified chaser and then turned to pull her close after hugging her so hard that she could barely breathe he kissed her remaining breath away when ginny shared what had happened he told her that colin worried look upon noticing her absence made him reach for the trackingbrall in his pocket upon viewing her amazement and the hole that the magical blast had put in her robe draco grinned have i ever told you that you would ve made a superb slytherin she laughed in reaction to the relief she felt i think you would ve been a great gryffindor he gave a look of exaggerated horror she dissolved into giggles draco chuckled montague too ugly to become a permanent statue i think my head of house needs to hear how a prefect has abused and deserves to lose his position with a sweeping bow that reminded her of a dashing captain of the guard he said the honour is yours cherie ginny blew him a kiss merci mon coeur she waved her wand said mobilicorpus and set the frozen boy into motion after draco had rushed out of the hall in search of ginny blaise attempted to finish her lunch pansy and millicent sneering while muttering snide comments to each other didntfaze her she was used to the unappetizing view crabbe and goyle who had asked her to call them mr c and mr g when nobody else was around offered her the last chocolate chip biscuit from the platter they had devoured she took it with a smile they could be so sweet blaise glanced over at terry he was smiling at something wesley said her gaze lingered wondering when they would be able to sit and talk like that again her throat began to ache impulsively she walked over to the ravenclaw table and handed terry the biscuit for my sweetie his smile brought tears to her eyes she left the hall blinking madly in order to keep from crying like a ruddy hufflepuff pssttt zabini blaise over here what was with people waylaying her behind the statue of bertha the behemoth was it the statue proximity to the hall she recognised the speaker voice and approached warily the last time she and granger had a private chat the girl hexed her not wanting to dance until she almost dropped again she palmed her wand your parents didntforbid you to talk to me did they why the secrecy the girl tucked a bushy strand of hair behind her ear i ve been taking a lot of nonsense because of ginny and draco i didntwant to give people another excuse to call me a slytherin lover defiantly she said i suppose you d chat in front of anybody and give a rude gesture if they commented no i do my share of sneaking around blaise grinned rude gestures too curious she asked what did you want to talk about the girl glanced down at fingernails she probably kept short for practical reasons i wouldntnormally ask but ginny been rather busy lately so i decided that since you helped her get hands to sponsor the valentine dance i d ask you to help get him to support an end of year ball interested despite the pang that thinking of a ball without terry caused blaise said muggles sure have a lot of dances she thought about it for a moment would the formal attire be muggle or wizard if it was optional then those who have dress robes but cantafford or dontwant to wear muggle attire wouldntbe excluded the smile that curved hermione lips was smug no one could object either blaise respect for the other girl bumped up another notch maybe she was the brightest witch of their time giving granger a considering once over she asked do you have a muggle ball gown no i ll wear my dress robes i only wore them once to the yule ball they re perfectly serviceable that stiff proud tone didntmatch the wistful look in light brown eyes blaise said if i agree to manoeuvre hands to sponsor the ball then you have to agree to a girls day out with ginny luna and a couple of others she waved her hand airily shopping hair nails lunch deal hermione eyes narrowed i am a prefect are you suggesting that i leave school grounds without permission to flit about london shopping i presume a little slytherin persuasion was called for there a hogsmeade weekend coming up we d just be going a little further off school grounds the girl looked only a little more agreeable how will we get to london floo hermione levelled a look that made blaise fight not to fidget and where is this floo located the hog head hmmm prudent choice praise merlin the formidable girl was starting to come round using the silkiest voice possible blaise painted a beguiling image with words imagine finding that perfect dress wearing it to the ball seeing the look on ron face when he beholds you a vision of loveliness descending the girls staircase hermione was silent for so long that blaise started to worry had she gone overboard a vision of loveliness repressing the urge to shout with triumph she smiled you ll take his breath away is that a yes i shouldn t but you will i will once you win over hands blaise grinned it as good as done once in the main corridor she saw a slim blond ahead of her and ran to catch up with him colin wait up i need you blue eyes lit with unholy amusement sorry blaise too late i ve already got a girlfriend when she punched him in the arm he said ow donttake rejection well do you stepping out of right jab range he said all right dontabuse me how may i be of assistance help me think up a way to convince professor hands to sponsor an end of year ball to dumbledore he stared pale brows contracted in thought and then smoothed out the devious glint in his eyes gave her hope colin snapped his fingers easy we sing one of his favourite songs and then you do your marilyn monroe act hands agrees in order to show what a big strong influential man he is the wanker she said what a marilyn monroe act colin batted his eyelashes in exaggerated fashion breathily he cooed professor hands i was wondering do you think that someone as influential and distinguished as yourself were to propose an end of year ball that the headmaster would agree she pinched his cheek how about you do it blondie colin smirked sorry you re the one whose picture hands will want to have autographed so he can brag that the zabini girl has the hots for teacher seeing her grimace of distaste he laughed incorrigibly meet me in the library before the class we need to pick out a song okay see you binns never noticed when she was late to class but draco did when she sat down at the table he said what have you been up to glancing sideways she asked what have you been up to he raised a platinum brow imperiously she arched a dark one in return after several minutes impasse her mate shrugged i went to save ginny from whoever had kept her from the hall only to find that she d taken care of montague already she teased did you pout hardly i snogged her breathless and escorted her and the bastard she d petrified to snape office what did snape do montague has detention with filch until the end of term and if he threatens ginny again he loses his prefect privileges and faces ministry charges blaise mirrored draco smile he stared pointedly until she confessed i asked colin if he would help me persuade hands to go to dumbledore and suggest a ball why you cantdance with boot so he was staring commandingly again she pretended not to notice binns droned which founding wizard of the wizengamot said i cannot tell a lie anyone anyone doodling terry name distracted from the silent pressure for a few minutes so did sketching a picture of her inquisitive friend with an appropriately long nose he reached out and snatched the drawing draco changed the nose to a classically perfect length pocketed it and leaned close to whisper funny really funny almost as much as this this was his fingers darting out to poke her side blaise bit her lip gods he was ruthless she was incredibly ticklish stubbornly she shook her head no way was she going to tell him her reason for wanting to lobby for a dance he struck again she had to bite a knuckle to stop from laughing draco smiled wickedly you either tell me what i want to know or i continue to tickle torture you the easy way or the hard way you decide ungraciously she gave in merlin all right stop already granger asked me to okay happy now he shook his head in amused disbelief just when i thought you couldntact more like a hufflepuff blaise decided not to share about the girls day out ginny could tell him later much later like the day before hogsmeade weekend when the class was over she sneered when he wished her good luck yeah right you finally realised that a dance means you get to see red all dressed up more like it bye in the back of the library near the restricted section colin was leafing through a portfolio of music she tossed her schoolbag onto the table and sat down beside him so what have you got he continued to search i remembered seeing hands mouthing every word to that elton john song wesley and luna sang at the valentine dance i figure if we sing it we re halfway to yes she moved closer to help sort sword and stone you ve loads of songs how will you find it he lifted a sheet of music elementary my dear blaise i looked in the mum favourites section your mum liked elton john is that why you have it to remember her by yes she d clean house to his greatest hits record at her blank look he elaborated records are like orpheus orbs except flat and the old ones get scratchy his smile was reminiscent and tinged with sadness blaise felt like a git for bringing painful memories up oh i sorry if i upset you asking about her that tough losing your mum out of the corner of her eye she saw a strawberry blonde approach and called mindy over here blaise filled her in on the song and it being one of colin mum favourites mindy sceptical look turned tender when he stated with puppy dog eyes yeah i really miss her giving the girl a heart tugging look he said i miss her hugs his girlfriend hugged him blaise smiled aw that was sweet he sighed i miss the way she used to kiss me goodnight too mindy leaned forward to kiss him on the cheek he turned his head and kissed her full on the mouth before pulling back to laugh at her sputtering we were a very affectionate family blaise shook her head you really are a perv let me see the song she scanned the notes i remember dontgo breaking my heart i cantsing the girly part too high mind swapping of course not remember that song broken she had tried to forget sure let do it in muggle studies blaise waited until after she and colin sang the song to ask wide eyed in a breathy voice professor hands this wonderful song reminds me of the valentine dance do you think it possible for the school to have an end of year ball like muggles have to promote tolerance and harmony and stuff elbowing colin who was snorting over her eloquent ending she used the feminine wile that her mother swore no man could resist blaise bent her head as if shy and then raised her eyes entreatingly the teacher smiled at her with amiable condescension with me all things are possible remain after class and we ll talk about it then on the way back to her desk blaise looked at ginny and whispered a single word passing luna she repeated the soft plea of help any girl asked to remain after class with a professor named manny randy hands had a right to panic in luna opinion she smiled reassuringly at blaise who looked greatly relieved the teacher began pontificate on the different types of muggle transportation since her father had done a series of articles titled license to drive or license to kill she felt knowledgeable enough to not to have to pay close attention instead luna mind turned inward to last night vivid dream she had dreamt of a place out of myth or legend a neverland where a pirate ship glided through dark waters sails billowing the jolly roger rippled in the stiff breeze the skull and cross bones glowing white against the black fabric the full moon shone brightly on the deck of the pirate ship revenge two men were carrying on a swordfight from bow to stern one smiled wickedly while parrying he was every inch a pirate from his black plumed hat and wavy brown hair to his thigh high boots the other man looked more like a fencing master due to his severely tailored black clothing pulled back hair and finesse with a blade a thud resounded from the planks of the deck bound and gagged a mermaid with a tail covered in iridescent scales was attempting to propel herself toward the railing the pirate noticed the raven haired siren actions he laughed i must admit sir that your lady love is plucky as well as uncommonly pretty after i through with you perhaps i ll keep her in a tank for those lonely nights at sea the fencing master expression became even grimmer the only thing you ll embrace will be death when i send you down to davy jones locker the clang and rasp of steel intensified from below deck came a shimmering streak of gold zooming over to the combatants the tiny orb of light circled the pair before hovering in front of the pirate a faery shook her diminutive fist and scolded fiercely impatiently the man waved a steel hook and sent her flying she landed on the deck with an indignant peep while the adversaries continued their duel the glow about the tiny being grew steadily larger until the fae became the size of a human woman she was a unique looking female with her pale skin layered green dress and long flyaway blonde hair taking a wobbly step forward she shouted james hook stop that nonsense this instant the pirate opponent took advantage of the captain distraction to engage and then disarm the rogue the faery exclaiming halted the sword tip pressing into hook chest no dontkill him stygian eyes flashed why shouldnti because i love him and i ll let you and the siren go free with a stiff nod the man backed away and rushed back to free the mermaid hook strode toward the faerie tink why the devil did you go and dontcall me tink that the name given by a selfish little boy and i wontanswer to it anymore after rolling blue eyes the pirate grasped the faery arms sybil that siren and her paramour are responsible for my first mate death that must be revenged no james she said smee drank too much and fell overboard trying to catch a peek at a mermaid without her shells it isnttheir fault that the crocodile ate him she stroked his cheek tenderly it is not your fault either so end this now without glancing at the other couple hook declared you are free to go a resounding splash caused the man to spin around and rush to the opposite rail sybil at his side gaping at the sight of the mermaid and her lover embracing while floating slowly away he shook his head at the un natural buoyancy turning to the woman smiling at his reaction the captain snapped what is so demmed amusing you are james would you like to fly his mouth twisted self mockingly alas i have no happy thoughts she kissed him softly i love you i ll be your first mate in every way and if you search your heart you ll admit that you love me too think about it you ve got happy thoughts captain hook mouth curved in a smile that held no trace of cynicism cradling sybil face in his hands he kissed her gently she slid her arms around his neck he slid his fingers into her hair the embrace turned passionate and neither noticed when their feet left the deck and began to float upwards do you find muggle accident statistics amusing miss lovegood startled into awareness luna dreamy smile faltered she blinked at the frowning professor and denied no i only so grateful that my father doesnthave to use muggle transportation hands disapproving expression relaxed yes the wizarding world has much to be thankful for he waved his wand at the blackboard the assignment due next class is an essay contrasting a muggle and magical method of transportation if you have not experienced a muggle mode then i suggest you owl a parent or relative and get their account class dismissed the class quickly emptied luna smiled when blaise crossed her fingers and whispered wish us luck before the three girls walked up to the professor hands sat at his desk sandy blond head lowered to search through a desk drawer with an exclamation of triumph he pulled out a copy of cosmopolitan witch and opened the glossy magazine to the zabini jewellers ad the girls traded incredulous glances the wizard said defensively i enjoy the quizzes blaise smiled so do i would you like me to sign that for my favourite muggle studies teacher professor hands loosened his tie if you insist my dear smile brittle but determined blaise scrawled the autograph hands leaned back in his chair weaving his fingers together and resting them on his paunchy abdomen he said ladies tell me your ideas for this end of the world dance luna tried not to laugh it the end of year ball actually ginny said i sure professor lorelei would be more than happy to organise the decorations again a definite spark of interest lit the man eyes as blaise began to explain how harmony and understanding would be credited to him nodding in a rhythmic way that was almost hypnotic the man smiled genially at the end of the girl pitch allowing students to choose whether to wear dress robes or muggle formal wear is an excellent way to promote tolerance i approve with a heavy sigh he confided so many of my ideas to promote appreciation and acceptance of the non magical have fallen on stony ground never to take root flourish and bear fruit hands smiled sadly muggle spirit week muggle history month and the muggle film festival were all brilliant ideas that withered on the vine luna looked at blaise and mouthed say something the other girl hastily said oh that too bad i would ve participated in muggle spirit week hands sat up straight would you have worn that bikini in the ad on swimwear day ginny elbow to the side didntprod the slytherin to speech but luna gentle kick to the ankle finally prodded blaise to agree um sure sighing deeply the man shook his head how that would ve raised school spirit he gave another regretful exhalation well i shall use my considerable influence to persuade the headmaster of the vital importance of this ball by the next class i am confident that hogwarts will be one giant step closer to tolerance the three girls each thanked the professor and turned to leave ladies one last question luna said yes professor will you three be wearing muggle gowns yes sir she said along with the other girls his smile widened excellent blaise whimpered ginny pulled her out of the room while luna closed the door and smiled to see the slytherin shuddering ugh ick eeuwww he is the lowest slimiest ickiest vilest teacher on the planet ginny sniggered please dontrepress your feelings tell us how you really feel it was for the greater good luna reminded when the other girls nodded she said straight faced just try not to think about how your gowns are going to raise hands spirits both her friends faces scrunched in disgust back at ravenclaw she saw wesley was sitting at a table dividing his attention between a text and a girl who was standing beside him luna stood still while housemates moved past her into the chamber she unclenched her fists and forced her overheating brain to function rationally observing the situation without a red haze in front of her eyes revealed two things first the girl some sixth year was trying her best to chat the boy up secondly wesley was only being polite blood pressure stabilising luna walked over to the table a serene smile on her face wesley looked up his face brightening noticeably upon seeing her viewing the swing of her hips a dashing eyebrow lifted he chuckled when she dropped her bag and sat on his lap blue eyes gleamed when she pulled his head down for a long deep kiss when she finally lifted her mouth from his the girl was gone the satisfied look on her face made wesley laugh softly that one girl who will never ask to borrow my potions notes again not if she doesntwant to brew trouble his merry laughter made her and several other girls smile i like your possessive streak bella luna he lifted a strand of her hair and began winding it around his finger it matches mine she saw a prefect enter and slid over to the chair next to wesley before informing him about the muggle style ball professor hands had agreed to sponsor she asked do you think the headmaster will agree to hold one why not dumbledore seemed to like the last dance and probably doesntcare what a few parents say about their darling pure bloods being forced to enjoy themselves with inferior classmates his finger was now a lovely shade of purple kissing it she released the digit from its silky bondage and asked will you dress muggle or wizard he looked surprised it optional that inspired he gave her a heated look it depends on what you d like to see me in buttercup luna felt her cheeks turn pink the modern tuxedo you wore to the new year eve party would look s nice bright eyes twinkled while he teased s nice is that anything like s wonderful or s marvellous blushing she scolded you know i was going to say sexy the backs of his fingers brushed her cheek i know but i like to hear you say it really raises my spirits she burst out laughing it was several minutes before she could control her mirth enough to say what exactly was so funny on the morning of hogsmeade weekend draco lay in bed thinking that this day had seemed to take forever to arrive as a sixth year he was free from the burden of owls or newts but he had felt pressure all the same ginny always spirited had become more so over the weeks of review and testing one day she would complain that her teachers were becoming obsessive compulsive the next his girl would demand that he help practise a charm or test her on history of magic one more time if he tried to suggest they take a break she snapped at him when he indicated his willingness to press on reviewing she would throw herself into his arms and try to snog his lips off he sat up ginny bewitched or bedevilled by turns but she was never boring he sat on the edge of the bed and ran a hand over his hair it was overlong falling into his eyes but he still refused to have it trimmed red had become fixated on it always touching his gorgeous platinum hair and in moments of whimsy murmuring grow hair grow lips quirking draco stood and began to stretch a quick glance in his mirror reassured that his muscular tone was still at its peak even though quidditch season had ended and he d only been able to work out a couple of times in the last fortnight the thought of ginny hands roaming a chest lacking tone or definition made him vow to hit the weights more often when he flexed his pecs the amusement he felt over his display of vanity changed to chagrin when a sleepy voice asked that a cool trick boss i can wiggle my ears wanna see draco turned to see crabbe ears wiggling he said dryly you re talented vincent i can wriggle my nose like a rabbit said goyle obviously wanting equal praise he sighed i stand in awe draco strode toward his trunk halting when an ominous flapping sound reverberated at the window that a big blackbird tonelessly he corrected it a raven crabbe an idea formed opening the window wide he backed over to his bed when the bird hopped into the room he grabbed his wand and waved includere a cage materialised around the raven flapping its wings cawing angrily draco pointed his wand again silencio he bent to pick up the envelope that had dropped onto the rug it was black with the malfoy seal impressed into green wax this time are you going to open that goyle asked he shook his head not yet he placed the missive into a pouch in his trunk gathered a black shirt and trousers and warded the trunk before heading to the shower standing beneath the hot spray he deliberated what to do there were options he could ignore what was undoubtedly a second warning give in to it or ask for help he was still undecided when he returned to the room uh boss yes goyle is that bird your new pet can i feed it and water it and call it george it not a pet but yes you can care for it as long as you dontopen the cage or get your fingers too close it not a nice bird gregory in his pyjamas printed with tiny hogwarts express trains the huge boy seemed especially childlike crouching on the floor in front of the cage a sharp beak lashed out almost striking the thick outstretched fingers goyle pulled his hand back he an angry bird snatching hold of the ring at the top of the cage the boy shook the wrought iron naughty naughty be good or be thirsty george the way the raven cocked its head and quit beating its wings against the bars caused a chill to shudder down draco spine could the raven be an animagus the situation was becoming complicated he said with forced casualness i think our bird needs someone to watch him constantly if you two take turns while getting dressed i ll have slinky send you up a breakfast tray and some seed and water for george his cronies nodded obediently goyle lumbered into the lavatory while draco called into the fireplace slinky agreed to bring the requested items glancing curiously at the raven before leaving crabbe sat down in front of the cage i dontthink you should keep this bird as a pet boss i think he bad he stared solemnly at the raven if george pecks me can i wring his neck was that a panicked silent squawk smiling unpleasantly draco waited several moments before he said no but feel free to give our bird a stinging hex to teach him manners goyle relieved crabbe on guard duty after warding the cage to prevent gregory from trying to hug or squeeze george and allowing him to escape draco went downstairs blaise looked up with a smile reaching for the pot to pour him a cup of tea handing him the mug she slanted a quick glance to make sure fiona and morrigan were absorbed in their own discussion before whispering what wrong he filled her in she bit her lip you need help why dontyou guys go have a talk with mr weasley while we re having our day out draco frowned what the hell are you talking about ginny didnttell you last night about our plans for a girls day out a humourless laugh accompanied his flat no she laughed nervously heh that funny she said she would big brown eyes entreated we re going to go into london to find a dress for the ball and do girly stuff have lunch while you do manly stuff who are we ginny me luna fiona morrigan and hermione he tried to imagine the diverse group doing girly stuff it was impossible granger and girly were not words he associated together trying to bend his mind around the boggling idea draco asked sarcastically who are the blokes you expect me to do manly stuff with she started nibbling a fingernail one look from him halted the nervous habit in an undertone his mate listed wesley not david since he made plans or terry since he restricted so that leaves blaise rushed through the last names so fast they sounded like one harryandron he accepted a bowl of porridge and repeated blankly harry and ron reflexively he picked up a spoon and began to eat morrigan leaned over are you okay with our plans draco why wouldnthe be his girl got to go swanning off to london while he was expected to spend hours with three blokes who had each at one time or another kicked or helped to kick his arse it would be jolly good fun what he started to shake with silent laughter blaise took his hand i serious about asking mr weasley for help if you dontwant to take the raven to snape or dumbledore he ll help you with lucius squeezing his fingers gently she pleaded let him help you please for me and even more for ginny sake draco looked away from misty eyes swallowing before nodding abruptly fine i ll do it you go off have fun and i ll go give my girlfriend father another reason to hate me she leaned over and planted a smacking kiss on his cheek one day he ll love you almost as much as i do a strident voice said look at them milty dontthey make you sick parkinson stood with her hand in the crook of montague arm the chaser pulled the pug faced girl away ignore them pansy let go to the hall and eat sneering the girl allowed the barrel chested boy to steer her to the entrance fiona said in a strangled voice milty montague first name is milty morrigan laughed milton montague what a horrible name to give a child no wonder he turned out so badly draco imagined pansy trying to get her new boyfriend interested in a kiss and cuddle and began to chuckle beside him blaise smiled everything will work out wontit he shrugged we ll certainly find out once the group made its way to hogsmeade the girls used the three invisibility cloaks to sneak into the hog head behind the boys draco ignored the tavern patrons rude questions about the raven he carried and paid the barman for the use of his floo in the small back room he averted his gaze from the sight of goodbye kisses and set down the cage to hold ginny tightly enjoy your day out he slid his mouth across hers needing a kiss for good luck uh ginny sister the other girls have gone perhaps he d given six or seven kisses because he needed a lot of luck her lips tried to cling when he lifted his head that made him smile even though he was uncertain of how mr weasley would react to his predicament after she had flooed to the zabini office flat draco turned to ron he jerked his head toward the fireplace you first all right we ll floo to my dad workshop and i ll sneak into the house and get him roberts asked with a puckish smile are we avoiding your mother for some reason weasley you ve never met her have you roberts believe me we want to talk to my father alone first roberts looked to draco for confirmation he nodded weasley stepped onto the hearth followed by roberts and potter draco kept a firm grasp on the handle to the birdcage while he took floo powder and strode forward stepping out of the fireplace he saw mr weasley and his eldest son talking with ron apparently they had been in the cluttered workshop when the boys started arriving they hurried over upon seeing him bill nodded at the bird may i the pony tailed weasley used his wand to run some sort of test on the raven red sparks flashed this is definitely an animagus and as far as i know an unregistered one i need to take the raven to the ord aurors for questioning that okay with you malfoy yes of course take it i ll return in a few hours with the results weasley watched his brother leave with a grimace on his face never liked birds except owls always expect them to attack in flocks trying to peck everything to death in a murderous frenzy potter adjusted his glasses smiling is there something you fear more than spiders no no there not but i dontlike birds okay draco said i donteither i like birds the group turned to gaze at roberts who grinned chickens pheasants ducks fried baked roasted arthur weasley cleared his throat to gain their attention he had an air of authority despite his casual attire draco handed him the letter mr weasley examined the seal carefully gingerly breaking the wax and opening the letter the older wizard removed the parchment out of the stygian envelope after scanning it silently he read the message aloud it appears that the inferior company you keep has corrupted your pure blood character you have ignored my instructions and ill treated my messenger i am most displeased such insolence cannot be allowed to continue unchecked if you do not remove the impediment to your future it will be removed for you a heavy silence fell over the workshop weasley asked bluntly is that a threat draco looked from the son stormy blue eyes to the father calmly determined expression he said yes that definitely a threat a n this chapter goyle reminded me of the abominable snowman in the old bugs bunny cartoons who wanted a bunny rabbit saying i ll hug him and squeeze him and call him george also buddy from elf saying he an angry elf about the dwarf writer who subsequently beats him up yay for being able to use bits from anything you like in fanfiction including a line from peter pan and a reference to an old hitchcock classic the birds lol chapter 47 circle of friends mr weasley took the acknowledgment of the veiled threat to ginny much better than his son did the younger redhead grabbed handfuls of draco shirt if that bastard you call a father tries to hurt my sister arthur placed a calming hand on the boy shoulder he not the enemy ron weasley released his grip oh yeah i forgot sorry draco used a steam spell to remove the wrinkles from his silk shirt no harm done but in the future do try and remember that i only want to protect ginny potter said if you stopped seeing ginny she d be safe it took all draco could do not to laugh in the other boy face believe that do you i d not thought you one for false optimism potter i not but admit it you re too selfish to give her up conscious of his audience he spread his hands you re right i am so live with it his words were spoken to potter but he meant them for ginny family too a glance at mr weasley revealed a steady gaze and a small smile draco brows drew together the wizard was unlike any father he had ever known this calm reception made him uneasy i not asking you to give up your relationship with my daughter only to help thwart any attempt to harm her arthur composure defused the tension in the workshop draco nodded how can i help i not sure but hearing your willingness puts me at ease the older wizard gaze narrowed as he looked past the boy shoulder out the window his tone changed to one of urgency molly coming use disillusionment charms quickly the four boys blended into the background only moments before mrs weasley burst into the building waving a letter look at what come in the post it a letter from ginny she says that the school is having another dance and she wants to wear a muggle ball gown instead of wizard robes shaking the envelope she said what wrong with dress robes i wore robes to our yule ball and you couldnttake your eyes off me mr weasley cleared his throat now dear this really isntthe time for that sort of discussion the hair on the back of draco neck stood up when the woman sidled over to her husband i say this is the perfect time bill off on an errand there just me and you and that comfy rug over there his blood grew cold he was standing on that comfy rug if he moved she might notice a shift in the chameleon like properties of the spell but if he stayed draco sagged in relief when mr weasley said why dontwe go back to the house love and you can refresh my memory about those robes the man raised his voice if bill returns i ll just leave a note telling him to go get a bite to eat find something to do for a few hours before returning mrs weasley giggled the sound was eerily similar to ginny laugh hours hmm let go after the older couple had left the workshop and returned to the house the four boys broke the spell and became visible once more ron face was scrunched up in his about to spew a slug expression of discomfort he said crikey they re old they re parents that not right roberts snickered when weasley glared the other boy wiped the smile off his face sorry things are always more amusing when they happen to other people potter looked to be fighting a smile what are we going to do while we wait for er offhandedly draco mentioned our girlfriends are shopping in london as we speak the other three turned to him with interested gazes how could we find them asked weasley draco took the trackingbrall out of his pocket the freckled face became thoughtful we could floo to my brothers shop and go from there i s pose roberts grinned all in favor say aye aye he was not humouring a would be pirate draco growled arrr irrepressible roberts wesley laughed close enough the weasley twins were sharing a huge plate of sandwiches at their desk when the boys began to floo into the office jumping to their feet the two didntdemand to know what their little brother was doing off school grounds instead they delightedly clapped him on the back offered his friends a sandwich and asked if you re managing mischief can we come along draco watched the three brothers grinning like fools and tried not to feel a pang of envy he bit into a ham sandwich it was edible beside him potter said i always wanted to be part of a big family and now you are draco said green eyes gave him a mock innocent look just think malfoy one day they could adopt you too if potter expected him to fall over in horrified shock the way he almost had over that mrs weasley picking out the right shade of green for your sweater comment the wonder boy was disappointed draco shrugged and took another bite of sandwich he noticed the disgruntled expression on his old enemy face and smirked the only weasley brothers who merited being addressed by first name left two part time helpers and a trio of shrunken heads in charge of the shop the heads hung in the doorway between the public and private areas telling children who wandered too close hey don be comin thru if you don wanna look like dis the twins noticed his interest fred said with a nod to the chortling trio they re brilliant i dontknow why muggles say talking heads like it a bad thing d you draco shook his head once they left the shop roberts said my mum muggle and talking heads are what they call people on telly who talk constantly without saying anything and you have no idea what i talking about do you george smiled not really but it sounds interesting a few meters ahead potter was staring at a quidditch supply shop window when the group reached him they saw what had riveted his attention it was a notice that the chudley cannons were holding a practise session open to the public ron shouted it today he looked at the clock inside the shop i mean now the timbre of his voice rose in excitement that pitch has a public floo station nearby we could go fred and george looked tempted they looked at each other and then asked but what about your plans for finding the girls roberts said the girls dontknow we thought about following them draco was torn he wanted to go watch professional quidditch but he wanted to see ginny too a thought struck he said if the girls had wanted us to come they would ve invited us they probably want to surprise us with their dresses weasley immediately nodded i dontwant hermione mad at me for ruining her surprise i think we should go watch quidditch instead the six quickly agreed and made their way to the central floo station arriving near the pitch the cannons were using for the practice session the group strode over and got in line to purchase tickets draco stepped ahead of the others and reserved a private box he heard george whisper to his identically smart mouthed brother too posh to mix with the crowd is he without turning around draco answered if you want someone in the crowd to recognise the hero of the wizarding world i ll exchange the box for general seating when the man returns with my change silence reigned until the money was handed over and they stepped toward the entrance roberts said jokingly if you change your mind about publicity potter my father on the quibbler staff i happiest when my name is out of the papers thank you inside the box the twins grinned since we didntpay for the box we ll pay for the beer they strolled out with a cheery be back soon those that remained smiled in anticipation of an ice cold beer when the brothers returned fred tossed his younger brother a bottle laughing at his open disappointment i not facing mum wrath for serving her underage baby boy ronnikins george presented draco bottle over his arm label out like it was champagne only the best butterbeer for you sir potter glanced at his own bottle you got him a pricier brand sitting between potter and their brother on one end and draco and roberts on the other the twins exchanged glances before the one who might be fred tapped his bottle against draco bottle of course potential investors always get the best treatment george tapped his beer bottle with his younger sibling butterbeer cheer up brother you get to see the cannons today and next christmas we may be able to afford to buy you a bigger present listening with half an ear to fred spiel about the brilliant opportunity to invest in a small business draco slouched in his seat on the other side of him roberts said in an undertone do you get hit up like this a lot hit up hit on or just hit yes i used to it wearing bright orange robes adorned with a double c and a speeding cannon ball the quidditch team took the field the second string players wore white robes for the scrimmage match as broomsticks lifted into the air draco said to think quidditch began in a place called queerditch marsh at the other end harry called back or that the snitch was developed to replace hunting a bird called the golden snidget amazing the twins said as one boring their brother scowled do you want to sit by harry and talk history malfoy if you do tell me and i ll trade seats but otherwise belt it because i trying to watch a match here draco was tempted he would like to talk about the history of quidditch but he just couldntmake himself go sit by potter sulkily he watched a chaser botch a reverse pass a beater hit a bludger backbeat into one of his teammates and the keeper for the white team attempt a starfish and stick defence without a stick he said they should change the club motto to piss poor and proud of it roberts chuckled they changed it in 1972 and probably wontagain for another hundred years draco sat up straighter he asked do you know the old motto eyes on the pitch the other boy grinned we shall conquer i dontblame them for changing it to let all keep our fingers crossed and hope for the best mentally crossing his fingers draco said i suppose a ravenclaw knows everything about quidditch through the ages not all of us roberts said but i do slanting an amused glance he sighed theatrically how i wish i could talk about anything other than this dismal match while pretending only faint interest draco said let discuss the changes in quidditch since the fourteenth century once the girls flooed to the zabini london flat luna watched vastly entertained as blaise and hermione each attempted to take charge of the girls day out the slytherin girl proposed that the group visit the siren spa have lunch and then go shopping for gowns and shoes hermione shook her head i ve had a massage before when she saw ginny arch her eyebrows the girl explained it was over christmas holiday in switzerland and karl came highly recommended karl huh said ginny fiona asked did karl look like a viking god hermione ignored the questions as i was trying to say after a massage i was too relaxed to want to do anything as stressful as shopping so i suggest that we shop have lunch and then visit the spa before returning to school blaise opened her mouth probably to argue and then shut it shrugging whatever it doesntmatter let go fiona and morrigan giggled at their roommate snappish tone and followed with hermione close behind luna met ginny eyes and smiled her friend grinned impishly i hope we get a viking god named karl for our masseuse outside the building hermione asked where are we going without turning around blaise said shopping not at dolce gabbana stregone i hope why not they ve got new shoes in and i want to pick up some snakeskin slides tilting her head and using a tone that likely had the other girl grinding her teeth hermione said because the rest of us arentrich and we cantafford to purchase anything therefore we should go to a muggle shop that sells clothing at a discount that made sense to luna but morrigan pointed out i donthave any muggle money fiona shook her head me either and muggles cantsend our purchases to hogwarts you have a point hermione said but i still say we should what dig through the racks at a muggle ox farm said blaise it oxfam and no i not suggesting that at all luna spoke up i know a wizarding resale shop that sells ball gowns the bickering stopped she smiled it not too far a walk ginny asked what the name of the shop ananke closet i think i ve been there before it upscale not grotty the others agreed to go there luna led the way saying the shop name is appropriate since ananke is the greek goddess of fate and necessity beside her blaise made a face when hermione said ananke was the mother of the fates her character never wavered and her judgment was unalterable a faint bafflement coloured the girl voice she didnthave many temples dedicated to her although i cantthink why not ginny said if there was no changing her mind why pray the girls all laughed when they reached the shop located in an alley off diagon they entered and were greeted by an assistant in a little black dress luna frowned why did dress shop assistants always have to be petite and thin enough to look spectacular in unadorned black didntthe owners realise that customers had an instinctive dislike of them the other girls were telling the woman that they needed ball gowns the assistant who needed a new dye potion to cover dark roots was all smiles come this way we have recently acquired a new selection of gowns on one side of the shop gowns hung against cream colored walls or draped over mannequins classical music wafted through the space from a wizarding wireless network station luna saw that even blaise looked reluctantly impressed luna smiled when a plump witch bustled out of the back room she wore purple the lavender haired woman returned it hullo dear looking for a ball gown today yes lovely i ananke and i ve got two gowns that would suit you splendidly she led the way to a corner and gestured to a floor length gown in a turquoise and white abstract print it silk comes with a matching stole and the scoop neckline is very flattering luna was sure it was but her eye was on the teal blue gown displayed on a mannequin nearby the braided rhinestone shoulder straps and ornament on the deep v bodice were pretty but the slight fishtail hem was what made her long to try it on ah the sea goddess gown is what you want with a wave of ananke wand the gown was off the mannequin and in the girl arms dressing room right over there staring at herself in a full length mirror a short while later luna smiled at her image dreamily taking a flight into fancy holding a sequined half mask up to conceal her identity the blonde woman scanned the ballroom looking for a handsome pirate the masquerade ball was in full swing the dancers circling the room in a waltz the melody made her long to join the throng pink lips turned up only one partner would do her smile widened as she spotted a man in black making his way toward her a fabric mask obscured his golden hair but nothing could diminish the brightness of his gaze merry blue eyes admired her gown as he bowed and lifted her hand to his lips you look like a beautiful mermaid tonight he offered his hand and led her onto the floor while they were dancing she searched his face asking do you miss being a pirate trading the freedom of the sea for responsibility on land dimples appeared in lean cheeks at times that when i steal my wife away and go for a sail his lips curved do you miss being a mermaid she answered serenely sometimes that why i procure saltwater gillyweed to take with me whenever i fortunate enough to be abducted by my roguish husband he laughed the sound captivated her as much as it had once upon a time in an underwater grotto brushing tempting lips across her cheek he whispered in her ear i feeling especially piratical tonight pale eyes shining with anticipation she returned huskily i ll bring the gillyweed the face suddenly appearing behind her in the mirror caused luna to startle and jerk back clearing her mind of fantasy to focus on fiona the girl auburn hair shook you were really out of it lovegood luna gazed steadily at the other girl fiona said i was just wondering if you were going to buy that gown if you dontwant it i want it no other girl was going to play mermaid to wesley pirate if she had anything to say about it hazel eyes were rueful when fiona said i had a feeling you d say that luna tried to make up for her harsh tone by suggesting fiona try on the turquoise and white ball gown that was hanging beside the sea goddess gown it would look lovely with your colouring she said i will thanks the other girls were trying on their selections except for blaise who said she already had a gown hermione turning sideways to look at her reflection in a nearby mirror said your mother brought it back from a fashion show i expect blaise rolled her eyes what if she did got a problem with that no well i have a problem with that dress the cut and colour are all wrong for you almost anything would look better the owner sailed in just as the slytherin and gryffindor were about to go toe to toe ananke held a coral strapless gown with silver beaded accents out to hermione take this dear the moment i beheld your perfect posture i hoped you would try it on hermione said very well since you asked so nicely she took the dress and went to try it on returning a few minutes later will someone fasten the back please ginny stepped up i love the dress the hem is full and red tresses shook as she said in exasperation i cantthink of the right word fluttery the girls turned to the proprietor her eyes twinkled the way your young man stomach will flutter when he sees you wearing the gown from the soft unfocused look in amber eyes luna could tell that hermione was taking a short flight into fancy herself the girl said i ll take it light brown brows drew together what shoes will i wear with the gown blaise held out strappy sandals the colour matches the beading and the heels arentoverly high hermione stared at them with narrowed eyes before asking the older witch how much are they there no price luna saw blaise shoot the shop owner a meaningful look ananke said they are included with the gown unable to resist teasing luna said if shoes are included i ll go grab those satin slingbacks i saw earlier blaise shot back not with that dress you won t there a pair of high heeled slides with rhinestone chandelier drops that are the only shoes that will do your dress justice morrigan gasped those would go great with my dress too where are they luna dashed for the shoe display at the other end of the shop after the girls had made their purchases and arranged for them to be delivered she was still feeling victorious over winning the twenty metre shoe dash the group decided to have tea instead of a full luncheon inside a shop that rivalled madam puddifoot with its glass ceiling crystal chandeliers and oriental rugs they ordered pots of darjeeling blaise looked over at another table and said to the young woman taking their order those cucumber and cress sandwiches look good we ll have some the server nodded and began to move away ginny halted her by asking today specialty sandwich herbed cherry chicken salad do you recommend it yes they re wonderful shall i add those as well the girls all nodded hermione said thoughtfully we should probably have some fruit salad for a balanced diet morrigan said i love red currants lisa scratched her quill against the parchment once more she grinned while asking anything else ladies luna cleared her throat and said since we re trying to keep our girlish figures i ll order something light for afters when everyone looked expectantly at her she said chocolate truffle cake and giggled even while the others pelted her with sugar cubes blaise led the way into the siren spa after tea with a content sigh the classical furnishings and d cor always made her feel like a goddess behind her fiona gave a low whistle posh hermione asked what this going to cost waving her hand as if to brush away objections blaise replied airily nothing it already taken care of so relax and enjoy she turned her back strolling toward the receptionist desk one thing she had learnt from both her parents was that acting as though something was a fait accompli often swayed others into sharing that opinion since hermione didntobject blaise smile to the receptionist was a mix of satisfaction and relief changing into robes a short while afterwards the girls giggled over the gold embroidery on the soft egyptian cotton morrigan said s s siren spa or salazar slytherin tracing the entwined letters blaise said severus snape luna gave her a knowing look that received a moue and shrug the rest of the girls reacted in various expressions of disgust fiona pretended to gag the spa package began with a hand and foot paraffin dip the young ladies as the therapist referred to them broke into giggles after having their feet and hands dipped in multiple layers of paraffin and then placed into booties and mitts blaise enjoyed the deep heat that would leave their skin soft luna waved her mitts in a manner that reminded the slytherin of a pantomime she joked hey bella luna are you doing a dread pirate pantomime over there slightly protuberant pale eyes gleamed while the blonde nodded and lifted one mitt this one wesley the other girls broke into laughter ginny said to hermione come on get into the spirit she lifted a mitt and lowered her voice blimey you re gorgeous hermione raising the timbre of her voice along with the other mitt the girl said with a prim expression thank you ronald you may kiss me later if no one is looking fiona and morrigan sniggered hermione looked at ginny and raised a mitt she curled her lip and then drawled i going to snog your lips off in the centre of the dance floor red because i dontgive a damn about anybody else opinion she lifted up the other mitt to say breathily oh draco i love it when you sneer like that take me i yours the girls broke into giggles at the way hermione went mmm and rubbed her mitts together to imitate passionate snogging luna said i was only kidding about the pantomime the therapist returned to renewed laughter exclaiming you lot are the jolliest group we ve ever had blaise followed the woman into the next chamber looking forward to the herbal wrap not everyone felt the same way full body hermione brows drew together is that really necessary the therapist nodded your spirit will be calmed and your skin detoxified blaise couldnthelp teasing dontworry granger she said we wonttell mr freckles if you ve got a weird mole or a birthmark in the shape of a quaffle hermione reluctantly smiled and permitted her body to be steeped in the detoxifying wrap an attendant offered champagne while they allowed the herbs to cleanse and calm blaise automatically reached for a glass before noticing the others stares she asked do you have pumpkin juice of course miss the last treatment before they were scheduled to visit the salon was an aromatherapy massage on the way the girls passed the mud bath chamber and glanced inside curiously there were two women lying submersed to their necks in rejuvenating mud despite the turbans covering their hair and cucumber slices concealing eyes blaise recognised the faces and said in a voice trying not to slide into hysteria last one to a massage table gets cold hands carlotta her friends smiled and moved on but the girl relief was short lived sweetie darling is that you blaise dearest blaise slowly turned covered in brown ooze edina stood beaming at the group of girls who returned her inquiring smile with hesitant ones her mother shook her head complaining why did you run off sweetie dontyou know how hard it is to wade through mud darling i said to let her go eddy who gives a toss why she and her little friends are here narcissa was slumped in the doorway holding a champagne flute with muddy fingers edina gave her daughter an apologetic glance dontmind cissy dearest somebody called her baby boy a blood traitor or something equally silly at a party last night and she been in a nark ever since you wontthink it silly when the invites dry up like your skin eddy blaise glared at narcissa before asking her mother who called draco a blood traitor edina rolled her eyes montague baby girl not that it matters compared to seeing you off school grounds she reached out to caress and leave a streak of mud across her daughter cheek i am so proud of you darling flouting the rules for beauty placing her hand against her chest the woman blinked rapidly pressing her lips together before saying now i truly know that the mediwitch didntswitch babies at st mungo like cissy always said it could ve happened said narcissa eddy told me she conned two different healers into using pain cessation spells she was out cold when they pushed you out blaise said through clenched teeth thanks mum we ve got to go now massage her mother kissed the air beside her cheeks blaise could feel the mud hardening but didntbother to wipe it off instead she smiled tightly and stalked toward the massage chamber ignoring the other girls unspoken sympathy it wasntuntil the group was ready to have their hair done that an idea sprang to mind that made her truly relax turning to hermione who was also waiting for a stylist she said i letting my hair grow out so i going to skip a trim and go back to ananke closet hermione said i thought your mother already bought you a gown yes my mother she looked away i want to wear a ball gown of my choice that reflects me not this season couture then go and i hope you find the perfect gown thanks blaise hurried back to the changing area before she was tempted to go mushy and hug the girl or something days later blaise contemplated her reflection in her dorm room full length mirror sliding another hairpin with a tiny flower made of diamonds into dark curls she smiled lopsidedly her strapless dress of white layered tulle looked like one she had seen her great grandmother wear in an old photograph reaching for a black lace fan the girl opened it with a snap and fluttered it front of her face from her seat at the desk nearby cassandra said calmly lexx and scarlett cantbelieve you re going the girl cheerful as ever was applying black nail polish and shaking her head i cantbelieve you re not going to the ball i mean it awful that kieran and terry cantbe there but you could ve hung with me for the evening a gleam lit fathomless eyes malfoy and his girlfriend wontmind if you decide to run off but i dontwant to be alone watching happy couples thank you all the same fiona in the turquoise and white gown and morrigan wearing pomegranate red entered the room from the lavatory their faces glowed anticipating a romantic evening with their boyfriends they were so lucky blaise was misty eyed and thankful for waterproof siren cosmetics ready to go she asked downstairs draco leaned against a wall hands in trouser pockets while crabbe and goyle fended off mary kate and ashley blaise tapped a bony shoulder mary kate whirled around blaise used her fan to point to a couple of spotty fifth years your dates are over there girls dontkeep them waiting pouting over not getting to drool over their idol the duo flounced off draco said maybe i ll give the boys a vacation and let you be my bodyguard he gave her appearance an approving smile no one would suspect a girl who looks like you could kick their arse she reached up to straighten his tie i d do it too for you or ginny his smile made watching girls sigh and their dates shrug in resignation chuckles drew her attention to the pair who looked nice if not elegant in their formalwear lookin good mr c mr g how did your erm date go blaise avoided a narrowed grey gaze to ask when they grinned and nodded good vincent flashed a large white smile we each have a date tonight draco said what do you mean a date why didntanyone ask my opinion and are you trying to tell me that you two are sharing a bloody date couples were leaving the common room and heading toward the hall blaise said come along you ll see when we get to the entry she patted his cheek our boys are old enough to date daddy he huffed in grudging amusement and then smiled wickedly before tickling her sides she shrieked while crabbe and goyle chuckled two others huffed in disgust honestly milty what a disgrace to slytherin others will deal with them pansy let go stephen millicent crabbe stepped into montague path the look he gave caused the chaser to hurriedly move on down the corridor with parkinson warrington and bulstrode scurrying to keep up blaise kissed vincent cheek he tilted his head toward his friend giggling she kissed gregory cheek too in the entry hall couples lined up to get their pictures taken draco looked for ginny while blaise tried not to feel depressed over being all alone in a sea of happy couples it was no use her lips started to tremble someone tapped her on the shoulder she turned it was terry he smiled want to get our picture taken she touched his cheek with trembling fingers he was there wearing a tuxedo and looking so handsome it was almost unreal blaise asked how he said i wrote and begged dark blue eyes travelled over her shining it was well worth it his hands cupped her face her lips lifted toward his before his mouth touched hers she said anxiously you re not restricted to your house anymore you can be seen with me talk to me hold my hand in the corridors terry whispered right and then kissed her so tenderly that blaise cried in happiness ginny followed her friends into the entry hall when she saw blaise and terry kissing she broke into a wide smile harry and ron both in black dress robes smiled faintly elegant in her coral dress hermione nodded toward the pair she said while attempting to tuck a fallen strand back into her upswept hairstyle are you smiling because they re together or because you donthave to share your date anymore both in retaliation ginny said oh dontworry about finding a private place to snog i made sure some potted palms were placed in the corners when we decorated the hall ron frowned while listening to their banter he turned to hermione you were worried about finding a private place to snog no she poking fun at us because we keep our affection private instead of making the public display she thinks proves true love the expression on ron face was thoughtful he gazed over to where the reunited couple was now holding hands and smiling into each other eyes public display proves true love ginny clapped a hand over her mouth to stifle a laugh when he strode into the chamber pulling his girlfriend along hermione said honestly ronald you are not dragging me into the middle of the entry hall to mmm while her brother did the family proud in the snogging department ginny met the gaze of a boy so elegant her breath caught and then released on a heartfelt sigh draco wore a tuxedo tailored to perfection but she d bet that even in a set of her brothers cast off dress robes he would be breathtaking she took a step forward thinking possessively all that gorgeousness is mine mine mine when they met he lifted her hand to his lips pressing a kiss you look exquisite impulsively she curtsied you like the dress his slow smile caused her cheeks to heat i love the dress turn around slowly so i can get the full effect she felt both hot and cold shivers in the delicious way that only draco inspired ginny turned displaying the navy ball gown she had almost passed it up when shopping the deep v neck had received a too daring from hermione when she asked the girl her opinion luna morrigan and fiona had liked the way the gown complimented her colouring in the end it was blaise single word comment that had sealed the purchase fingering the sheer straps on the open back the pronouncement was sexy masculine fingertips ran lightly over the same straps now ginny was startled into giggles when her boyfriend drawled sexy draco slid an arm around her waist to lead her over to the line of couples waiting to have their picture taken blaise and terry allowed another couple to go ahead of them so they could talk with their friends luna and wesley just got their picture taken they looked so cute together looking past draco shoulder blaise added you ll look adorable too mr g and ms e amused to see draco pivot sharply to stare at the couple behind him ginny thought he made gaping incredulity look good platinum strands shook while he tried to articulate you you re dating the sister of that kells girl how why she said when blaise told me about finding a girl for crabbe and goyle i immediately thought of esmee the shy girl turned pink conjuring cookery is one of my hobbies goyle patted the pleasantly rounded shoulder of his date with a beefy hand she likes to eat too with pride he boasted when we met at honeydukes esmee ate more chocolate samples than i did the girl gave her date a melting smile that only because you offered me the last truffle she told the others earnestly gregory is such a gentleman draco looked like he couldntquite get his mind around the idea of goyle having a girlfriend and being considered a gentleman ginny patted his hand consolingly he would get used to the idea of his boys having lives of their own after they got their picture taken draco stayed in the entry to watch gregory and esmee have their portrait taken his eyes narrowed in suspicion when crabbe made his way to the front of the line tell me that the boys arentsharing a date that vincent not coming up here to take his picture with gregory and esmee rosaline photographed the couple and then said he not coming up here to take a picture with them he going to take a picture with me the expression on draco face was priceless he shot ginny a i ll deal with you later look before asking her roommate why a gleam of warmth lit the blonde girl icy blue eyes he came up to me in honeydukes and said i see you only took one sample is that because you think you re fat because you re not you could eat the whole basket if you wanted to the girl said with wry humour how could i resist such gallantry crabbe smiled broadly upon reaching them he looked to draco seeking approval isntrosaline the most slytherin like gryffindor you ever met hmm draco said enjoy your evening while they headed toward the open doors of the hall ginny pretended to pout i thought i was the most slytherin like gryffindor you ever met he leaned close that why i said hmm instead of his fingers brushed her hair aside so he could whisper in her ear mmmhmm every nerve ending went mmmhmm in response to the tingle his breath sent throughout her body inside the dining hall transformed into a ballroom that tingling sensation changed into tension ginny realised that two sets of friends each expected them to join their table at one ron hermione harry morrigan neville and bindy waited at the other luna wesley blaise terry colin and mindy sat talking each group had reserved two seats at their table ginny turned to draco who shook his head dontstick me between a bat and a bludger wherever you lead i ll follow she would remind him of that the next time he tried to linger for a few more minutes in the quidditch supply shop right now though that wasntmuch comfort while she was debating luna drifted over i going to ask cindy and jason to join our table so you can stop worrying about hurting our feelings ginny smiled her thanks and pulled draco by the hand toward ron table the moment they sat down her brother asked when did you get emerald earrings the memory of an unforgettable dance on a rooftop with city lights shimmering in all directions made her smile even while she shook her head at her brother question when asked why she wouldntsay ginny said i learn you take things ill which are not so or being concern you not ron made a face at his girlfriend i dontknow what that from but is she telling me to mind my own business hermione smiled it from anthony and cleopatra and yes she is harry directed ron attention to a nearby table where seamus had enchanted the candelabra to dance while the others watched the spectacle draco said in a low silky voice i would have bought you sapphires to match your dress had i known she reached up to finger a dangling drop i like these every time i look at them i hear you say his fingertips tracing her lips stilled her voice draco said then come and kiss me sweet and sixteen he pressed a short sweet kiss to her lips it wasntshort enough when he drew back ginny saw her brother gazing at them with the expression he had once worn regarding a cockroach cluster she lifted her hand to show ron the mood ring sorry the ring made us do it blue eyes turned speculative glancing from the ring to hermione ginny repressed a laugh when ron leaned toward draco and asked where would i find a ring like that later dancing with her boyfriend visible to all their friends wasntquite as romantic as being secret lovers but it was a lot more fun slow fast disco or techno they danced every dance until an oldie song played the long and winding road was a beatles classic that brought the hogwarts staff onto the floor in a wave that pushed the students off to watch in amusement low laughter brought ginny gaze up to draco face he gestured to the palms in a corner snape and lorelei are dancing over there luna standing nearby with wesley pointed to another couple captain hook found his happy thoughts ginny hadnta clue what the girl meant but professors hook and trelawney did look contented swaying together the woman green dress robes complimented her colouring in a manner grey clothing never had or maybe it was the way the wizard smiled while sliding his hook down his partner back that was responsible for the radiance blaise brought terry over and promptly announced that she needed to fix her makeup before dragging luna and ginny off toward the entrance hall in the outer corridor ginny said why didntyou just tell terry you needed to use the loo pressing her hand to her chest in an excellent imitation of her mother blaise gasped sweetie darling talk of bodily functions is hardly conducive to romance in her own voice the girl confessed besides it more fun to have girl talk inside the lavatory pansy and millicent were slathering on another layer of cosmetics waiting for a stall to become available ginny tried to avoid the beady eyes glaring at her but the witches who obviously believed too much is never enough wanted a confrontation pansy said millie what is that horrid smell in here blaise sneered it your designer imposter perfume pansy the broad shouldered girl acted as though no one had spoken it smells like manky weasel to me luna began to twirl one of her small side braids around a finger she said i knew a girl who smelled manky weasel before it turned out that she hadntused a deodorant spell that day and only smelled herself millicent lifted her arm and sniffed pansy threw a makeup brush at her snarling dontbe so stupid milly the girl spat at ginny you think you re safe but you re not your big brother couldnteven keep hold of a raven how he going to protect you pansy said before she stomped out i d be finding a rock to crawl under if i were you little weasel in the mirror ginny observed that her freckles stood out against skin pale with apprehension she turned from her reflection to look at her friends no one outside our group and my family knew about the raven escaping remembering draco account of how bill had apparated and inadvertently broken the includere charm which gave the raven its freedom and her brother the gashes sharp talons had raked down his arm she told them even after what montague said i didntreally believe draco father wanted to harm me a short laugh escaped scare me away yes but not physically harm what am i going to do luna hugged her blaise squeezed her hand we ll think of something right now let go back to the ball and show those hags what a weasley is made of ginny said sounds like a bit of ron rubbed off on you good blaise said fiercely in the hall the lights were dimmed and the music was dreamy reunited the couples drifted out onto the dance floor looking up into draco face while they moved together in languorous rhythm ginny pressed closer she would tell him what had happened but not now tonight she would think only of being together without cares or concerns reaching up on tiptoes she slid her fingers into silken hair and brought his mouth down to hers for a kiss a n george isnta nice bird for those of you wondering if crabbe was pulling a napoleon dynamite i see you re drinking 1 per cent milk is that because you think you re fat cause you re not you could drink whole milk if you wanted to moi use a movie line hello mcfly lol special note the end of the school year is the end of hp books but since i not jo my story isntover once they board the train for london hope you ll enjoy the places they ll go the shakespeare quotes are from the merchant of venice and a midsummer night dream respectively chapter 48 love and madness draco bent low over his broomstick as he soared across hogwarts lake casting off lingering uneasiness over his father plans he enjoyed the illusion of freedom that flying gave after today ride back to london he hoped his biggest concern would be finding ways to see ginny over the summer his lips curved interrogating parkinson the day after the ball had revealed that montague had given information in lieu of the physical intimacy pansy had expected of her new boyfriend milty sr had bragged in a letter about the raven escape but had not confided who the animagus was draco remembered the pug faced girl look of frustration and smiled although his lips remained closed early morning rays sparkled on the water turning it golden the air was cool and invigorating ahead ducks flew in v formation reminding him of the way slytherin lined up to get the quaffle a raucous caw echoed draco pulled eyes narrowing as he searched for the source of the call to the left a raven circled slowly over the forbidden forest face hardening with determination he gave chase the raven glided on the air wings outstretched another caw sounded this one struck the listener as taunting abruptly the bird wings folded sending the raven hurtling down into the forest one hand gripping his wand he followed draco pursued the flash of black in the same manner he did a snitch avoiding obstacles in his path while keeping an eye fixed on his target the leafy branches of the trees gave way to an obstacle course of broad trunks leaning to the left and right in turn to avoid collision he kept the raven in sight and plunged lower into the murky wood deep into the forest where the trees grew so closely together that flying became hazardous and the hazy light of the upper canopy darkened into shadow the bird landed in a small clearing following suit he raised his wand blue white light shot out and struck the raven bound by the animagi transformation spell the bird became a petite woman with raven black hair her eyes slid over draco in a way that made him almost physically sick ni o you dontlook happy to see me marisol laughter caused his fingers to tighten on the wand fighting the urge to hex she said your father wrote to me asking that i use my special abilities to do him a favour a favour his tone was kept as expressionless as his face what did he promise you in return the smile that parted blood red lips was pure evil a slytherin inner voice hissed for him to curse now and leave her body for the denizens of the forest to dispose of after i remove an impediment or two lucius promised to return you to my loving arms while he was trying to absorb the information without outwardly reacting she purred a wilful boy like you needs a strong wife mi amor dolore he said through his teeth watching the spanish witch fall to the ground to be in pain was a curse his father had learnt from snape it wasntunforgivable since it caused excruciating agony for short periods of time but had no debilitating side effects draco had suffered its brutal effectiveness himself hoping marisol would be just as leery of earning future torment he said finite incantatem and threatened as the woman lay shuddering next time i may not break the spell she began to laugh rising to her feet the witch swayed and licked her lips if only i had known you could make me hurt so good i would have fought to keep you lover out of the forest came faint clicking sounds draco shifted uneasily as the woman tilted her head to listen marisol said lucius also wanted you to have a taste of fear so that you will give him proper respect in the future hasta luego she shifted into a raven and flew away before draco had decided what to do with the woman or the knowledge he lifted his wand and gritted lumos to see into the shadows climbing onto his broom the boy began to rise in a vertical lift about ten meters above the ground draco came face to face with a giant spider long hairy legs dangled from the massive body hanging suspended from a cable like thread the clicking sound came from pincers shining black and deadly abhorrere he yelled hurling the spell at the red eyed monstrosity the spider baked away under the influence of the aversion charm but the forest began to reverberate with the noise of countless pincers clicking draco lifted so rapidly he almost lost consciousness bursting through the canopy with only a few cuts and scrapes to show for his misadventure he held onto his broomstick for dear life and flew toward school once back onto the grounds of hogwarts he returned his broomstick to the shed and hurried back to the castle inside the entry luggage was stacked in readiness for the return journey to london catching the sidelong looks his appearance gathered he hurried into the nearest lavatory his image in the mirror was shocking leaves and cobwebs stuck to his hair and clothing a fingertip length gash marred his cheekbone and trickled blood down his face after cleansing with water and spells he ran cold water into a washbasin plunged his face into it and held his breath lifting his head after a minute the boy shook the water out of his eyes and met the incredulous gaze of colin creevey what the hell are you doing malfoy the boy sounded genuinely confused waking up not that it any of your business creevey where ginny in the hall eating breakfast why colin sounded suspicious not bothering to respond draco stalked out of the lavatory he was relieved that ginny was all right and determined to keep her that way striding away from the hall draco saw goyle lumbering toward him with a big smile on his face george came back boss he flapped at the window and hopped onto my arm and didnthurt me or nothing he even let me pat his feathers and give him some water before he flew away wasntthat ace a beefy hand grasped goyle shoulder and spun him around crabbe looking furious shoved his best mate against the wall i told you george was bad i told you not to let him in he took the drawing malfoy keeps on his desk draco forced himself not to panic or wince when he deflected vincent punch he told the two dontsay a word about george to anyone not your girlfriends not your family no one do you understand they nodded he clapped their shoulders with a tight smile go have breakfast i ll see you later on the train they galumphed toward the hall he raked a hand through hair that was nowhere near perfection and turned again toward the main corridor something dropped onto his shoulder and ran down his arm shuddering and cursing he shook off the arachnid and lifted his wand to blast the little bastard no use of magic outside class mr malfoy professor snape stood a few metres away eyes narrowed and searching wracked by another convulsive shiver draco said with loathing i hate spiders is there a reason for this recently developed antipathy to arachnids snape voice was smoothly persuasive resisting the urge to meet his head of house fathomless gaze draco shook his head no sir for several taut moments the man waited for further explanation when none was forthcoming he clipped very well good bye mr malfoy goodbye sir when the man had turned to resume his journey to the dungeons he said professor snape yes draco the man tone was inviting where would you recommend i go for summer holiday he asked in hope that snape would understand the true question was there any place he could be free of his father malevolent influence abroad the dry voice contained a note of sardonic humour miss zabini asked me about romania several days ago staring after the retreating figure draco frowned romania back in slytherin house blaise was sitting with her friends on a sofa he caught her eye and gestured imperiously she jumped up and hurried over causing fiona and morrigan to decry her caving to chauvinism what wrong dark worried eyes searched his carefully blank expression come upstairs he didntwant to explain with pansy and millicent straining their ears to eavesdrop nearby inside his room draco slammed the door shut why didntyou tell me that you went to see snape she placed a hand on his arm i was waiting until i checked things out had a plan he shook his head in frustration if you ve got a plan i want to hear about it he began to pace i ve just come back from a jaunt into the forbidden forest where a bad bird turned into an evil woman marisol the bitch told me father promised she would be my wife if she removed an impediment or two his hands clenched into fists then she flew away to steal ginny picture while i fended off giant spiders merlin help us she hugged him is that how you cut your cheek her fingertips rose to touch his face gently i didntdo it shaving his sarcasm received a wobbly smile and a feeble attempt at humour you shave really i thought you used depilatory spells to keep that smooth skin he gave a half smile snape spill she took a brochure out of her shoulder bag and handed it over the day after the ball terry showed me his parents letter several brochures like that came with it they didntjust say we changed our mind you can go with whoever you like they made a deal mr and mrs boot lifted the house restriction but he had to agree to spend his summer holiday abroad participating in a ministry of magic volunteer corps programme she bit her lip anxiously we chose that one draco scanned the department of regulation and control of magical creatures brochure citing the magical opportunity to serve as a summer volunteer at the dragon reserve and research centre in romania it sounded like they wanted unpaid labour to shovel dragon dung and sort through scales to him he asked so terry gets sent off to romania are you looking to go with him he stared when she said i want you and ginny to come too in ravenclaw tower luna listened to her friends chat while she packed her trunk thinking how odd that none of her things went missing this year perhaps the persons who seemed to enjoy hiding her things found someone else to prank placing her toiletry bag in last she closed the lid behind her cindy said brightly well jason waiting for me downstairs i ll see you all on the train the remaining girls looked at each other expectantly once the bubbly blonde had locomotered her trunk downstairs bindy asked is our scooby gang still having one last meeting in the library her rounded features lit up when the other two nodded mindy said warningly dontcall me scrappy though after depositing their trunks in the entry the trio retraced their steps and slipped into the library several inter house couples were sitting at tables talking quietly making their way to the restricted section the girls found their boyfriends already waiting colin and neville sat on the window seat while wesley leaned against a wall listening to the two discuss the previous night leaving feast i cantbelieve malfoy didntseem to care that gryffindor won the house cup neville exclaimed he didntmake a snide comment or say anything i saw him dunking his head in a washbasin this morning said colin he looked a mess he shrugged i think he got bigger problems luna stepped to wesley side he draped his arm around her waist she leaned against him using the warmth of his body to combat the chill she experienced thinking of what problems draco and ginny might be facing unconsciously she began to wind long blonde strand around her finger wesley halted her nervous gesture kissed the bluish digit and unwrapped her finger dontworry bella luna terry couldnttell me too much but a plan is in motion that will take our four friends away from troubles this summer his voice was light in tone but heavy in meaning she smiled across from them neville said hearing you mention a plan makes me think of the one we came up with he asked are you still going to volunteer at st mungo s wesley yes i wrote my parents and suggested they make the arrangements wesley made a face they re all for my contributing to society and learning to consider others before myself i figured i might as well serve where it will do us the most good excellent neville beamed and then said sheepishly i mean if you re going to have to do community service then that would be the best all round what will you do there bindy asked curiously push round a trolley of books or wheel patients from floor to floor i suppose wesley words sparked a vision that made luna smile dreamily while the others debated on the best time and day to start their investigation into the mystery of the gum wrappers she lay on the hospital bed staring out the window and sighing a gentle knock was heard at the door the girl called come in at first glance she knew that this wasntthe dark dour healer she d thought was making his rounds this man was younger with a smile as bright as his golden hair blue eyes in a handsome face twinkled would you like something to read nodding she watched the teen roll in a trolley his gaze rested for an instant on the slender legs displayed by her hospital gown she blushed but didntreach for the blanket she d pushed away earlier pushing the trolley to her bedside the boy with the nametag wesley gestured to the books what takes your fancy today her blush deepened so did his smile revealing adorable dimples boldly sitting on the edge of her mattress the boy lifted a book how about pride and prejudice he glanced at her necklace and read the name luna she shook her head no i dontgo for the superior sneering type i liked mr bingley more than mr darcy ah wesley lips quirked while he replaced and then picked out another book tarzan of the apes is a good adventure he grinned at the way she started shaking her head before he was done speaking he placed the book back in its former spot so the strong silent type doesntappeal either hmmm he reached for a book on the bottom shelf and placed it in her hands it was old and looked well read she looked at the portrait of a couple holding each other hands while she read the title aloud the princess bride wesley continued to lean toward her after handing her the book his face was very close to hers the proximity of his lips was giving her ideas breathily she asked is this a kissing book his dimples deepened slowly he nodded her hands lifted and framed his face closing the space between them until her mouth brushed his he smiled against her lips this is an awkward time to ask but what are you in st mungo for her fingers sifted through his hair they say i loony he chuckled before his mouth covered hers in a kiss she sighed happily when he whispered love me to madness bella luna laughter brought luna out of her imaginary world and back to the real one she was kissing wesley reluctantly she stepped away he ran the backs of his fingers down her cheek daydreaming hmmm she nodded burying her face against his chest mindy sniggered that a good excuse for random snogging luna heard the girl gasp and then demand why did you grab and kiss me colin i was daydreaming bindy made a smacking sound while kissing neville on the cheek me too feeling less loony luna smiled at her friends wesley wrapped his arms around her and said cheerfully you didntmiss much our little scooby gang agreed to owl each other and in a week we ll visit st mungo s the four watching smiled and nodded after the others had left the restricted section luna and wesley remained he led her over to the window seat still pleasantly dazed from the real kiss that had paralleled its dreamy counterpart she sat beside him tracing his lips with her fingertips wesley gave her a look of droll seriousness those books arentgoing to see a soul for months if we dontwant them to despair of ever being read again we d best make sure to give them lots of hope he grinned roguishly when she kissed each dimple i glad i not the only one with an active imagination she said with what wesley called her mona lisa smile his hands glided over her back in a way that sent a shiver of anticipation coursing through her body his mouth enticed hers to open his tongue exploring in a way that made her heart pound returning the sensual caress of his hands and lips and tongue luna fingers rose to begin tugging on the buttons of her boyfriend shirt hours later on the train the reminiscent smile on her face dimmed slightly when she finally noticed the tension underlying surface cheer when the three couples had first boarded malfoy had gone to the prefect carriage while the others grabbed a compartment ginny and blaise had been chatty discussing the ball crabbe and goyle new girlfriends and the possibility of getting together for dinner soon lively card games filled the time until the food trolley came by luna thought blaise bought far too many sweets and sandwiches until draco returned claiming starvation and promptly ate an amount of food even ronald weasley would find impressive afterwards talk became private conversations between couples that was when the strained atmosphere became evident looking to her right luna could see draco speaking in a low voice that kept ginny eyes riveted to his face the girl nodded several times before resting her head on his shoulder and closing her eyes on the other side of the compartment blaise and terry public display of affection caused wesley to clear his throat meaningfully the couple smiled apologetically instead of sitting up from their almost reclining position however they used a disillusionment charm to become unnoticeable wesley slanted luna a glance filled with puckish humour once the hogwarts express pulled into the station ginny left to try to find draco who was once again on prefect duty blaise handed luna a small present with a meaningful smile just in case i dontsee you until september happy birthday after enveloping her in a fierce hug blaise followed terry off the train wesley looked at the package are you going to open it now or wait they shared a smile of ravenclaw curiosity untying the ribbon on the silver box luna carefully opened the top she lifted out a small square mirror and handed it to wesley before reaching for its match his eyes lit up a melusine mirror he said with a small laugh i ve envied terry his wishing i could talk to you the way he talks to blaise she nodded me too luna gazed down into the reflective surface wesley his face appeared gazing up into his grinning face she said we re lucky to have such good friends he nodded and waggled his brows even luckier we have good friends with money to buy us expensive presents she giggled not about to argue when she planned to enjoy her expensive present to the fullest they followed the exiting students onto the platform at one end ginny family had gathered protectively around her in the middle blaise blew a kiss to terry before she and draco joined their mothers luna noticed that mrs boot lips tightened at the romantic gesture but otherwise pretended as if the girl didntexist wesley murmured what a lovely mother in law she ll make one day he froze mid grimace she turned and saw mr and mrs roberts striding onto the platform they waved and called wesley he smiled widely at his warm reception kissing luna on the cheek thank merlin my folks look happy to see me after waving back to his parents wesley said i ll be seeing you in my mirror bella luna so keep it handy all right all right luna noticed her father the moment he stepped onto the platform he looked older more tired her stomach clenched was his friendship with ivanna greengrass not working out she rushed over magically lightened trunk dragged easily behind her she searched his face for a clue to his mood before kissing his cheek he smiled hello sweetheart in the car on the flight home lunatic larry didntrant about his lackwit reporters or the non profit instead he congratulated luna on her owls and quietly asked about school when they reached lovegood house he ushered her into the library pouring himself a firewhisky her father nodded to an envelope on the desk that came in the post today luna recognised the loopy handwriting it belonged to the aunt she had claimed to visit over easter holiday in silent dread she waited to hear what he had to say blaise brooded over the disapproving look mrs boot had given her during the short ride to the zabini london home why couldntthe woman give her a chance didntterry feelings count for anything we ve arrived stop sulking and get out draco held the door while she climbed out closing it with a snap let go to your room narcissa heard her son and drawled see eddy i told lucius not to get upset over a little experimentation amongst friends edina agreed and then raised her voice unnecessarily to say go on up and do whatever sweetie darlings but be down for dinner enrique coming and if his baby girl not there to greet him i donteven want to imagine his temper neither did blaise she nodded her acquiescence and brushed past the women inside her room she strode over to the cabinet hiding a cooling chamber and withdrew a couple of butterbeers she tossed one to draco before taking a long drink after she set the bottle on a side table she flopped back onto the bed do you think he knows about what the deed the money terry or all of it i dontknow he dropped down to join her in contemplating the canopy embroidered depiction of a quixotic knight tilting at a windmill what will you say if he does she turned her head to meet a concerned grey gaze i dontknow his commiserating smile became one of relief draco sat up and withdrew the mirror from his pocket ginny his smile widened home safely i see the two traded assurances of well being and affection blaise ears pricked when she heard the other girl say that she d had a talk with her family on the ride home ginny next statement was a pleasant surprise not so to draco who stiffened why would your parents want me to come to dinner blaise sat up to see ginny smiling face they want to hear about your brilliant plan in greater detail eyebrows arching over the phrase your brilliant plan she listened as draco said what time grey eyes shifted sideways when ginny said eight receiving a nod in response to his silent question he agreed then slid off the bed to walk into the bathroom in order to say a private farewell when he returned to the bedroom blaise was holding up two dresses for his opinion what do you think the demure white or the power red red he followed her into the dressing room while she hung the dresses back up the expression on his face reminded her of a little boy wondering if he would be taken to task for being naughty she smiled i dontmind if the weasleys think you came up with the brilliant plan she patted his cheek it everyone plan and if we pull it off we ll all be brilliant reaching to stroke his cheek once more she mock frowned getting a bit stubbly mate better shave or spell that away she pushed him toward the door i doubt ginny family want to see stubble burn all over their baby face in the doorway he paused are you sure you can handle enrique by yourself his worry made her smile affectionately i sure hours later wiping clammy palms against her sheath dress blaise wasntquite so confident although she entered the lounge smiling hello papa enrique glanced up from the sideboard where he was pouring a glass of wine hola mi amada hija the way he said my beloved daughter was worrying edina sailed into the room cissy says she not hungry now that draco gone off to dine with friends she lurched toward her husband and grabbed his drink downing it before kissing his cheek thanks sweetie i needed that lean intense features softened have another querida his faint smile vanished when he looked at blaise what have you been up to ni a at school well we had loads of finals and then an end of year ball which i helped bring about she rattled on and on in an attempt to distract her papa from his original line of questioning her mother seemed dazzled by her rapid fire commentary but her father listened with an air of grudging amusement drinky entered the room dinner is served gratefully blaise rushed into the dining room during the formal meal she asked her mother questions about crystal readings and beauty treatments to edina delight they kept up a lively conversation until dessert when enrique declined tiramisu he said enough of meaningless prattle i asked you a question earlier hija and now i demand the answer the dangerous glint in his eyes caused a quote to come to mind full of vexation come i with complaint against my child my daughter pretending that the conversation wasntlikely to become a midsummer nightmare blaise imitated her mother she asked a question edina said yes sweetie what have you been up to blaise widened her eyes innocently what do you mean her papa stood and threw down his serviette la biblioteca go he pointed commandingly before stalking out edina said i think i ll go see if cissy regained her appetite good luck darling in the library blaise sat facing the broad desk lifting a file from its polished surface enrique said since you pretend ignorance i will speak he smiled thinly imagine my surprise when i went to close the deal on sol y sombra and found that the deed necessary to complete the sale was no longer in my possession he leaned back in his chair propping his feet on the desk lighting a cheroot her father blew a smoke ring he looked across and said ominously i could think of only one person who would dare break into my safe you hija the more upset he got the heavier his spanish accent became enrique sounded like his grandfather now that was not a good thing determined to brazen the situation out blaise remained silent her father feet came down as he faced her squarely rubbing out his cheroot in a crystal dish once i accepted that my child had gone against her father i naturally became curious to discover what else my little bee had been busy doing he upended the file scattering the contents wide eyed she flinched when he threw a paper at her all the paperwork is here but yet accounts have been emptied and transferred gringotts informed me regretfully that as you are of legal age and have been given charge of your finances i am no longer to be privy to such information attempting to calm himself her father took in a deep breath and asked after a long exhale why have you betrayed my trust tears welled allowing them to fall unchecked blaise answered you betrayed mine you lied to me about owning sol y sombra about gran abuelo i did what i had to do to protect what mine her father surged to his feet in three strides he rounded the desk and pulled her roughly upright strega pequena you have nothing without tu familia little witch nothing releasing her enrique backed away raking his hands through black curls and shaking his head basta enough this situation this defiance of my authority ends now curtly he declared i have a business trip that cannot be postponed but when i return you will sign the papers my solicitors are drawing up and wrongs will be put right through a blur of tears blaise watched him storm off yelling in the corridor for drinky to andele and pack his things numbly she picked up the fallen papers placed them back into the folder and returned the file to the safe upstairs she crossed to the bedside table and took out her melusine mirror terry appeared almost at once i was just thinking about you his voice sharpened what happened what wrong she began to cry he said floo to the office baby i ll meet you there soon she was stepping out of the wizard bay winery office enfolded into terry arms he held her while she cried and explained about her father he sat beside her on the sofa clasping her hands quietly he asked what do you want to do she touched his long brown hair stared into blue eyes dark with anger and determination and smiled i want to be with you kissing him she closed her eyes and allowed the sweetness of his embrace wash away the bitterness and pain his arms tightened as she strained to be nearer blaise loved her father but she wasntgoing to give up control of her life give up terry for him or anyone else she lay in her boyfriend arms meeting the passionate demands of his mouth with her own melting against his warm strength blaise panted when his lips travelled to her throat what you asked on summer solstice how about tonight he pressed closer right now terry sounded amused and hopeful at the same time no i need to go back get a few things she kissed him tenderly will you ask your brother to cover for you he nodded yeah terry stood and helped her to her feet she cradled his face in her hands i ll be back soon i love you the memory of the love he vowed in return kept her smiling while she hurried back to her room to shower change and gather the bag she d prepared in anticipation of this day stopping briefly to leave draco a note with instructions for minky she then entered her mother room edina was in bed with a novel whose front cover depicted a blonde heroine being kissed by a pirate hero blaise smiled at the title inconceivable love she said mum the older woman flailed about screeching what who called me that horrid name seeing her daughter she calmed oh it just you sweetie come here do eddy used her novel to fan her face i know it silly to be overset by trifles but to be called mum is so terribly aging darling you ll never be old blaise refrained from adding mentally her mother noted the bag and change in hairstyle asking brightly your hair looks fab did you use a hair growth solution are you and draco going on holiday yes to both and i d recommend that you and cissy go on holiday as well papa wontbe very happy when he receives the letter from my solicitors stating their intent to protect my financial independence holiday i cantafford to go on holiday i already spent this month allowance and now i reduced to utmost poverty blaise smiled fondly i ll pay for a month in a penthouse suite in your favourite hotel leave a note telling papa to visit and then go when edina hugged her and kissed the air above her cheeks she said huskily love you mum bye without blinking at being called a horrid name eddy said love you too sweetie darling bye bye downstairs in the library blaise tried something she had never tried before looking into the mirror she called draco in a few minutes his face appeared a white blond brow lifted didntknow these things worked with others convenient isntit something in her eyes made him demand what happened i left a note explaining but all you need to know right now is that i leaving and i not coming back the moment ginny stepped off the hogwarts express her family rushed forward mum enveloped her in a warm embrace as her father looked on with a smile while her parents greeted ronald in a like manner fred and george grabbed her trunk and led her away from the train how d you like our new threads said george fred grinned stylish arentwe they wore copper coloured dragon hide jackets and trousers despite the warm weather she smiled the twins did look fashionable when told so they beamed fred stroked his sleeve cost us plenty of galleons but we re worth it george said cantwear these at the shop though peruvian vipertooth is venomous and teething ankle biters love to gnaw on dragon hide ginny pinched his cheek aw you ll be a good dad someday her brother winked that what alicia told me george laughed when fred added yeah right after she said once your extended childhood is over the two began cheerfully arguing over who was the bigger case of arrested development both wanted the title bill strolled up quit bickering and keep a lookout you two the order got operatives across the station on alert but that doesntmean we dontneed to be vigilant after hugging her briefly her eldest brother scanned the platform malfoy way too obvious about his surveillance ginny looked and saw draco openly watching her she smiled returning his scrutiny he looked so different from the other students standing there elegant and handsome with an air of confidence that most lacked he was a prince among commoners unconsciously ginny fingers lifted to trace her lips while she stared at the mouth she wanted to kiss his lips curved in smile of male satisfaction she almost jumped out of her skin when bill pulled her wrist down the slytherin isntthe only one who way too obvious ginny pinched her brother arm before turning to wave goodbye to draco as he and blaise strolled off to join their mothers the pony tailed baby whined ouch that hurt fred and george were still sniggering and taking turns pinching each other and mocking owie it hurts when their mother bustled over she scolded there is no time for your foolery boys taking in their sheepish apologies she gave a sharp nod that better gently pulling her daughter into the middle of their group molly said let be off ginny felt like a member of the weird sisters being hustled out of the reach of fans in her case the fan was a psychotic spaniard looking to remove the impediment to becoming the future mrs malfoy swept along by her protective family she remembered a conversation on the train in a low voice meant for her ears alone draco told her about following the raven into the forbidden forest she stiffened when he shared what marisol claimed his father had promised instinctively she tried to pull away he said don t she stared into grey eyes dark with shame over past mistakes ginny had seen that look in her own eyes after tom riddle had changed her life her heart leapt in her chest remembering the forlorn way he had said bad things are in the dark a rush of tenderness made her eyes tear up as she whispered i not going anywhere ron hand on her shoulder brought ginny out of memory they had reached the car climbing in to sit between fred and ron she smiled when george leaned out to call no more room back here billy boy looks like you get to sit with mum and dad bill closed the door with unnecessary firmness i ve decided to scout the station once more check in with our people and then floo home with the report when the twins saluted facetiously he gave them the finger in return they broke into laughter molly shook her head a fine example you re giving to your younger siblings go be useful and we ll see you at dinner anchoring her hat with one hand she said to arthur we d best be going dear within moments the car was airborne the invisibility booster protecting them from the notice of muggles ginny rather liked being invisible since it enabled her to relax without worrying that one of her family members would be scrutinizing her expression for several minutes she thought about draco about his plan for them to be together safe over the summer she closed her eyes and became lost in a daydream deep in a romanian forest a young woman strolled along a winding path she smiled to see that the dappled sunlight filtering down into the woods attracted butterflies pushing back the hood of her long red cloak the girl stopped to watch the colourful insects flutter up to the leafy canopy her pulse leapt when she heard a voice drawl what in the basket red whirling she met the pale gaze of a two legged wolf a picnic lunch the young man straightened from leaning against a tree asking with a lift of white blond eyebrows for grandma she strolled off the path for us with a predatory grin he took the basket and placed it on the ground he pulled her close and growled how about i gobble you up instead little red riding hood she giggled as he playfully rubbed his lips across hers what so funny ron question broke into ginny fantasy making her growl irritably nothing unseen her brother said i probably dontwant to know anyway from the front seat her father asked was draco contacted by the raven again yes ginny swallowed hard this morning in fact while he was flying flying ron yelped how d he get to go flying when all the brooms were locked up eh now ronnikins said george dontbe jealous fred said in a singsong voice i not jealous suspicion threaded the younger boy tone and how come you two are taking malfoy side the twins laughed we always take the side of new investors ginny could hear the glee in fred voice that why we re wearing dragon hide and you re not molly snapped enough she modulated her tone to ask ginny dear tell us about the raven giving the edited for family version she shared how the bird led draco into the forest transformed into a female death eater who stated that lucius had sent her and that he wanted his son to learn proper respect ron broke the silence that fell that raven will have to go through me to get to you sister she thanked him because the thought was sweet even though the idea of ron being her shadow for the summer made her want to start laughing hysterically there was no way in the wizarding world that she could stand such an overdose of brotherly love ginny broke into the discussion her parents were having on who would guard her at what times with mum dad draco has a plan to get me out of harm way while the order apprehends the raven well speak up dear we re waiting her mother tone was sharp with anxiety if i leave england in secret an auror or operative can use polyjuice to be me and lure the raven into a trap where would you go her father asked romania to visit charlie by yourself molly sounded dubious no the ministry is sending volunteers to the dragon research centre to help i d go with them ginny held her breath while her mum and dad deliberated on her left george whispered that a brilliant plan and i not just saying that because malfoy injected much needed capital into our flourishing enterprise on her right ron said yeah right galleon grubber to his sister he said that plan i dontsay it brilliant but it sounds good hesitating a moment he asked should should i go too although the twins repressed laughter when she immediately said no ron was obviously relieved oh okay but i would ve if you d wanted me to this time her thanks were heartfelt when they reached the burrow and clambered out of the car her dad said sweetheart go in and owl draco right away ask him to dinner i want to talk with him in more detail about this raven woman and his her father smiled in a way that reminded her of the twins brilliant plan ginny rushed up to her room and took out her mirror it was almost funny the way draco expression changed from relief to romantic to reserve within seconds he seemed to think being asked to dinner was ominous she teased cheer up they haventritually sacrificed a guest in months he laughed and the boyish amusement lighting his face caused her to murmur if you dontcome i might die from wanting to kiss you so badly his smile changed into the wolfish expression that made her heart slam against her chest awake or dreaming cheer up a girl hasntexpired from lack of my kisses in months chuckling over her pretended ire he smiled in a way that tugged her heart i want to kiss you badly too i ll floo to the workshop a little before eight so you can save me from expiring the thought of giving draco the kiss of life made her hum while practically skipping downstairs in the kitchen she happily informed the group sitting around the table he coming the twins exchanged looks her mum and dad did the same ron asked puzzled how could you know that when you haventsent an owl ginny mentally slapped a palm to her forehead how stupid of her not to go through the motions of sending an owl under the combined pressure of everyone silent expectancy she said draco and i have mirrors that we use to keep in touch several pairs and shades of red brows lifted but no one objected molly said that an awfully expensive present she added thoughtful as well a gleam of interest lit her eyes when she gazed at her daughter would you show me the mirror dear sure hours later waiting for draco to step out of the workshop fireplace ginny smiled at the memory of her mother girlish fascination with the melusine mirror and her confession that she d always wanted a pair but finances being the way they were sensibly put the notion out of her head next christmas ginny knew what to recommend her boyfriend get her parents she threw herself into his arms the instant he stepped onto the hearth the heat of his mouth was a delicious contrast to the cool fingers running through her hair and down her back no one had ever made her feel the way he did and she didntcare where she had to hide from marisol as long as draco went with her it took several moments before the sound of clearing throats broke through ginny mental and physical absorption dragging her mouth away she snapped what uh time to come inside dinner ready said george unless you d rather we go back and tell mum you prefer to make a meal of kisses draco pinned fred with a steely gaze do that and i tell the story of angelina panties george laughed i d love to see mum reaction fred clipped shut up forge the twins left the workshop with ginny and draco following molly declared that there would be no distressing talk over dinner bill scowled when his mother told him his report would have to wait draco was unfailingly polite during the meal his table manners drew her brothers attention bill said to ron he eats like a girl ginny was surprised to hear ron say no he eats like someone with manners and take it from me girls appreciate it her brother turned red when molly demanded what exactly do you mean by appreciate it arthur said remember our leaving feast sixth year i believe ronald means something like that love all eyes turned to molly she blushed to rival ron after dinner ginny sat beside draco on a sofa while bill told them about the order operation and how the raven as they called marisol had narrowly escaped capture at the station a half hour into the story she noticed an odd expression cross draco face he stood abruptly and excused himself when he came back ginny whispered only half jesting was it my yorkshire pudding he whispered back no my mirror warmed it was blaise his eyes were troubled but he shrugged i ll tell you about it later while they had been privately conversing bill had ended his speech arthur shared draco idea about ginny visiting charlie while a decoy lured the raven out of hiding her brother looked over would you be willing to help us with this malfoy no i wontbe here her brother repeated incredulously you wontbe here why not where the ruddy hell will you be ginny smiled encouragingly at draco while he answered in romania a n a chap with a cliffie every pov i think that a new record for me lol couldntbe helped so much to do so little time special note the song from james and the giant peach seemed to fit this chapter because love is the sweetest thing and it does exactly what it wants to do the quotes in order were taken from robert burns shakespeare from the tempest morgan llywelyn winthrop mackworth praid willow and the princess bride chapter 49 love is the sweetest thing blaise giggled at the astounded look on terry face carefully placing her bag on the floor she walked toward him with a wide smile like my new look he nodded wordlessly reaching out to touch dark waves of hair falling past her shoulders he stared with an intensity that made her catch her breath why did you grow it out she tried to reply lightly so no one will recognise me as blaise zabini he looked appraisingly at her face to someone who knows you it not that extreme a change but to strangers who have only seen you in a jeweller ad terry smoothed waving strands toward her face you ve gone from exotic and sexy to pretty and sexy when she narrowed her eyes terry grinned spicy to sweet blaise slid her palms up his chest hey i spicy and sweet yes you are he said after a kiss his expression became serious are you ready for this no second thoughts still unused to the way her hair slid into her face she said i burnt my bridges i dontwant to turn back i want to go on with you she noticed a piece of luggage on the floor by the sofa blaise returned the question what about you if if you have second thoughts i ll i ll understand and the firm manner in which terry took possession of her mouth was more reassuring than words he said david going to cover for me so no one tries to wake me and break the illusion spell making it seem as though i still in bed his gaze smouldered he going to tell mum and dad that we stayed up late and i sleeping in her cheeks grew hot that wontbe a lie you will be sleeping in terry fairer skin showed a tinge of a blush while his smile revealed how much he looked forward to that feeling absurdly shy blaise glanced away his hand cupped her cheek brought her gaze back to his but to see her was to love her love but her and love her forever he smiled i was reading my old poetry book earlier and that expressed how i feel about you after he followed the sweet words with a sweeter kiss she leaned against him resting her head on his shoulder he said in a smiling tone that was robert burns but i know a bit of shakespeare too his lips brushed her ear hear my soul speak the very instant that i saw you did my heart fly to your service tears clogged her throat and spilled down her cheeks terry used the pad of a thumb to wipe them away these are tears of joy i hope her arms tightened around him as she nodded he pressed her closer before saying are you ready to go yes he lifted her bag and then moved to pick up his own before following her into the fireplace at the inn she brushed floo powder off terry shoulders while he looked around at the chintz and lace filled gathering room no one will think to look for the sophisticated miss zabini here she said i had to stay somewhere close enough for you to fly over to be with me if your father using the office i like ottery st catchpole and the white witch bed and breakfast will be a fine place to spend the days before our trip mrs comfrey cooking is magical a warm voice said why thank you dear so nice to know word of my breakfasts gets round rosy cheeks creased in a smile as the grey haired woman bustled forward wiping her hands on a floral apron she looked at blaise inquiringly have you stayed with us before miss romero isntit going to the register on the table across from the front door she looked at the reservation and corrected mr and mrs romero adding the slightest hint of a spanish accent blaise said si we are the romeros a cousin of mine stayed here senora and recommended your lovely inn to us the older witch beamed yes i remember now you have the honeymoon suite shaking her head mrs comfrey remarked sympathetically newlyweds having to work on their honeymoon it not right but i do admire the way you re making the best of it dears come this way halfway up the staircase a tart voice blaise remembered well said they seem rather young for newlyweds with an apologetic glance mrs comfrey murmured my sister mrs snidely is aptly named raising her voice the plump woman looked down at the thin frowning witch and chided they re of legal age so keep your opinions to yourself when the stern woman spluttered her pleasanter sister said brusquely go on make yourself useful and bring up a welcome tray with another apologetic smile to the young couple mrs comfrey continued up the stairs and led them to the room that took up half the second floor terry gaze flickered over the bed placed in the centre of the room lingering on the white satin duvet before glancing at the white on white floral rug the white paint wallpaper and furniture he gave a warm slow smile that made blaise blush again mrs comfrey discretely pretended not to notice she showed them the bathroom with its enormous claw foot tub and took the tray of assorted fruits chocolate and sparkling cider from her sister when the scowling witch arrived at the door setting the tray on a small round table in front of the balcony she reminded them that a breakfast tray would be placed outside their door at nine the next morning you dontmind me registering us as romeros do you asked blaise once they were alone he said i wouldntcare if you registered us as malfoys trailing his fingertips across skin bared by the off the shoulder bodice of her gauzy white dress terry said in a tone that made her heart race you look beautiful he wore the midnight blue silk shirt that made his eyes like sapphires she sighed you look beautiful too in the mirror behind him she could see that her own eyes were dark with a mixture of excitement and apprehension disregarding the typical bridal jitters blaise walked over to her bag and used her wand to open the lock out of the magic carpetbag she took a white pillar candle in glass candleholder and pointed the sun rises on that side of the room so place the candle there please she removed a jar of seashells next and asked will you fill this with water and put it on the opposite side of the room while he fulfilled her request blaise lifted a marble bowl out of the bag and poured a pouch of lapis turquoise and amethyst stones into it before setting it down on the north side of the room while terry placed a brass candleholder with a red pillar candle over on the south edge of the bedroom afterwards they used white votive candles to make an almost complete circle around the symbols of air water earth and fire stepping into the open end of the circle blaise stood by the bed and held out her right hand to terry he took it and helped her wrap a white silken cord around their clasped hands after a moment of nervous silence he said the words they had chosen when they researched marriage rites for someday in the hogwarts library handfasting is a symbolic binding together of two people that have come to make of two lives one life gazing intently into her eyes he spoke the celtic wedding vow i terry pledge to you blaise that yours will be the name i cry aloud in the night and the eyes into which i smile in the morning i will cherish and honour you through this life and into the next huskily he added i pledge to be your husband from this day forward in a soft voice blaise repeated the vow and pledged to be his wife he took a celtic heart knot wedding ring from his pocket and slid it on her finger smiling tenderly wear this ring forever as a symbol of our unending love and intertwined lives eyes shining with emotion she took his matching ring and slid it onto terry finger saying the words and rejoicing in the knowledge that although they might have to remove the rings the symbolism would remain in their hearts and souls terry spoke the spell wizard praid of the wizengamot had established to make private vows legally binding now the rite is duly done now the word is spoken and the spell has made us one which may ne er be broken they both inhaled sharply when every candle in the room extinguished after a moment they relit terry smiled as he untied the cord and let it fall may i kiss my bride overcome by the realisation that from now on wherever they went they would go together whatever the days held dark or bright they would face united she lifted her face toward his their first kiss was one of sweetness the second burned bright and strong like the flames around them terry mouth moved over hers with increasing passion the touch of his lips and hands kindled a fire in her veins now she was free to give him all that she was and take all he had to give in return within the circle of candles and arms and love the image of two flames coming together to make one flame came to mind blaise found the vision and her wedding night beautiful sacred and filled with indescribable joy in romania draco had suspected that his answer to the question of where he would be instead of helping to entrap marisol would receive a mixed response but he hadntexpected bill weasley to punch him turning so the blow glanced off his cheek instead of blackening his eye he stood and prepared to fend off another attack he neednthave bothered fred and george jumped on their hothead eldest sibling and swiftly took him to the ground mr weasley watched the action with a small smile while his wife shrieked what has got into you bill you should be ashamed of yourself trying to buck off twin captors the man grunted me i not the one trying to run off with a sixteen year old girl ginny turned a shade of red that draco had never seen before he smirked when she gave her brother a kick to get his attention we arentgoing to live together you bloody fool he ll be working at the centre with me protecting me she reached down and pulled the ponytail hard do you understand now fred and george faces were contorting with the effort not to burst out laughing fred looked over and saw draco smirk he lost his composure rolling off his brother to hold his sides immediately the red faced prat dumped george off and rose glaring and muttering darkly identical hyenas had better sleep with one eye opened the twins stopped laughing but kept sniggering from time to time as they drolly practiced keeping an eye open pulling his hair out of its holder weasley refastened his ponytail tersely he said sorry malfoy if i jumped to the wrong conclusion draco nodded his acceptance of the cool apology the steely look that had accompanied the words told him that the man didntthink he had accused falsely if the wizard handshake had never been given weasley wouldnthave been wrong as it was living together as ginny so inspiringly put it was only a dream for the future mrs weasley clapped her hands to get everyone attention i need tea into the kitchen everyone amused by how the family instantly followed orders draco followed them into the kitchen and sat beside ginny beneath the table she slid her hand into his he thought no one noticed until george said how interesting our gin blossom drinking tea with her left hand i didntknow she was ambidextrous said fred with a suspiciously straight face mr weasley smiled pleasantly i not ambidextrous either he reached across and tapped ginny teacup with the one in his left hand cheers ron weasley scrunched face said that not right clearly as if he had groaned the words aloud the twins snorted in amusement bill weasley lips twisted but he remained silent mrs weasley looked surprised you re not i thought for sure you were being so talented with your hands and all the woman thoughtful voice trailed away as her husband lifted her hand and pressed a kiss to the back thank you my love he said noticing her family and guest stares mrs weasley said briskly yes well now that we ve had tea tell us more about your plans draco the volunteers meet at the end of the week to travel by port key to romania ginny can use a potion or illusion charm to disguise herself until we arrive safely he smiled wryly i sure her brother will think of many ways to keep us busy even bill smiled at that comment while the rest of the family told stories of their christmas visit draco caught ginny eye and winked there was no way charlie would keep them that busy she suppressed a smile and squeezed his fingers later after accompanying him to the workshop so they could say goodbye in private ginny draped her arms around his waist and teased so you plan on squeezing romance into our busy schedule do you no man comes between me and the girl i love her smile faded pressing her cheek against his chest she asked solemnly what about another woman draco was glad that she couldntsee his expression flatly he told her the raven better never find her way to romania in the forbidden forest i came very close to killing her ginny squeezed him in comfort he brushed his lips across her hair and promised grimly if marisol tries to hurt you it will be the last thing that witch ever does she pulled back and looked up into his face what she saw didntmake ginny turn away instead she stood on tiptoes and kissed him fiercely his mouth slanted over hers returning the kiss hungrily he needed the assurance that she loved him even the parts that were dark and ugly his fingers tangled in her hair lifting the strands and rubbing them alongside his cheek like silk when they arrived in romania he would lead his little red into the forest and snog her senseless every chance he got against her lips he smiled wolfishly she opened heavy lidded eyes are you going to lure me off the path and gobble me up my big bad wolf i would if i hadntgiven my word red when she pouted he chuckled i never said i wouldntnibble though when she laughed he spun her around growling playfully let start now sliding her hair over a shoulder he bent and lightly raked his teeth across the back of her neck following it with an opened mouthed kiss that made her sag against him and moan i love the way you nibble turning to face him she smiled in a way that made him say what pretty white teeth you have red she smiled in a feminine but decidedly wolfish manner the better to nibble you with he returned to the zabini london home several kisses and one supposedly accidental love bite to his neck later draco content smile vanished when he remembered his conversation with blaise in the mirror he burst into his room and snatched up the note left on his pillow sitting on the bed he opened it and quickly read the contents as she d said before his mate had left and didntplan on returning to her childhood home she briefly outlined the confrontation with her father and the steps she had taken to protect her independence draco was glad that wizarding law stated criminals lost the right to control their business interests he had been made acting head of malfoy enterprises and the first step he d taken was to separate his accounts from the company s grey eyes widened when he read where blaise had arranged for them to stay until the volunteers left for romania he was grinning when a hesitant voice inquired mr draco is wishing i pack and send along his things as i have for miss blaise one look at the house elf standing in the doorway showed the reason for minky addressing him by name instead of young master she wore a miniature mink stole with her fur edged tea towel he frowned why are you still here offering to help me why haventyou gone large green eyes twinkled minky is free so minky is choosing to serve miss blaise out of her own free will shall i be packing now thinking about how much more comfortable the wilds of romania would be with a house elf along draco said i would appreciate that very much minky thank you it wasntas hard as he d thought being polite to an elf perhaps all that practise being polite to weasleys had paid off in more ways than one he efficiently directed minky in packing for the upcoming trip taking advantage of her skills to transfigure several pairs of trainers into sturdy hiking boots incinerating blaise note to ash and slipping his mirror into his trouser pocket he thanked the elf before she took his trunk to the inn after minky left draco heard a knock on the door and went to open it his mother stood swaying in the hallway he said it late what are you doing up narcissa laughed drunkenly ha the real question is what have you been up to he slid an arm around her waist and began to lead his mother toward her room i ve been packing to go on holiday mother she snorted the vulgar contrast to her elegant fa ade made him smile his mother curled her lip i know what blaise told eddy ed woke me up all excited over the holiday that scheming girl paying for icy blue eyes warmed slightly i never liked blaise much but she grown on me like those jimmy choos i didntwant but eddy forced me to buy i actually wear those shoes now when he huffed in amusement she smirked it true inside her room narcissa weaved unsteadily over to the dresser and picked up one of his father pictures she watched lucius smile at the camera as though he were planning something truly evil tonelessly she said your father sent a note informing me that since my influence in your life is insufficient to keep you in line he taken steps to remedy that abruptly placing the photograph face down she reached out and touched draco face smiling briefly i wontgo against your father but if you resist his control i wontgo against you either impulsively he kissed her cheek thank you mother she blinked and waved him off go on have a happy little holiday while eddy and i do the same the look in her eyes belied the smile on her mouth conveying a seriousness that made his insides twist go he nodded and left her turning every photograph of his father face down before he flooed to the white witch bed and breakfast draco had one task left to complete back in his room he picked up the bottle that blaise had left along with the note his eyes scanned the directions a half hour later he looked into the mirror and laughed until his side began to hurt when he stepped out of the hearth in the twee establishment his mate had chosen to revisit mrs comfrey looked up from her knitting and smiled without recognition mrs romero said you would be arriving late and it was no trouble for me to wait up for you your trunk is already in your room pausing to retrieve a key from the register desk she asked anxiously it on the first floor instead of on the second beside your cousin mr suave but mrs romero said that you d prefer your privacy he agreed while signing his name rico suave in the register and trying to decide how to pay blaise back for her little joke the honeymoon suite has sound proofing spells so the other guests rest undisturbed said mrs comfrey she must have noticed his inadvertent glance toward the ceiling he smiled ruefully and bid the woman good night unable to wait another minute he took out the melusine mirror and said ginny her eyes were soft and sleepy until she noticed his hair they widened and then glazed over when he lifted the ends of hair that was now legolas length and waved them at her meaningfully her mouth dropped open while she bit a knuckle he said starting thinking about what you want rubbed first luna rolled onto her stomach pulling the pillow over her head to block the sun streaming into the room remembering another morning when her father came in singing rise and shine and tickling her toes she blinked back tears who knew when she would hear that off key bass again the days since she d come home had been awful the memory of that first evening when the bottom had dropped out of her world still made her stomach twist in knots she had watched her father sip firewhisky and waited for him to speak unexpectedly daddy chose to sit in the chair next to hers instead of his usual seat behind the desk he picked up the letter lorinda wrote to tell me of an encounter she had recently shopping in diagon alley she ran into molly weasley who thanked her for having the girls over easter holiday admitting that her nickname of loopy is well founded lorinda said that she just smiled and went on her way thinking that perhaps she had forgot her niece visiting he tossed the envelope back onto the desk after she made no move to take it your aunt consulted her calendar once she got home and was perturbed to discover that she had cancelled her trip to spain due to a friend illness she owled me right away luna thought that explained a lot looking at her mum and dad wedding picture on the desk she asked in a small voice are you very angry he didntanswer until she gathered the nerve to meet his eyes i was now i very very disappointed that you felt it necessary to lie in a tone that most likely made new reporters fear sacking he demanded where did you go and who did you go with she explained about blaise family beach house how the girls all slept in one room the boys in another and nothing dodgy had gone on her father listened silently as she told about windsurfing horseback riding ballooning and making dinner she left out dancing in clubs and long siestas in hammocks afterwards he said so it only luck that the intruder article wasnt hogwarts girls gone wild i suppose i should be grateful but i finding it hard to feel anything other than disillusioned rising to his feet her father said tiredly we ll talk more another time go up to bed now luna rose to her feet in the doorway she stopped when he said did you consider for one moment that i might have understood remembering the wistful question and her sad reply of no luna threw off her pillow and rolled over to contemplate the stars on her ceiling at night they glowed softly in constellations across the room now the glow was absent she felt that way like a star that didntshine her father left for the quibbler every morning before she awoke and returned after she d gone to her room for the night if she hadntbeen able to talk to wesley luna would have been devastated by the estrangement from her father as it was it still hurt more than she let anyone even wesley know rolling out of bed the girl contemplated her reflection in the mirror merlin her hair was a rat nest when had she last washed it her nose wrinkled when had she last taken a shower or changed out of her nightclothes disgusted by her depression she marched into the bathroom luna was combing the last knot out of her hair when she entered the kitchen her father stood at the stove stirring a pot of porridge his pale blue gaze showed relief that she was up and clean she sat at the table he brought her a bowl after crumbling brown sugar on top taking a seat beside her he offered a platter of bacon her lips curved it was nice and crispy just the way she liked it she took a bite you re not going in to work today i ll go in for a few hours this afternoon after taking another bite of porridge larry announced we re flooing to london to meet ivanna and the girls for lunch she stared into the slightly protuberant eyes she had inherited so you stayed home this morning to make sure your loony daughter wouldntembarrass you her father merely smiled do you think a man called lunatic larry minds his daughter being loony he said i ve been avoiding you and i sorry i didntknow how to get past what you d done luna asked and now you have how by remembering that i was young once too and thought i knew better than my parents and made similar mistakes he gazed at her steadily i learnt from my mistakes and didntmake them again can you do likewise she nodded yes i sorry i disappointed you when he hugged her she whispered in a choked voice i love you daddy his voice was unusually gruff when he said i love you too sweetheart clearing his throat her father straightened and reached for the paper shrewd eyes flickered over the front page and darkened as he bellowed an error the front page of the quibbler has an error look at this the paper was thrust beneath luna nose she noted the misspelling and made a sound of commiseration although personally she found the headline rat toni cure all or conspiracy to kill rather amusing she said i sure readers know that you meant tonic not a person named toni as her father continued to rant and threaten luna smiled all was right in her world a few hours later she almost changed her mind flooing to a london station and walking the short distance to the restaurant luna chatted with her father enjoying his company once they reached the restaurant that her father claimed had good homey atmosphere with no pretensions she finally met ivanna greengrass she was not happy to meet her the woman was nothing like the wicked stepmother of her imaginings instead she was petite attractive with stylishly short blonde hair the image of a successful businesswoman mary kate and ashley gushed hello luna their mother ushered the twins past the bar on the ground floor to the restaurant above the girls told luna that they had wanted to go to the weird sisters caf ivanna said that place is too loud and we d have to wait forever for a table this is elegant but relaxed and we ll be able to hear each other talk she smiled at larry the superb wine list is what interests me the most i need a glass desperately i had a reporter go mental he ran down the street naked telling people he was merlin it took all morning to get him checked into st mungo s once the server had taken their order luna father made an effort to carry the conversation by asking the girls how they planned to spend their summer holiday mary kate wanted to dye her hair brown ashley cried how could you even think about looking different than me is it because i used the last whitening mint this morning we can get more and i sure no one noticed that your teeth arentquite as bright their mother briskly interrupted mary kate recital of the mental anguish she had suffered to ask luna what her plans were i d like to volunteer at st mungo s ivanna smiled warmly that a wonderful idea dontyou think so larry he frowned i remember roberts telling me his son was volunteering at the hospital are you wanting to help sweetheart or wanting to see wesley both she gazed serenely at her father he shrugged fine with me all of a sudden the day seemed brighter mary kate and ashley argument over which cosmetics line was better seemed amusing instead of annoying and her father having a friend wasntsuch a calamity for the rest of lunch conversation was casual and unforced and everyone agreed that the bananas tart tatin was scrumptious after the bill was settled and luna bid a smiling farewell to the greengrass trio she asked her father may i go by the hospital now he nodded come by the office and say hello before you floo home she kissed his cheek i will luna soon approached the entrance to st mungo hidden behind the fa ade of purge dowse ltd other shoppers never even glanced at the redbrick department store permanently closed for refurbishment she walked up to a mannequin in a minidress of purple paisley luna lovegood to volunteer and i love your dress she said the painted lips turned up while the beehive bewigged head bent in invitation for the visitor to step forward the welcomwitch grumpily directing visitors barely spared her a glance volunteer office is on the fifth floor between the hospital shop and the visitor tearoom in the lift luna watched with interest as a boy with scrofungulus exited on the second floor a witch who giggled uncontrollably departed on the third and a wizard who kept saying what my age again was led off by a friend when the lift opened onto the fourth level following a couple of elderly witches down the fifth floor corridor luna noticed a handwritten sign of volunteers affixed to a door about halfway down she turned the handle and went inside a mediwitch looked up from a desk she said i madam ratchet wishing to volunteer are you before the luna knew it she was filling out forms answering questions about the sorts of things that frightened or nauseated her and told that she could start that very day if she liked luna said do you suppose i could assist another volunteer wesley roberts the mediwitch looked at her more closely if i had a galleon for every time i ve been asked that over the last few days she smiled however since wesley showed me your picture i ll send you to him instead of to the third floor to assist with regurgitation patients like i did the last girl according to madam ratchet wesley was pushing a trolley of books around the spell damage ward the patients had taken quite a liking to him luna took the stairs down to the fourth floor behind a curtained off section she heard him say so you re not interested in mysteries thrillers or historical novels how about romance a spate of giggles sounded causing luna hands to clench into fists her nails dug into her palms when the unseen witch said in a high breathy voice i d love some romance in my life wesley said then the princess bride is just what you re looking for enraged luna yanked open the curtain saying fiercely wesley roberts dontyou dare give that book to any girl but me her mouth fell open when she saw the old woman on the bed the witch giggled and pinched the boy cheek i told you that i was a young and beautiful woman smiling sweetly at the gaping girl the old woman said kindly the sorceress fin rizelle does not enchant men whose hearts belong to others take him and the book with my blessing patting wesley hand she said i think i ll have that pirate romance inconceivable love she winked i love pirates me too said luna she backed out of the space wishing the floor would open up and swallow her she must have embarrassed wesley horribly his lips were pressed tightly together meekly she followed him into what looked to be a linen cupboard once inside wesley laughed until she poked him in the ribs it wasnt that funny blue eyes were bright with amusement yes it was pulling her against him wesley bent and kissed her forehead it was funny he kissed the tip of her nose it was also flattering next both of her cheeks received kisses and inspiring she repeated hopefully inspiring he kissed her lips his mouth showing her the exact nature of the inspiration she sank her fingers into his golden hair using her hold to deepen the kiss his fingers tightened on her hips when she used her lips and tongue to show how he had inspired her wesley kissed his way over to her ear to whisper you must be a sorceress bella luna because you ve enchanted me there was only one thing she could say oh my sweet wesley the day before the volunteers were scheduled to leave for romania ginny slipped downstairs and flooed to the white witch bed and breakfast as she had every other morning since draco had begun staying there she breathed in the delicious aroma of mrs comfrey famous breakfast and sighed she was going to miss the kindly woman cooking she walked quickly toward the stairs giggling there was something else she d miss even more early morning snogs with draco halfway to the second floor she looked up to see a couple descending terry was fully dressed while blaise wore a robe that gaped enough to show she wasn t kissing while walking down the steps didntlook very safe but it did look fun ginny decided she should try anchoring her fingers in draco hair and leaning against him while he slowly navigated sideways down the stairs when blaise unlocked terry lips she saw her friend and smiled good morning pulling her partner by the hand blaise said enthusiastically tomorrow the big day i cantwait to go can you she gave her new husband a sultry look just think no more sneaking around to sleep with your wife at least for the rest of the summer blaise winked at ginny before continuing downstairs to kiss terry goodbye at the fireplace he flooed or flew to be with his wife each night and left early every morning if he could manage it the he visited in the afternoons two days ago the three friends had been playing exploding snap in the gathering room when terry bounded out of the fireplace explained i only have an hour and slung blaise over his shoulder before heading upstairs draco had pouted enviously until ginny said she d thought of another part she wanted him to rub with his hair after gathering the cards with flattering speed he had then chased her up the stairs with a wolfish smile remembering how silky his hair had felt sweeping down her leg she smiled dreamily blaise patted her arm hey mate are you all right you re pulling a luna i wonderful wonderful then you can come up and have a chat before awakening sleeping beauty on the way upstairs ginny thought about draco lying on the bed long white blond hair framing a face so masculine and beautiful that sometimes she encouraged him to talk quidditch strategy just so she could have a reason to stare she followed blaise into the suite surprised to see how tidy everything was from the girl state of dress she d expected a rumpled bed and clothing strewn from one end to the other you is wishing me to bring breakfast now minky nodded to the visitor and added strawberry crepes is what you is wishing yes miss ginny yes i mean no i ll eat later blaise countered bring two trays if you d be so kind minky she ll take hers down to draco in a few minutes the house elf bowed and was gone before ginny could countermand the request dontsay no i aware you two have breakfast blaise smirked on bed every morning i dontwant to give minky extra work she enjoys it truly picking up a brush she drew it down the length of dark hair and changed the subject long hair is fun but merlin it takes forever to wash and gods the constant brushing how do you stand it ginny glanced in the mirror at her own hair i used to it i guess well terry better enjoy it while he can because i want my curls back before i step on the hogwarts express with a speculative expression blaise asked have you brushed draco hair yet for some odd reason ginny blushed erm no he had been too busy brushing his hair across her she asked why have you brushed his hair only in the normal way because it so bloody gorgeous not in the you know sensual way what the sensual way by the time ginny carried the tray downstairs to draco she couldntwait to get her hands on his hair he opened the door after her knock smiling sleepily his robe wasntbelted giving her a scenic view of his chest not wanting to lose the stirring sight she covertly pulled off the belt while he used his wand to make the bed dropping the length of silk she kicked it under the bed while he placed the tray on the duvet she lifted a warming cover strawberry crepes when he lounged on the bed and reached for a plate she sighed contentedly and picked up a fork after he placed the tray outside the door later draco stretched like a satiated cat i should probably get dressed when she shook her head and patted the bed in front of her he smiled want a morning snog grey eyes grew smoky when she said yes but first i want to brush your hair her heart skipped a beat and then raced when he shrugged out of the robe and sat with his back to her on the end of the bed he said if you ever want to see me without clothing red you only have to ask he chuckled where did you hide my belt had her throat always been this dry swallowing hard ginny croaked under the bed she took his brush and carefully drew it down the platinum length of hair he said it wontfall out from brushing you donthave to go easy on me she laughed mostly at herself that good to know grooming her own hair had never been a thrill but stars and stones brushing draco hair gave her pure pleasure his head tilted to the side in complete relaxation ginny gathered her nerve and set aside the brush using her fingers she sifted through the strands massaged his scalp and enjoyed the silky texture in a way that was incredibly sensual she glanced up at the ceiling sending a mental thank you upstairs leaning forward she lifted the silken mass and rubbed it against her cheek impulsively her fingers tightened in his hair tugging him back until his head rested in her lap ginny bent and kissed him upside down felt different but oh so good she smiled against his mouth your lips are perfect from all angles he rolled away stood and pulled her off the bed and into his arms her hands roamed every inch of bare skin she could reach his hands slid down to her backside and pulled her flush against him breaking off the kiss draco stepped away and muttered cold shower yeah we ll take a shower and then go do something somewhere out to see the cool and collected draco malfoy hot and bothered was a very fine sight indeed ginny said we may both need a cold shower but i think i d better run up and use blaise s at his look of confusion she giggled you said we ll take a shower his lips twisted wishful thinking smiling in a way that hurt her cheeks she said if i ever find a magic lamp watch out his brow creased she laughed it another one of those muggle stories i ll tell you about it later after a cold shower her walk toward the door halted when he asked will you brush my hair again sometime every day his smile of male satisfaction kept her grinning all the way to blaise room the next day ginny awoke early to share a family breakfast she and bill would soon floo to the station closest to the quidditch pitch where the volunteers were meeting the group would be going on to romania by port key in the kitchen her mother was sniffing and wiping her eyes with an apron ginny hugged her dontworry mum i ll be just fine trying to cheer she added i can use the flames in charlie fire to talk to you after we settle in and he can send my letters with his when he owls her mother gave a watery laugh if you get charlie to write home more often that alone will be worth the trip her father rose from the table to pat his wife shoulder in reassurance that the attitude love our ginny will be home before you know it safe and sound safe and sound that the most important thing to keep our little girl out of harm way until that awful woman is apprehended eyes misting again molly sniffled and moved toward the stove fred stepped into her path go have a cup of tea mum breakfast is men work george sniggered or so angelina tells him after their mother turned away to have a seat at the table fred used a tea towel to pop his brother george yelped fred nodded sharply that for being a prat and you ll get another if you dontadmit that you cook for alicia brother mine eyeing the damp cloth capable of snapping with painful precision george said takes a prat to know a prat he made a face fine i cook for alicia but not every ruddy meal like you chef fred raising the hand that received a stinging snap he yelped cut it out you prat fred grinned takes a prat to know a prat ow he shook his stung fingers you grabbed a towel you sneak good one suddenly the twins were laughing like loons ginny kissed both their cheeks and then kissed them again once she saw the stuffed french toast turning golden brown on the magically heated burners of the aga over at the counter where bacon cooked the old fashioned way with a crisping charm ron said how come they get all the attention ginny marched over to ruffle hair and kiss his cheek smiling ron said remind charlie that he promised me that i d be the first to hold a dragon egg and dontgo begging okay she said dontworry i dontever want to get that close to a broody dragoness over breakfast bill filled everyone in on the steps that were being taken to apprehend the raven ginny saw with relief that her parents and siblings seemed to be comforted by the knowledge even so it was a tearful parting with her brothers gruffly telling her to keep safe mum and dad each hugged her tightly whispering their love along with assurances that she would be home soon an illusion charm made ginny look like a petite brunette with hazel eyes and no freckles she had used polyjuice before so looking like someone else didntbother her a bit that confounded bill and made her smile reaching the pitch where the volunteers gathered she saw that she and blaise were the only females going she had hoped a few others would brave the wilds of romania so she could hook charlie up amused at how matchmaking seemed to be contagious she glanced at bill he gave a low whistle i never saw a girl who looked like that volunteering before merlin maybe i should go along for a few days to give charlie pointers in the romance department hearing her laugh he frowned what so funny his gaze was drawn back to blaise who was currently entwining around terry in a manner salazar himself would be proud of bill shrugged i guess its sorry charlie then he hugged her go on have fun stay out of the woods and i ll do my damnedest to bring that death eater to justice her smile was wobbly pluck her feathers for me he nodded i ll wring that raven bloody neck if i have to kissing his cheek she held out an envelope in a few days give this to mum okay in response to his questioning look ginny smiled wryly i have something i need to tell mum and dad about easter holiday and i figure by letter and with me out of the country is the best if cowardly way to do it when he opened his mouth she shook her head dontworry i sure they ll tell you all about it she waved goodbye and moved to join the group terry and blaise looked up and smiled in greeting draco raised a brow over her appearance i would kiss you but my girlfriend the possessive type and i afraid she considers these lips private property ginny slid her fingers into his hair using her grip to pull his head down she whispered those lips are mine mine mine and dontyou forget it as for kissing me close your eyes he shut his eyes smiling as her mouth moved against his a n next week the final chapter st mungo to romania what a long and winding road the last chap takes i have to confess it the longest one i ve ever written had to go out in a blaze of glory d chapter 5 protesting too much and testing potions luna idly fingered her silver radish earrings watching blaise saunter down the stairs following the interrupted tango malfoy descended the steps soon after both students stood impassively while madam pince shrilled to professor snape that they should be punished severely their icy facades cracked slightly at the mention of losing hogsmeade weekend privileges the head of slytherin house curled his lip at the indignant librarian and informed her although inappropriate my students were hardly indecent three nights detention ought to impress upon them the advisability of dancing someplace more suitable than the library madam pince didntapprove of such a light punishment but was silenced by one lift of snape brow a jerk of his head had the guilty pair rushing to follow their professor away from pince ineffectual sputtering passing by luna blaise gave a quick wink do you know her luna turned to the boy who had moved to stand beside her blaise is in my muggle studies class why she winked at you i wouldntcall it a wink more like a nervous tic really poor girl going to be the talk of the school again luna said calmly gauging his reaction harry james potter was the most intriguing boy she felt the strangest pang every time she looked into his eyes ever since that first meeting on the hogwarts express she and harry had unusual things in common the ability to see thestrals and losing their mothers after last year events and their conversation about the veil in the department of mysteries the pangs luna felt had increased she didnteven have to look in his eyes anymore to feel one it was very interesting she smiled slightly i dunno it looked like a wink to me harry disagreed with a frown lips twitching luna tried to keep her tone artless have you had so many girls wink at you is that why you know it was a wink instead of a tic emerald green eyes widened while pale skin flushed no no of course not i didntmean not even cho so you really think it was a tic harry flustered speech caused one of those pangs to flare up inside luna absently rubbing the aching place on her chest she said matter of factly yes the involuntary muscular kind not the parasitical variety a brief burst of laughter met her dry wit luna speculated that a fellow ravenclaw girl had been sorted into the wrong house only an idiot would give harry potter up abruptly she became aware that he d asked her something she hadntheard too busy watching his lips move she supposed harry smiled and asked again luna have you seen ginny she and hermione were supposed to do some girl thing together and she hasntshown up yet this was the last place she was seen i think she left awhile ago maybe ginny had to help a professor or you could always check your common room again luna misdirected with a last wistful glance at the lips quirking at her yeah i ll do that thanks luna his smile became perplexed when she replied no harry thank you ginny waited until just before closing time to escape the second floor of the library she was surprised to see a girl sitting at a table watching her descent you ve missed dinner want to go to the kitchens and get something to eat asked luna when ginny reached her table how did you know i was up there and why did you wait for me to come down madam pince bustled over please continue this conversation outside the library ladies she shooed the girls out with a softly muttered i need a drink i wonder how many hogwarts staff use student misbehaviour for an excuse to imbibe alcohol mused luna watching the librarian walking away ginny said incredulously who cares i want you to answer me how did you know i was up there her ferocious expression was wasted on the impervious blonde blithely luna said over her shoulder while she headed toward the kitchen i couldntsay another word until i ve had something to eat i famished bitterly counting loads more than one bloody word ginny trailed after the girl who had started humming weasley is our king inside the massive kitchen the house elf dobby rose from his chair beside a fireplace and rushed past long worktables where a few elves were still at work magically cleaning the night dishes ginny friend to harry potter has come to dobby kitchen how is dobby to be serving miss and her friend miss noticed the other elves giving dobby nasty looks over the dobby kitchen remark and tried to smooth over the elf unfortunate choice of words i dontwant to disturb anyone important work but we missed dinner and hoped that you wouldntmind fetching us a bite to eat cleaning is not important as dinner for friends dobby is conjuring you dinner in no time ginny sighed oh well if she heard dobby had been tied up and locked in a cupboard by the other elves at least she d tried once he materialised the promised dinners the girls sat down to eat after a sizable dent had been made into the food piled high on their plates ginny demanded so blue eyes widened innocently and then looked down ginny steely look told the other girl she wasntbuying her act contemplating shiny silverware luna admitted blaise and draco came by my table before their dance and asked me if i d seen you i knew it grimly satisfied ginny said i knew when he looked at me that malfoy was trying to drive me spare with jealousy ha like i care who he dances with or touches or rubs up against or breathes into their ear she laughed harshly crazed with jealousy my arse do i look insane to you incredibly protuberant eyes gave the answer glaring defiantly ginny snapped well you can just tell zabini to inform that snake malfoy their little plan didntwork jumping up and striding angrily toward the kitchen door she paused in the doorway to wave her arms in emphasis it did not work weirdly luna smiled the lady doth protest too much methinks dobby is methinking so too the house elf agreed ginny slammed the door in an immature but gratifying way to end the ridiculous conversation sullenly draco followed professor snape to the dungeons wondering whether he and blaise would get the rack or the thumbscrews or worse yet filch the professor stopped at the entrance of the classroom and raised a satiric brow uneasily the boy waited to hear what snape would say he hoped it wouldntbe a confirmation of those wandless legilimency rumours going round the school with a derisive curling of his lips the potions master said if you could be trusted to remain in a room together i would have you both scrubbing cauldrons performing inventory and changing the fluid in my specimen jars however you two seem incapable of keeping your hands to yourselves lips curving higher in malicious delight over the wide eyed apprehension on his students faces he pronounced therefore mr malfoy you have the honour of assisting me starting tonight miss zabini you will go along to dungeon five and assist professor lorelei draco shook his head envying blaise why couldnthe get to help the new professor instead of hanging round snape dank classroom getting nauseous from revolting specimens they hadnteven had dinner after detention he probably wouldntbe able to stomach food realising that his head of house was letting them off easily malfoy nodded his head respectfully he told blaise see you blaise said her farewell and waited for snape to turn his back before blowing the professor an impertinent kiss the professor turned around unexpectedly caught the girl face turned beet red she bolted for dungeon five sharing a similar male smirk the slytherins entered the cold classroom a plate of sandwiches and a goblet of pumpkin juice sat waiting on a table inside draco gave the older man a puzzled look crossly the professor ordered eat you ll do the cauldrons tonight and deal with specimens the next two detentions i do advise however that you not eat anything that you wouldntwant to see again tomorrow night draco ate hungrily as he watched snape leave the dungeon to attend to matters in his office obviously the professor thought it quite amusing to imagine his student losing the contents of his stomach taking another sandwich the boy ate it in a quick but well mannered fashion he wasntan uncouth weasley for merlin sake malfoy were a proper wizarding family who placed due importance on appearance and etiquette unlike the weasels who bred like weasels and barely subsisted in what his father said was aptly called the burrow draco told himself he was glad to be a malfoy and an only child if he d had a brother or sister they would probably hate each other having competed since birth for their father capricious attention a death eater of a father who taught his son jinxes and curses instead of how to ride a broomstick shrugging off morose thoughts the boy decided contrarily to think about even more disturbing things like ginny that dance what had he been thinking and how the bloody hell he was going to deal with the consequences now and he didntmean detention to be honest he d had a great time dancing with blaise everything had gone as planned until pince had come and he d seen ginny face her face her soft dreamy eyes and softer parted lips her swaying body and fiery hair draco knew when a girl liked what she saw and wanted him to make a move on her he just didntknow what he wanted anymore was he only yanking red chain waiting for ginny to throw herself at him so he could laugh in her face or did he want to catch her kiss her he tossed aside the now tasteless food in disgust running fingers through his hair in frustration cleaning out the cauldrons by hand draco was ironically grateful for the menial task the drudgery was an excellent thought inhibitor blaise knocked hesitantly on the door of dungeon five knowing she had gotten the better of draco on the detention detail just the thought of specimen jars gave her the shudders she didnteven want to imagine what they smelt like professor lorelei voice called for her to enter funny both the potions master and the new assistant had dark silky voices entering the classroom and catching sight of the professor at her desk blaise was glad for the woman sake the teachers looked nothing alike both professors had black hair and eyes but hers were much more attractive she would have thought snape would be grateful to have someone else take on the chore of teaching the bothersome first through third years but blaise had heard rumours he had tried to get lorelei sacked the girl looked around the changed dungeon classroom with its enchanted rectangular windows high in the walls and lack of specimens floating around maybe snape was jealous like some of the students said thinking of draco and ginny she wondered if it might not be something else altogether terry came out of the professor storeroom with several flagons in his arms here the last of the potions placing the filled containers on a table he smiled at blaise open mouth stare i ve got detention for hexing parkinson having soap come bubbling out her mouth should stop her spreading nasty rumours about you for a while what are you in for i erm caused a disturbance in the library really in the library how did you manage that blaise looked to professor lorelei for help that something you can find out tonight mr boot testing the potions with ms zabini the professor explained it a new addition to the third year curriculum verisimilitude potion a bit like veritaserum but it only takes a few days not a whole moon cycle to brew the only drawback is that the solution only works one question per spoonful she laughed a little ah well that all most mums need isntit smiling at their confused expressions the woman confided my aunt nerys over at siren pharmaceuticals developed the potion for commercial use it just hit the market and already apothecaries cantkeep it in stock flagons fly off the shelves literally shifting back into professorial mode the unusual teacher said briskly now the potion is best taken on an empty stomach so test and record your findings and then i ll conjure something to eat i have some first year history of magic essays to look over yes i assist binns too so i ll be in my office if you need me with a smile the woman sailed out of the classroom leaving the students alone and staring at each other picking up a quill and parchment blaise asked brightly so which one do you want to test first warm agile fingers plucked the items from her hands levelly terry insisted you pick one blaise m kay let see she plucked the first flagon up and read pickles dillon who d name their kid dill pickles muggles take a spoonful and we ll see if the potion done properly unnerved blaise steadied her hands and gamely drank a sample the tingly sensation in her stomach meant the potion was effective nodding her head she waited apprehensively for terry to ask a question did you get detention for doing something with malfoy yes they were both surprised at the immediate answer terry marked the parchment picked up another potion and read saunders jennifer he gave another spoonful to the girl now biting her bottom lip what did you do with malfoy dance sombrely he duly noted the result and chose another flagon labelled lumley joanna and indicated that the squirming girl should drink a sample what kind of dance tango blaise closed her eyes at the raw look on terry face was that considered dodgier flirting a scratch of quill against parchment was the only sound heard in the room she looked at the carefully controlled face of the boy holding out the felton tom potion sample i know him he really nice for a slytherin blaise said too cheerfully before downing the tingle inspiring fluid was dancing part of your matchmaking scheme yes a nod accompanied a notation before terry pressed the french dawn flagon into his partner reluctant hands this time there was no tingle did you kiss him no the potion didntwork but visibly upset she asked him stormily do you think i ran straight from kissing you to compare it to draco or something marking the negative reaction swiping a bottle and taking a swig straight from the source terry replied no i just jealous as bloody hell looking down at the potion he said laurie hugh didntwork either and scratched the finding onto the parchment try coltrane robert s blaise commanded handing over a potion the look on his face told that it was effective so she asked why are you jealous because i love you terry looked as stunned as she felt she d expected him to say something about not wanting anyone else to dance with her or touch her but love what was she supposed to say to that he moved around the table to pull her up against him they fit together perfectly moving into his kiss was the most thrilling pas de deux the girl had ever done sliding eager fingers through terry silky long hair blaise found everything she d ever wanted in his embrace passionately kissing until she felt boneless and he felt deliciously hard the couple finally drew apart flushed they prudently moved to opposite sides of the table offering a flagon of bucket hyacinth s solution blaise smile was wobbly i think we d best stick to questions like favourite colours for the rest of this lot terry swallowed the potion and took up the quill again he smiled into her eyes and said deep dark chocolate brown a n had way too much fun with the names but hey it a perk and hasnteveryone known someone with the same name as a famous person i ve known two girls named jennifer lopez poor things one even dated a guy named ben d professor lorelei is an ofc from another fic where snape gets a romance because i heart slytherin guys lol i also heart readers who review and make me whistle while i work special note i ve had so much fun writing this fic that it definitely sweet sorrow to post the final chapter even so if readers have enjoyed the journey our characters have taken to reach their happy endings then i a happy writer the quotes within this chap are from patricia c wrede if you haventread her enchanted forest chronicles you should the quotes at the beginning and end of the chapter are from a midsummer night dream the chapter title is from an old raymond chandler mystery with the kind of visual prose and intense characters that i ve always loved but i always thought needed more romance d it seemed to fit chapter 50 the long goodbye so shall all the couples three ever true in loving be the visitor tearoom was not warm and inviting but the six young people sitting around a corner table at the far end didntcare about the lack of atmosphere they were focused on something much more important solving a mystery sitting next to wesley wearing the lime green shirt that distinguished volunteers luna took a sip of her tea she listened serenely as the members of their little scooby gang discussed strategy bindy and i will visit my parents and keep a sharp eye on the ward said neville colin nodded mindy and i can stake out the ground floor patrol the front and back exits beside the slim boy his girlfriend asked who exactly are we on the lookout for again neville looked at mindy and shrugged his brown eyes were dark with frustration i wish i could tell you more than average height weight looks but the bastard was so bloody damned ordinary of course bindy grabbed neville arm excitedly how many people really and truly have no distinguishing features a mole a big nose something this wizard blends in so well that even though we both saw him we cantdecide if his hair was light brown or sandy or what colour his eyes were so that what we should look for yes neville said thoughtfully look for someone our eyes slide right past who you wouldnt notice usually wesley said luna and i will be roaming all the floors helping wherever they ask us to should we be on the lookout for someone pretending to be a healer the other boy nodded solemnly yeah over easter holiday he walked right past us using that disguise luna waited for a lull in the conversation to say i looked up droobles best blowing gum in the quibbler archives daddy ran an article on droobles last year her lips curved it seems that wonka sued and won a hefty sum they proved that the rival company used information obtained illegally to create the bluebell coloured bubble formula everyone but wesley was looking at her with what does that have to do with anything expressions she said one of the largest shareholders in droobles is malfoy enterprises isntthat interesting very interesting bella luna wesley hand squeezed hers she beamed colin smirked death eaters going round blowing bubbles that dontpop for days interesting maybe helpful i dontsee how mindy smacked the top of her boyfriend head presumably to help his thought processes function better it a distinguishing feature you gorgeous dummy oh colin replied sheepishly rubbing his head looking into his girl eyes he smiled so you think i gorgeous amused by creevey vanity and how mindy fed it by kissing him soundly in answer luna turned to her boyfriend he not half as gorgeous as you are adorable dimples flashed turning her hand over blue eyes twinkled while wesley traced a line on her palm see this line she nodded he winked it tells me that your day will lead his fingertip continued down to her wrist to a linen cupboard on the fourth floor luna widened her eyes all alone he traced a delicate vein that led to another one rubbing the soft underside of her wrist never alone a discreet cough brought their attention back to neville who looked a bit uncomfortable with all the public displays of affection the boy asked how will we keep in touch with each other wesley placed a bag onto the table after a quick look around to make sure no one was watching he said i d wondered about that myself opening the sack and handing each of the gang a small black rectangular object with curious buttons he grinned these are muggle two way radios the security office at my mum work has loads of these i asked if there were any old ones they were planning on getting rid of they gave me a half dozen after a small monetary show of appreciation colin laughed you bribed muggles and then enchanted these to work in a wizard building isntthere an inconvenient little law against that wesley said yes if you intend to use them which i interpret to mean on a regular basis which we don t neville held up his radio if we get caught i ll help pay the fine me too bindy nodded mindy prodded colin after saying i will as well it was a brilliant idea crying out in exaggerated pain creevey said plaintively why am i always abused after receiving no sympathy he chuckled i never said i didntlike the notion he gazed down at his radio what the range well these are old so only ten floors but we dontneed more than six and there ll be no interference on our frequency wesley replied neville looked amazed we can talk through walls and floors receiving a nod he smiled ace luna took the tiny wireless earpiece that would enable them to hide the radio in their pockets while keeping in contact and placed it in her ear feeling like a hit wizard or something equally thrilling after they had set their radios and agreed to meet back at the tearoom for lunch if no progress had been made the group split up a mediwitch headed to the lift noticed luna and wesley she said i could use some help in my ward they followed her down to the third floor patients recovering from potion and plant poisoning called out for water for a book for someone to help adjust the bed or assist them in some other way feeling much less the dashing operative luna waved to wesley and went into a private room to help a woman moaning for assistance once inside she gasped professor trelawney the teacher squinted without her glasses who is it come closer when she recognised the girl face the woman gave a weak smile why my stars its miss lovegood you you re a volunteer yes ma am luna hurried to fetch the older witch a pitcher of water and inquired for her as to when the healer would make his rounds after she conveyed that the wizard would be there shortly the girl asked forgive me for prying but what brings you to st mungo s that what i want to know sybil the wizard striding into the room looked undecided whether to be worried or put out smoothing his mustache with curving steel james hook demanded why didntyou tell me before i left that you were coming here i would ve escorted you instead i was informed by that surly welcomewitch downstairs that you d checked in the woman bit her lip i left you a note james he laughed shortly a note saying you didntwant to trouble me i expect when she nodded he sat on the bed and took her hand i would ve been far more troubled to come home to an empty flat and that ridiculous note m dear luna gazed curiously at hook tied back hair and black robes she asked what are you doing at st mungo s professor hook and how would the welcomewitch know to tell you that professor trelawney was here a dark brow lifted none of your business miss lovegood now go find some other patient to bother before the girl could react to that statement a healer stepped into the room lime green robes swirled as the wizard held up a chart hello james back with another auror trainee those students of yours keep us busy by merlin he shifted to smile genially at the woman waiting anxiously good news professor trelawney you were not poisoned by one of the exotic houseplants professor sprout gave you you are merely experiencing a malady common to expectant women he rattled on about finding a midwitch prescribed a potion for nausea and said that a mediwitch would come by with discharge papers soon before he left to see another patient luna stood riveted as the couple stared at each other trelawney said faintly students do you teach at the auror academy too james hook nodded curse and spell breaking full time before stuart he said i just filling in while another instructor on holiday it was his turn to ask hesitantly are we really having a child she nodded he smiled then you ll have to make an honest man out of me oh james backing away from the embracing pair luna halted when professor hook called not one word of this to your little friends miss lovegood savvy how piratical he sounded with a bright smile she said aye aye captain luna saluted before leaving the professor to explain to his expectant fianc e about a pirate named captain hook she met wesley in the corridor any sight of you know who golden brows rose in alarm voldemort he whispered in an undertone luna giggled no the death eater or whatever he is i refuse to call him gum wrapper bloke wesley escorted her to the lift he shook his head i ve seen several things that make eating an unattractive prospect but no incredible average bloke inside the lift she leaned close to whisper what she had seen and heard in trelawney room i thought you werentsupposed to say a word to your little friends wesley said humorously after hearing about the professors she pressed kisses along his jaw you re not my little friend you re my love she kissed his smiling lips happy that they were alone in the lift his hands slid down to her hips turning and pressing her against the wall while they exchanged deep soft wet kisses she moaned uh lovegood i hate to tell you but you pushed a button and we can all hear you two snogging or whatever colin voice was filled with glee not regret she gasped wesley chuckled creevey remind me to give you a hex later but right now tell us if you ve seen anything nothing no luck here neville voice was low whether embarrassed by the inadvertent eavesdropping or depressed over lack of progress she couldnttell they signed off luna pushed her tee back down to cover her abdomen and tried to look innocent when she and wesley exited on the first floor a mediwitch smiled brightly to see them volunteers how nice there a burn patient two beds down who wants someone to read the daily prophet to him and i need assistance with embedded spiders luna smiled at the shudder wesley gave when the mediwitch mentioned spiders she said why dontyou go read i ll help the mediwitch he smiled gratefully and hurried off soon his pleasant voice could be heard reading an article about the misuse of muggle artefacts the patient luna assisted with a young boy who had thought the species of spider harmless said he makes the news sound fun i wish my dad did my family falls asleep at table when he reads us an article after finishing with several other small tasks wesley and luna were heading to another floor when they heard mindy say oh my gods i think i just saw mr ordinary waltz in the front door he holding a set of healer robes neville ordered follow him to the lifts find out which floor he stops on colin shouted the fourth wesley urged neville bindy find someplace to hide we ll be right up he hit the button for the fourth floor asking creevey you two on your way yeah we ll block the stairs and lift wands ready luna and wesley exited the lift and headed for the janus thickey ward for long term spell damaged patients inside they heard neville shouting tell me who sent you tell me what you ve done to my parents or i ll show you how it feels to experience an unforgivable curse she and wesley froze when the man behind the longbottoms screened area laughed you know who it was you know who and he ll never allow your parents to escape his judgment boy curse me if you choose but it wontstop their well deserved suffering scuffling sounds were heard they rushed forward and yanked back the curtain neville was holding an armful of clothing bindy yelled there there he is headed for the door luna mouth dropped open a ferret with strange markings was running across the room before she or wesley could hex or jinx it a man in a lilac dressing gown scooped up the animagus and cooed well arentyou a cute little fellow gilderoy lockhart displayed a dazzling white smile while he carried the wriggling animal over to his bed i dontremember as much as i should but i do know that animals like women and children adore me i almost sure i d have hundreds of pets if i didnthave to feed them or give them any attention when the ferret bit him lockhart cried out and dropped the creature onto the bed it scrambled up onto the windowsill neville said dontlet him go he an animagus before he could push his former professor out of the way the ferret jumped out the window lockhart grabbed bindy wand dontworry he said patronisingly i know the transformation spell to help your friend the spell caused the ferret which had shifted mid fall into a wizard to transform into an animal again when the ferret hit the ground it didntbounce the way a wizard body would have instead unable to claim magical protection it hit the ground with a heavy thud and lay still the friends crowded around the window watching to see if the ferret would rise colin and mindy rushed into the ward what happened colin said luna pointed to the window they all saw a st mungo security wizard hurry out and pick up the animal whose neck was clearly broken the man looked up glad that they had stepped back out of sight luna said i think we should leave bindy hugged neville are you okay he said solemnly yeah i glad he dead and maybe the ministry will do a proper investigation now that i can prove i not just some meddling kid he asked his girlfriend will you come with me i going downstairs to tell security what happened she smiled and kissed his cheek i d be proud to colin and mindy volunteered to come along too luna said honestly i dontthink that wesley or i with our fathers connection to the quibbler would help you make your case neville he replied with a glimpse of a smile no probably not when the boy tried to hand back his radio wesley shook his head keep it you never know when the scooby gang will ride again neville said okay freddy he clasped bindy hand together they walked past his silently staring parents toward the door colin bowed to mindy after you scrappy she smirked just for calling me that no scooby snogs for you they waved goodbye and followed the other couple wesley slipped his arm around luna waist and steered her out of the ward inside the linen cupboard that she found quite comfortable he held her tight and admitted that not the way i thought our mystery would end she rubbed her cheek against his shoulder glad to be alive and in his arms i wanted life to be like one of those cartoons you told me about the ones where the kids unmask the villain and he goes to prison while the people he harmed are free to live a happy life a tear rolled down her cheek it didntturn out that way wesley kissed the tear away i know it didn t buttercup but neville will bash on and maybe now he ll get the authorities to help he smiled if they don t he got friends who will luna stood on tiptoes to press a kiss to his lips using her fingers grip in his hair to hold his mouth fused to hers wesley hands stroked up her back sifted through her hair and cradled her face while he slowly and thoroughly returned the sensuous caress of lips and tongue long sweet kisses made her cheeks flush and her heart pound she could feel his heart pounding too lifting her hand to his cheek luna said with a catch in her voice i love you wesley he kissed her again after looking into her eyes and smiling tenderly i love you too my bella luna when his lips lifted to trail kisses down her throat she took a shaky breath and asked will you come to dinner tonight so my father can get to know you his dimples deepened anything for you love he placed his lips on hers gently coaxing her mouth to open and deepening the kiss she shifted closer he moaned colin voice said laughingly uh you forgot to turn off your radio and well a couple of us did too and we thought you d like to know we can hear you snogging or whatever she giggled wesley groaned colin yelped mindy said tartly dontmind him we didnthear much after a pause the girl asked do you two want to go get some lunch bindy offered to treat at her parents restaurant neville done with security and from his expression needs cheering up luna looked at wesley he smiled she said sure we ll be down in just a few minutes after turning off her radio she twined her arms around his neck and murmured where were we wesley laughed huskily right he brushed his lips over hers here he took possession of her mouth the way he had her heart like a bold pirate she sighed and returned his kiss joyfully blaise opened the tent flap to walk outside and watch the sunrise reflecting that romania was nothing like she d expected it was so much more they had travelled by port key a large horse drawn cart had transported them from quidditch pitch to mountain meadow within moments after experiencing the unique sensation of being pulled forward by her navel through a swirling band of colour that rushed by like roaring wind the cart had pulled to a stop in a field carpeted by sweet smelling grasses and flowers she had climbed down with terry help and held his hand while she d gazed at the main structure of the research centre she admired the clean lines of the two storied building it blended into the nearby forest with its wooden construction and steeply sloped roof several smaller wooden homes clustered behind it like a small village blaise remembered the way their driver dimitrie had waved to the man striding toward them from the lodge like building charlie is in charge of volunteers he will tell you what you need to know the large gruff voiced man waved goodbye to his passengers clucking to the horses he said succes atunci la revedere booming with laughter the romanian guided the cart toward a narrow forest road what did he say or do i not want to know draco asked in an undertone niles a volunteer who had introduced himself as an obliviator re thinking his career of erasing muggle memories of the wizarding world said in his crisp tones dimitrie said good luck and goodbye when the rest of the group stared the wizard smoothed down his precisely arranged blond hair and admitted i good with languages blaise said i good with shopping phrases she winked at ginny cat costa asta how much is this that all you need to know except maybe ati accepta would you take if you like to bargain excepting the nearby village there wontbe many opportunities for you to shop during your stay miss charlie weasley had reached the group scanning the list of names written on the parchment held by the clipboard in his hand he said perplexedly i donthave any females listed ginny i was aware of as a late addition but no one told me you were coming miss steady brown eyes in a ruggedly attractive face glanced at her in friendly inquiry she raised her left hand it mrs actually mrs boot but please call me sophia ginny giggled draco coughed and terry smiled sliding his arm around her waist as a few disappointed volunteers muttered damn with a look of concern charlie reminded the tents arentexactly honeymoon suites mrs sophia he made eye contact with the ten young men and two young women making up the group of volunteers and said frankly right over there beside the centre are your quarters for the next several weeks they arentposh by any stretch of the word so if you re used to finer things he gave blaise designer clothes and pretty sandals a sceptical look i hope you re prepared to rough it once more proving his pleasant disposition charlie didntraise a brow when she promised cheerfully along with the others that she was he merely shrugged and escorted them to the tents she hadntnoticed before tall and roomy looking the tents were the exact colour of the grasses they were spaced across to the side of the research centre the dragon chaser pointed to a wooden structure painted the same camouflaging green located behind the tents he said each tent has a toilet but shares a bath house the freckles that made his face look tanned became more prominent when the wizard blushed uh be sure to have your husband keep watch for you sophia they re open showers nodded earnestly she said that wontbe a problem out of the corner of her eye blaise caught sight of minky lurking behind the tent on the far end and asked may we have the tent closest to the houses so i can be close to ginny amiably charlie agreed and assigned the others to share leaving the tent next to blaise and terry empty draco frowned dontyou want me to stay there charlie shook his head no i ve got plenty of room at my place you ll stay where i can keep an eye on clearing his throat charlie raised his voice get settled in everyone and then head over to the centre for lunch there a dining hall inside at one o clock we ll have an orientation meeting with a smile that faded when he saw ginny slip her hand into draco s the man led the young couple towards his home blaise called pa pa and laughed when ginny turned to her brother questioningly before echoing the romanian bye bye back to her terry picked up their bags why did you really pick that tent she grinned minky was there working her magic he chuckled let me guess we wontbe roughing it slanting a teasing sideways look blaise said no and you wonthave be deprived of sharing a shower either her husband how wonderful that sounded gave her a smouldering look that made her unconsciously walk faster they reached the tent and entered to see minky fluffing a sofa pillow in the lounge the house elf large round eyes glowed with zeal minky is glad she is deciding to look after you here there was no bathtub nothing but an old illumination orb a couple of camp chairs and a rickety table for the lounge and in the bedroom only two cots and a tiny wardrobe shameful gaze drifting across the colourful sofa upholstered in a traditional romanian print the oriental rug low table cosy club chairs and the small round table with chairs in a corner blaise said you ve done a wonderful job this is so much better than a honeymoon suite terry dropped the bags yes it is thank you tips of her ears turning pink minky ducked her head modestly and told them she would return to see to things the next morning after the elf had apparated blaise watched terry silently taking in the furnishings and bit her lip in anxiety he noticed and hugged her asking what wrong her lips trembled you hate it dontyou you wanted to camp out in a rustic tent and now you ll have to live in luxury she wailed i ve ruined our holiday his smile grew until he was chuckling lifting her up and carrying her over the bedroom threshold in classic bridal fashion terry placed her gently on the bed he kissed her lingeringly before looking around the space transformed into something out of arabian nights why would i want a musty narrow cot when i could share this with you blue eyes darkened while he slipped off his shoes socks and shirt i was a bit overwhelmed sure but i wasntunhappy he leaned down to take off her sandals before gliding his hands up her long bare legs i love you baby and i like your style his fingers unfastened the button on her shorts she returned the favour with his denims smiling show me how much due to terry showing her so well both in the bedroom and in the bathroom later they were late to lunch slipping onto the bench beside ginny blaise said in an effort to distract attention from their tardiness i really like how we all sit at one long table makes it seem like we re part of the same team even though some of us are only temporary she pushed her hair back over her shoulder and smiled across the table at charlie who promptly choked on his soup the brunette serving lunch pounded him on the back rather forcefully the romanian girl then wiped her hands on her embroidered apron and flounced out of the room with her nose in the air mystified blaise turned to ginny her friend gasped before dissolving into giggles on the laughing girl other side draco leaned forward and snapped while raising his wand you forgot to dry your hair hufflepuff startled blaise looked down and saw that her siren secret barely there bra looked not at all there due to being soaked by her bloody long wet hair in an instant draco spell had dried her tank top and returned her to decency she smiled ruefully at terry who fingered his own wet hair draco said hufflepuffs in love and used the spell once more charlie recovered from his shock grinned at them so you re hufflepuffs eh he winked looking uncannily like his twin brothers you sure uphold your house reputation blaise played with a strand of terry hair before brushing it back from his handsome face she ignored the suppressed mirth from her friends to say sincerely thanks terry arms sliding around her waist and pulling her back against his chest brought the newlywed out of her reverie she turned her head to look up into his face i love to watch the sun rise over the meadow the butterflies the flowers the mountains everything is so beautiful i glad minky added a back entrance so i could enjoy the view every morning he smiled wryly do you know the name of every flower now last night around the bonfire poindexter sure attempted to teach every ruddy one of them she giggled arnold doesntget to talk to someone who allows him to share his interest in flora very often disregarding his dry arnold doesntget to talk to a girl very often she informed granger like i now know that all those purple flowers in the grass are crocus heuffelianus and the others are blaise broke off shrieking with laughter when he began tickling her turning she said i canthelp being friendly poor blokes this is the adventure they ll be bragging about when they go back to desk jobs at the ministry he kissed her in a way that warmed better than the pale morning rays terry broke away to nuzzle her neck and ask in a low insinuating voice what adventure do i get to brag about over the last few days malfoy and i are dead even on barrels of dragon shite shovelled but that not what i call exciting blaise took a quick look around at this early hour no one was up emboldened she untied her belt and let her robe fall to the ground when terry jaw dropped she darted out of his slack embrace and ran toward the tent laughing when he slung her over his shoulder and carried her inside playfully slapping her backside languidly stroking his chest later she said i ve never been this happy in my life i dontever want to take my ring off terry rolled onto his side to look into her eyes what are you saying you dontwant to go back to hogwarts she took a deep breath and shook her head i ve tried to pretend that i wouldntmind keeping our marriage a secret but i want to cry your name each night and smile into your eyes each morning and i cantdo that if you re in ravenclaw tower and i in slytherin he smiled i dontwant to be separated either i tired of lying to my parents and the thought of living that way for another year terry said barry showed his coach the flight patterns i came up with for ravenclaw and he said he d make me an assistant coach in a heartbeat ruefully he acknowledged the cannons arentthe best but it would be a start blaise nodded eagerly that all we need she kissed him nobody loved me the way you love me feeling his heartbeat quicken beneath her palm she pushed him onto his back and vowed and i going to make sure that you know nobody will ever love you as much as i do after sending her satisfied husband off to challenge draco to yet another contest of magical shovelling skill blaise walked to charlie house to see ginny the girls helped out at the centre whenever they could but aside from sorting dragon scales and doing a little filing or other minor paperwork there was nothing for them to do this left the friends a lot of time for hikes to the village to shop blaise knocked on the door with a romanian longhorn intricately carved upon its surface looking forward to the walk through the ancient forest of gigantic fir spruce and beech trees the door opened she said buna dimineata charlie smiled in return good morning to you too come in ginny almost ready she followed him through the lounge toward the kitchen inhaling with pleasure your home always smells so good he picked a wooden trivet off the counter it the juniper wood it releases a nice aroma when hot things are placed on it it an old romanian custom looking toward the girl wiping off the table his smile widened anika gave it to me the same young woman who had pounded him on the back that first day now said without looking up i refuse to keep house for a bachelor without fresheners of all kinds charlie ran a hand over his red hair laughing self consciously are my socks that bad imi pare rau he looked at blaise and shrugged i am sorry i guess i sweat a lot chasing dragons anika wiped her hands on yet another colourfully embroidered apron this one orange and white she spared her employer a quick glance you do important work tracking the dragons preventing them from breaking the boundary wards keeping them safe with a hint of a smile in her green eyes the pretty housekeeper said i do not mind your sweaty socks blaise watched with interest as anika and charlie stared at each other matchmaking instincts flaring to life she asked are you two dating they both blushed and looked everywhere except at each other charlie was speechless but anika denied vehemently no no we are not cheeks red she practically tore off the apron saying i am done here i will see you at lunch da the man hand reached out to touch the woman arm mersi i appreciate you taking care of me cu placere you are welcome but it is only my job anika stepped back and left the kitchen watching charlie listen to soft footsteps head for the front door blaise said after it closed with a quiet snap you really like her dontyou the freckle highlighting blush returned endearingly he half smiled da not that a beautiful girl like anika christinel would ever like me bill now she d fall for in a heartbeat the jammy bastard pardon my language who d fall for bill in a heartbeat ginny asked as she entered the warm yellow painted room her brother replied wryly anika no she wouldn t ginny said she goes for a more rugged outdoor type i can tell charlie picked up a pair of dragon hide gloves well i have to fly up to the peaks to check on dragon eggs today so i cantstay and gossip about people love lives buna ziua ginny hugged her brother and wished him good day in return before she said i bet girls love it when you talk romanian he pulled away shaking his head and giving a single response in english on his way out the door loony sharing a smile over the term they now considered a compliment ginny and blaise each took a honey and walnut fritter off a plate on the table and hungrily consumed the pastries red eyebrows arched why are you so hungry didntyou already have breakfast blaise knew her blush rivalled charlie s i forgot i wonder why ginny grabbed another pastry after swallowing a huge bite the girl smiled impishly let talk about charlie and anika and how we can do a spot of matchmaking in the village later ginny stayed behind in the dress shop when the owner lelga offered to demonstrate embroidery blaise teased it the custom to give the man you fancy an embroidered handkerchief to display your wifely skills so you d better work fast before some other fair young maiden offers draco her handiwork ginny looked to the motherly lelga for confirmation a scowl appeared on her face fine i ll embroider the fanciest handkerchief he ever saw but if another girl tries to wave some scrap in his face i ll bloody well make her eat it the women around them who were pretending to shop while listening avidly burst into delighted laughter blaise waved goodbye and headed for the small jewellery shop lucian was a superb artisan his unique dragon and wolf designs had instantly captured her eye and made her long to contact her father finding new artists and gaining exclusive rights to their work was one of the aspects of zabini jewellers that she had enjoyed as much as enrique the few times he had brought her along on a hunting expedition blaise had loved the thrill of discovering an artisan whose work would become justly renowned and well recompensed she picked up a pendant depicting a chinese fireball after perusing the other wares the red gold dragon with golden spikes would be perfect for luna impulsively she asked the man wife nadia who handled the sale would you like your husband to become rich and famous the plump woman adjusted her traditional kerchief she looked at her thin husband creating a ring on the other side of the shop and said rich da famous nu i would not wish him to get a how you say big head when assured that the fame would be in jeweller circles only the woman nodded vigorously then da we have six expensive children nadia pinched blaise on the cheek you find a fancy jeweller who makes my family rich and i introduce you to emil our eldest lucian looked up with a frown she a married woman leave her be he winked but if she wasn t emil would be a lucky man bidding them a smiling farewell blaise checked in with ginny found her hard at work embroidering a handkerchief and told her she d come back in an hour she started down the path that led to the centre stopping to stare at the man walking toward her his stride halted while he searched her face with a small smile he greeted hola hija her father quiet tone made her heart leap in hope jingling the change in his pocket in a nervous gesture enrique said i came home to an empty house and realised that it was what i deserved i have worked so hard for so long and for what to drive away my wife and child he said sadly i have become my grandfather she shook her head no papa i wasntplanning on running off never to return i just wanted to prove blaise bit her lip i guess i acted just like you when he inclined his head in rueful acknowledgment she took a step forward how did you find me through minky her father nodded drinky coaxed enough information i did not ask how and i pray he never tells for me to know this is where you ran he looked around at the virgin forest and smiled i wouldntwant to build a summer house here but the trees are actually quite lovely are you happy blaise stepped closer smiling mistily yes enrique embraced her and said emotionally you look like mi abuela sophia with your long hair no longer my little ni a forgive me hija i ll always forgive and love you papa in an effort to stop acting like the hufflepuff she was masquerading as blaise stepped back and slipped her hand into the crook of her father arm you ve got to come to the village with me i ve found a craftsman named lucian who makes the most unique and potentially lucrative jewellery dark eyes alight with anticipation enrique strode with her to the shop he held up a finger now let me do the talking he grinned you will see the master at work later on the walk back to the centre their excited chatter about the upcoming romanian collection amused ginny blaise caught her smirking and asked how did your handkerchief turn out a white square embroidered with a traditional blue grey diamond within diamond design was displayed the girl accepted their compliments graciously before she noticed a boy waiting on the steps ahead and ran off to give the young man she fancied his token enrique caught sight of the man standing beside draco and smiling in their direction he asked who is that young man waiting for blaise gaze softened revealingly even before she said he waiting for his wife to introduce him to her father with a heart overflowing with happiness she pulled her speechless companion forward and said papa this is my husband terry ginny watched terry and blaise escort her father to their tent she sniffed and looked down blinking away sentimental tears draco lifted her chin are hufflepuff tendencies contagious or did you have them all along he mock frowned if they re contagious perhaps we d best quarantine those two she giggled they d enjoy that too much and then you d never beat terry at shovelling he gave a huff of amusement and steered her toward the dining hall saying triumphantly i already beat him at her surprise he said i ll concede i took advantage of boot distraction this morning to shift his barrel while he stared off after remarking that the morning sunlight turns blaise skin golden all over his brow furrowed long platinum strands shook as he said firmly no i refuse to wonder how he knows draco returned to his tale of that morning victory grinning like a naughty little boy his shovel kept dumping dragon dung beside the barrel for a good five minutes before he snapped out of his daze and corrected the mistake he twirled her around in a victory dance afterwards i retired undefeated as shovelling champion ginny couldnthelp kidding so the prince of slytherin is king of the dung heap his unrestrained laughter made her giggle she asked curiously why are you the retired champion his gleaming smile made classic features even more fae and beautiful masculine satisfaction rang in his voice because queen of my heart word of my and terry boy flying skills got round and your brother begged us to lend the research team a hand funny i seem to recall hearing that you complained volunteers who could fly rings around anyone else at this centre shouldnthave their skill wasted shovelling shite charlie tone was dryly amused he clapped draco on the shoulder and told his sister wallace and grommitt who were overseeing collection for the diagon alley order heard and challenged your boyfriend and his mate to a race they lost so draco and terry join the flyers and the losers get to shovel draco tried to look abashed but ginny saw his lips quirking and unconsciously lifted her face to kiss those irresistible lips charlie cleared his throat she snapped do you need a throat lozenge her brother grinned like the twins no but you should take a look around and notice we re in the dining hall now with fake innocence that gred or forge would admire he said if you re comfortable snogging with an audience go right ahead when she swayed toward draco he added it ll give me something to write about in the letter i owling mum today frustrated she promised just you wait charlie just you wait she tossed her hair huffily ignoring the nosy people watching to stomp over to her place at the table ginny shook off her temper when anika smiled sympathetically and served lunch it was hard to stay in a bad mood when eating mushroom soup a bread mixed with nuts and poppy seed called bobalky and stewed fruits she tried out her meagre language skills by saying a fost delicios to the girl serving charlie another helping of soup before he was done with the first anika smiled widely ginny noticed her brother moony eyed look of admiration and quickly asked does the village ever hold dances the young woman straightened her kerchief in a nervous gesture da in the village square but not many from the centre come to our celebrations the jovial older couple in charge of public relations and fund raising chimed in that they never missed a dance and didntknow why every year all the single volunteers stayed huddled around their bonfire when they could be dancing across from them niles straightened his already impeccable posture and asked are we invited when anika assured him that they were more than welcome he said doubtfully yes well that very polite but would any girls actually want to dance with us anika put a hand to her mouth probably to hide a smile before she said yes there are many more women than men in our village the atmosphere in the hall became electric as single young men envisioned dancing with single young women beside ginny draco said i dontthink any young maidens will lack partners at the next dance she pretended to scowl i dontcare how beautifully they embroider you tell any girl who asks that you already have a partner grey eyes darkened you re the only partner i want in every way ginny was falling forward into his eyes and tantalisingly closer to his lips when her brother started that annoying hem hem that reminded her of former professor and high inquisitor umbridge the sound made her want to take umbrage with charlie determined to snog her boyfriend silly at the first opportunity she glared across the table curtly she said what he jumped saying awkwardly i was just trying to ask anika when the next dance would be held from the corner of her eye ginny saw draco shaking with repressed laughter and surreptitiously elbowed him before muttering oh she looked at anika whose cheeks were as rosy as hers were green eyes transfixed by charlie intent gaze the girl murmured there is a dance this upcoming saturday will will you come when he continued to stare at her in silence anika said hurriedly perhaps i will see you there you are finished i will take your bowl picking up his almost full bowl of soup she marched out of the room charlie wide mouth turned down i think i just missed out ginny smirked taking pleasure in little sister status in more ways than one when he threw her a warning look she threw him a piece of bobalky cheer up you can still ask her to the dance and at least bread filling draco snorted as if trying not to laugh charlie told him sourly you wontbe laughing later malfoy flying volcanic ridges is no jaunt across the quidditch pitch when no further comments were thrown his way the disgruntled man bit off a hunk of bread and said pragmatically bobalky is filling pass me the fruit the moment the first couple left the table ginny sprang to her feet draco i want to show you what i found in the village today come on he set down his serviette with a knowing smile nodding when charlie reminded grimly that they would need to leave in a half hour outside she headed for the woods the thought of him as a wolf padding along and tracking her made butterflies flutter madly in her middle once inside the sheltering forest she whirled around and said that handkerchief i gave you he retrieved the item in question from his pocket what about it ginny said i embroidered it it custom for maidens to give the man they fancy a token he smiled in a slow wolfish grin that made him look predatory instead of feeling alarmed her fingers to twitched to pet him she began to breathe faster imagining stroking his white blond hair draco captured her gaze moved close enough to brush her body with his and lifted a lock of her hair rubbing the bright strand between his fingers he said silkily fancy me do you she nodded unable to speak he bent to whisper in her ear what big eyes you have red ginny shivered the better to see you with she replied huskily allowing her gaze to travel down his gorgeous body before meeting his eyes heavy lidded and hot his gaze drifted over her possessively before focusing on her mouth draco rasped what beautiful lips you have she stood on tiptoes to seek his kiss the better to snog you with love her big beautiful wolf didntgobble her up although he consumed her mouth with kisses nibbled her neck and dropped to his knees to push up her shirt and lick her bellybutton before blowing across it and kissing her abdomen ginny drew her tee up and off malfoy if i have to come in there and find you i bringing an axe draco stood raking his fingers through disordered hair and breathing harshly he laughed shortly seems your brother knows his muggle tales little red she scrambled to pull on her shirt yelling dontyou dare charlie weasley storming through the underbrush she said once she cleared the forest if i go off into the woods with my big bad wolf it none of your business brother he gave dad a wizard handshake and that should be good enough for you too charlie calling after her ruined the dramatic exit towards the house put your shirt on right next time and maybe it will be she looked down and cringed her shirt was on backwards she had thought she was choked with anger ahhh she yelled as she ran across the flower strewn grass to the house she slammed the door upon entering still aggravated she opened the door and slammed it again frustration vented she went upstairs in the bathroom ginny looked in the mirror and started laughing hysterically her hair was sticking out wildly she closed her eyes in mortification until she remembered draco kisses she sighed and decided to take a cold shower instead of a long hot bath draco and charlie returned while she was reading a book in the lounge her brother had a wide assortment of dragon related books from the practical from egg to inferno a dragon keeper guide to the whimsical dealing with dragons the moment ginny had read the title among the many crammed onto shelves filled with novels collections of myths and drawings and non fiction she d been intrigued the author had written about a princess who wanted more from life than the stereotypical prince ginny had instantly related when she read cimorene was the youngest daughter of the king of linderwall and her parents found her very trying diving into the novel with enthusiasm she hadntdisplayed diving into her cold shower she had just got to the chapter titled in which the wizards try to make trouble and cimorene does something about it and read the door to the cottage opened when the front door was flung open charlie strode into the room we re home ginny marked her place in the book slid it under a cushion and slid her legs off the sofa she stood and smiled have fun dragon chasing from the men windblown hair and wide smiles she could tell that they had she put her hands on her hips tomorrow you re taking me with you they looked at each other in alarm typical males they began reasoning with her trying to keep the little woman safe while they had all the fun now ginny charlie began in his older wiser brother tone of voice haventyou enjoyed walking into the village going shopping when the other man floundered and looked to him for help draco said learning embroidery she shook her head stubbornly it was all right for a few days but now it boring boring they exclaimed in unison boring i want to do things not sit around all day she ran to the sofa and grabbed the book thrusting it into charlie hands and shouting oh my gods i ve just quoted from this book when they tried to tell the princess to stop doing things that werentproper charlie looked at the dealing with dragons cover saying uneasily i remember this you wouldntrather be eaten by a dragon though would you her gaze locked onto a grey eyed dragon who smiled while giving her such a steamy look she could almost feel the fine hairs at the back of her neck curling along with her toes moistening lips that were suddenly very very dry ginny said with conviction oh yes i would her brother didnthave to know she meant devoured lovingly by a dragon who was also a wolf sometimes a black knight and always the man she loved you could send us to check on eggs none of them are scheduled to hatch anytime soon right draco said reasonably she thought of ron telling her not to go begging to hold a dragon egg and smiled charlie said that right probably not for weeks yet no harm in ginny flying the mountain ridges you could take her along the slopes show her the waterfalls the freckled face turned serious stay concealed when you check the eggs brooding dragonesses dontalways scream a warning before they strike excited by the prospect of flying and seeing dragon habitats maybe even dragons themselves ginny promised to be good as gold whatever that meant charlie laughed and headed upstairs to take a shower draco stayed behind after a long sweet kiss he said you ve got to stop tempting me to gobble you up he put his arms around her and chuckled at least until you finish school when that bloody damned wizard handshake is no longer valid she said okay and rested her head against his chest for a few moments peering up at him ginny asked you ll still nibble wontyou his gaze became smoky laughter rumbled up from his chest making her smile even before he growled every day red at dinner that evening blaise shared that she and her father had reconciled enrique had accepted terry after a few thinly veiled threats and the sharp businessman even agreed to put a local craftsman under contract to zabini jewellers the girl was so bubbly and radiant that ginny realised how quiet and withdrawn draco was in contrast she asked how he liked the goulash he shrugged she then asked if he had seen any dragons that day he said succinctly yes two longhorns and a horntail and went back to picking at his food not even his favourite clatite cu ciocolata si frisca chocolate and cream fritters could bring draco out of his dark mood he refused the dessert failing to smirk and make his standard is there anything romanians wont turn into a fritter comment the brooding started to worry ginny when her boyfriend didntcurl a lip at botanist poindexter enthusing over discovering some rare orchids called corallorrhiza trifida finally when the couple sat side by side on a fallen log watching the flames of the small bonfire she leaned against him and said you still worry about your father what he plans to do dontyou he continued to stare at the burning logs in a toneless voice he said i wish my father would see the error of his ways like zabini did even knowing him the way i do when you told me about enrique i wasnthappy for my mate i was envious smiling bitterly he confessed blaise has a happy family gets to sleep beside the one she loves every night while i watch for ravens and get threatened if i get up for a bloody glass of water ginny tried to distract him from bleak thoughts were you really getting up for a glass of water in the darkness platinum hair looked like starlight when he shook his head no i was going to check on you to make sure the wards were working properly what were you threatened with the tiniest of smiles tugged at the corners of his mouth the hex affecting private areas no she cried draco lips turned upwards at her unfeigned distress yes it made me thankful that i know the counter curse and lessened my regret that i rescinded montague hex the silence that fell was comfortable instead of tense across the fire blaise and terry were putting on their nightly display of what niles had termed smug marrieds snogging ginny watched interestedly as terry got up and strolled towards the couple tent while blaise walked around the fire talking to volunteers and staff i wonder what she asking ginny mused aloud whatever it is the answer no so far draco said when she reached them the girl the others called sophia asked urgently do you have a scarf i could borrow dark eyes lit up when the answer was yes she pulled ginny to her feet and grabbed her best mate arm as well come on let go get it ginny walked briskly to match blaise long strides wondering the other girl wanted a scarf so desperately her face heated when a couple of reasons came to mind she decided it was better not to know as she climbed the front steps calling i ll run up and get it when she returned draco was laughing softly when blaise hugged her and ran off with the scarf he shook his head that got to be the most hufflepuff girl in the history of slytherin house unable to contain her curiosity any longer ginny said do you know why she wants the scarf stop laughing and tell me before my imagination gets more lurid his flashing smile lifted her spirits she needs it to transfigure a seventh veil it seems one fell out when she was packing when ginny repeated the word veil disbelievingly he moved in a way that made her jaw drop yes veil as in dance of a little belly dancing and a lot of dropping veils get it ginny got it she determined to have blaise teach it to her so one day she could perform it for draco trying desperately to get the image of draco bare chested leaning back against colourful pillows watching her veils drop one by one out of her over stimulated brain the girl said i didntget to brush your hair today he gave her the same look he had in her imagination when she d dropped the seventh veil she immediately turned and led the way upstairs in his room draco sat on the end of the bed after she d run the brush down his shoulder blade length strands a few times he caught her wrist tonight i going to brush your hair her lungs were screaming for oxygen by the time she had regained the ability to breathe trusting him with more than her hair ginny released the brush he had never brushed a girlfriend hair before ginny or allowed one to touch his ironically he had preferred not to be that intimate with someone he didnttruly care about when draco was a child his mother had allowed him to brush her hair once he still remembered her pleased smile and the rare kiss she had bestowed on his cheek he d run a comb through blaise curls a few times on holidays when she was feeling wonky and complaining of looking like crap she d kissed his cheek too smiling in pleasure and gratitude in the back of his mind he d thought that brushing ginny hair would be like his other experiences something he did for someone else a rare unselfish gift not something he did for his own pleasure as he slid the brush down silken hair draco felt satisfaction in hearing the small sounds of enjoyment ginny made in response to the repetitive strokes but he also felt something else pleasure her dreamy smile and heavy eyelids made him happy he set aside the brush using his fingers to comb through strands that gleamed brightly in the soft light of enchanted candles it was like plunging his hands into a river of fire that didntburn mmm that feels so good she said breathily draco changed his mind about her fiery hair not burning he was definitely feeling the heat a sudden thought caused his fingers to still their massage of her scalp he asked with feigned nonchalance has anyone else ever brushed your hair she tilted her head back to gaze up into his face while he knelt behind her do my parents or my brothers yanking a brush through my hair because mum told them to count he smiled no then no unless you count blaise who has this weird thing for long hair she giggled when he gave her a speaking look okay maybe it not so weird but i ve only got a thing for your long hair his fingers resumed their circling massage as he enjoyed the warm glow her words gave her head lolled back tempting his fingertips and lips to skim down her gracefully arched throat mindful that they were in a bedroom with an open door draco lifted her hair and rubbed its softness against his cheek before brushing the ends across his lips ginny fell back sighing kiss me obligingly he complied your lips are perfect from every angle too downstairs the front door banged open and closed just as forcefully ginny charlie hollered she sat up looking at her boyfriend in alarm draco put a finger to his lips and snatched up the brush rapidly smoothing the strands his fingers had run through they could hear weasley taking the stairs two at a time charlie halted in the doorway why didntyou answer me ginny and what the hell are you doing to my sister malfoy mum always said yelling was rude and we should go to the person we want to talk with and do just that talk ginny crossed her arms and nodded in a way that made her brother grind his teeth you re not my mother ginevra draco tried to avert a sibling spat good thing she not since i doubt your father wants me brushing his wife hair ginny leaned back against him giggling her brother scowled grey eyes rolled humour weasley or dontyou recognise it charlie leaned heavily against the doorframe he exhaled heavily i recognise humour but i doubt my father would be amused to know i allowed you two to spend time alone in a bedroom ginny said donttell him we werentdoing anything wrong i won t this time so keep it that way shaggy red hair flopped into his eyes when charlie nodded vehemently he shook his fringe back sounding exasperated when he said i need to get this mess trimmed draco felt ginny tense before she relaxed and suggested with feigned nonchalance worthy of a slytherin why dontyou ask anika to cut it tomorrow morning no i couldn t dismissively draco said you re right sitting in a chair letting someone lean over you while running a comb and her fingers through your hair trusting her not to cut your ear with the scissors it takes a lot of courage are you calling me a coward malfoy no i was thinking more slytherin for an instant when the man face turned the shade of red his sister had right before she kicked bill draco felt just the smallest trace of concern on ginny behalf of course she might get hurt if her brother started trying to muggle duel after opening and closing his mouth several times charlie choked out i am a gryffindor and i ll ask anika to trim my hair first thing in the morning because gryffindors arentcowards like others i could name ginny jumped off the bed after her brother stormed off she did a fetching little victory dance you re brilliant and cunning and charlie will thank you when anika is leaning over him and running her fingers through his hair sexy and cute at the same time she sat beside him on the side of the bed and bounced in excitement isntmatchmaking fun he smirked thrilling his lips were a breath away from hers when charlie returned go to bed ginny pointing to the corridor he stressed your bed she stuck her tongue out before defiantly kissing her boyfriend and strutting out of the room draco laughed silently when she blew him a kiss in the doorway and cooed good night my love charlie pushed her down the corridor noapte buna to you too brat he pointed his wand at draco when she d gone waving the rod in an intricate pattern i ve put an extra ward on this doorway if you take one step out of here i ll know malfoy so donteven try once his girl overprotective brother had left draco listened to the sounds of the weasleys getting ready for bed when the house was quiet he headed into the bathroom to take a shower he stood beneath the hot spray for a long time attempting to relax it wasntthe physical tension that came from closeness with ginny that had him on edge it was the faint gnawing concern that something bad was going to happen he could hear his father drawling mockingly worry is for those without the power to take action lucius had taught his son many things most of which the boy had tried to forget there was one lesson however that he had learnt eagerly and still practiced regularly in bed draco closed his eyes took slow calming breaths and remembered sitting beside his father in the dark library do you know why we re here draco had just turned ten and didntlike the dark he was proud that his father would ask however so he shook off his childish fears you want to teach me something i expect his father pale eyes gleamed in the shadows very good i want to share with you something i only learned a few years ago when the dark lord was gracious enough to impart the knowledge straining the boy could just make out his father hand gesturing to the darkness surrounding them i aware that you have trouble sleeping in the dark your mother told me that you worry that someone or something could attack when you re most vulnerable lucius cut off his son protest with a wave of his hand i not angry i impressed that you realise that at such a young age grateful for the rare approval draco asked what can i do father to make sure i safe close your eyes and i ll teach you forcing himself to take deep deliberate breaths draco tensed and then relaxed every muscle in his body opening his mind and doing what his father had taught long ago he fell into darkness his spirit became a shadow floating above the bed and drifting through the wall in the next bedroom charlie was tossing and turning ginny sighed in her sleep in the room beyond the wraith like soul lingered as a smile curved pink lips before the girl turned on her side hugging a pillow and murmuring mmm draco eventually the shadow resumed its journey floating through every space distantly observing that the wards were strong and the house was safe drifting upstairs to return to its body the spirit became aware of a soft fluttering that was more a disturbance of air than a sound flying toward the source the shadow halted at the barrier of a windowpane once outside the protection of the wards the soul was vulnerable a murmur brought the spirit attention to the girl slumbering upon the bed nearby the fluttering sound came again it sounded like wings beating draco spirit returned so abruptly to his body that he jack knifed in bed gasping for breath he raked his hair back with shaking fingers trying to calm his racing heart what if marisol was here in romania looking for a way in to harm ginny he threw off the covers and strode toward the door about to damn the wards and go to her anyway until he was halted by the realisation that he couldnttell charlie about shadow walking and sensing something that might be a threat to ginny even if weasley wouldntthink him mental draco had taken vows of silence that were bound with blood he rubbed a hand across his face wishing there was some way he could bypass the wards you know a way he ignored the inner voice that was a memory of lucius and picked up his wand to attempt a counter spell red sparks lit up the space in the doorway draco tried another spell and another and another the others took the dark mark before they were given such power but you are my son and with this knowledge you will be the ideal spy if ever the dark lord has need of one at hogwarts shudders wracked his body as draco remembered what he had learnt summer holiday after second year while the women slept upstairs in the malfoy mansion the complicated spells the agonising pain inflicted by his father when he misspoke the agony his body experienced until he knew and performed the spells perfectly he had never used his hard earned skill for the dark lord but he had used it secretly for himself he was tempted to use it now will you stand by and do nothing while marisol acts you might as well have opened the window for her no draco tormented whisper reverberated in the quiet room silencing the mocking echo of his father his face hardened with resolve hands held out palms up draco closed his eyes and began to chant the spell that would transform him where a boy once stood a white ferret poked his head out of the pooling fabric and squirmed out of silken confinement before heading toward the door the wards didntaffect the animal which ran down the hallway and into ginny room scampering to the window he stood on hind legs and sniffed searching for any trace of a scent that did not belong nothing except the scent of the girl warm clean skin cautiously the ferret slinked closer he halted when a pillow fell off the bed as the sleeper rolled onto her back hopping onto the pillow the animal leapt onto the bed and padded over to observe the girl sleeping face instinctively he froze when her eyelashes fluttered and she opened her eyes to say in a thick sleepy voice i dreaming that draco turned into a ferret and came to watch over me her hands scooped him up and held his face close to hers aw tha so sweet her lips brushed his whiskers making him sneeze she smiled as her eyes began to close you re sooo beautiful even as a lil ferret she hugged him to her chest her fingers stroked his fur as she drifted off to sleep wriggling forward until his head rested upon soft skin he decided to wait until he knew for sure that ginny was safe before returning to his room soon the sound of her heartbeat combined with the warmth of her body lulled him to sleep when morning sunlight entered the room draco was dreaming the strangest dream he was licking the salt off a peanut but for some reason wasntsupposed to bite it still licking he heard a sleepy giggle opening his eyes in shock draco saw that his peanut was the side of ginny s and it was enormous lifting his head to peer at the face which in his current state looked like that of a beautiful giantess the boy who had become a ferret rolled off gerd s ginny s body and lay stunned for a moment after hitting the floor he shook off the impact his paws scrambling for traction as he scurried for the door and ran back down the corridor toward his room his ears detected the unmistakable sound of a door handle turning propelling his small body forward draco ran into his room and kept on scampering until he reached the bathroom towelling off after he had performed the spell to transform back to his natural form and showered draco stepped into his room and came face to face with a visitor following a hasty glance to make sure the towel around his waist was securely fastened he asked in a voice sharper than he had intended what are you doing in here ginny she held up his discarded silk pyjama bottoms i came to tell you about a strange dream i had her soft brown eyes were large in her delicate face was it a dream he froze just like a ferret defensively he said i dontknow what you re talking about but i dontthink you re brother would like finding you here with me so why dontyou go back get dressed and i ll see you downstairs ginny hand rose to the bodice of her nightgown i dreamt that you became a ferret to look after me and that you well licked me unable to meet her gaze he scoffed so now i demoted from amazing fighting ferret to pervy ferret what a flattering dream thanks a lot silence stretched out uncomfortably he broke down and looked at her she gave him the same stubbornly defiant stare she had given her brother last night so it was just a dream ginny stepped around him and marched toward the bathroom then you wontmind me looking for traces of white fur will you his hand shot out and captured her wrist she wrenched out of his grip why are you trying to hide this from me why wontyou just tell me that you re an ani i cant he interrupted desperately some secrets are kept due to honouring a promise but others are never spoken because the person has been bound by spell with blood magic and they literally can t tell anyone she hurled herself into his arms i sorry i should ve known it just that you were acting so cold he kissed her and stopped the stumbling apology showing her without words that his feelings for her were anything but cold her hands slid over his chest and up to his shoulders before trailing down to his hips loosening his towel a crash downstairs made them spring apart draco felt his towel sliding and clutched it in a fist ginny backed slowly away looking torn between alarm and disappointment another crashing sound caused her to blow him a kiss and run for her room he dressed in the outfit charlie had recommended dragon hide pants boots and a cotton tee to wear under a dragon hide jacket because the air was decidedly cooler at higher altitudes downstairs there was no sign of weasley in the kitchen the housekeeper was sweeping up broken crockery along with bits of red hair resisting the urge to back out of the room and let ginny speak to the woman he strode forward and inquired awkwardly are you all right dark hair swung forward to hide the romanian tear streaked face nu my virtue has been besmirched good gods what the hell did that mean charlie had assaulted her against the counter he didntbelieve it icily he said could you speak english please she glared i cut his hair i do nice thing tell him his hair is pleasing and he kissed me he stared incredulously what a bastard was throwing crockery at his head punishment enough or should i go curse him into oblivion she didntcatch the sarcasm do not speak of cursing charlie is a wonderful man worth ten of you and if you dare harm him i will do much more than throw crockery red faced the wench shouted do you understand my english now anika draco allowed the man who had walked up behind him to step into the kitchen perfectly he drawled he left the two to kill or kiss each other pulling ginny out the front door when she rushed down the stairs your brother is working things out with your future sister in law let go get blaise to feed us she slipped her arm around his waist but what if they re not awake or worse busy he gave a low chuckle all the better hours later flying with ginny on brooms that had been top of the line a long long time ago draco kept to the sharp ridges although his bold girlfriend wanted to explore the conical peaks the pungent pine fragrance was faint at this altitude even though the air was intoxicatingly fresh or maybe he was intoxicated by the sense of freedom from fear and from the burden of not being able to share that he was an animagus on the flight up from base camp they had seen brown bears wolves and even a lynx ginny had been excited to see an imperial eagle but he had instinctively recoiled hoping with dark humour that he wasntdeveloping an antipathy for birds as well as spiders he had preferred the scenery to the wildlife admiring the alpine lakes streams and cascading waterfalls his partner zoomed ahead taking a detour through vertical limestone walls toward vihorlat peak the name meant burnt and the hungarian horntails had marked the shallow caves there as part of their territory the couple had been sent to verify that the cement coloured eggs had yet to hatch and leave using a disillusionment charm to conceal their presence when they touched down on the sandstone slope beneath the peak ginny engaged the charm to blend into her surroundings before draco could do the same he heard a caw and turned to see a raven alight on a boulder while the bird morphed into a spanish woman he seized on a desperate plan silently he began reciting the transformation spell marisol said mockingly did you think i would not find you i listened at the kitchen window of that hovel belonging to your puta family and heard them speak of how they hoped their little girl was safe in romania black eyes glittered as she looked around i will deal with her and when i am through you will be mine lover draco concentrated harder than he ever had before stripping off his clothes to her delight and his chagrin he had never been able to transform with clothing on something about being too comfortable in his own skin he held out his arms tauntingly just before the spell took effect if you want me you ll have to catch me he heard her manic laughter while his world changed drastically as a ferret he darted his way up the slope zigzagging to avoid predatory talons he scuttled between boulders squeezed beneath ledges and used every bush clinging to the volcanic mountainside to evade capture while climbing steadily upward the raven beat its wings furiously against the last spindly bush keeping her from her prize he scrambled from cover and ran full out for the egg left to bask in the warmth of the sun leaping atop the grey oblong draco made every ferret howl and chattering noise he could while rising up on his hind legs intent on her prey the raven failed to notice yellow eyes glowing angrily in the cave behind him the black scaled dragoness lunged as he slipped off the egg and marisol grasped empty air a squawk and a terrible crunching sound propelled him forward in an adrenaline boosted rush of speed suddenly he was snatched up his furious wriggling scratching and biting halted when he heard damn it you can stop being an amazing fighting ferret now the horntail it ate her marisol is dead she wonthurt you or anyone else ever again his frantic heartbeat slowed as ginny landed beside a waterfall and disengaged the charm to become visible once more she pressed kisses to his furry face laughing and crying he licked her scratched cheek she kept petting and kissing him trying to give her a hint he nipped her chin ginny gave a watery giggle and finally set him down he slid into the small pool and transformed back into a form that was better suited to returning affection she reached into her pack and threw him his black briefs he almost dropped them when ginny began to strip it like a bikini malfoy dontgo prudish on me pulling his briefs on before she jumped in he pulled her into his arms and hugged her tight thankful to be alive he would ve stayed that way indefinitely raining kisses over her face in between holding her close if she hadntgasped that she needed air looking down he laughed and said would you mind if i started calling you peanut i had a dream this morning that i was licking the salt off one and he rubbed the spot meaningfully delicate red brows arched if you dontmind me calling you ferret whenever you do he tried to reply lightly you can call me ferret but i d rather you call me your love because you re mine and i so damned happy that you re safe his hands rose to cup her cheeks as he kissed her tenderly before shifting her closer and kissing her passionately ginny asked dreamily after passion gentled what did you just whisper draco smiled te iubesc i love you i do you know in romanian or any other language he kissed her again and asked now that you re safe do you want to go home or do you want to stay here and spend the summer with me ginny smile and her love made him truly free when she said i staying with you we re going to that dance and we re going to celebrate i love my family but you her arms twined around his neck while she lifted her lips to his te ador so good night unto you all give me your hands if we be friends and review not reprehend a n the long goodbye had a double meaning the chap was long and the finish but not quite the end of the story dealing with dragons is the story of that dance and draco discovering dragons are easy to deal with compared to weasleys as in almost every other chapter i snuck a few things in like names and bits of quotes in luna pov was my fave bull durham quote because i believe in long slow deep soft wet kisses that last three days and as with the princess bride reference in blaise pov the summer house quote you may remember westley saying in the fire swamp heh i like to get my faves in when i can i couldntput it in the disclaimer cause that would ve been telling but i dontadvocate teen marriage or doing a fred and george and leaving school early unless you re a fictional character with skills maturity and loads of money d i do advocate falling in love and snogging lol a tale of two matchmakers christmas reunion is posted as well seven years later blaise fears terry wants a divorce luna is hiding a secret from wesley and draco is tired of idiots saying his son has pink hair ginny solution call the curls reddish blond and invite their friends to malfoy manor for christmas thanks to everyone who has read and reviewed chapter 6 oh gods a gusher blaise floated dreamily into the great hall her feet may have touched the ground but her thoughts were languorously lifted into another realm one where she and terry were in each other arms gliding by the gryffindor table her eyes met those of a freckle faced red haired gryffindor boy blaise feeling at peace with the world waggled her fingers in greeting and smiled while she passed in her wake she heard a cry of pain crikey hermione why d ya hit me with that ruddy book oh dear did i accidentally nudge you with one thousand magical herbs and fungi i was trying to show harry what gillyweed looks like in its natural state so sorry ronald gryffindors might be brave but they sure arentsubtle blaise thought her smile widened when she met the dazzling blue eyes of the cleverest ravenclaw with the most talented lips in the entire school she gave terry a look that could have heated his hot chocolate she slowed when she approached using her schoolbag as a screen to run her fingers across the ends of his silky hair he shivered blaise smirked that how you do subtle ms granger of course subtle to a gryffindor was anything but to a slytherin like draco he watched her slide into place beside him raising a pale brow in amusement she grinned how quickly they d grown accustomed to sitting together too bad they never had the idea to spend their meals plotting and prodding one another before picked up a new boot zabini after eating for a few moments in silence to punish the amused wretch for his impertinence she decided what was good for the nag was good for the nagina and jibed how are those dishpan hands malfoy his eyes narrowed into grey slits what a dishpan muggles use them when they have to wash dishes by hand pursing chiselled lips in an adorable pout draco silently showed her his hands palms up they were red and roughened from his labour during detention blaise slanted a glance over to a table where a fiery haired girl was staring back with a slytherin like sneer ginny had heard about their detention and was gloatingly pleased about it miss weasley eyes were a bit too brown this morning blaise turned her attention back to the boy beside her after a sideways glance in another direction terry was concentrating on his breakfast she gave draco a meltingly sympathetic look while reaching into her robes for a vial placing it on the table she took malfoy hands in hers after another check assured the ravenclaw coast was clear she tenderly placed a kiss on each palm ignoring lips now twitching with warped enjoyment blaise uncorked the vial and poured the liquid onto his palms while massaging sore skin blaise cooed breathily poor baby how could mean old snape endanger these talented hands dropping the act she said i asked lorelei for a potion after i finished detention it supposed to work quickly how do you feel now draco smiled a real smile and not the superior smirk that usually passed for one girls all over the hall sighed blaise snuck a peek at the gryffindor table ginny had sighed and then promptly scowled draco raised his hands they were restored to pale perfection in gratitude he kissed blaise on the cheek blaise next peep confirmed ginny hadntliked that a peek in the other direction made her heart jolt terry was watching and he hadntliked what he d seen either he was glaring and moving his lips as if preparing to utter a jinx she groaned inwardly how could the situation get worse immediately blaise regretted tempting the heavens a familiar black owl swooped down from the rafters to drop a letter in front of her the black stationary was addressed in her mother bold handwriting something about the envelope was causing her breath to catch in her throat edina had used one of those before when someone got engaged draco asked why the look of terror did mumsie send you a howler biting her lip in dread blaise looked at terry in anguish and then pressed her lips together to hold back a sob of distress i wish it was a howler but it worse much worse than that it a gusher the black missive unfolded and an arch plummy voice rang out piercingly drawing attention from every table students listened in hushed expectation sweetie darling i just popped back from my crystal reading where cissy and i ran into patsy parkinson and she told us she heard you and draco are quite the item well am i sorry i ever doubted you i should have known when you wanted new clothes that there was a reason i thrilled of course bloody bollocky selfish two faced piggy patsy says it wontlast but cissy tells me she had a prophetic dream darling that you and draco were going to get married so we re forgiving patsy her little snit out with anger in with love and all that you re a fabulous wonderful girl and i sure dear draco thinks so too all right cheers i so happy for you darling only dear draco s firm grip on her arm kept blaise seated during the horrid gusher excited recitation of her mother message laughter filled the hall while the envelope exploded into a shower of black confetti blaise wanted to jump to her feet and dash from the hall to escape the ridicule pouring from every side she couldntmake herself look to see what terry reaction was beside her draco assumed an arrogant expression loudly saying merlin blaise was your mother sober his disgust was so convincing she could have kissed sneering lips in thankfulness sober no chance of that edina and narcissa only patronise that gazer to drink her elderberry wine blaise thought she did a good job at copying the disdain in malfoy tone he drawled i suppose we ll be exchanging vows if we dontwatch it just remember i partial to emeralds if you go looking at rings draco darling he smirked of course you fabulous wonderful girl grateful beyond words she asked care to walk your future wife to her first class draco sneered at the ravenclaw table i dontsee anyone else offering blaise refused to look anywhere other than the face of the only boy who had stood up for her when she needed it most lips trembling she smiled her thanks placing her hand in his as they walked toward the doors of the hall following draco lead she strolled casually pretending they werentbeing pointed to that she didnthear the gossip and laughter at the door draco paused and asked in an impudent voice that carried to the nearby tables so do i get to kiss the bride blaise forced a giggle knowing those who heard the last question would quickly tell their friends she hoped it would hurt terry to hear the speculation the gryffindor table was abuzz with rumours about the slytherin couple refusing to participate in gossip ginny bent her head and mechanically ate her breakfast beside her colin tilted his head to gaze concernedly are you all right sure colin i just hungry to prove her point ginny stuffed a slice of melon into her mouth and almost choked yeah sure he said doubtfully pounding ginny back and peering into her downcast face so what do you think about that scene with zabini and malfoy i dontthink anything i dontcare what those two do they can go pick out china patterns this weekend for all i care colin looked unusually serious i d have thought you of all people would recognise slytherin sarcasm when you heard it malfoy was obviously trying to blow off that gusher thing from blaise mother he ruefully admitted it was rather well done of him well done implying her mother was drunk walking blaise to class because no one else offered ginny indignant speech trailed away as she scanned the hall and found terry boot the tall boy had just grabbed another student by his robes threateningly letting go with a shove and an angry shake of his head terry snatched his gear and stormed out his fellow ravenclaws immediately began whispering looks like terry wishes he d offered to escort blaise too what do you mean too ginny demanded incredulously colin fair skin turned pink as he revealed i wanted to jump up and tell blaise i d walk her to class but everyone was staring and why would you want to help a slytherin colin lips turned up blaise has always been decent to me never pushing me into a wall or tripping me up and mocking me for being a potter fan like the rest of them do he confessed i had a crush on her a few years back i heard fiona flint talking to her about the yule ball once walking behind them in the corridor to the hall colin smiled sheepishly i blurted out that i d go with blaise if she wanted oh merlin you never breathed a word all this time what happened well flint told her not to encourage a grotty gryffindor but blaise was actually nice in a slytherin way ginny poked colin in the ribs hard go on smiling in reflection he said blaise looked me up and down smiling this half smile that was really stopping to clear his throat the blushing boy continued anyway she said if i wanted to go to the stupid ball and i was in the pit of despair because no slytherin asked me to go with them and i was able to bear the thought of being seen with someone younger and shorter and i could lower myself enough to consider a bloody gryffindor it would be you creevey listening to the moony eyed remembrance ginny had to admit the letdown was pretty nice for a slytherin damn maybe zabini is one of the few decent people in her house if that true what is she doing with malfoy ginny struck by a thought looked at colin what if he wanted me to pretend i liked him to get another girl attention would i do it yeah i would but i wouldntflash him or let him touch me however and whenever he wanted and act like i enjoyed it so bloody much she thought of draco what if he looked like malfoy though oh gods colin was regarding her with amused bewilderment you had quite a conversation with yourself shaking your head yes and no and yes again what were you thinking about ron said she was probably thinking how hilarious to see slytherins getting what they ve had coming to them for years couldnthappen to a nicer couple ow ron glee was cut short by a blow to his arm by an extremely heavy bag of books wielded by a girl with flashing eyes sorry again ronald perhaps ginny was thinking the same thing i was that malfoy was gallantly saving blaise from embarrassment and how sad he more the gentlemen than you are nose in the air hermione left the hall ron sputtered gallant malfoy gallant what is gallant anyhow rising to her feet ginny gave him a cool look and said crisply before following her friend i d tell you to get a dictionary but i know you wouldn t so i ll clue you in gallant means chivalrous courteous to women it a quality you lack sorely ronald the course of true love never did run smooth luna mused as she entered muggle studies that afternoon blaise hadntappeared at lunch or met her afterwards it had been just her and gregory the smarmy waiting in vain luna had drawn a moustache on his upper lip to relieve boredom whilst she waited she made herself leave before she gave into the temptation to darken his eyebrows luna gave blaise a searching look when she walked past the girl must have used some of her siren cosmetics because no one would be able to tell that she d ever been the least upset perhaps a complexion charm blaise smiled half heartedly in response to her concerned look and slipped a note into luna hand after taking her seat she opened the note to read l sorry i left you alone with gregory spent lunch holed up desperately scrambling through cosmetic kit for charms to make me look something other than total crap i now love and hate my mother can we meet same time tomorrow b covertly checking to ensure beatrice ginevra was looking the other way luna curved her lips conspiratorially at the girl behind her she was happy to get a conspiratorial smirk in return turning around she observed hands listening in satisfaction to an unfortunate boy stammering his way through his recitation of act iii of much ado about nothing the professor gaze met hers and gleamed maliciously tell us ms lovegood which portion of the ladies speech do you find most effective in championing their cause for turning beatrice affection to benedick you horrid little man i was staring at you the entire time well at that pudding stain on your shoulder any rate determinedly serene luna replied airily just to see hands lips tighten in irritation oh i suppose the part that goes but nature never framed a woman heart of prouder stuff than that of beatrice disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes misprising what they look on and her wit values itself so highly that to her all matter else seems weak she cannot love nor take no shape nor project of affection she is so self endeared the professor nodded brusquely and said what struck you ms zabini luna noticed ginny turning to watch blaise who said trippingly enough to make the bard proud so she turns every man the wrong side out and never gives to truth and virtue that which simpleness and merit purchaseth abruptly ginny turned away from the girl challenging stare the professor disappointed in his hope of needing to belabour a point due to student incomprehension picked on a nervous girl who didntknow what she thought about anything except having to use the toilet hands excused her cheerfully and spent the rest of the class explaining what shakespeare really meant in act iii afterwards the two matchmakers stayed behind for a moment breaking the awkward silence blaise said we have caught her madam luna caught the reference and grinned before replying if it proves so then loving goes by haps some cupids kill with arrows some with traps scowling at his plate of bland food chosen according to snape warning about the stomach churning nature of tonight detention draco was thoroughly put out he looked at the empty seat beside him and then glared evilly at the one responsible for hurting his friend and causing her to skip two meals in succession the girly haired boy gazed defiantly back at him draco curled his lip oh so now you ve developed a spine eh where was your backbone this morning boot it wasntyou getting blaise out of that mess now was it you didntdry her tears did you are you jealous i ve got the bollocks you lack coward you ll get yours terry boy just you wait terry boy turned back to his dinner apparently realising the impossibility of out staring a slytherin draco sneered at the craven back before picking at his own food once more is blaise okay about this morning malfoy refused to speak to the pug faced daughter of piggy patsy parkinson never tiring of her exercises in futility pansy simpered should i go and try to comfort her inexplicably draco gaze locked with the velvety brown eyes of ginny weasley weaselette didntglare sneer or challenge his stare instead she looked like she admired him enraged by the feeling of warmth that soft approbation gave he rose and disdainfully threw his serviette onto the table he answered pansy question in a carrying voice dripping cold insinuation all the while freezing red melting look with one of ice i ve already comforted blaise earlier probably why she too tired to eat thanks for reminding me pansy it time i go up and comfort her again perversely satisfied by the hurt reflecting in ginny eyes and the sight of three ravenclaws holding back an enraged terry boy he paused by the youth struggling to break free sneering tauntingly draco eyes mocked the other boy efforts to have at him crabbe and goyle lumbered over grins of expectation creasing their broad faces half the ravenclaw quiddich team forcibly dragged boot away slytherin dark laughter caused silly girls to shiver happily sweeping out of the hall minions cracking knuckles in anticipation following behind draco headed toward the kitchen to find his friend something to eat a n eddy and cissy arenteddy and patsy from absolutely fabulous but there are hopefully amusing similarities in characterisation and the gusher was filled with favourite bits of phrases gleaned from the show d chapter 7 black knight striding determinedly down the corridor draco abruptly halted his angry stride and whirled to face his cronies they stopped a few paces behind eyes narrowed in thought he pointed to vincent and ordered crabbe you go to the kitchen and have slinky bring zabini a plate of food his finger stabbed toward the other boy goyle you go to the library and get a book a book gregory thick brows were drawn in confusion draco sighed in exasperation rolling his eyes over the dull tools he was forced to employ he grabbed his quill and a beefy arm pushing up the food stained sleeve he wrote the name of the book directly onto goyle skin saucy tricks for tricksy sorts goyle read carefully how do i find it then you go grab whoever assisting pince and make them find it for you white blond brows rose in mild surprise when draco heard crabbe give the practical advice with a punch to goyle arm for emphasis he said excellent when you re done meet me in the common room we ve got a job to do before my detention this evening is it that ravenclaw are we going to make him not so pretty draco answered goyle and crabbe questions with a curl of his lip grinning like fiends they split up to complete their assigned tasks continuing towards the slytherin common room draco irritably spat out the password echis wondering why snape always had to use greek or latin wasntplain english good enough viper sounded loads better than the greek equivalent last week password had everyone sniggering so hard in the attempt to say polygonom erectum it was a wonder anyone had been able to enter knotweed would have been a big bloody improvement once in the common room he stood by the girls staircase and called get your arse down here zabini blaise appeared at the top of the stairs dressed in a green tee and a pair of denims smiling down at him she quickly descended the steps appraising her face he drawled glad to see today fiasco hasntaffected your looks gee thanks she said before throwing her arms around him in a tight hug you re the best draco and i ll jinx anybody who says differently yeah whatever you d be up against half the school i expect he said dismissively inwardly enjoying the sentiment rude snickering from the doorway announced vincent arrival slinky followed close behind carrying a large tray placing it on a table the elf accepted blaise thanks and draco curt dismissal with a sly smile the couple looked at each other ruefully it was evident slinky couldntwait to get back to the kitchen and tell his fellow elves what he d witnessed shrugging draco pulled his friend down onto the couch beside him and handed her a chicken leg blaise looked taken aback by the quantity of food before her i hope this food not just for me good job crabbe i still starved from missing half of dinner exclaimed goyle lumbering over with a book he handed it to draco and dropped to the floor to join his friend in eating with bare hands while he leafed through the saucy tricks detailed in the book draco was amused by blaise affected disinterest in his reading material he knew she was fighting not to ask him what he was about a sidelong glance caused him to half smile in approval of her ladylike table manners so different from the execrable ones exhibited by the neanderthals on the floor if only they werentso bloody useful exhaling heavily he concentrated on the text for just the right spell honestly you are the most maddening boy thought i was the best zabini he replied without looking up from the tome you are and one of the things you re best at is driving me spare so tell me what you re up to or so help me what you ll jinx when you swore to defend me grabbing the book and flinging it to goyle blaise jumped on draco curious he allowed her to pin him down he regretted the impulse when the girl raised her fingers no i ll tickle you the duo chortled at the sight of a helplessly laughing malfoy they snorted with glee when he turned the tables and tickled the girl in retaliation after calling an unspoken truce the pair sat up and arranged their clothing into a more dignified arrangement snickering to see their audience pouting over the loss of entertainment draco nimbly caught the book cast to him by goyle opened it and tapped a finger on a specific page blaise read the words aloud alopecia extremis is a spectacularly saucy trick to play on an inveterate liar whilst performing the spell a tricksy wizard must persuade the victim to vow to keep a specific promise of his or her own free will afterwards upon breaking the bespelled promise the ensorcelled person will experience total embarrassing hair loss brown eyes widened are you planning to use this on swallowing hard she looked away unable to speak the name the sight made draco even more eager to carry out his unique brand of justice terry boy will be fine if he keeps his promise not to let you down again his smile widened if he doesntstand up for you when he should however all that girly hair will go bye bye crabbe said with relish can we do it now huh can we said goyle draco said that up to zabini mind if we teach your ravenclaw to act like a man if he doesntact cowardly nothing will happen he shook his head blaise nodded solemnly and kissed her defender on the cheek you re a wonderful white knight malfoy abruptly denied it i a black knight more like but i get the job done motioning to the door he waited for his trusty squires to leave before raising blaise hand to his lips in smirking version of a courtly kiss farewell fair maiden before i go are you sure you dontwant me to slay this dragon instead nay sir knight methinks this trick will be more than sufficient pink cheeked she confessed i rather fond of the blue eyed dragon and all that beautiful long hair of his sneering playfully at the daft girl statement the black knight exited the room beckoned his boys and swiftly headed toward the dungeons at the bottom of the staircase he signalled crabbe at the top the large youth would step out of a doorway to follow their prey down the stairs distracting him from sensing the two lying in wait below the bend at the bottom leading to the dungeon corridor was a pool of shadows perfect for goyle to burst out of and surprise the craven dragon his heavily muscled arms would quickly grab the wretch and bring him to meet his fate catching the gleam of goyle large teeth flashing in the darkness malfoy couldntprevent his own wolfish grin from lightening the doorway at an angle from the happy brute waiting was almost as much fun as the actual footsteps echoed on the dungeon stairs the prey was flushed out and headed for the hunters within moments draco faced his captive well well well if it isnt terry boy he said with malevolent satisfaction he removed the other boy wand and tossed it to crabbe goyle had immobilised the ravenclaw by twisting his arms behind his back terry fought being hauled over to draco twisting in a vain effort to escape what re you going to do to me malfoy go on make it your worst but it wontmake me feel any sorrier than i am right now how sorry is that you miserable cretin malfoy wand prodded the teen chin up to meet his glacial stare i know i froze over that gusher i not a slytherin i dontreact quickly but i am smart i learn from my mistakes girly locks sounded sincere but that wasntgood enough talk cheap the boys and i need proof that you re not going to bail on our friend again so you ve got a choice i can let them work you over he paused to let crabbe crack his knuckles and flex his massive fingers before saying or you can willingly promise to never let blaise down again nudging the gormless wonder a bit harder than necessary draco waited for an answer boot flinched in pain i willingly promise to champion blaise zabini against anything and anyone satisfied now what that you re saying malfoy waving his wand in an intricate pattern over the git hair draco taunted i just engaged an alopecia extremis hex if you go back on your word bye bye pretty hair nancy boy explained crabbe with a sneer think zabini would like running her fingers over a bald head wondered goyle in a rare burst of nasty inspiration he let the boy go with a warning shove malfoy nodded to crabbe who threw the confiscated wand like a stick down the corridor toward dungeon five he sneered go fetch terry boy and remember what ll happen if you act the cur again draco watched the retreating figure for a moment and then turned to his companions slapping each broad shoulder he gave the pair a wide smile of approval that had them puffing out their chests in pleasure merlin you two were ace good one goyle about the bald head go grab a couple of butterbeers from my private stock you deserve it chuckling over their hurried clomping up the stairs draco turned to enter snape classroom eager to get to those specimens are we the potions master cool inquiry froze draco in place how much had the professor seen heard if you were you ll have to live with disappointment the fluids do not require replacing so you only have to inventory my collection come along was that a smile twisting the stoic man thin lips draco could hardly believe how brilliant this night had become he entered the dungeon humming the tune spanish guitar luna climbed the stairs to the second floor of the library wondering why ginny needed to research the play even more the essay was only required to be one roll of parchment in length surely she had enough material to write a set of scrolls by now at the top of the stairs she dreamily imagined doing a tango it had looked very romantic she wondered what it was like to dance so close she could feel every inch of harry body what the blazes are you doing luna apparently she had been swaying about in a daydream sighing over the loss of a lovely vision luna pushed her hair back and looked over at the impatiently waiting redhead i was just thinking about that dance i wish i had that sort of nerve nerve is right how dare they cavort around the library they deserved more than three night detention i would ve thought a gryffindor would admire boldness it wasntbold it was brazen luna laughed merrily until the other girl started looking uneasy she said you sound just like your mother ginny was taken aback but quickly recovered and went on the offensive the whole school wouldntbe talking zabini wouldnthave gotten that gusher if those two were behaving properly behaving properly did you get that from granger or was that another phrase you heard from your mum are you implying that i intolerant i ll have you know i thought malfoy was gallant for taking up for blaise but he changed my mind with that filthy mouth of his luna brows contracted in feigned puzzlement when was he filthy i thought it kind of draco to want to comfort a friend comfort oh right we know how a slytherin comforts his girl friends do we did you personally see or hear anything that makes you say that or are you boldly jumping to conclusion like we know gryffindors do ginny freckles stood out starkly against her white face her dark eyes looked haunted luna hoped she hadntbeen too blunt her beatrice might need a kick in the arse but she didntwant it to hurt badly uncertainly ginny asked do you really think i misjudged him it was all too easy to imagine ginny as beatrice saying what fire is in my ears can this be true stand i condemn d for pride and scorn so much the image made luna smile why dontyou talk to malfoy and find out she leaned over the railing to trace the progress of a boy below he stood by the stairs gazing up at the girls talking above detention should be over at nine she added casually over her shoulder before descending and giving harry a misty smile he gave her a friendly nod how it going luna luna enjoyed the confounded expression on harry face when she said while brushing past him getting better all the time harry enter how did professor lorelei know she was hesitating outside blaise wondered if the professor and the potions master had more in common than darkly compelling voices shaking off fanciful thoughts she entered the dungeon classroom lorelei was smiling enigmatically from her seat at her desk but no one else was in the room i sent mr boot on an errand he ll be right back the woman amused voice caused blaise to squirm uneasily what did the professor know in eerie answer to her unspoken question the woman confessed you seemed to be looking for your detention companion if you d like there a basket full of potions that need testing in my storeroom you may bring it out and set the flagons on a table while you wait for his return nodding her agreement the girl headed to the storeroom it was much brighter and airier than snape s no nasty specimens wiggling about in jars either thank merlin blaise picked up the basket noticing a strange tag tied onto the handle it was in the shape of a black scottie dog holding a bone which had second years written upon it shaking her head in amusement she brought it into the classroom and unloaded the contents onto the same worktable she had used last time terry entered the chamber here the potion professor madam pomfrey says it will relieve your headache more effectively if you lie down for an hour after taking it thank you mr boot i believe i ll go along to my quarters and return to check your progress later here a dropper it only takes a drop to test the hair raising solution if your hair rises as if by static mark the student potion as successful happy testing mr boot ms zabini the girl kept her head down rearranging flagons during the professor instructions to terry she felt his presence before he dropped a quill and parchment onto the table gathering her courage she took a deep breath and looked up did you know about malfoy plan for me tonight terry blue gaze was dark and searching yes he nodded before saying i promised willingly i would have even if i d known about the alopecia hex would you her lips pressed together she took the dropper out of his hand dipped it into a flagon and read off rowling jay before offering it to the boy watching her with an earnest expression on his face yes i told malfoy that i was smart enough to learn from my mistakes i ll never let you down again blaise will you forgive me her heart turned over moving close enough to smooth down the fine hairs that had risen in reaction to the solution blaise smiled tenderly of course i will she wound her arms around his neck i never want anything to happen to your gorgeous hair pressing fervent kisses to every inch of skin he could reach terry finally smiled against her mouth and teased it not too girly haired pretty boy for you clenching her fingers in the locks in question blaise narrowed her eyes and warned you know your hair is sexy and you d better not lose it terry my man i won t because i am your man he vowed tightening his embrace terry proceeded to demonstrate his affection so thoroughly they barely had time to test potions before the end of detention what am i doing here why did i listen to loony luna anyway i should leave waiting for me red turning slowly ginny faced the boy lifting a brow with a look of faint inquiry malfoy face when not twisted in a sneer was classically handsome and almost angelic in beauty no wonder he was called a love god his face and form was every bit the pale perfection starry eyed girls sighed over fighting the urge to press her hand against her fluttering middle ginny said bluntly yes all right if you want a chat i ll walk you to your common room i dontwant to talk here i ve already had snape in my business once tonight she walked close enough to smell a faint scent she couldnttell if it was soap or skin but it was really not what she needed to think about changing her mental direction ginny asked impulsively what happened malfoy slanted a look of satisfaction her way the boys and i helped boot learn a lesson about standing up for a friend forcing herself not to boldly jump to conclusions she replied calmly how did you do that he blinked she smiled inwardly somehow a surprised malfoy was as amusing as he was attractive arentyou going to accuse me of every vile deed facts unknown no fine whatever i got boot to willingly promise not to let blaise down again and put a hex on him to fix him good if he breaks it which one he bent his head to look uncertainly at her she must be breaking every preconceived idea of a redheaded gryffindor girl malfoy slight pout made his lips extremely not what she cared to see breaking away from his gaze ginny walked faster he easily caught up alopecia extremis saucy tricks for tricksy sorts she said with a little smile i suppose if anyone knows how proud a boy can be about his hair it you strong fingers encircled her wrist making her halt what that crack mean weaselette pretending not to notice girls sighing over your platinum locks ferret girls do you sigh over my hair too trust a snake to slither out of something only to turn it around on her tugging free ginny started walking even more briskly in your dreams malfoy he caught up to her near the gryffindor corridor moving with that fluid grace she reluctantly admired so much draco manoeuvred her into a corner and placed his hands against the stone on either side of her head she turned her face away from the heated grey stare but it was impossible to forget when his lips were so close to her ear draco murmured do you have the same dreams i do red ones where you and i are a lot more friendly and wear a lot less clothing the feel of his warm lips against her heated flesh was causing the most distressful urge to consume ginny she was a moment away from turning and grabbing the hair that yes damn him to hades she had sighed over and bringing those tormenting lips to hers when an indignant command broke the spell get away from her now malfoy or spend the night in the infirmary cat like he sprang away with a last meaningful glance ginny direction are you okay ginny tried to be grateful to hermione for her interruption it could have been worse ron could have seen her and malfoy in that compromising position she smiled shakily at her rescuer and assured her that yes she was fine and no ronald did not need to hear about this and no she would not like to explain how the situation came about it was over and that was that ignoring hermione patent disbelief ginny followed her into the common room and immediately went up to bed unsure as to whether she did or did not want to dream chapter 8 dancing with faeries trying to avoid gagging from the cloying scent permeating the tower room luna blinked misty eyes that were a by product of her roiling stomach why the professor had to keep the classroom which resembled a twee tea shop so warm and smelly was beyond her swaying slightly in an overstuffed chair she gazed blearily at her classmates as they peered into their teacups luna was not a firm believer in divination she had observed professor trelawney see things in a tea cup crystal ball palm or astrological chart that had never come to pass too many times to count she frowned thinking of times the scatterbrained woman had predicted harry death thankfully none of the grisly predictions had come true although she was sceptic however that didntmean she was going to announce it to the class people still snickered over trelawney prediction that hermione granger most passionate relationship would be with a book luna had no desire to be told her destined mate was a crumple horned snorkack or that her future lover would land them on the front page of the quibbler of course if that lover happened to be the boy who lived shrugging off scrummy fancies she peered into her teacup luna narrowed her eyes as if she really believed her fate could be decided by an arrangement of soggy leaves the girls at her table were peering into their cups avidly they were roommates and the closest she came to having friends the three girls were nicknamed the indies because of their names mindy macdougal bindy brocklehurst and cindy cornfoot blondes of various shades and hair lengths had declared luna an honorary indy they called her lindy much to her outward indifference and inward satisfaction cindy was shaking her pale curls excitedly oh oh oh i see a circle her breathy voice snagged the attention of several boys who would be happy to make her sign of love a reality merlin a cross mindy swept back her shoulder length strawberry blonde hair and impishly sang a few words from a muggle song she listened to at home about being in trouble botheration bloody mermaid again bindy round face under a sandy fringe was set with frustration that must mean something ruinous to my diet will be served at dinner over their shoulders the professor said excellent work girls you re really focusing what little talent you possess to embrace the totality of tasseomancy she pointed what of you ms lovegood my inner eye senses something of great import waiting to be discovered at the bottom of your cup surprising as that may seem luna stretched her stiff lips into a smile trelawney really knew how to get in her little digs suddenly the sympathy she had felt for the woman over last year events evaporated along with any trace of mistiness her eyes were dry as her tone well if you really think so professor perhaps you should read my leaves a sinking feeling overwhelmed the girl as soon as the words left her lips magnified eyes behind oversized glasses lit up in elation oh my heavens oh how rare listen up class pay close attention ms lovegood has a trelawney drew in a breath to announce thrillingly guitar in her cup smiling coyly the dotty witch trilled romance in the future for you ms lovegood any idea who the lucky boy will be giggles snorts and snickers filled air reeking due to an unfortunate combination of scents clutching her stomach luna gasped i think i going to be sick may i be excused the professor hurried to open the trapdoor and waved the nauseous looking girl down the ladder yes yes go on and dontforget your essay on tasseomancy and the warlock convention of 1289 once she was able to gulp uncontaminated air luna felt much better debating whether to go get something from the mediwitch anyway she heard a concerned voice say the divination classroom strikes again i see come along you ll be right as rain in no time professor lorelei swept past and clearly expected her to follow intrigued by the new professor she obligingly trailed along studying the woman profile the professor taught first through third years history of magic and potions so the girl never had the opportunity to talk with her before lorelei was very attractive sometimes when luna had no other romantic dramas to watch unfold around the hall she would observe the staff table to see if anything interesting was happening there there had been a definite pattern of sideways glances between lorelei and snape recently the student had intercepted a covert exchange so heated she had been forced to eat an enormous bowl of double chocolate chip ice cream to cool off how remarkable meal times were these days reaching the professor office luna was engrossed by the yellow washed walls and cushy furniture festooned with little scottie dogs and cherries noticed my interest in the muggle artist mary engelbreit i see have a seat and i ll get a nauseous no more potion out of my drawer i always have a supply on hand specimen jars no need to elaborate drinking a viscous fluid the exact same shade of the cherries painted on the professor desk luna met professor lorelei midnight gaze and said i feel fine now thanks this may sound strange but have we met before the other woman smiled luna could see why snape was sending the professor scorching glances but why the professor thought snape desirable no not officially you did seem to sense my presence on the train a dark brow rose in question yes on the train to hogwarts luna had felt someone looking into her compartment but there had been no one visible in the corridor obviously the woman had been wearing an invisibility cloak lucky you getting to sit with harry turning her thoughts firmly away from the enticing daydream of sitting by harry she stared in disbelief had the professor just asked if she d like to join a group of students on a jaunt into the forbidden forest tonight yes ms lovegood several students serving detention will be helping me pick a unique variety of zalvzianskya capensis tonight i believe you are acquainted with ms zabini mr boot mr malfoy and ms weasley mr potter kindly volunteered to help i am awarding twenty five house points for willing participation you mean we re going to pick faery phlox we re going to see an actual faery ring harry too at the professor nod she blurted wait you said ginny has detention tonight when did she get detention gazing over to a clock in the shape of a scottie dog professor lorelei answered with an enigmatic half smile oh i d say in another two hours and four or five minutes i substituting for professor snape in his afternoon classes he indisposed another two hours did that mean lorelei was going to give ginny detention on purpose how how wonderful luna agreed to meet the group at the side entrance nearest the forest after dinner smiling happily she waved goodbye to the professor who had started grading papers twirling a long strand of hair as she walked toward the main corridor a strange refrain played itself over and over in her mind matchmaking and faeries and harry oh my flouncing into the great hall ginny refused to even glance toward the slytherin table she was very much afraid that if she saw a certain blond adonis smirking she would take her wand and are you going to sit down gin you look rather mental staring off muttering that way ouch what d i do now hermione you re an insensitive boor ronald cantyou see your sister is upset ron immediately asked what was wrong and offered her a goblet of cold pumpkin juice ginny was amused to see him blush when hermione nodded approvingly taking a sip she complained to everyone in the vicinity i thought having lorelei substitute for snape would be the best but she looked away biting off an imprecation that would get her more detention we had professor lorelei too and she was amazing temper subsiding ginny laughed with the others at neville sincere words his round face turned pink quickly applying the third law of thermodynamics he transferred the heat to the boys laughing at his innocent admiration harry and ron think so too i ve heard them say how nice lorelei is and what was that word you guys used oh yeah fit fit something hermione looked ready to throw any moment now light brown eyes narrowed dangerously is that what you said ronald weasley wasntme was harry who said that honest mione he even volunteered to help pick some daft flowers in the forest tonight cause she smiled at him isntthat so harry all eyes turned to the boy closing his eyes he opened them and admitted yeah you blabbermouth but i earning twenty five house points for helping the others are going as part of their detention i one of them the detention group ginny bitterness drew gasps and questions no what happened what d you do ignoring the boys ginny answered hermione question she told me that i earned detention because i was about to add three drops of hellebore instead of two for the draught of peace and i needed to learn to be more careful crikey harry did the same thing and she just smiled at him she did correct me ron so why didntshe give ginny the same treatment admit it harry you re teacher ickle pet ginny reluctantly smiled over the awkwardness of harry position he was chuffed that lorelei liked him but embarrassed that he was earning house points while ginny had detention she noticed colin looking toward the staff table he caught her eye and smiled both snape and lorelei chairs are empty maybe detention will be called off i never that lucky she muttered darkly before topping off her pity party with a peek over at the slytherin table malfoy was eating his dinner with exquisite manners no decent boy ate that nicely it was creepy he smiled at something zabini was saying a real smile that relaxed his face into breathtaking he looked up and met her gaze how did he do that was it some slytherin skill always knowing when someone was staring at you entranced by you flipping her hair back in a gesture that caused the horrid boy to laugh enticingly ginny kept her attention on the conversation at her table and refused to look at that snake or think about his warm lips on her skin or daydream about the two of them walking under a moonlit sky through the forbidden forest really she wasntgoing to spend another second on that gin i concerned about this habit you ve developed talking to oneself is not a good thing creevey blue eyes were round with suppressed mirth he looked worried not one iota huffily ginny retorted you d go round the twist too if you had detention with zabini and malfoy tonight merlin knows what they ll get up to in the forest i wish i could come along do you think if i went round to lorelei office he broke off when ginny shook her head sorry colin the professor told me she only needed six students and i was the last harry broke in to ask who re the others then hello harry luna said from behind them she smiled fingering a silver mandrake pendant i just wanted to come by and tell you how much i looking forward to picking faery phlox tonight isntit interesting how two students from three of the four houses are going terry boot and i you and ginny and blaise and draco i guess hufflepuffs are so well balanced that they dontneed whatever waggling her fingers goodbye luna drifted out of the hall hermione said excitedly faery phlox is a relative of night phlox which i read grows in delicate clusters of white flowers folklore states that if seven supplicants encircle a faery ring in the moonlight the faeries will allow the invisible flowers to burst into sight like a display of fireworks visibly controlling envy she concluded the flowers keep their honey and vanilla fragrance even when picked and are useful in several potions if you want we could go watch from the astronomy tower hermione ron offer caused the girl to forget her disgruntlement you want to go to the astronomy tower with me he shrugged sure you think we ll be able to look into the forest and see that faery ring dontyou hermione nodded even though everyone but ron knew bloody well that it was impossible to see any such thing due to the impenetrability of the magical forest the girl agreed to go to the tower directly after dinner she didnteven mention bringing homework along ron if you cantsee that you and hermione are meant to be after this i am owling fred and george and declaring war brother dear finishing her dinner ginny rose from the table and walked toward the side entrance with harry she could sense no see malfoy and zabini strolling behind them remembering luna mentioning of terry coming along on the outing her spirits unaccountably lifted she looked forward to seeing a real faery ring ginny smilingly quoted for harry a quote she d read in muggle studies i know a bank where the wild thyme blows where oxlips and the nodding violet grows quite overcanopied with the luscious woodbine after admitting she couldntremember the rest of shakespeare words she listened in astonishment to a smooth drawl finish the citation with sweet musk roses and with eglantine there sleeps titania sometime of the night lulled in these flowers with dances and delight what possessed him to spout muggle drivel draco was sure he didntknow unless it was to see the admiration on blaise face she hugged his arm in that effusive way of hers and complimented gorgeous and a genius you make me sad for mere mortals you slytherin god merlin act the black knight once and ever afterwards silly wenches painted everything you did with a rosy glow why hadnthe thought of doing that sooner am i a mere mortal blaise boot asked as he walked up ha jealous terry boy what the matter dontlike hearing your girl compliment the bloke who hexed your girly hair better watch your step in the forest you might just run into something unpleasant out there in the dark zabini the fickle bird hugged draco arm once more before taking herself off to hold boot hand weasley smirked up a storm over that before smiling at perfect potter hero of the wizarding world was she getting a thrill being so close to her crush of second year honestly that potter infatuation had been a transparent rebound from her rejection by him if he d shown up that night in the trophy room the girl would have written that miserable excuse of a valentine poem to a different boy with a malfoy as inspiration she wouldnthave been forced to use pickled toads and blackboards for her exercise in humiliation determined to do the school a favour and prevent such a perversion of poetry from happening again he sauntered up to walk beside the girl he secretly called freckles poor pickled toad eyed potty he looked about as happy as terry boy potter didntlike being ignored the moment someone better came along but draco was doing him a favour really and anyways was it his fault girls found him irresistible maybe he shouldntgloat so openly but he was a malfoy gloating was one of the things malfoys did best he smirked perhaps he d get a chance to show little red what the big bad draco could do even better in some secluded part of the forest have you ever seen a faery ginny question was given a moment consideration no but my mother has she told me listen to the wind rustle it reminds us a faery is near right red ignored potty rude comment to reply if you watch all nature things you might just see a faery wing that what my mum always says by mortal eye unseen they hie from many an airy realm someone named florence harrison said that although daddy claims he said it first loony lovegood had floated up to walk by potty they were the perfect couple loony and potty hilarious draco unconsciously paused with ginny to let the pair walk ahead and followed with blaise and terry bringing up the rear what a bizarre group they were the only redeeming feature was the lack of hufflepuffs who would be trying to organise a sing a long by now rolling his eyes over orphan boy explaining he had grown up with muggles who refused to believe in anything as frivolous as faeries draco glanced at the suspiciously quiet girl by his side do you really think we re going to see faeries why that had slithered out of his mouth was another mystery to add to the growing list i hope so although mum always told us that they hide at the sound of human feet were they actually having a civil conversation a malfoy and a weasley he stopped on the side entrance steps and looked up at the darkened sky amazingly it showed no sign of falling where you believe there is magic you will find it professor lorelei had a velvety dark voice that matched her long black dress and cloak draco open admiration earned him an elbow in the side from weasley the woman continued faeries love glamour pun intended the troop we re about to visit are part of the seelie court which has been described as a host of light and benevolence riding on the night air they are friendly but it is better to be safe than sorry legends about eating faery food and stepping into faery rings have grains of truth i afraid holding up a small jar lorelei pushed back the hair she had let down presumably for the faeries and cautioned pass this about and carefully rub some on one another eyelids is it faery ointment asked luna my father ran a series on the correct ingredients and what happens to wizards who donthave it to help them see things as they really are when faeries use their glamour i hope our forest friends wouldnttreat us so unkindly miss lovegood but rest assured that this mixture of four leaf clovers and other things will protect you as will i headmaster dumbledore joined the group bright eyes twinkling in mischievous glee over the students surprise draco almost had faery ointment placed into his left eye instead onto its lid when he opened his eyes in shock close your eyes malfoy draco glared at ginny imperious tone before complying her fingertips felt soft as butterfly wings he immediately grimaced at the fanciful thought there had better not be any frolicking with bloody faeries because i not dancing with weaselette for all the gold in gringotts unless we had to i mean if dumbledore and lorelei order us to because the faeries demand it or some tosh no not even then even if i stay on detention for the entire year unless your turn to do me malfoy had she really said that the blush highlighting every freckle assured him that she had and now regretted handing him such an opportunity for retaliation deciding to do the unexpected draco ignored the entendre and calmly took the jar waiting for brown eyes to close after a dubious stare ginny closed her lids her mouth parted slightly his lips curved in a predatory smile as he proceeded to use nimble fingertips in a manner that was guaranteed to make a legion of butterflies take flight in little red unsuspecting body blaise smiled dreamily holding hands with terry while the group walked along the edge of the forest she noticed how the ointment green sparkle made her boyfriend eyes look almost teal blue and sighed happily squeezing his hand draco was sneering over her shoulder he d refused to let her and terry boy bring up the rear didntwant terry getting ideas about ravishing his girl in the forest ironically she hadnteven thought about that possibility until her black knight insinuated it in that sinful drawl of his now blaise was becoming obsessed with thoughts of her and terry alone in the woods a sickle for your thoughts she teased mine are worth a galleon at least since they involve you and me and in that case they re not worth a bloody knut zabini terry turned his head to glare at draco which caused his hair to slide over a muscled shoulder blaise resisted the urge to run her fingers through tempting brown strands he caught her eye with a smile that warmed to her toes which were curling in her boots professor lorelei and headmaster dumbledore were leading the procession the students followed behind they walked in near silence except for the occasional taunt by draco to potty or terry boy and their angry replies blaise smiled affectionately draco was so adorable when he smirked she couldntunderstand how ginny resisted him the group stopped before an unusually dense section of the forest and waited after a moment hagrid the care of magical creatures professor and habitual traveller through the forbidden forest emerged from a path now opening in the undergrowth by magic he hailed the group black eyes and white teeth glinting through the shaggy screen of bushy black hair and beard yer looking fair t night lorelei evening dumbledore everybody jovial greetings given hagrid advised spect yer wanting to get to that there faery ring mind you i ve been scouting and the path is alrigh no centaurs round here nothing to harm as long as yeh stay on the path and don be traipsing off i ll be having yer word on tha satisfied with the group assurances the half giant waved farewell and strode off toward his home hagrid words of caution made the adventure even more exciting to blaise she shivered in delight and pressed against terry back the path was too narrow for anything except single file dumbledore now brought up the rear wand at the ready the forbidden forest was lit by the reflection of the blood moon riding high in the sky iridescent insects shimmered amongst the bushes and gave the path a romantic glow entranced blaise smoothed terry hair back to get his attention she pointed to the sky it should be a lover moon before terry could do more than smile dumbledore genial observation travelled up the path june is the month for a lover moon ms zabini which is why so many people wizard and muggle alike join their lives together at that time october moon is one of new goals protection and resolution can anyone give another name for this month moon professor lorelei silken voice carried down the path her question a welcome distraction from blaise embarrassing words draco sniggering did not help his sudden yelp made her smile again hoping that ginny had trod his heel on purpose she was starting to like that feisty gryffindor harry answered falling leaf and hunter moon which were correct of course luna added her knowledge of the phases of the moon and which was best for planting harvesting and divination professor trelawney should be prancing about deliriously tonight then hope we dontcatch sight of her on the way back lorelei droll tone had the students chuckling at the thought the headmaster gently reminded them that the woman had a true if erratic gift and should be accorded the utmost respect a guilty silence befell the group it wasntbroken until they finally reached a clearing and laid eyes upon the faery ring lying deep enough in the forbidden forest to remain undisturbed the small circle was a grassy clearing encompassed by mushrooms and dotted with mosses and tiny flowers fragrant grasses and soft ferns comprised an outer circle around the ring under the moon and the light from dumbledore wand the students and professor lorelei joined hands after being cautioned not to let go unless the professor gave word gripping terry and draco hands blaise breathed in the sweet scents and giddily waited for something to happen lorelei released harry and ginny hands for a moment to place a handful of amethysts on a large flat mushroom inside the ring she explained with a smile faeries like bright stones rejoining the circle she said faeries hide from the world because men hearts have grown cold and few are able to see what is hidden only the magic of love can turn the key that unlocks the gates of the fae so think of those you love as i give the gift of song and we shall unlock this gate together taking a deep breath she sang a lilting celtic sounding tune about an ancient forest and the tales the forest could tell by the second verse blaise noticed a glimmering brightness starting to fill the ring by the third verse flickering lights transformed themselves into dozens of faeries squeezing the hands she held she looked around at her companions they were laughing with joy at the sight of the radiant beings with shining wings the faeries were tiny fair of face and hair wearing gowns or clothing in various shades of green one flew close to her blaise smiled at his resemblance to the slytherin by her side he gave a roguish wink and zoomed off to join the others hovering by the professor and commenting on her dress her hair her song there a sad note in her voice tonight been disappointed by a lover hmmm the knowing voice was felt as much as heard it belonged to the faery who had winked at her donttease puck i ll tease whom i please nyx what brings lorelei why she brought young ones is much more interesting ariella says you shea look faylinn dumbledore here too i see him terrytop blaise became dizzy trying to match names to faery faces and comments they were so different gull and puddlefoot and pinch and trixy were all as bright eyed and playfully curious as kittens puck frowned upon discovering the group was shielded from his glamour by faery ointment shaking his tiny fist at each young one he grumpily sat on lorelei shoulder and wrapped a long spiralling curl around himself he tugged hard and smiled upon hearing ouch s pose you ll be wanting the phlox got a smelly room you want to freshen up the brash fae was zipping about tugging everyone hair and enjoying each expression of pain all eyes turned to lorelei who said simply yes divination tower the professor is finally willing to change to faery phlox due to its helpfulness in expanding sight we humbly brought song and stones to offer in return we accept your gifts and ask for two more first silver puck flew to luna and grabbed her mandrake pendant do you freely offer girl oh yes luna breathed ecstatically to the merriment of the fae who rolled in mid air holding their sides in laughter all of you give us a song and dance and you shall have your phlox and a gift besides we promise no tricks or harm shall befall you puck grinned lorelei looked uncertainly at dumbledore what songs do the students all know the spry wizard smile rivalled the faeries in merriment the school song of course gather your courage pick your partner and your favourite tune let show our fair friends what the people of hogwarts are made of bowing to lorelei he waited for her to put her hand in his blaise watched draco look unexpectedly complacent as he pulled ginny into waltzing position harry and luna followed suit terry smile as he brought her arms up to encircle his neck in a blatant embrace matched puck for impishness his warm strong hands caressing her waist and back were more arousing than anything she had felt before the headmaster baritone blended with lorelei soprano and the rest of the group voices as they started to sing hogwarts hogwarts hoggy warty hogwarts the faeries laughed until they cried at the spectacle before them at the end of the song puck told lorelei with a wide grin here your faery phlox white flowers exploded in like tiny fireworks in air and drifted downward terry fingers tenderly removed a flower from blaise hair and ran the soft sweet petals along her cheeks the girl was so dazed she barely heard puck shout and here your gift faeries zigged and zagged over each of the couples giggling and sprinkling faery dust blaise held onto terry for dear life when they began to rise she soon became accustomed to the airy sensation lorelei and dumbledore drifted a couple of metres off the ground moving in a stately waltz luna and harry floated upwards a few more metres interestingly draco and ginny circled in each others arms considerably higher than the other young couple gazing into terry eyes while faery dust sparkled in his hair and shimmered in the air around them blaise was unsurprised that they alone continued to drift into the canopy alone at last his smiling voice stroked her body surely as his gentle hands dreamily she brushed her fingers through his hair along his face and down his back meeting terry lips the only dance blaise cared about was the one that was as ancient as the forest around them drawn by passion the fae folk came to circle around them mesmerised like moths to a flame wrapped up in the wonder of each other mouths and arms and love the couple was unaware of the passing of time or the slow drift downwards accompanied by the chiming songs and laughter of the faeries blaise only opened her eyes when a puckish voice sniggered in her ear we promised no tricks but if you continue your play in our circle much longer we might be tempted to whisk you away to an enchanted isle across the western sea the disoriented girl wrenched her lips from her boyfriend and pulled him up to sit beside her they were lying on a mound of snow white phlox in the middle of the ring their companions were scooping the flowers into an enchanted bag and grinning like faeries draco with a look that promised his benevolence would only last the night pulled terry and then blaise out of the circle some show you two put on how come you went higher than the rest of us put together languid from the night events blaise thought about draco question while they gathered flowers thanked the faeries and bid them farewell retracing the path illumined by nature and dumbledore wand she waited until they stepped foot once more onto the familiar grounds of hogwarts to whisper her answer never letting go of terry hand love gives you wings with a little help from faery dust a n i do believe in faeries i do i do i also believe in reviewers who kindly share encouragement to paraphrase fleetwood mac you make writing fun and sprinkle faery dust to make me float giddily after every review all the bits about faeries i just liked the old spelling more than the usual one i quoted from unknown sources or piecemealed and paraphrased from loads of online sites why is academic research never as much fun when i have someone to credit like shakespeare or florence harrison i do so but all i can offer the unknown persons i quoted are heartfelt thanks they were probably women from the days when female writers were known only as a lady we ve come a long way baby chapter 9 getting closer love gives you wings with a little help from faery dust walking back to the castle blaise sickeningly sweet answer to his question of why she and boot had floated higher than the other couples echoed in draco head love zabini in love a few weeks ago she barely knew terry boy was alive and now she in bloody love gobshite faery dust and vows of eternal devotion have melted your mind woman jealous that zabini has a new boyfriend scowling draco looked back to where stolen kisses and gooey looks were being exchanged by the couple in question meeting ginny level gaze the boy surprised himself by asking honestly do you believe in love at first sight sure the french call it coup de foudre all it takes is two willing hearts he scoffed well i not willing to be struck by idiocy even if blaise seems to be enjoying it immensely and no i not jealous she free to see any pretty boy she likes how generous of you ignoring the impertinent tone he drawled i think so i could break them up if i wanted to smirking he added hope boot doesntmind blaise running whenever i call maybe he won t if you stop running your hands all over his girlfriend jealous i run my hands over somebody other than you his lips curved upwards in satisfaction when she couldntchoke out a coherent reply to that the reaction was quite amusing and intriguing he disregarded the thought that he was more comfortable analysing her motivations than thinking about his own freckles looked very fetching in the moonlight and they had ascended higher than almost everyone else around the faery ring that was all the proof draco needed to confirm ginny had a massive crush on him he decided provoking her into admitting her feelings would be a welcome distraction from the stomach turning love birds cooing behind them since she was so easy to bait he started by raising an insolent brow and matching it with a stare that coolly raked its way up and down ginny body when he smiled suggestively the redhead temper ignited you re disgusting malfoy i wouldntwant your filthy hands on me if you were the last boy at hogwarts in the universe if the choice was you or a flesh eating slug suppressed laughter brought draco attention to the group around them they d reached the side entrance but he and red had been bickering too intensely to notice he saw the headmaster smile in an irritatingly knowing way and scowled to think he d begun to doubt father claim that dumbledore was the worst thing to happen to hogwarts sorry ginny but hagrid just got rid of the flesh eating slugs they were ruining the castle gardens so you re left with malfoy i afraid loony luna didntsound afraid she sounded amused in that distant way of hers he considered the ravenclaw she always looked remote and otherworldly but he d ask blaise what she thought of girl they had moronic muggles together loony might be someone who needed watching especially if she was getting close to potty draco pretended not to notice ginny glaring at him when he readily agreed to lorelei request that they keep the details of this night events to themselves he smiled charmingly at the professor just to hear the girl teeth grind dumbledore directed the students to disperse to their separate common rooms before following the professor and seconding her cheerful goodnight terry going to uh walk me back to slytherin see you draco he couldntlet the starry eyed couple off that easily our common room the other way blaise the silly girl accepted a flower boot plucked out of her short curls and presented like a bouquet of bloody roses with a smile murmuring we re taking the long way terry boy threw a smug look over his shoulder before carrying blaise off for some snogging and groping along deserted corridors draco almost hoped filch or his cat mrs norris caught the pair making out almost he still wanted help manoeuvring ginny into declaring her hopeless affection over hogsmeade weekend after that however he d suggest the trophy room as an excellent place to rendezvous poor malfoy girlfriend thrown him over and now he left all alone weasley taunt would ve been much more effective if potter had hung around to escort her safely back to gryffindor as it was whilst she d been watching the scene with blaise unfold not so perfect potter had allowed lovegood to finesse him into accompanying her back to ravenclaw house so here they were a hungry snake alone with a little red birdie whatever should he do draco eyes became hooded as he smiled in a way that brought an alarmed expression to a pretty face lowering his voice he insinuated darkly all alone except for you red what are you going to do now run malfoy laughed as she fled calling running only makes the predator that much more intent on bringing down his prey little bird heart pounding she ran faster listening to the footsteps whose echoes travelled up the corridor to reach her frantic ears he said slow down you know you want to turn around and look me in the eye little bird just stand there and wait for the big bad snake to get you merlin he even sounded sibilant never she shouted reaching within for a burst of speed as though he were through playing malfoy steps quickened from a lazy jog to a run ginny mind raced how would she get away even if she wanted to a small inner voice coaxed her to give up give in and let him devour her denying the traitorous impulse the breathless girl came to the main corridor and contemplated her three options she could run up the stairs and assuredly be caught she could run down the steps leading to the dungeons and hope that one was unlocked so she could hide there all night if she had to hair fanning out wildly ginny shook her head against the image of being trapped at the end of a dungeon corridor with draco coming toward her electrified into action she chose option three running through the entry and hiding in the great hall eventually she could work her way to a staff entrance and escape back to her house slipping into the hall ginny carefully closed the door and tiptoed inside the magicked candles were doused but the enchanted ceiling lit the chamber with a dim celestial light sliding under the slytherin table the last one malfoy would expect her to choose she began to crawl from one end to the other on hands and knees she gave silent thanks to whichever elves had cleared away all the debris from dinner hearing the door creak open she froze soft footsteps reverberated in the silent chamber her pursuer had sauntered inside an ominous click echoed in the shadow filled room hear that little bird i just shut the doors and they wontopen without my specific counter spell so you may as well come out come out from wherever you are without the distraction of draco masculine beauty ginny was hit with the full force of his mesmerising voice it wrapped itself around her like black silk smoothly stroking her senses until the girl clasped a hand over her mouth to keep from breathing audibly pressing her lips together she forced herself to continue crawling toward the end of the table her tormentor spoke again really worked up a sweat running up and down those stairs think i ll take off these robes and cool off the whisper of fabric brought incredibly disturbing mental images what did his body look like was he wearing black perhaps a black silk shirt to match his voice contrast with his porcelain skin and white blond hair ginny had noticed draco resemblance to that faery puck floating in his arms she had almost moved to touch his lips with hers only indignation over his roving hands had prevented her from making the mistake trying to scrape up some of that former anger she found just enough to propel her into movement once more not wanting to talk yet well that alright birdie think i like slithering around in the dark trying to hear you breathe feel the heat radiating off your skin is it as exciting for you as it is for me ginny had to stop and cover her face again damn that malfoy and his tempting voice trying to lure her out so he could she resolutely ignored her insides treacherous melting and the beguiling image of what would happen if she d just slip out and place herself into draco clever hands midway down the table she halted when his drawl sounded closer than ever not under the hufflepuff table i ve walked the length and no little bird was flushed from cover will you be under gryffindor no you re a bold one arentyou red no hiding behind your house for you which table did you choose then ravenclaw probably wiser but i think i know you know you d think slytherin would be the last table i d check lumos like the bird he d called her ginny had been paralysed by the sound of that silken voice drawing ever closer by the time he said lumos and the wand illuminated his captivating face she was ready to end the suspense relieve the tension shhh draco murmured urgently surprising her by sliding under the table pulling in the bench and using his wand to perform a charm i ve put an obfuscation charm on us someone coming i didntreally put a spell on the doors and we dontwant to be found like this do we they were lying on their sides under the table ginny back was cradled against draco chest instinctively her fingers had automatically clutched his sleeve when he whispered in her ear oh gods it is black silk a voice echoing from the entrance said professor snape mrs norris heard somebody in here snape oh merlin does he mind slytherins going at it under the table not that we re doing any such thing but if caught everyone will say that what we were up to wontthey thank the stars draco covering my mouth with his hand i think i would be whimpering now that i hear snape prowling around hmmm malfoy skin smells good how does it taste mmm salty ginny impulsive decision was answered by a promise breathed so faintly she had to strain to hear two can play that game red restlessly moving in helpless response to the exploration of her ear and neck by draco lips and tongue she barely heard snape tell filch at the door i found a male student robes i ll take them into custody until i discover the owner whom i am positive left this room as soon as he heard our voices sure he gone are you and not hiding with some girly are you implying my inspection of the chamber was not thorough perhaps you could do it better no then i suggest you search the dungeons in case some misguided youth and his girly are hiding there snape sardonic voice drifted away with filch abject apologies following draco rolled onto his back and draped a forearm across his eyes ginny rolled over on her stomach beside him propping herself up to ask do you think he knows he knows didntyou hear those emphasised words of his and filch being banished to the dungeons my initials are monogrammed on the inside of my collar ginny he doesntknow who i in here with but he knows it me alright she grimaced in sympathy lowering his arm draco saw her expression and said ruefully merlin our little game got out of hand didntit i just wanted to give you a bit of a jolt not scare you to death or get us expelled weaselette i prefer to be called ginny draco his smile flickered briefly i can try but i not promising it ll seem bizarre after calling you everything except that red she moved closer his eyes widened hold on what do you think you re doing ginny leaned over him sliding her fingers through platinum strands to position his mouth for her kiss the feel of his lips was just as tantalising as she had hoped and feared smiling into shocked gray eyes she jibed i just wanted to give you a bit of a jolt ferret not scare you to death attempting to move away she gasped when he stopped her his hand reached up to play with her hair and then cupped her face draco wicked smile was one she looked forward to seeing in her dreams give us another jolt ginny boy who lived dances with faeries wouldntdaddy sell papers like fizzing whizzbies with that headline not that i ll ever tell him some things daddy just doesntneed to know walking beside the famous harry potter luna decided that he was even more interesting than she had previously thought although he faced danger bravely harry was very nervous around girls he was constantly trying to smooth down his hair and barely able to keep eye contact for more than a few moments at a time knowing how awkward it was to feel out of place she would never force the bashful boy to take her to a tea shop like that mis sorted cho had she d suggest the bludger make him comfortable and make him hers the phrase sounded like an advert for some product in the quibbler but it made perfect sense to luna harry wasntone of those self assured types like draco he didntlook in the mirror and say i am a love god to be fair she didntthink malfoy did either but he did look as though he would and if he had a talking mirror it would constantly tell him how gorgeous he was smiling at the thought the girl wondered if she d like an enchanted mirror to talk to or if it would make her roommates think she was even loonier a brief touch on her arm made luna realise harry had been speaking whilst she was thinking and staring at his lips again thankfully he was kind enough to repeat the question do you know why everyone floated at different heights luna she began to twine a long strand of hair around her finger why do you think harry well perhaps the faeries sprinkled more dust on some people faeries can play favourites everybody knows that she agreed any other ideas he frowned thoughtfully it was cute maybe maybe the more romantic a couple was the higher but then why would ginny and malfoy levitate more than us i like you but they cantstand each other hearing harry say that made her brain go fuzzy they can t luna it malfoy we re talking about here ginny would never like that slimy git she was still dazed over hearing him say he liked her she wouldn t no i mean she has been acting a little mental talking to herself and she does glare at malfoy but that cause she doesntlike him right you like me harry luna knew she should probably try and convince him that ginny and draco were meant to be but somehow everyone else romantic dramas didntseem near as important as hearing harry say he liked her yeah sure you re easy to talk to i like you the most interesting boy with the most beautiful green eyes in the school ran his hand over his hair before meeting luna misty gaze make him comfortable do you have any plans for lunch hogsmeade weekend he answered warily probably go to the three broomsticks with ron and hermione like usual why oh i was just wondering if you and ron and hermione of course would like to try a new restaurant with me it called the bludger and its all quidditch his frown smoothed out ron was talking about it at dinner we could do that i suppose meet you there at noon harry was backing away why hadntshe mentioned the latest conspiracy daddy had uncovered or walked a little slower ah well she had saturday to look forward to didntshe raising the hand that had a finger wrapped in hair she waved noon yes see you harry admiring the deep shade of purple that reminded her of one of her jumpers luna freed her tingling digit and thought of another headline gorgeous teenaged survivor of you know who attack makes casual date with luna lovegood returning to her dorm she quietly sang hogwarts hogwarts hoggy warty hogwarts lounging on a wide hammock blaise watched the setting sun paint the sky with breathtaking pastels sliding a long bare leg down to the white sand she lazily nudged the hammock into motion gently swaying her gaze was drawn to a swimmer making his way to shore terry stood in the azure shallows raising his hands to slick back long wet hair admiring the lean muscular body walking towards her blaise breathed in the scent of exotic flowers and the enchanted ocean when he reached the hammock she pulled her lover down to lie beside her lightly tanned masculine hands stroked soft curves while slender golden fingers caressed firm paler flesh the hammock rocked as mouths and hearts merged oh terry she sighed blaise he answered softly before the hammock began to rock violently blaise zabini wake up this bloody minute or you re going to miss your first class the rocking hammock of her dream dissolved into the reality of fiona flint and morrigan macduff standing on each side of her four poster bed shaking the mattress bolting upright blaise threw a pillow at fiona auburn head and groused couldntyou give me five more minutes you heartless witches i was having the best dream catching the pillow her friend tossed back to her the girl hugged it and said dreamily terry and i were together on a hammock on the enchanted isle of the faeries we heard oh terry oooohhhh teased the black haired morrigan all alone on an enchanted isle were you two being naughty asked fiona seeing blaise blush she crowed oh merlin you were doing her best mcgonagall impersonation she said severely come along ms macduff delicate ears should not be sullied with the sordid details of lurid dreams i want to be sullied i demand to be sullied what is sullied exactly morrigan laughed i ll tell you while we pick out her clothing she needs to get her arse in gear and take a shower dashing for the loo on the way to the shower blaise grinned she d be more than happy to have that dream every night for the rest of her life all during the day she looked forward to being with terry and sharing her dream to her intense dismay the ravenclaw and slytherin sixth years didnthave any combined classes scheduled blaise eyes automatically scanned the corridors between every class but she never caught a glimpse of her long legged long haired gorgeous guy lunch was frustrating she d been running late due to being waylaid by her partner in matchmaking luna had dragged her off to the newly moustachioed statue of gregory the smarmy to share her thoughts and plans about harry potter of all people refraining from grimacing or making one of the many sarcastic comments that came to mind blaise had agreed that asking potty erm potter to lunch at the bludger was indeed inspired rushing into the hall she d met terry who was just on his way out with the ravenclaw quidditch team hi blaise the guys want me to explain a new strategy i ve developed for the next game he smiled regretfully boot here brilliant at tactics one of the quidditch players boasted terry brilliant at lots of things she drawled reaching out to smooth a strand away from her boyfriend face smiling she waved farewell leaving a stunned group of athletes behind her dropping onto the bench beside draco she ate a sandwich without enthusiasm ignoring his amused scrutiny for someone who floated high last night you sure look low now yeah i so low i should be under the table draco sprayed a mouthful of pumpkin juice directly into parkinson pug face he started to cough pounding her watery eyed mate back blaise regained her humour and her appetite that evening she picked at her dinner frustrated at not being able to connect with terry all bloody damn day what did she have to do to get a moment alone with her boyfriend the sight of pale elegant fingers reaching for a bowl of chocolate mousse gave her a mouth wateringly wicked idea aut inveniam viam aut faciam what that you re blathering blaise zabini family motto i will either find a way or make one i about to live it returning draco smirk the girl went over to the ravenclaw table and slid into the vacant spot beside terry he smiled bemusedly as if wondering what she was up to winking she said playfully i ve come to get what i want for dessert terry silently offered his dish of mousse reaching out a slender hand blaise wiped a speck of chocolate from his lips and brought the finger to her mouth blue eyes darkened when she slowly sucked the mousse off while making a mmmm sound want some more his husky voice carried the students around the couple hushed agog at the spectacle before them undoubtedly the shock would soon wear off and word would travel up and down the table before spreading to every house blaise couldnthave cared less she rose and gave terry a look heavy with promise bring the bowl forget the spoon the personification of lean and hungry lunged off the bench snatching his neighbour uneaten dessert terry encircled blaise wrist with eager fingers and dragged her swiftly from the hall a n the lean and hungry description is from shakespeare julius caesar had to get the bard in somewhere this chap and i dontthink blaise minds that such men are dangerous do you lol how lovely to be dangerously in love
