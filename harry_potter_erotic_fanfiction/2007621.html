queen who loved each other very much though often reserved and cold the king and queen were respected by all they were extremely wealthy and were at peace with all other kingdoms the kingdom was truly a joyful place adding to the kingdom joy a prince was born draco was welcomed into the kingdom with great cheer for he was sure to follow in his parents footsteps and continue on with their peaceful existence the kingdom was overcome with happiness but no one was happier than king lucius or queen narcissa celebrations and grand balls were held kingdoms from far far away came to celebrate the birth of prince draco and offer him gifts but unnoticed to all eyes one man did not celebrate lord riddle none other than the king most trusted advisor lord riddle jealousy of the king had grown throughout his years of service but he patiently waited for years he knew that it was destiny to kill the king and queen and then assume his rightful place as king then the brat was born and ruined his plan if lucius and narcissa died the prince would get the throne this would not do lord riddle now needed to kill the brat as well but his desire for the spoilt prince suffering was stronger than his desire to become king quickly riddle was a patient and cunning man so a plan was formed he waited fourteen long years the prince had grown up to be a handsome young man and the object of much affection which only fed his arrogance lord riddle had no patience for the child selfishness and vanity in public or in front of his parents lord riddle watched as the prince acted as if he was the image of innocence as soon as he was alone with riddle he was nothing less than the spawn of evil prince draco enjoyed tormenting lord riddle playing practical jokes on him and annoying him to no end everyone else in the castle however much to lord riddle disgust thought it was amusing and were constantly entertained the queen would laugh with her private servants at her son antics although draco was very good at maintaining appearances and propriety as befit his royal stature lord riddle could see with vivid clarity the obviousness with which prince draco despised every minute with the commoners lord riddle could see right through the prince charming facade any being of lower rank was not worth his energy lord riddle knew this because he felt the same way surviving fourteen years with the brat seemed impossible not only was lord riddle the most frequent victim of the brat pranks but he was also forced to serve the prince every need as if he were no more than a servant he lord riddle trusted advisor to king lucius and queen narcissa it was an outrage lord riddle was furious but like the prince he too was a skilled actor he hid his true thoughts and continued to serve the prince as thought it were his highest honor the only thing that helped him through the years was the thought that he would someday rule the kingdom even better was the thought of strangling the brat with his own hands feeling the spoilt prince gasp for breath under his fingers lord riddle could only hope for something as satisfying as that only hope and wait now the prince was coming of age where he could rule and lord riddle desire for the prince to suffer only grew more and he knew just the way to make him do so lord riddle found that he could not kill the king and queen on his own he d be discovered and all things he had worked so hard for would be out of his grasp he searched for someone who could complete the task for him when he found a witch who was willing to help him he felt as if the long years were worth while not more than a month after the witch was secretly hired the king and queen mysteriously fell ill the entire kingdom grew grave and sorrowful any happiness that the kingdom still possessed was gone when the king and queen quietly passed away the prince and now the new soon to be king and ruler of his kingdom who was already greatly depressed for the illness of his beloved parents sank deeper into darkness he locked himself in his large sleeping chamber and refused to talk to anyone even those closest to him he did not listen to any person that tried to visit them whether they were there for business matters concerning the kingdom or consolation purposes many left the kingdom and traveled south to neighboring villages to the south some left because the kingdom just wasntthe same and felt no reason to stay others believed that the prince though respected was not of age nor capable of ruling lord riddle was not discouraged by the drop of the population there were still people he could rule just not as many as the royal malfoys had the witch was not pleased with the results of the curse put on the king and queen and was furious with lord riddle she accused him of tricking her and that he was insane with jealousy she would not complete her duty by killing the prince as previously agreed outraged lord riddle killed the witch and searched for a new one all he found however was a beautiful young gypsy named sybill trelawney who had just arrived from a foreign land she knew nothing of the kingdom or the prince lord riddle thought this was all too good to be true until the gypsy clumsily explained in her cryptic tones that she would do no curse unless she was given an honorable purpose very much annoyed and impatient lord riddle wanted nothing more than to kill the gypsy like he did the witch but he was desperate and eager to kill the prince and the gypsy was his last hope lord riddle told the gypsy that draco the soon to be king was shallow and arrogant that he treated all others with the utmost disrespect and that he was cruel and too proud for his own good he did not deserve to sit upon what was once his father throne for he had a heart colder than ice and could care less for the people who loved him dearly the prince was selfish spoilt and unkind all in all lord riddle had spoken the truth and had merely exaggerated and enhanced his story where he saw fit he also conveniently forgot to mention that prince draco had loved his parents dearly lord riddle decided that she did not need to know of that detail the young gypsy was convinced that the prince needed to be taught a lesson not a lesson that one would learn using the mind but the heart as her plans deviated from what she expected lord riddle had in mind the gypsy kept her thoughts secret lord riddle was meanwhile extremely pleased that prince draco would be taken care of he was a little disappointed that he wouldntbe the one to kill the brat himself but the sooner draco was dead the better more and more people were leaving the kingdom it seemed that all at once the people residing in the castle composed the majority of the kingdom prince draco did not know this he only left his chamber twice since his had parents died a month before unbeknownst to lord riddle the gypsy conducted her own investigations she learned that the prince was a recently orphaned fourteen year old boy who just had the responsibility of a kingdom thrown upon him she saw that the poor boy was in mourning and that he was only a mere child who knew close to nothing of responsibility or duty honor and loyalty yes but being responsible no the prince had probably gotten everything his heart desired from the day he was born sybill knew that lord riddle carried a grudge of some sort for the prince what this was she did not know nor did she know the details of the deaths of the king and queen she did know however that the prince truly was everything the lord has described him as when she looked into her crystal ball and saw prince draco she could sense the sadness and iciness of his heart she saw what he was capable of and feared for not only his life but also the lives of people around him this child was truly cold and uncaring the sorrow and love that he felt for his parents was now replaced by bitterness and anger he was arrogant and ignorant proud and selfish what he was like before the mysterious deaths of his parents she did not know but that draco was gone now nothing good could come of a lonely and angry child having so much power the gypsy realized that the people of the kingdom must have sensed this and fled to other kingdoms the gypsy decided what she needed to do although many lives might be taken it was far from the amount that would be lost if the prince were to grow up as he was now she told the lord that on the night of the next full moon the prince that he knew so well would die lord riddle was extremely pleased and impatiently waited five days for the full moon to rise the gypsy was purposefully vague of course lord riddle assumed that the king soul would leave his body he never expected what was really to happen on the night of the full moon lord riddle was quietly preparing himself for his new role as king by sitting on the throne for several hours servants bustled about cleaning the primary chef was gloomily cooking painters were painting and everyone was going about their normal business the prince was emerging from his chambers more and more yet he still had not had his official celebration to announce him as king therefore on the next day the official coronation was going to be held the servants hopes seemed renewed the majority of the servants were currently in the grand ballroom getting everything ready for the prince celebration when the prince suddenly barged into the large ballroom at quarter past eleven catching the servants by surprise the prince looked dazed and lost and confused as if he didntknow where he was or who he was staggering to the center of the ballroom his eyes stared mistily in front of him concerned the servants cautiously approached the prince before he clutched his head in agony without warning a large dark gray cloud in the night sky slowly drifted to the side revealing a giant white orb glowing among the stars the servants watched horror as they saw the prince before them transform into one of the most terrifying beasts known to mankind the future king had transformed into none other than a werewolf there were deafening screams of fear as people fled for their lives the prince was no more than a hungry killing machine pursuing them primitively lord riddle was seated in the throne room sitting on his throne happily waiting for the brat to die when he heard the commotion coming from below him in the great ballroom he quickly ran to the source of the noise his eyes widened in disbelief at the scene that played before him at first he thought his eyes were deceiving him but after a few moments realization dawned he found himself staring at a werewolf tearing apart a poor servant in the kitchen his first instinct was to scream but his voice failed him the next thought was to run seeing as the beast had suddenly noticed lord riddle standing before him motionless and was beginning to advance upon him he started to back away slowly his legs failing him as well when he noticed the odd color of its eyes usually a werewolf eyes were bright yellow but this werewolf had blue eyes the color was such a pale blue that it didnteven seem to be that color it was as if its eyes were almost gray almost transparent lord riddle had unfortunately seen those eyes for many years and he knew them very well enough to recognize them anywhere even when they belonged to a monstrous beast only one person had eyes such as this draco lord riddle was at first frozen in shock then he swelled with anger he fled from the kitchens as the werewolf chased after frightened servants into the ballroom he regained his common senses and sped through the mob of screaming people running in all different directions to find the gypsy he searched the whole castle but she couldntbe found many people died that night and all those living outside the castle were now gone as soon as screams could be heard from the castle they didnthesitate to gather their things and flee all respect and loyalty to the royal family was gone finally the moon went down and the sun began to rise werewolf draco was about to slash a servant to bits when he clutched his head in pain again only this time no physical transformation took place he blinked slowly and groggily as if he had just woken up from a peaceful nap he staggered back in shock as he looked down disbelieving at his bloodstained paws draco was no longer the handsome young man of the royal family noticing that somehow draco seemed to have regained his mind lord riddle staggered into the great ballroom where draco stood frozen staring at his bloodied paws lord riddle yelled and shouted in frustration draco was supposed to be dead not running around murdering his soon to be subjects draco did nothing but stare at his paws lord riddle screamed at draco questioning to no one in particular as to why he was still alive draco still stared the remaining residents of the castle gathered up their courage and watched the two in the ballroom from behind large objects and through cracks in doors suddenly the gypsy appeared out of no where lord riddle demanded to know why draco was still among the living sybill said that she had never intended to kill him only teach him a lesson draco attention was quickly averted to the gypsy and he was not at all happy draco with tiny traces of the true werewolf instincts inside him was about to reach out to slash her to bits but his slowly recovering human nature realized that he was covered in quite enough blood instead he demanded to know what she was talking about half surprised that he could speak coherently but was startled at his new booming voice the gypsy calmly stated that she never intended to kill him as lord riddle had originally hired her for she had sensed evil in lord riddle aura much longer before she ever sensed anything bad in draco it was not hard to see that lord riddle was bitter and had extreme grudges carried around with him lord riddle snarled as he lunged for the gypsy pulling out a knife as he was in mid air draco having learnt of this new piece of information currently so confused and angry at everything and anything that he didntcare if it was true or not leapt towards lord riddle pushing him away from the gypsy who stood calmly as if she expected draco to do that in the first place draco grabbed the knife from the lord and held it high over the lord chest lord riddle was bleeding from draco claws clutching him tightly and his head was bleeding from a hard contact to the marble floor when draco shoved him out of the way blood was starting to fill his mouth and his eyes were starting to roll backwards he told draco that he had attempted to murder him and that he was sorry that he never succeeded he was extremely glad however that he at least killed the king and queen hearing those words draco brought the knife down into lord riddle dying heart and took satisfaction when lord riddle eyes lolled back and were closed with heavy lids lord riddle desire to become king had never been fulfilled the desire to make prince draco suffer dearly however was a rather large consolation prize as his life came to an end draco dropped the knife to the floor and stood above lord riddle still motionless figure he stood there staring at lord riddle for several minutes then he let out a gut wrenching roar his furry arms raised over his head in anger and pain it echoed through the hallways of the castle and out into the early dawn the residents of the castle who were watching stepped back in shock and fear but did not flee the gypsy however stood exactly where she had for the past several minutes not flinching or moving in the slightest draco quickly turned his icy blue gaze on the gypsy he demanded to know what she had done to him the gypsy carefully stepped towards the beastly prince i am sorry for what you will go through your majesty i truly am but this is for your own good you can never truly live in happiness until you have learnt to love and be loved again on the third full moon after your seventeenth birthday the moon will shine brighter than ever before it is until then that you have a chance to break the spell this curse is irreversible the spell can only be broken when you have learned to respect others lower than your self and love someone for who they are and they as well if you do not you shall remain in the body of a werewolf complete with a werewolf mind the occurrences of this past hour are what you will have to look forward to should you fail if you do fall in love however and manage to find someone who shall love you also you will return to your human body as it will be at the age of seventeen in order to keep you company because i do feel great sympathy for you i shall cast a spell on all those who reside here at the castle they will return their human bodies only if you are human as well if you are to turn into a true werewolf for all of eternity they will cease to show any human qualities they might have already possessed i assume you d confine yourself to this castle being what you are therefore as a window to the outside world i shall give a magical mirror containing one of your most faithful servants this mirror will show you anything you ask whether inside this castle or beyond it remember the third full moon after you ve reached the age of seventeen it will shine brighter than ever before and with that the gypsy disappeared as quickly as she had come the servants were pulled with a strong invisible force into the grand ballroom they were held in midair as colorful lights and sparks danced around them in the sudden wind that held them prince draco watched in horror as they too began to transform he watched his favorite chef become nothing more than his beloved cauldron and the primary artist become a paintbrush other servants became things such as dressers armoires broomsticks and the like these objects contained certain human qualities they could walk and talk but they were in the forms of what were supposed to be inanimate objects then finally he saw one particular servant become a magical mirror just as the gypsy had told him her true human form was visible in the mirror but when she put her hands upon the glass she was trapped behind it the kingdom no longer had a shining castle nor a handsome prince it was no longer a joyful place with a lovely king and queen the skies were no longer always blue and peaceful the palace being surrounded by many woods and forests was soon forgotten by many in the villages and towns nearby it soon became nothing more than a myth the tragic tale of a prince who lost everything and still awaited someone to come to the castle to break the spell but the prince had lost all hope and fell into despair for who could ever love a beast i didntwant to copy the movie lines

specified and i not making any profits from this fan fiction an 4 21 2011 i sorry for the long span of time in between these last updates i leave for peru on may 16 so i want to try my best to get out as many chapters as possible before my departure i wontbe back until late june so here hoping as always please feel free to drop any thoughts comments or suggestions in a review i always feel more inspired when i hear what people think about how it going so far also as for the title of this chapter there are subtle implications about the specific word choice which can be determined from the information below from col lab o rate verb used without object 2 to cooperate usually willingly with an enemy nation especially with an enemy occupying one country thanks well done hermione well done hermione was not unused to the blackness of night that came with living so near to a forest in the outlying countryside nor was she unused to the soft dissonance of the wandering critters tracing patterns on the walls mcgonagall and her merry band of trinkets had done their best to provide her with comfort in the dankness of her cell and her limbs were rather warm under her mound of blankets despite the inevitable draft these matters were appreciated by hermione in the strongest sense of the word but they were far away from her current train of thought bloody well done i need to find a way to contact the others she said to herself trying to drown out the sounds of dripping and crawling i wouldntdare ask them to come look for me but i need to let them know that i am safe hermione hugged her knees closer to her chest deep in concentration but how and who were those men in the forest what was it that they were looking for hermione a voice startled her from her bitter thoughts and she cleared her throat to hide her previous daze blaise her voice had gone ragged from the night events but her concern leaked through what are you doing down here i just wanted to come look after you is all hermione frowned as he slid through the rusting bars of her prison cell what time is it you know he ll punish you if he sees you lingering oh bollocks he wontbother to check besides it been hours it nearly dawn still oh i wouldntworry about my safety dear hermione he said as he hopped to her side she gave him a dubious look honestly when it comes right down to it the master temper is no match for my bravery he waggled his eyebrows but the impact of the statement was lost in the small cough that escaped from his lips afterward indeed hermione lip twitched into a near smile despite her exhaustion which is why you handled yourself so handsomely earlier this evening while we were backed into the corner of that parlor a facade i assure you it wouldntsit well within the castle hierarchy to have two alpha males now would it i suppose not of course not besides bravery is nothing compared to cunning and i have plenty of that to spare with a mischievous grin blaise winked at the girl buried in the mountain of comforters who rolled her eyes but smiled in spite of herself i ll be sure to keep that in mind for next time next time blaise eyed her in half jest half wonder do you make putting yourself in danger a habit milady hermione expression quickly darkened and she leaned back against the unforgiving expanse of the stone wall behind her only just as of recently she admitted who were those men in the forest the thought struck again could they have perhaps been looking for me what have i really lost tonight well my dear hermione i assure you that if trouble making is what you aim for then look no further for an accomplice hermione watched him make an impressive bow and smiled softly once more subduing her persistent questions i appreciate your assistance blaise she laughed quietly but i actually hoping to retire from this lifestyle as soon as possible blaise eyed their surroundings with a critical eye holding his gaze on one of the more intricate spider webs in the corner i understand your hesitation he said shifting away from a rodent that scurried about in the corner but just as well please know that my aid criminal or otherwise is always at your beck and call goodness hermione mused offers of collaboration in crime dexterity in cunning mentions of experience with services of a more physical nature you really do live a devious life is there anything that your impeccable morals wontallow you to do physical blaise piped just what are you oh oh you wouldnthappen to be referring to the conversation that dean and i were sharing just yesterday morning would you about me exchanging things and services hermione smiled playfully perhaps mortified blaise wax features contorted which hermione found all the more amusing i thought you d forgotten look here hermione just let me explain i promise that under no real circumstances pipe down mr zabini called madam mcgonagall as she rounded a corner i do not wish to know the explicit details of how you choose to spend your free time which you should know i beginning to believe you have entirely too much of hermione hid her smile with her hand as blaise sheepishly turned to the wall and proceeded to mock his superior with every ounce of his stealth abilities when her hand rested at her chin however hermione smile transformed into an abrupt and harrowing cough my dear you are not faring well mcgonagall was at hermione side in an instant watching with immense disapproval as hermione steadied her chest with her free hand it seems i have something lodged in my throat hermione rasped ignore the burning sensation she felt at her neck nonsense mcgonagall cut in you re growing ill the master should never placed you here let alone forced you to stay down here for this long thank goodness he finally came to his senses and alerted me to release you release me another cough indeed mcgonagall lips pursed we need to get you upstairs and into your bed immediately before you truly catch sickness no no please take the blankets with you that right so that was it hermione thought perplexed blaise and mcgonagall were bustling about her but she couldnthelp feeling as if there were suddenly some other force that was controlling her body for her this couldntbe it not after the grand fuss he had made about preserving his dignity at the sake of her well being not after the way that she pushed him the night before did he did he provide any sort of explanation mcgonagall and blaise paused in their handiwork of wrapping the blankets around hermione shoulders and shared a glance hermione pondered the intensity of blaise surprisingly serious expression and the strain within mcgonagall dark eyes i sorry child mcgonagall said more softly resuming her work with folding the blankets more securely around her frame but the master does not apologize at least not easily hermione looked into mcgonagall eyes for a moment longer desperately trying to read what lay in their depths she was sure that the older woman was trying to gauge her reaction to read her thoughts and hermione could only wonder what might be so important to her feeling herself at an impasse she nodded gently and unsteadily pulled herself to her feet i understand she said quietly i not entirely sure what the general expectation was but i know that i was not expecting to see upper floors of the castle ever again so this is actually quite an improvement hermione turned to the hat on the floor with a rueful smile and with what she hoped look like sincere relief but mcgonagall did not seem any less displeased in a way hermione scoffed i suppose choosing to let someone not die in a deserted prison cell is something of an apology she quelled the growing bitterness that threatened to creep back into her thoughts and instead turned to blaise i just sorry that now i will have no choice but to disappoint you blaise it seems that my career in imprisonment was short lived it seems that we ll just have to make do blaise lamented with a dramatic flourish he bounced to the cell door that mcgonagall had just opened and dragged the corner of one of her many blankets with the handle of his base mcgonagall rolled her eyes but managed to keep her comments to herself as she passed through the dungeon door hermione glanced back at the dreary cell behind her hearing but not hearing blaise muffled chatter of a new life i dontknow where those men came from or what their purposes were and for now there nothing i can do about them i was a fool but i shall not make that mistake again if another moment of escape presented itself to her she would take it without hesitation ah choo miss granger hermione you re back and such was the way that hermione was greeted into the kitchen for breakfast after another few pointed words from mcgonagall a fresh set of nightclothes and a blissful exhaustion induced sleep that she had been denied in the dungeons hermione greeted her audience clad in a dress that was forced upon her by parvati and lavender and with a billowing sneeze good morning everyone she managed to say with watery eyes how are you feeling child would you care for a cup of tea please sit down miss granger hermione i so glad you re with us again dean appeared on the tabletop just as hermione found herself seated we were all so worried good morning dean hermione replied graciously i faring much better now thank you she looked around the kitchen at all of the marvelous creatures around her stricken by the number of objects who had come to see her and thank you to all of you for your help last night speak nothing of it miss granger said a burly pot from the stove anything for a lady like you indeed miss granger said a delicate piece of china from a nearby counter it was the least we could do speaking of what we could do said seamus who appeared at hermione side we ve all made you a fine breakfast this morning and we d love for you to enjoy it oh why thank not at all miss granger it our pleasure please hermione said slowly and with clarity call me hermione well hermione dean smiled broadly you ve certainly given us all quite a bit to talk about here in the castle it not often that something this exciting happens every day hermione looked at him blandly what on earth do you mean you re a talking paintbrush but then the reality of what he had said hit her and she inwardly groaned oh hermione said with dismay running a hand the no longer neat bun that her hairbrush had prepared for her yes i do suppose i let myself get carried away unfortunately nonsense hermione a napkin to her left cried not necessarily hermione dean countered it just that nobody ever talked to him like that before not even sir snape and it s well a little overdue dean unconsciously checked his surroundings and pressed on we re so sorry that you had to spend the night in the dungeons hermione and we hope that our assistance made it a little easier on you but what you did was amazing yes miss said one of the larger miniature teacups you re very brave it shyly shuffled itself in its spot on the table and hermione smiled sadly yet very silly for getting myself wound up in the dungeons for the night she placed her chin in her hands and gave a short mirthless laugh serves me right for essentially inviting the idea dontkid yourself hermione that was a rotten thing for him to do said blaise as he appeared at the edge of the kitchen and loudly hopped his way to dean left mate dean said in surprise you were almostlate for breakfast i overslept blaise sniffed haughtily it happens besides i was assisting a certain someone in a certain location due to a certain sentence for most of the night while you were guarding the room thank you but dean replied incredulously it food you never miss a meal and i here now he replied smoothly and so i never shall dean shook his head but someone was already picking up blaise speech it was the grave tone from the familiar drawl of sir snape that caught hermione off guard and before she knew it her laughter had converted into rapt attention enough of this sir snape commanded as he emerged from the shadows of a dark corner where had been lurking hermione could swear that she heard dean mutter hedonistic buffoon under his breath but no one else seemed to notice anything other than snape intense scowl hermione what you did last night surprised all of us and no one more than the master himself he has great power but that does not mean that you are without your own while i would not recommend suggesting punishment again as you did last night snape paused to offer her a tired scowl and a pointed glare and hermione felt her breath freeze in her lungs what you did was significant likewise while his reaction was not surprising it was inexcusable sir snape lowered his eyes perhaps not among royalty but certainly among greater men the air had grown thick with tension so quickly so heavy with a bitterness that reached all of these creatures a bitterness that hermione could only share a taste of that she felt compelled to slice through it lest she lose herself in that moment i sorry hermione said with a repentant smile tearing herself from this unnerving daze and feeling a rush of shame wash over her i very much in agreement and i should have known to bite my tongue i shouldnthave expected any better results after insulting someone with such little maturity and such great authority hmmm snape said slowly his scowl unchanged and lips barely moving indeed and with that snape turned for the exit snapped at the servants to get back to work and he was gone whatever this was this spell that momentarily captivated the room of servants it was broken hermione felt relieved but remained wary there were too many mysteries appearing before her in this castle and she feared that she would never find the answers she sought and for some reason she found that she could not relax around this snape she couldntplace it but something about his tone and character evoked these feelings of indignation and defensiveness and i thought it was just the prince who fell victim to mood swings apparently it the whole kingdom it a wonder you came back hermione said the same teacup with undeniable gratitude and hermione immediately felt guilty for her judgmental thoughts many of the expressions in the room had taken on a wistful glaze at the youth statement revealing traces of a sense of long forgotten hope perhaps this girl was truly the one to break the spell after all they wondered hermione however did not notice for she was too busy looking into the teacup that she now cradled in her hands i wonder at the very same thing myself to be honest she whispered you re not going to try to leave us again hermione are you hermione stared at the cup biting her lip torn by the child hopeful face i have so many other loved ones to take care of back home she said softly i sorry little one but i cantpromise that you ve all been very kind to me and i canttell you how much i appreciate everything that you ve done for me she looked around the kitchen and the servants were all listening i ll do whatever is in my power to help you transform back into your human selves well there is something you can do the little teacup proffered all you have to do is get the prince to to find the cure said a mothering teapot before anyone else could interject pardon me madam but i katie bell at your service the gypsy never told us the real cure the teacup started to protest but the pot sent a warning look and it became silent but we are grateful for your thoughts miss hermione hermione smiled sadly again and gave another mirthless laugh nodding unfortunately it clear that prince malfoy is it it clear that he would rather i not be anywhere near this place and to be honest it quite reciprocated i dearly miss my friends and family back home they have no idea where i am and i must go back to them as soon as possible she frowned into her cup face i sorry i donteven know your name it colin the cup supplied dejectedly colin creevey hermione smiled well colin she prodded i ll be sure to make my stay here as meaningful as possible for however long that may be there was a tense silence that rose among the other servants again but hermione was still immersed in the conversation with her newfound friend colin offered her a small smile and gestured that she take a sip of the warm brew he was holding but as soon as he was out of her line of vision he let his face fall and confess his blatant disappointment hermione sipped her tea from the cup deep in thought and the servants made their silent decisions that it was finally time to return to work and so this is how it came to be that breakfast time on this day was spoiled and the rest of the morning passed by gloomily i promise hermione insisted but blaise countered are you positive we have all sorts of activities planned really she pressed i would just like to rest in my room for a bit it was a long night he was distraught come on now blaise dean said exasperated we can come back in the afternoon right hermione of course she said not able to turn down his earnest face but at the same time simply willing them to just leave already see dean said victoriously we ll be back soon very soon blaise said joyfully with an itinerary hermione lazily waved goodbye a combination of disbelief and bemusement on her features as soon as she stepped into the room she braced herself to be attacked by her furniture which were no doubt sure to scold her for letting her hair come loose it seemed however that her companions had taken their leave to the gossip of the servants quarters and hermione was instantly grateful releasing a tremendous sigh of relief she rotated her shoulders uncomfortably marveling at how even the simplest dress in their selection could still feel so disagreeable against her skin she immediately froze upon hearing a noise behind her and prepared to make a mad dash down the hallway at the first sign of danger after a few brief moments of silence hermione heard the sound again midas she spun on her heels there on the foot board of the bed midas was perched contentedly and staring at her moving slowly she placed a hand on her hip and eyed him suspiciously you again i not sure if i supposed to trust you or resent you midas cocked his head to the side in what hermione told herself was alarm that what i said just last night you went and got the others when i asked you to but i obviously cannot know your true intentions you could have done it solely for the sake of your master she advanced toward the bed keeping her steps small and cautious and who was it that lured me here in the first place midas leaped from his perch glided across the air and landed at a window sill he stared at hermione then glanced toward the forest and then back again hermione narrowed her eyes in confusion and midas repeated the process i dontknow how they ever learned to understand you hermione whispered but she relented and moved toward the window midas looked at her earnestly or at least she thought so he could very well have been looking at her and thinking that she was a loon or more likely he could very well not be thinking of anything at all except mice midas had apparently given up hope on trying to make hermione understand something for the moment which was all right by her because she was in no mood to translate with a sigh hermione plopped onto the pillows in the nook at the sill and extended her legs causing midas to squawk in distress i still upset with you you know hermione told him miserably but i suppose i shouldnthave alarmed you just now no matter what you may or may not deserve with a sigh she placed and elbow against the window pane and rested her chin in her palm but then again you re in his in circle she told the owl absentmindedly who knows what you re here for midas hopped closer turning his head all the way around in what hermione was convinced was confusion it doesntmatter she said at last the only thing that matters right now is that i need to contact the others ah hermione hesitated eyeing the owl with uncertainty i need to contact ron and i dontknow how by the time midas moved again she had actually forgotten about his presence he left without warning a flurry of feathers and left hermione with her unanswered questions figures hermione whispered hugging her knees to her chest that what you do best you silly owl you fly away and let other people handle life on their own she was just about to take her leave to go find blaise and dean again when midas swooped in through a previously unseen compartment near the ceiling carrying a small scrap of parchment and a quill in his mouth stunned hermione watched as the owl carefully placed the items on the seat before her and sat back on its haunches to wait hermione glanced at midas then back to the parchment is this hermione picked up the quill with trepidation you ve already inked it midas merely cocked his head if this is what i think it means hermione said pointedly at the owl it means that you re giving me the materials to write one letter to the outside under certain conditions i sure and that you ll deliver it for me no reaction hermione inhaled and exhaled deeply in annoyance but took hold of the parchment anyway you re incredibly frustrating but if you can truly understand me then you have my sincere thanks and without any further prompting from midas hermione looked to the small scrap of paper in the palm of her hand and wrote disclaimer this story is based on characters and situations created and owned by

isntmuch direct hermione draco interaction in this chapter or the next chapter because it going to be setting up the scene but it coming soon and it will be worth it in the meantime i know now that poker was not invented until the 1820s which is at least half a century after the story of beauty the best is generally set the mid 1700s for some reason my 14 year old self did not think it d be useful to look up that sort of information before publishing a previous chapter thus i will be going back and editing the chapter mentioning poker night to meet the more historically correct adaptations that you will find in this chapter from the everything casino gambling book feel confident have fun and win big by meg elaine schneider stanley roberts bingo is a first cousin of the lottery a game of chance in which players try to match randomly drawn numbers to win most historians agree that modern bingo is based on the italian national lottery or lo giuoco del lotto d italia that began in the early 1500s and is still played weekly the game is believed to have migrated to france great britain and other parts of europe in the 1700s players were issued special cards marked with rows and columns of numbers to win the numbers called had to form a complete row or column on the card bingo ha who knows how historically accurate my minor incorporation is but it worth a shot this was getting ridiculous pansy paced back and forth within her prison her cage her hell and cursed her predicament once more she was lucky that draco had been too distracted with the young lout to think twice about her less than subtle inquiries about the castle recent events and thus too distracted to catch on to her pitiful secret the secret that she had been harboring now for two nights that she still could not see the girl it was preposterous when the gypsy left her on this unforgiving plane she had granted pansy with the ability to reach beyond the grounds of the castle in order to see what the others could not she was cursed in this mirror with these powers in order to be draco connection to the world a twisted ironic testament to the similar role she had played in his life as a mortal she alone had been the stable foothold of reality that reminded him of what was outside his small scope of royal upbringing and from behind her glass barrier she still offered the same this time revealing what transpired outside of his own monstrosity whenever she pleased she could look out over the expanse of magic to watch the events that occurred away from their palace sanctuary their tiered purgatory and relay her visions to the others for years her stories of the outside world had fallen on draco deaf bitter ears and his servants eager ones and she had not ever encountered any challenge with descrying trapped within her tarnished mirror she could expand her mind eye to witness all which she could not experience until now pansy moaned as she banged on the glass pane wishing with all her might to finally get a glance of the young loathsome girl what would draco say once he realized that she had this defect this missing link this gaping hole within her magical existence he had not caught on as of yet but pansy knew that once he came to his senses he would see her weakness her flaw you stupid girl pansy told the unseen female feeling her jealousy override her despair what so special about you anyway if she ever wanted any chance at seeing this visitor she had to find a way to reach her mind out further she had never had any trouble locating an individual before and this lapse in ability did not sit well with pansy she would find a way to see her she just had to draco would never know of her weakness i dontunderstand hermione said warily pausing in the corridor you want me to attend your game night indeed blaise bounced a bit of gambling is enough to cheer anyone up and you are in sore need of a cheering up party and besides dean offered logically we need someone to make sure that the luck of the irish isnt too lucky if you know what i mean well hermione considered i not fond of the idea of gambling but i dontsuppose i have anything else to do do i i might as well join you not fond of gambling anything else to do blaise sputtered what else is there to do goodness gracious blaise dean shook his head not everyone is a money grubbing handle like you are blaise just shook his head in astonishment ignoring dean expectation of a reply with a sigh dean asked so what is it that you like to do hermione to be outside to be with my friends and family to go to the market or the bookstore anything well hermione said thoughtfully shaking herself from her reverie what i really love to do more than anything else is to read oh said dean surprised you seem like you had expected me to say something else hermione observed dean looked sheepish dontworry it not as if i had pegged you for another girl like lavender or parvati who are nice and all but a little preoccupied but i guess i just sorry that we donthave much here for you to relate to dean frowned up at her apologetically as they resumed walking along the corridor it not like we were really prepared to have a visitor after so long although we should have been blaise grumbled darkly under his breath what oh nothing blaise said so books are what you like you said dean could see the mischievous wheels turning in blaise mind and feared what cock eyed plan he could be creating love hermione smiled i love the outdoors and being with others but i could literally spend days reading by myself if someone would let me indeed blaise whispered to himself pensive with his planning say now why dontyou two run off to the third floor servants quarters to get a head start on the bingo tourney bingo and i ll see you in a bit eh where are you going dean called after blaise as he bustled back down the hallway in the opposite direction oi vey he gone hermione laughed well i guess now neither of us have a choice we might as well make the best of it dean had opened his mouth to reply when hermione suddenly gave way to another coughing fit blimey hermione he said worriedly maybe we should get you back to bed hermione considered this seriously if i go back to my room now i can start working on another plan but if i go under the guise of being ill i sure to have caregivers at every turn i need to go back when there will be time to think alone and besides she glanced about cautiously feeling against all reason that eyes were boring into her back something about this castle is already making me feel scrutinized enough as it is nonsense dean she patted her chest i all right dean was unconvinced well he said with obvious conflict if you re absolutely sure positively hermione asserted well dean said as he turned the corner if you re not sick now you re definitely going to be a whole other kind of sick when you see how much money seamus is going to try to cheat me out of tonight the luck of the irish will be no more and with that hermione followed a determined dean down the hallway wondering what on earth she had just agreed to sometime shortly thereafter hermione found herself thinking that she had never seen a room in such competitive disarray precarious towers of marker chips and mountains of decks of game cards were enveloped on the round table by tense stoic faces eyeing one another suspiciously as they attempted to inconspicuously evaluate their cards hermione could almost imagine the strain in the room swirling around them like a hazy fog of cigar smoke she sat at her place in the table by dean quietly waiting for the progression of the game and taking this time to investigate her newfound friends further lee jordan was feisty and had a boyish care free attitude that put hermione at ease almost instantly as the herald lee had transformed into a tabard his typical short coat which was emblazoned on both the front and back with the same design of twisted animals that she found so disturbing on the door knockers at the castle entrance what our coat of arms these chaps lee had joked upon noticing her curious stare the eternal struggle among the four houses is nothing compared to what happens here with these bingo blokes when a skirmish erupts let me tell you the four houses her bookish curiosity was surfacing but when she had tried to get him to elaborate her voice was soon drowned out by the already bickering voices of her table companions from that point on she enjoyed his attempts to provide a commentary for the game as he called the numbers although his fellow players squashed his hopes at the first sign of any further narration the palace scribes terry boot and anthony goldstein were beautifully designed quills and had a strong air of knowledge about them lisa turpin having been a carder in the castle previously transformed into a pair of her old weaving tools complete with a handle and bent wire teeth for brushing and cleaning wool michael corner the old hayward had turned into a pair of hedge cutters which made playing this game awfully difficult luckily he had the assistance of zacharias smith one of the weaving looms who could help him place his chips and retrieve his dues dean and seamus were especially quiet tonight and hermione did not fail to miss the fact that they had situated themselves with as much distance between them as humanly possible or as inhumanly possible perhaps so miss hermione lee began as he mixed the uncalled bingo chips trying to break the tension are you enjoying yourself here at the castle as much as one can i suppose she said with a small smile it helps when one has superb company blaise declared as he playfully nudged himself at lee oi you lee said easily the last time you did that you set me on fire lee showed his singed thread for emphasis this better not be here when i human again if i not one hundred percent singed free when i return to my mortal body i swear you ll be my announcement podium for months zabini lee the next chip if you wouldnt mind anthony was swaying his quill feather impatiently all right all right keep your ink in there was a great mixing of the bingo chips and then with a flourish lee removed one from the pile and called out its name blimey i got it again bingo blast absolutely no way oi thomas it aintme problem that you re just not any good at take that finnegan you lousy cheater hermione watched in alarm as the table transformed from a class of stoic assortment of knick knacks to a pack of wild animals as if it were a rubber band stretched too taut before being released and then converging in on itself without restraint she immediately jumped back from the fray watching with growing concern as the skirmish started escalating to a full out brawl and was terry actually biting someone oi you apes lee raised himself high above the whirling tumble if you re gonna fight take it to the corridor out out hermione watched the objects detach themselves from the cluster one by one until all that was left was a wildly flailing broomstick and a paintbrush so shaken by rage it appeared as if it were vibrating is he all right hermione asked sending a sidelong glance at blaise oh this blaise shrugged nonchalantly it just how those two handle things nothing to be concerned about my dear hermione still well then blaise said with renewed cheer let us see here what we have next on our list ah we ll be late for our appointment with mcgoogle at this rate dean dean get out of that tussle this instant we have a schedule to keep dean lurched himself toward blaise and hermione but not without throwing a this isntover finnegan we ll finish this later over his shoulder first the two guides propelled themselves forward making a beeline for the corridor while hermione turned herself around to face the objects to offer them her thanks when she faced them once more she was surprised to see them all staring at her expectantly may we join you miss hermione lisa asked um hermione began eyeing blaise behind her who appeared to be whispering about something with dean i would like to say yes but i honestly not quite sure where we re going blaise what his flame burst upward upon hearing his name what oh very well you lot can come but just dontget in our way i dontneed any other reasons for mcgonagall or the master to be giving me trouble you hear what happened to all that alpha male talk from last night hermione jested playfully with a smirk she fell into step beside her two escorts as lisa zacharias and michael scrambled around her feet lee voice however could still be heard cursing down the corridor about a blasted mess what blaise michael snickered now there a laugh oh hush you snippy blaise huffed i need not defend my masculinity to a pair of overgrown scissors however i think this argument has already been won today by another party if any other creature in the castle most closely resembled his highness this evening it was most certainly none other than dean himself me dean said surprised what for why you sure shook with all your might when you were at it with your best mate now didntyou blaise smiled deviously the only other creature i ve seen with bristles that uptight and agitated is the prince himself a round of good natured laughter surrounded hermione there you are dean zacharias added through gasps for breath next step is to get the roar down pat and then you ll be top wolf for sure just make sure you roar more than speak that way you wonthave to remind us with your makeshift monikers of you servant that you dontremember our names hermione continued their journey down the corridor watching with interest as another boisterous round of laughter echoed throughout the halls her companions began congratulating zacharias for hitting the nail on the head when she once again got the distinct impression that they were being watched as subtly as possible hermione glanced up to the higher floors above her attempting to peer into the shadows she saw nothing but even as she followed her friends farther into the castle she just couldntshake that feeling that something was there you hear that snape draco shook his head with a huff ever since she came around all i have been listening to is their complaints and their incessant questioning of my character a despicable sneer crawled into his features and he peered farther into the light to get a closer look they never dared to speak of me this way before at least snape thought with genuine amusement not within your hearing range is that really what irks you sire draco turned on him with a harsh expression and snape sighed i sure you have suspicions that would suggest otherwise draco drawled eyeing his chef what are you implying i am only just observing that you seem far less distressed with the servants dissatisfaction with your rule than you are with their apparent affection for her draco turned away pausing for a moment as his brows burrowed together of course they are dissatisfied with my rule draco bit out my reign is essentially nonexistent and they are only drawn to her because they believe she will make them human again draco said quietly he inhaled deeply as he watched her laughing with them below and felt his eyes narrow she has nothing else to offer i doubt that such thinking will facilitate your grossly incomplete task of further making her acquaintance yourself we ve been following her around all day sire snape heavy brow raised imperceptibly perhaps there is a more effective way of getting to know her perchance through actual conversation but draco was still listening to his servants laugh at his expense and his dark eyes clouded with malice their attachment isntdeep it is formed merely from misplaced trust i have serious doubts that any of them would be expending their energy on this acquaintance if not for such circumstances snape sighed heavily the servants admire miss granger because she treats them with respect and listens to them perhaps you could instead learn a thing or two from her by the time draco had turned around prepared to scold and deny snape was already gone coward draco muttered under his breath but couldntmuster the energy to offer any other parting remarks toward his absent mentor instead he focused his concentration the hearty laughter echoing from the floors below well snape he muttered darkly to himself think i dontknow what i doing do you he right you dolt you have no idea well draco voice dripped in an acidic baritone ignoring his mental note of caution his eyes continued to trail the young woman below we ll see about that disclaimer this story is based on characters and situations

the beast and any other things specified and i not making any profits from this fic author note 6 5 2011 so i unfortunately only got one monstrosity chapter out before i left for peru but i back now this chapter was actually part of a larger chapter originally but i ve decided to just post this little bit for now the next installment should be out within a few days chapter 12 catapult are you kidding blaise whispered with impatience it a fantastic idea i still dontget it dean face scrunched into confusion we already mentioned it before why not just take her there now because blaise drawled in exasperation glancing at the young woman chatting with the objects in front of him think of the impact what good will it do all of us if we present her with the library and what magnificence will it do all of us if he presents her with the library you really think he ll do it dean whispered so soon after last night incident well he bloody better blaise said determinedly time a wasting blaise dean said perplexed it only been two days my point exactly they ll need all the time they can get pansy draco stormed into his chambers and immediately accosted the mirror yes draco i need you to investigate something oh pansy looked at him sideways feeling a giddy anxiousness well inside her it had been so long since he had asked this service of her that she couldnthelp but feel a tingle of irrational pride in her position but she remained cautious of letting herself get too excited she was used to his mood swings but last night had ended more abruptly and with even more dissatisfaction than usual she couldntlet herself get her hopes up what did you have in mind tell me what you can about the band of men who entered the forbidden forest last night he said with hard eyes i want to know what they were up to you think they might have something to do with the girl or are you concerned that they might be onto us pansy asked immediately if they harness silver ammunition it could very well be that just look draco snapped pansy took a moment longer to search his eyes but only found impatience and so she closed hers in turn and set to work through the blackness behind her lids she catapulted her mind forward coming upon a vast network of flashes and lights each accompanied by a myriad of sounds her energy swiveled and pivoted meandering above this open maze until she found what she was looking for and descended find it draco spat impatiently he didntlike the way pansy stood so rigidly or the way her expression was entirely devoid of any semblance of herself how long had she been standing like that his brow creased in concern and his arms slipped from their offensive hold across his front pans there it is she whispered eyes shut draco paused looking down in surprise to find that his hand had already extended midway to the mirror without his knowing and snatched it back to his side with a huff he clenched and unclenched his claws and shot an appraising glance at his paw as a feeling of warmth stretched through his limb he turned back to the mirror watching her speculatively as she continued ahh pansy said a tight smirk splaying over her features she lives in mad eye town how quaint and what about the men draco rolled his eyes claws forgotten where were they from the same pansy whispered shutting her eyes tighter as if trying to peer deeper into the landscape interesting the men who you encountered last night have all dispersed into their homes to rest they ve switched positions now and there is another band of men pushing westward along the outskirts they seem to be looking for something her head shook slightly i need to get closer to be sure i didntrealize that this was going to take all day pansy draco drawled lazily as he slumped into his nest pansy wasntfooled however the malice was gone and her draco was back trying only minimally to hide her small smile pansy ducked in and out of streets and alleyways propelling herself through the town only to come to an immediate halt in the plaza oh pansy said confused it appears that the whole town is in a bustle over this girl the men the ones who got to you last night and the ones who are making their way around the perimeter of the forest now are search parties for the girl draco sat up slowly his eyes staring intently ahead indeed and have they found any sign of her pansy looked harder her eyes squeezing shut against him as she listened in on the townspeople no nothing they re all far too downtrodden to believe that they ve gotten close although they were close werentthey draco deigned not to speak but the revelation was forgotten when a disgusted sneer suddenly enveloped her features my what an outlandish bunch she part of i used to wonder at what kind of world mad eye could have been created from and my opinion hasntchanged i canteven see a school with a scowl draco tilted his head toward the mirror still gazing into the unseen before him come off it pansy he sighed i ve already got plenty of reasons to despise her figure out if they ll be coming back smile broadening pansy readily complied they re all wrong with navigation they re going away from the castle entirely and from their patterns it looks as if they re going to start spreading out in all the wrong directions i can keep an eye on them periodically however if you d like she hoped that the eagerness in her voice didntirritate his ears as much as it did hers probably for the best draco muttered pansy energy could sense across the distance that he was deliberating about something but she was so enthralled with the notion of being back in draco ultimate confidence that she could barely think on it she was momentarily sidetracked however by a group of townspeople trooping around a lopsided looking home it looked as if a small army had taken up residence in this pitiful building as a base for the search individuals scattered about the lawn shouting orders and sharing worried looks while a smaller trio hung about behind the house out of sight a young couple was beckoning to a young man perched in a tall oak right in the fork in the trunk and a relatively large branch high off the ground this young man it seemed was decidedly ignoring them his red hair was a horrible contrast to his pale freckles and pansy sneered with distaste remembering the days of draco perfect complexion and piercing eyes she was about to turn away her energy hovering unseen in the air when she noticed that the young man held something clutched tightly in his fist peculiar pansy whispered draco ears twitched but he was still lost in thought she too felt herself drawn out of her previous conversation with draco and into curiosity she pulled her energy alongside this young man calculating his usefulness as he glared at something in the other direction come on ron a young man with dark hair was shouting up at the figure beside her the man named ron however seemed not to have heard ron the woman called she shared this man features could she be a relative you re not doing anyone around here any favors by just brooding up a tree if you d like to mope then that your choice but we ve already decided she crossed her arms and shot a fierce scowl at his form pansy had to admit that while the red hair and freckles suited this one more the girl still marred whatever potential prettiness she could have had with those dirty clothes we decided nothing the man beside pansy said quietly and she was so surprised to hear him speak that her concentration broke and her mind energy slipped two feet lower toward the ground she shifted herself back upward glancing curiously at the man profile ron you know hermione is the planner the dark haired boy voice came into focus he made an attempt to sound lighthearted but there was a definite swell of concern he spoke more softly now and pansy strained to hear the whole town worried i worried but we have to trust that hermione can handle herself for now until she can tell us where she is we donthave much of a choice anyway all we can do for now is to just make sure that all of her things are ready for her when she returns pansy looked to the man beside her but he was persistent in disregarding the two below it wasntlong before the couple slowly departed from the tree the young man whispering with the young girl all the way pansy started breathing heavily registering the gravity of what had just been presented to her her mind was reeling with questions and she didntknow where to start a sigh from the boy in the tree caused her to jump and she glared at him as he shifted about when he saw that the couple was finally out of view he turned back to the scrap of paper in his hand and opened it pansy watched hungrily as he peeled back the corners ron i safe i cantexplain everything now but i just want you to know that i okay this owl is named midas and he is a friend i cantcome back home yet but i promise i ll find a way to come back soon in the meantime do not come looking for me and please try not to worry it wasntsigned she noticed pans reread the note trying to absorb the information into the archives of her mind as thoroughly as possible so the girl was connected to this boy somehow was she and she had already gone into cahoots with midas to reach him she stared at the note imagining with glee how much draco would detest the girl even more after a piece of information like this would be brought to his attention it hadnteven been a full day since her release from the dungeons and she was already sending secret messages out she snickered derisively envisioning the faceless girl being thrown back into the forest good riddance pansy turned to the young man once more are they lovers she wondered in revulsion they must suit each other wonderfully she was sure and yet pansy contemplated the note isntsigned perhaps she left it blank as a matter of protection or perhaps she just tactless in all of her interactions just as another gratifying image of the girl being discarded from the castle flashed before her eyes a thought struck her what if what if i could help her escape but pansy immediately squashed it down and covered her hands in her face no she thought miserably no matter what happened the kingdom needed her draco may or may not ever truly care for the girl but i couldntdo that not to the others they at least need the chance suddenly the full realization of what was happening hit pansy full force she was going to lose draco to a girl he didnteven know to a commoner he couldntstand to someone who didntdeserve him and to someone that pansy could not lay eyes on let alone fight blinking back tears and biting the inside of her cheek to keep from alerting draco to her dismay in the distant spaces of the castle she stared at the note in the boy hand with hatred she could see the girl script see her lover but not her face you may have the prophecy she thought bitterly glaring at the note but he ll never be yours in the way that he mine fat chance ron whispered angrily crumpling the note in his fist and startling pansy from her reverie at first she worried that she d spoken out loud and she thought for an impossible moment she wondered if the boy had heard and had responded to her announcement it became clear quite quickly however that ron had merely read the note once more pansy stared at the young man with renewed clarity taking in the jagged angles of his angry features draco pansy called extending her voice across the magic and through her body in the mirror she hesitated for but a moment reconsidering for the consequences but in the end she decided to keep this young man and whoever else his companions were her little secret draco i dontsee anything else of value down here she called not letting her gaze off of the redhead face is there anything else you would like me to look for what he wouldntknow wouldnthurt him she hoped

waterflower20 for the consistent reviews i swear they make my day chapter 13 priorities a search party things were growing more complicated by the minute with less than three months and counting he needed to find not only a way to stomach the creature traipsing through his halls but also to find a way to lure her into a courtship but it was more than that not only did he have to put with her agonizing muddy peasant odor and know it all attitude but now he was also faced with the challenge of ensuring that she stayed in while her would be saviors stayed far away all while having her fall head over heels for him while he was like this apparently he had to find out more about her following her around all day had done nothing but aggravate his nerves and if he ever wanted to have a chance at saving his kingdom if he ever wanted a chance to show snape then he needed to change tactics damn he whispered thumping his paw on the floor beside him the stone below it gave into the pressure with a small crack and draco glared at his paw as if it alone were the culprit draco pansy prodded her form wavering slightly behind the mirror i asked if there was anything else that you would like to know about was she still trailing on ah draco said with a wave right you mentioned the ammunition earlier why not check out the silversmith he suggested finally breaking from his reverie put an end to this silver bullet debacle once and for all right pansy replied cheerily standing a bit straighter when he glanced her way in curiosity he could see her eyes darting to and fro behind her lids but the sky outside his window recaptured his attention he was almost certain that she was acting a little too strange but he decided to let her be oh she said with a frown draco turned in his nest to face her his brows dropping low into a knot between his eyes well the majority of the items appear to be harmless pansy said softly platters jewelry kettles but it also appears as if someone has petitioned a rather large order of bullets pansy said licking her lips she finally opened her eyes indeed draco tapped his claws against the stone impatiently mulling this new information over i suppose someone may be onto us after all but draco you dontknow for sure pansy draco rolled his eyes werentyou the one just spinning this theory at me when i first arrived but surely draco if they harness silver ammunition it could very well be that i know what i said pansy cutting him off feeling anxiety rise within her it couldntbe true but nothing is for certain i can only tell you what i think i see where would they get this kind of information what makes you so sure certain that these were really intended for you instinct he said quietly instinct pansy countered your instincts have been waffling back and forth all day first you re raging at the girl last night for her impudence in touching you last night because it wasnt silver then you come straight up here to seek confirmation that you had done the right thing pansy draco growled which you further ignored and thereby decided to release the girl from the dungeons because it had to be silver pansy this morning i overheard you ranting about letting the girl go too soon because it wasnt fatal and now pansy at the sound of his roar pansy immediately fell to her knees and bowed to the ground forgive me your highness draco stared at the girl on the ground for a moment longer his hard eyes softening slightly at the sight of her small form when he felt that she had remained in that position for long enough and that his ego had been sufficiently soothed he let his breath come out through his nostrils in a powerful huff that he knew she would understand i dontknow how else to explain it he said as she slowly righted herself i just know that what came inside of me yesterday was no ordinary bullet and it time for me to stop dancing around reality in a number of ways i came here thinking that i would find out more about the girl so i could teach snape a lesson by doing something for her his face twisted slightly but now it seems like that my fear has been confirmed instead of just pulling off this stunt to spite snape i really do owe her something the disgusted look on pansy face was painful to see mostly for the fact that he was sure it mirrored his own damn he thought under no circumstances will a malfoy apologize to a peasant but if he really looked at it all clearly he knew and would never admit out loud that the guilt had already been eating away at him for hours compelling him to follow her around the castle just looking for an excuse to rationalize his behavior he had to do something to get rid of it but what what are you going to do pansy asked her voice curious and laced with disappointment it matched his thoughts exactly hmm he muttered noncommittally but he had already started stringing the first threads of his decision i should at least make more of an effort to put her more at ease he began but stopped when he saw that pansy looked like he had struck her in the face dontlook at me like that draco spat feeling his hackles rise his flesh was crawling with discomfort nothing extraordinary i assure you just enough to get this stupid ordeal off my chest besides snape wants me to try to learn more about the dirty peasant does he well he never said that i had to interact with her i can rid myself of these pesky feelings without ever saying a word to her best to get this done and over with draco gritted through his fangs as he strode through the door but draco what are you going to do i dontknow draco said pausing at the doorframe but until i find out keep an eye on those men but without another word draco bounded down the hallway already on the hunt for the dirty scent of the girl sometime later when draco had endured listening to too many useless conversations from the gaggle of servants assigned the girl stay and was absolutely certain that he could no longer stand any fiber of his being for having spent the remainder of his day lurking about the castle to watch their onerous activities an intriguing piece of information floated his way well the girl began peering down at the paintbrush beside her in the parlor with a cough it just that after meeting terry and anthony i very interested in seeing all of your artwork really asked the brush draco searched his mind for its name but came up short daniel or was it tobias what kind of art all kinds the girl shrugged and draco watched with distaste as she smiled down at his servant i mean this very castle is art itself but it would be grand to see more than just architecture you know your paintings drawings i would have expected more paintings in a castle of this size and with so many artists draco rolled his eyes from his perch on an upper floor balcony she was blown away by her bedchambers but was criticizing his lack of art decor she certainly had her priorities skewed unfortunately a great deal of them were sold after the death of the king and queen said lisa turpin sadly rest their souls the other objects chorused in unison draco breath hitched in his throat but he shook it away after a moment still his claws tightened around the banister these halls used to be filled with fantastic examples of the arts lisa continued but i afraid that when push came to shove those masterpieces were the first items to go how unfortunate hermione commented with a frown draco rolled his eyes again with feeling yes indeed lisa nodded to herself however we are still fortunate in that we were able to maintain a small percentage of our book collection that books hermione face lit up instantly and she actually forgot to take her next step her gaze was glued to lisa onward moving form and her lips began sloping into one of the first genuine smiles she d felt in days draco leaned farther over the banister to listen in as in a library oh what i would give to mr zabini i doomed hermione paused mid speech only to find that blaise was suddenly using her calf as a shield albeit a very ineffective one she raised a brow curiously watching as he divided his time between hiding from the trembling hat who was now making her way toward them and trying to keep his flame from creeping too close to her skirts mr zabini you are late it wasntme blaise protested from behind hermione left shoe i promise that it was serious you see it all started when finnegan blaise zabini do not bore me with your excuses i expect nothing less than perfect punctuality from both of you and this constant presentation of a poor impression on our guest is wildly unacceptable but not a word mr thomas i expected you fifteen minutes ago and now those fifteen minutes are gone for this reason you two will be getting an early start on your chores tonight and will meet with me again later this evening during a more reasonable hour at my convenience do not anticipate a meal before our next appointment but now mcgonagall turned with a grim smile to hermione i sorry miss granger but i afraid i going to have to relieve you of your guides for one evening i sure that the other servants would be more than willing to keep you occupied for the rest of the night hermione bowed her head as she gave a polite curtsy but was surprised to experience a bit of lightheadedness when she resumed her standing position she touched her fingertips to her temple gingerly ignoring the slight sense of vertigo that momentarily overcame her thank you madam mcgonagall but i think i d much rather retire to my room for the night it seems i much more tired than i originally thought mcgonagall eyed her curiously for a moment observing the dark circles beginning to form under the girl eyes and nodded in agreement yes dear i think that d be for the best i sure that the others would be more than willing to escort you but the servants were already leading her away mcgonagall watched them all but drag the girl with them down the corridor chatting animatedly all the while and shook her head perturbed by the time she rounded on her two victims once more draco had already stopped listening books draco leaned back against the banister clicking his claws against the wood impatiently he pondered the word for a moment turning it over in his mind testily trying to wrap his mind around what he had heard and the potential significance it held after quite some time he threw himself from the railing to the floor and made his way to the astronomy tower without hesitation so she liked to read did she draco skidded to a halt when he came to the stony balcony of the highest tower and plopped himself on the ledge heedless of the bank of snow in his path he wasnteven sure he believed she knew how to read but now he had a clue as to what his next course of action would be it didnttake a master of observation to note the change in her heartbeat or to notice the way her whole body spiked at the mere notion of a library for whatever reason draco was sure that this was his ticket to a smug victory over snape and a long awaited piece of peace and quiet in his castle all he had to do was just shove her in the right direction close the door behind her and not look back draco crossed his arms as he thought realizing with satisfaction that if the broad were really that excited about a stack of books then this could very well be the solution to many of his problems and he felt his surliness begin ebbing away as he considered the possibilities snape wontbe able to say anything once he sees how much better of a mood she in once we give the thing some toys to occupy herself with and she ll be out of my hair indefinitely not to mention that i can finally start to work my way into her good graces if she can learn to shut her trap for more than but the thought stopped cold instead as draco looked out into the darkening dusk he saw the perfect image of his father face draco could only stare back into his lucius disapproving gaze for a moment before he lost his strength and had to turn away but his father scowl was waiting for him behind his eyelids regardless those eyes so like his own pierced right through his useless tricks and told draco everything he already knew you are weak the eyes said draco shook his head to clear the image but it was no use he cradled his head in his hands hating the grotesque feeling of his fur on his cheeks but finding himself unable tear his paws away father forgive me he pleaded it out of my control it for my kingdom the memory would not fade that same penetrating stare laying bare all of draco flaws a disappointment the eyes of his father shouted a disgrace unworthy of the malfoy name unworthy of the malfoy blood no draco whispered i have no choice now you dontunderstand i dont want her i have to choose her a malfoy does not surrender the eyes accused draco could see his father scowl clearly a painful reminder of every mistake of every deserved punishment a malfoy does not accept an unworthy fate you are weak father please draco shook his head lost in the memory blood traitor no draco begged silently no i not please understand father better that you remain an animal his father voice loomed than to taint our lineage with the blood of one sire draco looked up with a start aggravated that someone had crept up on him so easily he turned to the intruder with a snarl only to find snape supplying him with a rather bored stare his chest rumbled with a low growl as he waited for snape to carry on and his mind was still reeling with the fury of having been caught in yet another vulnerable moment you are weak what draco snapped what is it snape paused for a moment examining his disheveled master with subtle concern that only further irritated the prince and cleared his throat i was merely coming to check on your progress your majesty snape hopped a little closer and to see if there were any ways in which i could assist you for a few minutes all draco could manage was a sharp stare to the snow covered treetops in the distance when he finally did speak it was with short and clipped tones bring me the servant named zabini draco said simply watching the snowflakes dancing in the wind snape looked momentarily startled zabini sire what counsel could you seek with him draco sent snape a long knowing stare it seems that our plans regarding the girl have changed you summoned me milord draco eyed the bowing creature before him carefully a small smirk grazing his lips blaise noticeably gulped two items of special interest have come to my attention draco began slowly pacing before the small creature before him in the uppermost tower then in a sudden flash of movement he crouched down to the floor snarling at blaise dwindling flame with satisfaction blaise curled in on himself imperceptibly not daring to look up draco chuckled cruelly under his breath forgive me your highness blaise exclaimed finally taking a peek upward draco had raised himself onto his haunches once more and was staring down his long snout with a sneer firstly you should warn your fellow servants that where the girl is i will most likely be in hearing range he lowered his eyes down slowly to blaise gaze and smirked once more thus it would be wise to mind one tongue when the alpha is present blaise gulped again y yes sire secondly draco stated resuming his pacing as blaise released a cautious sigh of relief in my research i have come to realize that the peasant has a supposed interest in art it is for this reason that you and your merry troop will show her the library you will escort her there tomorrow and you will present the library to her as if it were your own idea you will not mention my involvement nor will you mention my observation of her draco peered down at blaise dumbstruck expression understood blaise was confused uhm sir please do not think me disrespectful or ungrateful for the tremendous positively admirable effort being shown on your part to court the young miss for our salvation but would it not be slightly more effective for the wooing process if she were to know you know that you are wooing her at the sight of prince draco malicious stare blaised gulped again but then again an unknown secret admirer is quite romantic as well so i ll be off then and so he went disclaimer this

machine lately and that honestly been the major inspiration for my writing for the last few weeks when i write on going fanfiction i tend to jump around between chapters it really just depends on mood

working hard on upcoming chapters also for those of you who might be interested in finding regular updates about my writing habits or just want to know a little bit more about me feel free to check out my livejournal http therentyoupay dot livejournal dot com all of my fandom posts are open to the public but my more personal posts are friend locked also i listened to quite a lot of sara bareilles king of anything for this chapter the stanza below belongs to this song chapter 14 decisions decisions so you dare tell me who to be who died and made you king of anything all my life i ve tried to make everybody happy while i just hurt and hide waiting for someone to tell me it my turn to decide who made you king of anything king of anything sara bareilles but hermione didntget the chance to see the library the next day blaise what are we supposed to do dean asked moving anxiously about the corridor in the morning light he wants us to show her the library but she in no condition to go anywhere bollocks blaise said sternly shifting around the carpet as well he wontlike to be kept waiting perhaps he ll understand blaise eyes shifted toward his creative friend dubiously but didntreply we should tell him dean grumbled giving up hope it only figures we re going to be the ones getting pummeled for this when it really his fault for putting her in the dungeons and getting her sick in the first place well i do wish you luck my good bloke blaise supplied more cheerfully what do you mean i not going alone dean if you do recall i nearly croaked last night i do think you can handle this one by yourself that doesntmake any thanks again mate i wish you the best of luck but by the time dean opened his mouth to protest once more he was alone oh bollocks hermione had not left her room since retiring the previous night and she had no intentions of venturing out for the rest of the afternoon instead she was keeping herself busy by feigning illness and desperately trying to find the time to fashion another daring escape plan and most certainly not thinking about the dreadful diary anymore there was no time to break her own moral codes of privacy invasion again if she were going to find a way out of this place and she reminded herself of this fact often she was after all aiming for a plan that was thoroughly conceived and successful this time as opposed to her previous attempt which could be chalked up to simply crafted attempt to not die but doomed to failure through a distraction by her ungrateful wounded captor regardless however the servants had been most attentive to her throughout the entire day her entourage left her alone occasionally but it was never for more than a few minutes at a time in and out around and about hermione eyelids barely had any time to flutter closed before yet another visitor came barreling in to check on their guest although she had predicted this situation a few days before and at the time had subsequently decided to dismiss the possibility of exaggerating her sickness she had opted for such an attempt this morning after all in the hopes that luck would be on her side today she should have known better as she heard the clinking pitter patter of yet another trinket aid in the hallway hermione sprung herself back into the bed in a flurry of down blankets and plush and scrambled through the covers twisting in and under the sheets she closed her eyes just as the door opened a crack behind her her hard earned scrap of cloth her first prize and future map clutched proudly out of sight in the safety of her right palm goodness miss hermione the little matronly servant exclaimed as she examined the human girl from every angle you re positively burning up and your forehead is awfully clammy as the aid tutted disapprovingly and shuffled about the floor hermione felt that it was finally acceptable to peak at her visitor and saw that it was madam pomfrey the motherly chair and midwife who she had met earlier that morning at least my mad dash around the room was helpful in promoting my little act suddenly as madam pomfrey moved about her quarters she heard a small train of teacups trail in with their mother teapot oh wonderful the poor thing needs some tea in her that is absolutely certain just leave it on the cart she seems to be resting right now aw man little colin creevey dismayed quietly but did as he was told regardless to his credit he didntspill the tea near her bedside table much hush hush the mother teapot murmured as she gathered her offspring around her we ll be downstairs if you need anything madam pomfrey yes yes she said distractedly already working with one of the coat racks to ring out a warm soaked hand towel it was later placed on hermione already cooling forehead but she couldntresist the pleased sigh that escaped her as she relaxed too soon a heavy resounding knock echoed across her stone walls and hermione stiffened immediately letting madam pomfrey words what the devil rush over her and focused on keeping her breathing as even as possible she swallowed hard keeping her body utterly still and her face composed lest he god forbid make his way to the other end of the room to see her but that doesntmake sense her mind rattled shaken what he even doing here in the first place shouldnthe be off somewhere exploiting young working children this late into the day my lord madam pomfrey asked voicing the confusion that was oozing from hermione pores hermione had not heard him enter but she knew he was there hovering at the frame behind her she could sense him feel the tension thicken the air she found it hard to breathe evening pomfrey he said in low clipped tones i ve come to inquire about the state of the girl hermione mind blanked as her heart raced and she channeled all of her energy in keeping her breathing as consistent as possible inhale breath exhale breath pretend to ignore conversation repeat while it did not achieve the desired effect totally hermione was able to listen in with a respectable amount of calm my lord she is resting as you can see she stated patiently though with the hint of accusation that only motherly figures seem capable of producing she will be well again by morning but only if she has been allowed sufficient rest indeed he replied and she could feel his eyes boring into her back breathe breathe was there something else with which i could be of assistance madame pomfrey asked and hermione could hear the curiosity pouring from her she seemed almost hopeful my lord very well the prince said suddenly and hermione heard the swish of his cloak i shall now take my leave of you both and i will entrust her in your care see to it that she does rest aye my lord another rustle of cloth and hermione knew he was gone she took a few additional moments to let her mind digest this new development and then gradually began to shift under the covers as if she were waking perhaps she had been sleeping and she had merely dreamed the whole encounter unbeknownst to her aching mind but she knew that was not the case yet why would he come why wouldnthe announce her bluff she could fool his servants but surely she couldntfool him about something such as an exaggerated illness ahh miss hermione you re finally waking madam pomfrey said realizing now that hermione had sat up how are you feeling my dear confused she responded honestly she swallowed a lump in her throat and tried to sound convincing i swore i swore that i had heard the master voice just now but that couldntpossibly be she turned to the midwife in anticipation could it madam pomfrey had not been expecting that and she looked just as baffled as hermione felt indeed he was she said with genuine surprise he came to check on your health but why madam pomfrey looked away quickly and lightened her voice your guess is as good as mine hermione puzzled brow furrowed as she considered this what a strange creature well executed sire that girl is such a bloody fraud it almost comical draco sniped what a bloody waste of time come now draco snape drawled as they sank deeper into the dark corridor surely you must be pleased with your renewed efforts pleased draco sent the cauldron an incredulous glance hardly at any rate you have now cleared the way for the next step into moving forward with your companionship oh really draco there no point in denying what it is there no need to make it sound like a prison sentence i did nothing of the sort snape drawled your attitude is simply allowing you to hear what you expect to hear to this draco offered no response are you prepared to learn of the next task do i have a choice spectacular snape enunciated i glad to see you re finally listening to reason you re drunk ron the supposedly intoxicated redhead sat on the sturdy edge of a stone wall outside a very particular house at the fringes of the forest propped against the strong bark of a giant oak behind him he glared at harry hard who was now glaring at the nearly empty bottle of gin in his freckled hand harry ron started slurring only marginally look at me do i look drunk to you harry paused what you look like is depressed he said candidly but not without a hint of camaraderie and almost drunk almost ron repeated slowly but not quite and so he took another gloomy swig ron come on harry chided his brows furrowing together in consternation he attempted a small smile as he batted the bottle away from ron mouth this isntyou at all you re an affectionate drunk a ridiculous prank pulling fall over your own feet kind of drunk not a brooding moping makes everyone worry git of a drunk what would hermione say about this hermione doesntlike either kind of drunk ron turned to him with difficulty right harry continued feeling impatience mingle with his concern which is why you should go back inside and sleep it off so that you wonthave to disappoint her eh but she not here to stop me ron said blankly ignoring how the cold breeze chilled his skin where did the light go he thought distractedly he remembered looking at a sunrise that morning the promise of a new day of a new search but by the time he stopped again to actually see what was around him here he was alone and everything was dark that the point she not here and there nothing either of us can do about it harry eyes tightened with worry nothing either of you can do about your fool mission to drink or about her not being here either he said another swig i sure she not going to approve of this when she gets back however harry persisted who going to tell her you it possible ron chuckled but it sounded tired all right all right god harry you prat you get what you want i ll go in and lock up the house then take my sorry hide to the couch to sleep i could stay the night here too if you think you might want the company nah nah s alright ron shrugged him off as he stood wavering only slightly go back to the burrow and keep ginny and my mum company kay tell them their bloody disappointment of a son is sobering up and will be responsible and all that harry looked doubtful but acquiesced you know that she going to appreciate everything you ve been doing while she away harry reminded him gently tending to her farm and keeping her valuables safe and all ron made a noncommittal noise in the back of his throat as he steered himself up the path to hermione home but didntoffer any further comment on the matter g night harry with a strained expression harry watched him maneuver the stepping stones clutching the bottle all the while they d been almost just as concerned for ron sake the last few days as they d been for poor hermione s and the lack of any legitimate progress in spite of her secret mysterious note was all the more agitating the town frantic searching had begun to simmer down after so many empty dead end days of pursuit and harry worried that they soon might do the unthinkable they might give up goodnight ron he said thickly and watched as his friend closed the door behind him but ron didntimmediately lock up instead he exited through the back door and stumbled his way to the grassy field where hermione loved to watch the horizon he slumped to the earth in a heap and let his head loll back against the scratchy patches of grass the sound of crickets soothed him but the ground was cold and hard and the bottle was now empty he stared up at the sky marveling in the insurmountable number of stars that blinked back at him a wintry sky was the clearest he remembered hazily and the display was astounding but marveling at such a vast overwhelming unknown was too disheartening to do so alone especially after having consumed an entire bottle of gin and he desperately wished that hermione were there to share it with him share what the view or the gin shut up harry ron mumbled indistinctly as he rubbed his face hermione would know what to say to a comment like that hermione always seemed to know what to say didntshe if she were here she d be able to identify the constellations for him then tell him all about the different myths bound to each design and he would stare at her in wonder trying to hear what she was saying but grow distracted by the simple joy of her voice if she were here they would probably argue about something stupid and he would find a way to make her laugh and he would watch how her face glowed in the moonlight as she told silly stories about stars and he would enjoy merely being close to her but she not here he remembered reaching for the alcohol that was no longer there his hand dropped to the ground limp well ron murmured to himself as he drifted off to sleep my gin has gone and left me too a sound from behind him shattered the sleepy images of silent contentment and stolen kisses and ron clumsily moved to his stomach to better inspect the source of the interruption what the ron rubbed his eyes blurrily at back of auror and ronan stable hoping to dissipate some of the gin for his foggy state of mind but the noises continued he pushed himself up swaying slightly and grumbled as he pushed himself the twenty paces he needed to reach the stable entrance blimey you two ron said incredulously from behind his fingers if hermione found out how awful you were behaving what the hell are you he rubbed his eyes once more more ferociously this time and tried to calm his beating heart when he opened his eyes again the eagle owl was no longer perched atop auror stall but his heart still blasted frantically from his chest blimey he said to the two horses as they blinked back at him enough of that will you he then realized that he was being ridiculous it not like they could understand him anyway no matter how drunk or not drunk he was going crazy he muttered bitterly to himself as he slipped back outside he turned to the bottle in his hand with disgust this is your fault you know he whispered to it he started the surprisingly difficult stroll back to hermione cottage tripping on two occasions there you go harry he griped quietly back to the falling over my own feet kind of drunk just like you wanted yeah he was nearly halfway to the doorway when an inexplicable force jutted through him pulling from behind and he felt himself drawn to a halt it was as if he had walked through a sheet of ice all of a sudden but just hadntseemed to notice until was too late he shook his head in bewilderment then turned back to his bottle fucking crazy you make me no more of you for me just you watch trying to swallow the dryness in his mouth he turned back to the despicable forbidden forest tracing the patterns of the branches with hardened eyes when he spoke to the trees his voice betrayed no trace of alcohol or exhaustion it was only his voice deep and full of promise under the sole influence of determination i know you re in there hermione we ll find you he vowed i ll find you after a few moments the spell was broken and he finished his short journey back to the cottage door where he promptly stumbled inside two paces from where he once stood pansy energy hovered soundlessly in the air mystified he said what i think it a fantastic idea lavender chirped to the side simply marvelous parvati chimed please hermione please say yes i dontunderstand she said slowly more to herself than to the countless servants surrounding her bed she had barely woken the next morning let alone prepared herself for the oncoming day before a parade of servants assaulted her bed with the most spectacular news the prince had once again invited her to dine was i not in the dungeons only two days ago did we not come to some sort of agreement that we cantstand the sight of each other the sight a servant clarified from below it was little flitwick does his appearance frighten or upset you miss hermione oh nonsense hermione scoffed his countenance is nothing when compared to his disposition i could hardly care whether he were a werewolf or an overgrown pigeon were he not such a complete classist misogynist flitwick blinked up at her in uncertainty so his appearance does not strike you as alarming everything about him strikes me as alarming hermione assured him allowing the bitterness to flow through her words but not in a way that frightens me so much as it infuriates me that s relieving to hear i suppose but what really alarms me hermione pressed seeming to have not heard the servant latest remark is how he could expect anything good to come of us dining with one another we already find it quite challenging enough to behave civilly when i dont have sharp knives within reach flitwick nervously glanced up at her reassessing her temper perhaps the most alarming individual of this duo was not his master after all he insisted that you continue to take all other meals in the kitchens but that you enjoy dinner in his company in the grand dining hall henceforth mcgonagall restated patiently enjoy hermione asked crossing her arms i certain you must have paraphrased that the words perhaps are not directly quoted though the intention is the same she offered with a small smile that didntquite reach her eyes hermione looked at the worn opening of her mouth and the tight lines that created its corners indeed hermione thought incredulously but why she asked again this doesntmake any sense he wishes to ensure your good health mcgonagall explained further and the room was suddenly sent into a tizzy of murmured conversation and the wardrobe twins giggles which is why he recommends such bouts of sunlight and fresh air in order to avoid another fever something in the hat gaze told hermione that mcgonagall knew that her little illness act had not evaded the master notice but that only complicated matters more what motivation could possibly be behind such an invitation and such a specific explanation alluding to her lie was he merely trying to demonstrate how she could not fool him the more and more she thought about it the more she dreaded this dinner engagement she was positive that he had something rolled up her sleeve and that when it would finally be revealed well she wasntsure how she was going to take it but that didntmean that she wasntgoing to accept oh no she thought stubbornly if he thinks that he can scare me so easily he has another thing coming she had not seen him since the night of her escape and she was determined to maintain her ground naturally she would have to be more careful so as not to upset him nearly so badly as she had the last time but should she find a reason to stand up for herself she would do it without hesitation and his majesty should be prepared for that well flitwick prompted anxiously staring up at her as his crinkly pages shifted in his suspense hermione exchanged glances with the servants in her quarters and shrugged hopelessly in defeat do i have any choice lavender and parvati squealed with delight as flitwick and mcgonagall tried to hide their gusty sighs of relief within the hour the castle was in a whirl of gossip about what this night might mean hermione was trying her best to be polite really if hermione were to put it diplomatically she supposed that she could label the evening thus far as an awkward conversation between two awkward parties though that was being too generous there wasntmuch conversation it was just awkward it had been distinctly uncomfortable since she first stepped into the hall dressed in one of the scratchier dresses the wardrobe twins had insisted upon and it was still uncomfortable now both the dress and the situation as she self consciously sipped water from a gaudy goblet in between bites the prince had yet to make any attempts at speaking to her and hermione couldntdecide whether she was glad for the silence or if this just made her even twitchier she imagined that it had been a while since he had been in any real social setting and his embarrassment at being so put on the spot must have been making him ah grumpier than normal she tried to keep this in consideration as she delicately cut off another morsel of meat slowly and with great care as if she were really trying to cut through the tension around them she felt so on edge that the tiniest movements from the servants caused her to jump slightly and she tried to counteract this exhausting nervousness by looking anywhere at him in fact neither of them had actually laid eyes on one another for more than a few moments throughout the entirety of their evening thus far well draco began and hermione mentally cursed herself for ruining her own foul luck if i d known that this was going to be such a stimulating conversation i would have prepared myself by bringing a book she refrained from sending him a scathing look so this was how it was going to be was it starting back at square one well she could play his game and this time she wasntgoing to end up doing something stupid she was going to behave herself like a grown woman should and hold her ground diplomatically forgive me your majesty she cut into her meat with force her previous conscientiousness about table manners disregarded i was under the impression that it was preferred that i not speak until spoken to if at all i was under the impression that such social tact would be lost on you diplomacy be damned but of course hermione continued through gritted teeth i suppose that even if i had any inclination to initiate conversation i may not have much to offer i fear she offered him a distasteful smile and he narrowed his eyes after all with your estimable social skills i certain that you ve probably already exhausted countless topics of conversation with plenty of company draco glared setting down his goblet with more force than necessary well he said levelly the smoothness of his sarcasm was only barely punctuated by the roughness of his form even so what with the stature of your class and considering what levels you are able to ah manage i sure that your family hermione noticeably cringed must find you very accomplished that it hermione slammed her utensils down and a number of nearby servants jumped in less than quarter an hour you have already insulted my intelligence my class and my family all on more than one count she glared leaning forward over her meal what is your problem my problem draco rose as did his hackles the servants retreated as snape and mcgonagall surreptitiously rushed forward yes your problem you re harder to follow than a deranged owl draco snarled and she vaguely noticed midas shrink back in on himself off to the side she would apologize to him later to clear up the confusion honestly your highness if the only reason for my presence is so that you have another target for your antics then i assure you that our time would be otherwise better spent another target you blasted where are you going but hermione had already stood nodded to the servers with mumbled thanks as she excused herself and turned to leave i haventdismissed you he roared master malfoy i saved you the trouble hermione replied with a hiss already halfway to the door you are nothing but trouble he ground out as he planted himself in her path forcing her to come to a halt she flinched slightly at the rapid movement and the way she suddenly found his snarling face hovering so close to hers but she recovered quickly nothing but an overconfident little girl who obviously misunderstands her place then let me leave hermione gritted with equal vehemence despite your beliefs it painfully obvious to me that my place isnthere let me leave and neither of us will have to pretend otherwise hermione watched with unwanted curiosity as something briefly flickered over his expression her eyes narrowed a fraction trying to cling onto whatever it was that she had seen but it was already gone being disagreeable wontearn you freedom girl draco spat his voice dangerously low i warned you that your outlook would greatly affect the quality of your stay do not think that pushing me is wise master malfoy snape and mcgonagall pressed their voices nearly begging when had they all crossed the threshold into the entrance hall the girl was still glaring at him eyes coated with undiluted loathing and he was certain that his could only match with a peculiar sense of detachment he noticed that she was shaking slightly her form quivering with quiet rage with a tiredness he had not realized he felt an exhaustion that had crept all the way into his bones into his core he cut short the low growl that was blistering his throat he schooled his features back into the familiar mask of apathy and raised his stance to a more dignified position feeling his eyes refocus he pinned her with a cold gaze and simply said you are dismissed her shoulders rose as she seethed prepared to say something that would undoubtedly retract the practiced calm he had just phased into but mcgonagall was quickly hurrying her away before she could so much as open her mouth to retort he watched with distant eyes the way her shoulders trembled as mcgonagall ushered her away feeling more exhausted than before she was going to be the death of him he just knew it the feeling of pewter eyes boring into his skull made draco turn snape was waiting at the frame of the entrance to the hall and he was not pleased satisfied now draco draco mask of calm deteriorated as his brows furrowed and a distinct sneer embedded itself in his frown what are you looking at me like that for this is not my fault but snape had already turned on his so called heel and was making his way back to help clean up the mess both figuratively and literally snape mind drawled as draco followed him back into the hall he couldnthelp but notice how the servants went about their work quietly shocked as if they were dumbstruck from the whole incident to which they had been privy he wanted to tell them to wipe those looks off of their faces and to actually do some work and to mind their own damn business but he still had a bone to pick with snape and he was not going to lose this time snape draco defended he had not intended his voice to come out as such a growl but his form had other intentions this isntmy fault how could i ever get along with that with that forget about the spell for a moment draco snape cut him off with a harsh whisper low enough so that only he could hear listen to yourself look at how you treated that girl again do you think that my blood is any purer than hers but you re different draco fought back quietly after a pause and it not like i have to marry you and thank the heavens for that snape drawled impatiently the sarcasm and disappointment fueling his following words on the bright side i am certain your parents would be very proud to know that you ve held their ideals the prince eyes narrowed and he stiffened leave them out of this he whispered dangerously you have no right snape held the prince gaze for an eternity and finally he turned and left without another word draco released a breath that he hadntrealized he d been holding but the action held no satisfaction snape had left draco alone among the remaining servants and the air was silent and thick with tension it was almost as if draco could hear snape thoughts dontmake their same mistakes draco but the notion only riled him further feeling a tiny pair of eyes transfixing themselves on his profile draco immediately turned to a small teacup on the faraway table which was staring up at him unabashedly what are you looking at he snapped unthinkingly as the teacup promptly cowered under his glare and started to cry a pang shot through draco chest he opened his mouth grasping for something to say but he hadntthe slightest idea what when the mother pot came over and glared at the prince and started to console her son she turned to him in astonishment master malfoy you should be ashamed of yourself without warning an image of his mother raided his vision strong beautiful and alive in the mother pot and teacup stead draco only saw his own mother from long ago during a time when his father had been too harsh on him with his father words still echoing in his mind you re not even trying draco and unable to bear their presence any longer not the mother pot s not her teacup s nor his own memories he fled to the astronomy tower in a daze it was a week before hermione saw him again disclaimer this story is based on characters and situations created and owned

ve continued on in the story with the same characterization of neville and blaise that i used when monstrosity was first published which obviously means that my characters are a tad ooc in comparison there is so much character development in the books that i couldnthave had access to while first forming their characters in my story so please keep that in mind as you read on also i couldntfigure out what the hell to make luna butterbeer cork or a radish neither worked so i opted for a simple solution i heavily listened to solitude by david nevue while writing pansy perspective just as a heads up chapter 15 energies inside out upside down twisting beside myself stop that now cause you and i were never meant to meet i think you d better leave it not safe in here i feel a weakness coming on the walk imogen heap pansy did not sleep what need might an enchanted mirror possibly have for rest after all despite pansy endless list the curse ensured that it simply wasntmeant to be oftentimes pansy bitterly mused that perhaps she would not feel so trapped in her glass prison if she were not also trapped out of her fantasies her mind her dreams but that would have been too easy wouldntit like draco she could have slept away the endless moments of misery and unavoidable truths and with draco she could have forgotten her state if only for a time but her life though privileged in some respects had never exactly been easy so instead as always she learned to adapt night after night of listening to the unremitting sounds of the darkness and watching the gossamer of spiders spin farther and farther under the moonlight pansy eventually learned how to come to terms with her imposed insomnia the first nights were the most difficult the howling winds echoing off draco howling nightmares echoing off the howling winds and after many useless attempts to procure the elusive comfort that she could never provide she eventually learned to trace the dust and grime on her tarnished mirror as if it were a doily of lace and to forget to listen to the howls pansy no longer cried the nights eventually hushed but remained restless pansy would sit with the silence sometimes endurable sometimes deafening by measuring his breaths from the opposite edge of the room against her own and would count the minutes until dawn she eventually learned that when she no longer lived in constant fear of his nightmares she missed dreams of her own so she explored during the quiet nights when she felt that it was safe to slip away when the painful memories subsided well enough and he slept soundly enough pansy sent forth her mind eye in her travels as her energy soared across different lands and seas pansy learned the beauty of places she had only heard stories about and heard languages she didntthink she d ever understand but out of all the beauty out of all of the places she marveled at seeing places she would never before have been able to see to imagine the only places she truly wished to see were the ones cut off from her those blurry images that had been lost and forgotten in the fleeting moments of the last morning she had truly woken up but somehow she daydreamed of draco they were not true dreams even after three years the images were not clear enough the sounds were not sharp enough and all too soon the entire world of her creation would shift and fade at the slightest distraction for three years she tried and tried absentmindedness during the day when the castle had seemingly forgotten her and fantasies during the night when all were suffering in their own personal hells but her efforts never offered the familiar gratification if only she could hold onto the moment a little longer just maybe she would be able to envision the details of her wedding gown or maybe she could picture the sight that she and draco would make while greeting their kingdom from the balcony or just maybe she could know the feeling of being shrouded safely under the covers as they but always too soon the entire world of her creation would shift and fade she still yearned for it but these recent nights were rapidly distinguishing themselves from those of the past pansy was learning a new way to pass the hours since the arrival of the unseen girl pansy understanding of her existence had been turned on its head and so she began to wonder what was the difference between energy and will between phrenic energy and physical energy could one become the other could one simply will one to become the other in her heart pansy knew better than to hope she had never been strong like draco thus she started small learning and adjusting as she pushed and pulled her at her mind shaping and hardening her energy it was exhausting and pansy had no leads no guides and no results to tell her if what she was doing was right or impossible but one night as she slipped back into the castle after a particularly fascinating scene from the woman redheaded lover she inadvertently stumbled upon an unforeseen breakthrough when she released her energy back into her dormant form she awoke not in her tarnished mirror but in a mirror situated four corridors below and thus began a new era of exploration a new challenge and with it hope renewed after all she may have been locked away in a tower and she may never have been strong pansy thinks but she was no damsel in distress goodness my dear hermione blaise coughed innocently i not used to being on the receiving end of your murderous stares and it especially all the more worrying since i haventseen you look quite that murderous since the night of last week repast when blaise hermione cut in forcefully staring him down with burning eyes half scolding half pleading i d really rather not talk about it if that all right yes indeed blaise chirped and hermione took a calming breath but i was only just trying to point out that it been an awfully long time since blaise hermione cried snapping her book shut vigorously she d feel bad about it later but what he means to say hermione dean cut in smoothly sending the candlestick a warning glance is just that it been unnerving for the rest of the castle to see you cooped up here in the library for so many days at a time meaning of course hermione leaned down to stare dean straight on so many days since i ve had any run ins with your master well dean admitted trying not to look too guilty yes there is that i knew it hermione tossed her hands into the air i haventeven so much as heard from him after that horrid encounter and i would prefer to keep it that way thank you kindly dontyou think it might be just a little bit nicer if you and the master were to you know get along a little better maybe you should just try to dean but hermione neville cut in before either hermione or dean could continue we hate for you to limit yourself to the library like this we understand perfectly well that you might need a little time away from the master a little but there no need to hide yourself up here all the time neville hermione said slowly trying to overthrow her impatience with patience i like being here certainly i choose to be here because i know that the probability of running into him is much slimmer but that not entirely why hermione felt herself soften as she looked at the surrounding magnificence in awe this place is beautiful this library is more than i could have ever hoped for in such a predicament and i so grateful to you all for showing this to me especially after how miserable i was feeling she glanced at the brush the pot and the candlestick each in turn offering a placating smile i promise you that more often than not the guise of hiding from your master is simply just a convenient excuse for me to lock myself in here for hours oh neville said with a frown dean and blaise exchanged looks neville what wrong nothing the pot said but his shuffling belied his speech hermione turned to blaise and dean in curiosity well dean started sheepishly it just that we miss you miss hermione you know you spent a great deal of time with us before the library and of course we understand if you d rather not be around us after what been happening and all is that what this is all about hermione looked between the three with horrified eyes she turned to neville just as dean and blaise exchanged nervous underhanded glances neville i sorry i never meant to give any of you that impression i am so grateful for all that you ve done for me and i do enjoy your company i promise i ll make an effort to visit more often it simply that i ve never seen couldnteven fathom this many books before she looked around again in unabashed wonder i in heaven blaise brow quirked at her choice in words but thought better of commenting after a shared frown with dean blaise decided that today attempt at remedying their master hopeless prospects was not going to prove any more uplifting than the previous day s with a shrug dean signaled that blaise should change tactics and move to more lighthearted subjects lest she grow suspicious well played blaise thought despondently suppose that makes sense neville said with significantly less shuffle oi longbottom blaise inched toward him no need to mope at least you re mobile enough to visit her here unlike some of the others and you know i ve been doing a lot of thinking lately you all should be thanking me if it werentfor me you wouldnthave hermione in the first place what that now dean muttered i the one who lead her into our mismatched circle anyway so all this moping poppycock about where she spends her time is totally unnecessary that ridiculous dean chortled it could just as easily be argued that i equally responsible certainly not how so dean asked with a defensive crease in his brow is this truly a real conversation hermione asked neville with sore eyes but the disapproving lilt of her voice had not fully hidden her incredulous amusement he merely shrugged with a similar look of befuddlement your personality is not nearly so gravitating as mine blaise said loftily as he flicked away a piece of now hardened previously melted wax you may have helped pique her initial intrigue but i the one who keeps her coming back wouldntyou say so hermione er she said with a lopsided frown as she stared ever perplexed at his waggling brows hey now neville cut in and hermione was at once grateful for a rational distraction didntshe come back because the master was in danger her gratitude diminished technicalities longbottom blaise barked as hermione released a breathy laugh of helplessness she was torn between light amusement and the dark reminders of something that she had been stubbornly avoiding for days well neville huffed defensively we should be discussing technicalities it the whole point of this debate innit if anything midas should get the credit because he helped her from the forest and into the castle and i should get the credit for letting everybody know you cantjust keep adding people to the list blaised demanded next thing you know you ll be saying that crabbe and goyle should also be considered shouldntthey dean pondered they were there when hermione entered the castle as well just how many people knew about me being here in the castle before i met you hermione whispered to dean in unpleasant surprise that does it you two blaise said if you think i sharing well it quite obvious then isntit luna asked quietly and hermione almost jumped she d forgotten that luna was there although the credit for having received her as a guest is shared by all of us hermione alone is responsible for keeping herself here isntthat right hermione well hermione hesitated growing more uncomfortable under the protuberant gaze of the delicate blue book how could one look so serene all the time it didntmake sense to hermione and more often than not she found herself unsettled by the young woman unflappable nature technically your master has control over that luna nodded unperturbed but truly if you wanted to leave you could do so at any time the human balked as the book distant eyes glazed over something that was outside the window what hermione said flabbergasted that was most certainly not the truth if she were truly able to leave wouldntshe have done so by now she felt herself growing irritated but the others were already letting luna words sink in so really luna continued unfazed hermione is the one who deserves the credit luna you spoilsport blaise pouted conceding defeat she merely smiled and shrugged while hermione tried to rein in her temper what rubbish she thought prickly feeling dizzy as she watched luna sit peacefully atop the nearby desk she immediately felt awful for such negative thoughts however certainly luna and she disagreed on a number of beliefs but the least hermione could do after being displayed such loyal hospitality was to try to accept her odd antics gently she cleared her throat as if she were clearing her critical thoughts she would simply have to get used to luna and to her different ways of thinking she was going to be spending a lot of time in her general vicinity of the library after all hermione snuck a glance to once again marvel the endless shelves around her how many books could she read before she returned home it would take years maybe decades for hermione to read even half of this collection perhaps she would get the chance to read a more reasonable portion no hermione she thought you have books at home you re getting out of here before you can even make it to the first bookend but as she blankly stared at the black binding her lap and thought of her favorite red at home she realized that intention might not materialize you know for such a touted social butterfly you certainly have a penchant for bringing awkward situations upon yourself dean cried rustling his bristles in blaise direction hermione scooted her legs underneath her with an incredulous laugh lest she literally get herself into the middle of what she knew to be another harmless argument what were they even fighting about now and i d thought that ron and ginny fight a lot she smirked but there it was that familiar pang she cleared her throat again and tried to listen in on the squabble to distract herself are you sure it merely a social butterfly i could have sworn i was considered more than that i ll tell you what you re more of apparently my efforts in becoming recognized as a ladies gentleman are not coming to fruition i will have to rectify this immediately why you where are you going now off to find britney it bridgett you buffoon but the distraction didntlast next thing she knew her three guides were plodding across the carpet toward the exit goodbye she called out after them watching with slightly widened eyes as neville hurriedly responded before chasing after dean and blaise into the corridor she slid her gaze to luna still form swallowing slightly well hermione began squashing down her discomfort i suppose i ll be leaving as well i think i ll take my book back up to my room for a bit you normally spend all day here luna said to the window arentyou afraid of running into those talkative girls or perhaps you feel uncomfortable about what i said with you being able to leave the castle luna tilted to the side seeming to consider this um hermione swallowed feeling her cheeks grow warm at having been caught it true you know luna said unruffled but it all right if you re not ready to believe it just yet luna i sorry hermione said suddenly feeling rotten for her behavior i just dontworry hermione luna turned she was smiling slightly but then again wasntshe always in a way you ll be back tomorrow yes hermione nodded gently trying to return the smile she suddenly felt her skin itching to get back to her room but she wanted to try her best to be especially polite to luna from now on tomorrow she wasted no further time by moving briskly out of the room and closing the large door with a soft thud it wasntthat she disliked being alone with luna she d spent a great deal of time around her over the course of the last week and had only felt mildly discombobulated it was just that what she had said earlier still had hermione mind reeling luna obviously couldnthave known what she was talking about she always talking about strange things like turnips being some sort of plum or little creatures spinning through people fuzzy minds this isntany different so lost in her thoughts hermione accidentally ran herself into the corner of one of the darker corridor turns with a small gasp of pain and a quietly uttered rare curse ron would be proud she thought distantly hermione propelled herself back away from the wall and regained her composure she hated how distracted she had been lately not only was it not helping her planning but it also continually reminded her of just how far out of her element she was she was hermione for god sake with everything that she knew about herself or at least thought i knew she should have been much farther along in her escape planning and not running absentmindedly into walls and especially not without the excuse of having done so with her nose stuck in a book the longer she spent her time in this castle the more and more she began to worry that its influence was beginning to change her character but that was silly it d only been just over a week as she was shuffling the fabric of the robes she wore for warmth voices from around the long passage of the corridor drifted toward her you think the library will distract her well even if she were to find out there not a whole lot she can still do is there hermione stiffened immediately swiftly flattening herself into the shadows at the corner with which she had just collided her eyes narrowed and her ears pricked and she stilled her breathing until she nearly forgot to breathe at all it wontbe long until he comes back one of the servants whispered i just know it that man is always coming around ranting and raving and now that we ve reacted so strongly he bound to be suspicious but we always drive him away the other member of the pair countered they were nearing her now we just acted as we normally did you re growing paranoid only because he mentioned her you just wait the first said stubbornly he ll be back and then he ll come with all those search parties that he been shouting about and when he finds out that she been here the whole time he ll do more than just demand for miss hermione again mad eye her mind thought desperately i refuse to be drawn into your delusions just because he came to the castle calling for her doesntmean the he has the slightest idea that she actually here i dontknow the other said and hermione watched as they finally came into the light and they continued on passing her she pressed herself more firmly into the shadows willing herself to become invisible should they look behind we can never really predict what he ll do next can we sure we can the other said suddenly boisterous and hermione breath caught in her throat as always constant vigilance their raucous laughter continued on all the way until they had passed into the next corridor leaving hermione in the shadows she let her body slide down into a heap against the wall feeling the robes and the fabric of her dress snag in resistance against her movement and her precious book thudded softly to the floor beside her knees she sat there for a moment limply digesting the information that the two servants had unknowingly supplied her and did something for the second time that day that she so rarely did otherwise damn she whispered and let her head fall back against the stone she ignored the pain and dolefully mused that ron would be proud had he been around to hear it damn damn damn damn damn she let it all out in a rush covering her eyes with the heels of her palms what was she going to do would midas let her write another note could she actually rely on mad eye he d been so wrongfully right about so many things but this this was her escape could she count on him to find her to help her and why was she pondering all of this out in the middle of a dark corridor her mind was suddenly confronted with the image of unexpectedly running into him while mucking about aimlessly on his stone floor and before she knew it she was up and bounding through the corridors back to her rooms and so ended another evening each day hermione grew closer to those around her biding her time and shielding her secrets while finding herself enjoying their company and ultimately waited for the moment that would allow her the chance to earn her freedom was she a coward for hesitating was she a fool for allowing herself to gradually grow more and more attached was she a liar for plotting to leave while leading them to believe that she would stay was she a traitor for finding moments in which she was truly enjoying herself all as her loved ones agonized over her from miles away each day as sleep closed in around her and her spinning thoughts lurched and gave way to her dreams the silent tears escaped before hermione had any chance of stopping them how ironic she contemplated hazily just before sleep overcame her that these tears seem to be the only part of me that have any will of their own blaise you dolt we should be heading back to the library and keeping an eye on hermione until she retires for the night not endlessly traipsing around after females dean blaise turned back as he scuttled down the corridor i have no idea what your plans are for the evening but i currently en route to our meeting with sir snapey snape neville choked oh i d better be going just a minute neville dean interrupted not bothering to take his gaze off the candlestick what meeting dean come now tell me you didntforget mcgonagall informed us last night that she would be unable to receive our reports this evening and that good ol snapey would be meeting with us in her stead well i wouldntwant to bother neville hold it dean cut off the pot once more eyes still fixed on blaise what was with all of that talk about bridget and social butterflies and rectifying social perceptions just now come dean blaise scooted himself closer to the paintbrush surely you dontthink our hermione is too wrapped up in her dilemma to notice some of the inner workings of this castle i mean what if she were to suspect that we are constantly rushing off to see the authorities after every day with her but we are rushing off to the authorities after every day with her dean grumbled we re practically spies which is precisely why it so important that we draw her attention away from our connections to the higher ups as much as possible no obviously as lowly servants of the castle we are obligated to some mode of interaction with the commanders but if we really want her to open up well we have to make it seem like we re on her side you know but neville sputtered softly arent we on her side yes yes blaise muttered impatiently once she falls in love and is happy then we ll all be human again and be happy so in actuality her side is the same side as the castle but as she cannot yet know that we re all on the same side obviously we just have to make it appear that we re more on hers than the master s and besides hermione is an independent soul you know i hardly think that she d appreciate anyone clinging to her so fiercely and whatnot you are off your rocker dean deadpanned so we re on both sides neville speculated with a thoughtful frown like double agents what blaise snapped impatiently no no oh fine whatever like double agents then does that mean snape is a double agent too neville pondered aloud ha if anything snape is the biggest double agent of all blaise barked with laughter not only does he have to pretend that he on hermione side for hermione sake but conversely he also has to emphasize the fact that he on the master side just to get an ounce of his cooperation if you can call it that and has to put up with zabini was it a deep cold voice rose from the shadows farther along the corridor i was really hoping that our last conversation about minding one tongue wouldntneed to be revisited so soon m master malfoy blaise blurted inelegantly before lowering himself into a humble bow dean and neville followed suit immediately neville unfortunately seemed to have lost some dirt in the process his incontestably shaking form probably had something to do with it forgive me sire where the girl draco voice droned after a pause in the library my lord blaise managed with more composure we ve left her with luna the librarian while making our way to our meeting with snape for the evening report that wontbe necessary draco said with a steely tone it is no longer snape or mcgonagall concern you will not seek out either again but will instead report your findings directly to me henceforth dean and neville watched on in silence not daring to chime in oh snape is not going to like this blaise thought and we are going to be the ones to get the beating for it my lord blaise swallowed thickly and tried to dismiss his nervousness with a small cough if you re certain draco brow rose in distaste impatience complementing his contemptuous mien follow me the three trinkets followed wordlessly paying close attention to the respectful distance between themselves and their master heels the additional challenge of meeting his long stride with no legs on which to support themselves made for a particularly noisy journey despite the verbal silence and blaise tried to ignore the unmistakable irritation that was rolled into each of the master clenched fists when they reached a small outside balcony at the opposite end of the castle draco pushed the doors open without consideration of his strength and the battered wooden edges pounded against the outer stonewalls forcefully enough to scatter a small flock of nocturnal birds from the nearby tree branches the three followed their master farther into the darkness as draco perched himself on the stone ledge and settled himself against the wall of the castle exterior so draco sighed impatiently without giving blaise the impression that he actually desired that they continue report yes sire blaise began quickly as you may have surmised your plot to bestow upon her the library was highly successful so successful in fact that miss hermione has begun spending nearly almost all of her days there only leaving at meal times and i know that draco ground out searching for his patience i already know about her routine you fool or indeed have you forgotten our last conversation blaise mouth ran dry firstly you should warn your fellow servants that where the girl is i will most likely be in hearing range thus it would be wise to mind one tongue when the alpha is present n no sire splendid draco replied acerbically continue my lord blaise tentatively leaned forward forgive me but perhaps our meeting would most e efficiently serve your time if you were to tell me that which you would most like to know he gulped my lord very well draco eyed the candlestick shrewdly what happened after last week encounter what has she said of me while not in the library that deceitful power hungry raging coward of a ungrateful loathsome worm riding out his superiority complex while cocky selfish tenacious piece of nothing but a snippy overgrown terrier who she ah seems to be cooling down after last week incident blaise responded circumspectly no doubt that in a few days her anger will have simmered down enough to attempt another audience in your presence so long as we somehow find a way to trick her or bribe her into doing it and all without her knowing that it was our doing draco pointed him with a blank stare and blaise belatedly realized that he needed to brush up on his acting skills in the master presence he coughed nervously and what have you told her of us how much does she know oh dear blaise thought and vaguely wondered how he could feel his heart drop into his stomach when he technically had neither blasted phantom pains for the sake of consistency blaise began forcing himself to eradicate the slight tremor from his voice mcgonagall has informed us of the points of conversation that she shared with hermione on the night of her arrival as well as the manner of her reaction she told miss hermione very briefly that our kingdom was once prosperous but that a curse was placed upon us after the king and queen passing rest their souls dean and neville suddenly muttered quietly in unison carry on draco said gruffly his brows knitting themselves together she is aware of snape influence in the castle and of midas connection to sybill she knows that the curse affected us all differently but she neither knows that there is a cure nor a timeline she has absolutely no idea that we have less than three months and that she herself is the key she was mortified by the gypsy supposed cruelty in leaving you to your fate without any remedy especially as she is fully aware of what fate awaits us should the curse prevail and has promised to help us find a solution in whatever ways she could convenient draco rumbled his eyes bore into blaise s who gulped and what does she know of the curse impetus she she was informed of the nature of your state that night and what consequently transpired and how did she fare draco bit out she didntreact according to mcgonagall draco likewise didntrespond mcgonagall also might have used the moment as an opportunity to put in a few words in your favor blaise added cautiously meaning well blaise coughed slightly she may have taken a bit of liberty in embellishing your character to soften the blows so to speak spit it out zabini draco growled she may have mentioned that you care about people exceedingly and that you are young and insecure and lost against all better judgments blaise involuntarily released a nervous chuckle that mcgonagall draco quietly seethed as his lips reached back to reveal his fangs his fur rising on end neville and dean instinctively took a step back i am going to but he cut himself off opting instead to press his knuckles into his temples in what blaise hoped was a calming manner with a huff of hot air from his nostrils draco rounded on blaise what else has she mentioned blaise heard the question floating through the air lingering at the surface but read the real question in draco burning glare and what of him what of the traitor nothing else your majesty and blaise said quietly and bowed low and deep the balcony was thick with a long pause she does not know of he who must not be named very well draco said finally i suppose this may work to my advantage after all although it was entirely unacceptable for any member of this castle to divulge such knowledge i suppose that some pity might soften that sharp tongue of hers and i ll be able to milk her disadvantage for all it worth his laugh was a sneer as if already playing the picture in his mind but anyone who so much as even breathes a word on the matter of that night hereafter will answer to me draco fixed his glare on the three terrified servants individually lingering on the candlestick be sure to make this clear to your workmates yes sire now draco rapped his claws against his bent knee what are your proposals for the next course of action blaise took a moment to organize his thoughts his brows furrowing together in deep concentration as you are aware her time is majorly spent in the confines of the library hermione is very sociable but also very introspective and seems to treasure her time alone just as much as she enjoys the company of others her energy is very much influenced by those in her presence however logical hermione may be she appears to be driven by emotion especially that of those surrounding her thus the next encounter with her would undoubtedly be most successful for both parties with a smaller audience if any draco stared at the small candlestick below him an inquisitive brow rising slightly from its crease it seemed that the master hadntexpected his response to be so extensive and you think the girl would be responsive to this sort of proposition the incredulous slant of his eyes made blaise shift uncomfortably but he didntstep back no blaise said firmly looking into his master narrowing eyes not yet she is still reeling from the previous encounter as well the consequences of her attempted escape when draco bit out impatiently we have been doing our best to win you her favor blaise replied slowly carefully minding his words he doubted that we ve been begging her to come out of the library so you the master could just get off of our bloody backs already and see her in the first place so that everyone could just get on with the wooing and so you could get hitched and turn human again and really people is it really so hard for crying out loud would be taken very well when give us three days your highness blaise requested with a slight bow we will ensure her cooperation for another audience with you in three day time draco considered him for a moment and what say you about the nature of this meeting another attempt at dining together so soon would be unwise blaise stated prudently i would recommend considering another venue that would better suit both of you draco scoffed so long as i never again have to witness how uncouthly she is able to ruin a piece of meat with a mere fork draco wrinkled his noise churlishly while the others frowned just as well i will consider it blaise nodded respectfully his lips still quirked downward she is totally oblivious to any of our efforts in aiding your courtship but she is steadily becoming more comfortable in the castle with the accessibility of the library perhaps if the connection between the library and yourself were made absolutely not draco said quickly bringing his suggestion to an end if she learns it will be my decision and on my terms you ll do well to remember that yes sire there was another uncomfortable pause in which blaise did not find it appropriate to provide further input and draco did not prompt him for additional information blaise could feel his form returning to a regular state of calm despite the master presence and wondered if perhaps he would ever find feeling unflustered in such scenarios commonplace he imagined not you two draco gestured with the tilt of his head toward neville and dean near the door what have you noticed of the girl behavior that will aid me having thought themselves forgotten the two had unwittingly lulled themselves closer to a state of calm at the sound the master question dean stilled just marginally but neville form seized with fright well dean coughed slightly finding his voice hermione has certainly been educated though for what cause of with what resources we do not know she is perfectly literate and can read as well as write she has an extensive knowledge of history and of foreign cultures most likely as a consequence of her avid reading hermione lives on a farm just at the other edge of the forest nevilled added she grew up elsewhere and moved to a village on the outskirts of the forest when she was young hermione doesntcare for fancy things dean continued his voice growing more confident she prefers simple pleasures most of the time and most of all with reading and acquainting herself with the servants she doesntdrink nevilled chimed doesntgamble blaise muttered hermione also isntone for cursing and is actually quite reproving of zabini linguistic tendencies dean snickered she also very prone to looking out for others nevilled nodded she comes to meals early to help us with chores and even stays late afterward to talk to us while we clean she been very nearly giving the teacups heart attacks during meal times when she tries to stop them from enough draco ground out the others immediately stilled into silence and he eyed them hard you speak of her with such striking familiarity for only having been acquainted just over a week ago they shifted uncomfortably she has been well received by those in the castle my lord dean said simply draco eyes narrowed so it seems he whispered coldly before turning to blaise and what else of her home what has she told you about those in the village those who are undoubtedly looking for her she has not mentioned them my lord draco paused and his sneer faltered what he snapped she has not spoken of them sire blaise repeated we do not know anything else about the place from where she came and you haventaskedfor what reason she is very forthright with many of her thoughts your highness dean explained she offers a great deal to us regularly and with the limited time and less than ideal circumstances it hasntbeen appropriate to pry draco chest heaved with an irritated sigh well what of her family then blaise paused before speaking we ve noticed your highness that above all else hermione does not speak of her family there was a moment in which blaise felt his eyes connect with the master s blaise saw something flash within his irises that shook through him but he couldntbe certain as to what he d seen had it been surprise disbelief understanding but his master blinked and it was gone your majesty blaise began with another respectful bow after another careful shake to clear his head we have been doing all that we can to serve your purpose in wooing our guest and wish to aid you whatever ways possible and in order to fully assist you it would be best if we better understood a fuller scope of your feelings toward miss hermione what exactly is it that you want to know zabini draco eyes glowered down suspiciously we have spent a great deal of time learning about miss hermione feelings your highness blaise explained slowly but unless we know where you stand on the matter it will be impossible to push her i suppose in the right direction he looked up at his master expectantly half dreading and half praying that is hardly relevant draco said evenly as he lifted his chin haughtily blaise restrained a sigh you can take the aristocrat out of his snooty features but you canttake the snoot out of the aristocrat arentyou the least bit concerned that even if she does fall for you the spell cure will be null and void if you dontfeel anything for her dean and neville were shaking their heads fervently from behind blaise back trying with all of their might to telepathically tell blaise to step down remember his place and to just shut his trap already because he going to get us killed or mauled or that wontbe an issue draco spat coldly that blasted gypsy will get her lesson in respect and humility all right and after all draco removed a piece of dust from his cloak with distaste as soon as the spell is broken i ll have my fair share of company from the concubine mistresses regardless it was at the tip of blaise tongue forgive me sir but i not really certain that how true love works but he thought better of it just in time not to mention he could practically feel the gazes of his two companions searing through him and besides like you would know zabini you hypocrite yes sire continue forward with your current schemes draco said levelly gazing out into the encroaching darkness and i will expect an audience with the girl in no less than three days blaise shifted his gaze to the floor and heaved a sigh yes master november the month had changed by now hermione was sure of it she ticked off the days in her mind counting and recalling dates that had escaped her memory in the greater scheme of dangers which she had confronted recently the weather was growing frostier with each passing hour and soon her bills would need to be paid her animals prepared and her land put in order some part of her knew that she could rely on the weasleys to aid her in such a time of need but hermione knew that she couldntexpect couldntwant them to go through so much trouble for long and when the loan collectors came for payment naturally the weasleys would meet with them mr weasley her legal guardian owned the deed to her land after all as a woman she had no hope of claiming land of her own and it was one of her greatest fortunes in life to have befriended such a loyal generous family under more dire circumstances she would have been forced into marriage immediately following her parents deaths and for everything that the weasleys had done to ensure her independence and to save her from such a fate she was eternally grateful but how much could she truly hope for them to save when she was no longer there to maintain their gracious burden the book that she had been resting against her folded knees drifted slowly out of her focus and into the waxing shadows she sat comfortably reclining against an inviting assortment of throw pillows in her favorite window nook in one of the far corners of the library but it seemed that her evasion tactics couldntwork any longer her thoughts were finally catching up with her absentmindedly she let the black cover fall back over her place marked thumb and let her mind wander through the glass and over the snow kissed trees back home what would happen to her assets she immediately thought of her mother and father prized possessions her most precious belongings hermione was not a material girl but she treasured her mother old locket her father old books her ronan and auror surely the weasleys would do all that they could to keep them as safe as possible but what would she do without her farm how would she make money to live to repay them she would have no choice but to marry ron she immediately squashed the dread that flooded her at the thought and then colored at the intensity of her reaction hermione knew that while the weasleys were kind people she was not unaware of mrs weasley intentions for her and ron to be wed always like a second daughter hermione and her parents had been inserted into the weasley circle seamlessly and fully and there was nothing that such openhearted souls wouldntdo for their family but hermione had to wonder would the weasleys have agreed to assist her so completely after her own family demise had they not believed that she would soon join theirs legally she shook her head forcefully she would not think such things she loved the weasleys each and every one of them even arrogant percy and she would not question their acts of kindness even said acts were part of a shameless well intentioned underlying match making plot they were her family in one shape or another and without them and harry she would have no one and besides hermione thought forgetting herself already if i dontget out of here soon it looks like mrs weasley will get her wish anyway but wasnta happy marriage one of her wishes too the book shifted deeper into her lap her place and page forgotten it was true that marriage was one of her wishes but she couldntbe sure that it was what she truly wanted so soon in a few years hermione would be considered an old maid but she couldntimagine the idea of holding such binding commitments with so much living left to do two years ago she had dreamt of returning to the city and attending one of the universities that allowed women studies of continuing on in her father footsteps of ensuring the continuation of her education perhaps publishing a book of her own no her parents had passed on and with them died those dreams she had a different life ahead of her now and she had grown to accept it hadntshe why was her heart resisting even after her mind had reconciled with that fact so long ago what would her parents have thought of her indecision at a time like this a time of survival and dare she think it she didntwant to think it settling settling she thought and it was like the perfect pin to prick to her heart in every meaning of the word but she already knew that even if they had been alive if they had survived it not as if they would have had any recollection of who she was anyway the book finally slipped from her lap the floor but she didntnotice it all seemed inevitable now that she stared at her future head on without the distractions of a home to run and without the preoccupations of avoiding her moody captor as soon as she left this castle and returned home she would have to marry ron for certain no matter what her feelings were i love him she whispered softly to herself and knew in her heart that it was true but there were many kinds of love the word was not bound to one meaning to one kind of bond did she love him in a way that would allow her to overlook the pain and suffocation she would feel from her inevitable dependence on him for the rest of her life and as a traitorous thought flashed through her mind blinding like a white light the pin pricked further puncturing the very core of her heart would i simply be trading one prison for another oh her breath left her in a graceless whoosh and her hand flew to her chest as if she were trying to trap it inside oh ron she apologized wordlessly oh ron i sorry for thinking such terrible thoughts you dontdeserve this uncertainty this bitterness it not your fault and i only wallowing in my own misery when all you want to do is be there for me and to help me and god what are you thinking through all of this this soon became all too much to bear her silent tears trailed down her colored cheeks and hung dolefully at her jaw few and fragile though they were as they graced the dying sunlight with their presence since the day she looked on as her father released his dying breath it was the first time her tears had seen anything but the safe hidden seclusion of her bed but hermione did not care to shield them now not when the cutting truth of her imminent future was suddenly laid bare and exposed before her and now that she no longer had any other shield within her power to protect herself from the truth not when she was alone and out of sight so hermione sat in her favorite nook in the library with her temple pressed against the glass and let the tears fall by the time luna had trickled into her alcove much later with neville and blaise and dean in tow hermione tears had dried and dispelled they saw her cheerful smile her bright eyes but nothing of the breathiness left by her tired lungs and nothing of the disguise but hidden from the shadows draco had seen it all when he entered through the doorway ripping away and casting aside the sheet of cloth that some servant or other had suspended at the frame earlier in the week pansy could barely contain her excitement draco she cried pressing her fingers against the glass in anticipation where have you been all day i ve been waiting for you forever you ll never guess what i ve taught myself to do i dontknow why i didntthink of it before it really such a simple concept but i ve been working on it for days and i ve really got the hang of it now and i think that with just a little bit more draco are you even listening to me draco stood in the middle of the room clenching and unclenching his claws rhythmically with his deep labored breaths pansy brow creased in confusion watching the way his paws were shaking just enough to be visible to her trained eyes she sobered instantly and leaned back away from the glass what happened nothing he snapped his head ticking to the side in irritation obviously something happened she pressed her fingers brushed against the dirty edges doilies and lace doilies and lace of her mirror you can tell me she whispered werentyou just blathering on about something he twisted his scowl in her direction pansy took a deep breath maintaining eye contact just wait it out she thought try to distract him with something else while he cools down just like normal just like you always do pansy i was saying that i ve finally found a way to see things other than just by using my energy she exclaimed unable to keep the brightness from her voice it not perfect and of course i cantfully escape but i can leave the mirror and move around to other reflective surfaces you you can leave the mirror pansy beamed ecstatic from the awe she heard in his voice yes like i said it not perfect but with a little work on the contrary draco said his voice scathing despite the frigidity as he started for the balcony this is quite lovely now you can finally give me some damn privacy pansy body seized as if she d been struck her mouth hanging agape in shock her chest certainly felt as if she d been struck by something draco she called out half appalled half devastated she had been trying so hard trying so hard to do this for him for them for herself and he couldnteven care he paused at the entry of the balcony his claws lingering against the stone frame he did not turn around to face her fully she saw only his profile in the shadows of the twilight draco does not apologize she knew and she braced herself for further impact i just want this girl out of my castle as soon as possible he said and the sound of his voice broke her doilies and lace doilies and lace doilies and lace she stared open mouthed in shock as the invisible force that had struck returned once more in a wave that encircled her entire body as he swept out of sight and onto the veranda pansy fell to the pressure closing in on her lost her balance and fell against the glass with a small gasp breathing in ragged bouts of air pansy head felt light with epiphany draco wanted the girl out of the castle pansy needed no further invitation disclaimer this story is based on characters and situations created and owned by jk rowling various publishers including but not limited

again for your support your reviews and your expressed interest in this story is what has helped bring this story back as always kite1011 you re the monstrosity savior and irene my old beta if you read this i miss you three years later not very far from what was once the beautiful magnificent castle of prince draco and his loved ones was a village in a place called england this provincial town was extremely small yet filled with pleasant people and charming landscapes it was also what one might consider common anything exciting or out of the ordinary happened very rarely in this lifestyle of simplicity and as with any quaint rural village one personal business was always public knowledge within this collective community of helpful neighbors there was the baker the blacksmith the carpenter the bookseller the silversmith and the like secrecy and privacy were nonexistent all gossip was welcome gossip if something happened monumental or trivial no one would be left in the dark good morning hermione good morning madam pince the young woman known as hermione granger stepped into the small book shop near the center of the market she looked at ease in her plain blue dress with her long wavy brown hair plaited pragmatically as it rested against her shoulders meanwhile the strict bookseller known as madam pince projected her persistently stern personality through a customary cold gaze and firm features stretched taut from a too tight bun even as madam pince eyes warmed slightly at the sight of her favorite customer they somehow still managed to convey a chilled suspicion hermione remembered that her friend ron once described madam pince in a voice much too loud and too tactless to be stated in the woman own bookshop of all places as a thin irritable woman who looked like an underfed vulture for which hermione promptly slugged him on the arm regardless by some means hermione and madam pince had come to share a certain understanding while hermione would be forever grateful for ginny harry and ron madam pince was the only person with whom hermione could really discuss books her one true home away from every morning hermione would walk down from her house on the top of the hill at the farthest end of the town and across the bridge to the market with no small amount of frugality she would buy only what she needed for the day and just before she began her walk back to her small house she would stop by the bookstore what do you recommend hermione asked immediately making way to a bookshelf on the left she quickly skimmed through the large titles written on the various spines with her forefinger pausing at the middle of the shelf to look at the bookseller what do i recommend the bookseller raised a thin brow dear i should be asking you for recommendations goodness knows you ve read every book i have at least twice madam pince looked at hermione watching her smile as she traced the patterns of grain in the wooden shelf which do you prefer madam pince smiled slightly a sight many customers never got a chance to see madam pince knew her beloved books would be taken care of with hermione almost since the first moment she d met hermione madam pince had deemed her worthy of being one of the few people in england worthy of the very rare privilege of borrowing the books from her small shop rather than purchasing her finds and besides madam pince thought if i didn t i wouldnthave anything left to sell and of course after everything hermione had been through well it was the least she could do hm hermione bit her bottom lip thoughtfully i guess it d have to be this one hermione stood on her tip toes to pluck a rather archaic book with a red cover from the highest shelf madam pince rested her elbows on the counter and began carefully flipping through the pages this one my favorite i assumed it was she let her glasses fall to the bridge of her nose as she tipped her head downward to look at hermione seeing as you ve read it four times oh i love it hermione told her instantly her eyes came alight and her cheeks flushed as she began summarizing the story elaborating further on her favorite parts all the while madam pince watched her with amusement and she smiled when hermione re enacted the villain being slain by the heroine that the kind of story i like she said thoughtfully a story with a heroine she trailed a finger along the title seeing something beyond the letters there arentmany stories like these ah madam pince fixed her with a disconcerted stare i see and what about a story where the heroine falls in love especially a story like that hermione laughed lightly drawn from her reverie like this story especially this story she gently flipped a page in the book resting on the counter then quickly closed it feeling as if she had suddenly revealed too much of herself in so few seconds madam pince made a decision then you ll just have to let me borrow it eventually i d love to read it madam pince said casually gently sliding the red book towards hermione hermione brows drew together in confusion what do you mean well seeing as there only one copy of this book in town and i am now giving it to you i will need to borrow it from you in order to read it madam pince said hermione opened her mouth but quickly closed it surely you cantjust give this book to me hermione asked disbelieving i have to pay for it just like everyone else she was already pulling her coin purse out of her satchel my dear you are one of the only few in this town with enough sense to read these books of mine madam pince answered reasonably you love this book more than anyone but your sales hermione argued it would be money from your pocket hermione bit her lip again no i sorry but i cantaccept it she shook her head slightly hermione you deserve this book and no one else will bother to read it the fools she said the last two words with no small tinge of annoyance then she said in a much softer tone please take it madam pince slid the book towards her again but hermione was in turmoil hermione it is free of charge madam pince insisted patience dripping from her every word couldntyou at least sell it to me for half price hermione fingered the title lovingly staring at the red cover corners where it was beginning to rip i d feel so guilty if you were to give it to me for nothing madam pince sighed half price if you wish but really there would be no problem at all if you were to just take it for free madam pince waited as hermione dug for the correct number of coins and paid her madam pince hesitated when hermione handed the money to her who truly needed it more are you positive you dontwant free of charge yes i positive she promised she took the red book and slid it carefully into her satchel careful not to crush the fresh loaves of bread and her small bag of sugar the smile on her face told madam pince all that she needed to know thank you madam pince goodbye i ll see you tomorrow goodbye dear as the door closed a small ringing bell attached to the top corner permeated the bookshop she watched hermione through the glass window until she was no longer in view and then returned to the back of the shop to take inventory with a sigh the poor girl when hermione reached her small home it was already midday humming to herself as she walked up the wide rock path that led to her doorway it was only as she rounded the large birch tree that she noticed a figure sitting on her doorstep hello ginny hermione called out with a smile quickening her pace to a brisk walk as ginny came to meet her what are you doing here harry and i are going to the park in a bit she finally reached hermione side since your house is nearest i thought i d come up here for a while before i left unfortunately i forgot that today is the day you walk all the way down to the bakery i glad i did dobby was having a sale on my favorite kind of bread this morning and i bought one of the first batches i cantwait to taste it hermione inhaled deeply imagining the scent of the air to be the fresh smell of her dinner you know you could have just asked me to pick some up on the way ginny said carefully avoiding large rocks on the path it not too far from my house and i could have easily picked up your food for you then you wouldnthave had to go anywhere today oh i know hermione said as she too averted the large stones but i love the scenery besides i stopped by madam pince shop again to get a book of course ginny rolled her eyes you were just there yesterday but i suppose that hardly matters what book did you get she asked hermione carefully slipped the book out of her satchel of course ginny sighed with a resigned shrug i surprised she hasntjust given it to you yet well this morning she tried to but i paid for it hermione said slipping it back into her satchel you mean she offered it to you for free and you still paid she frowned at her friend why i just felt guilty taking it it wasnta gift for a special occasion or anything it just felt wrong somehow i dontknow hermione sighed i know i probably should have just taken it considering i donthave enough money as it is but still well at least we settled for half price hermione attempted to smile but why did you come here before you went to the park i would ve thought you d want to walk with harry hermione raised a brow as she reached the front step well began the sixteen year old redhead i was going to but ron said he was going to come visit later i suggested that harry keep him company until they got here then we d walk the rest of the way together strange but if hermione didntknow any better she d swear that ginny was fixating her gaze on nearest tree a little too intently as if she d never seen one before so as you know my dad birthday is tomorrow you re coming to his birthday dinner arentyou ginny asked still looking anywhere but at hermione she raised a brow at the swift change of subject oh right sure of course hermione assured her of course i coming you live all the way on the other side of town and usually ron doesntcome here unless harry or you are with him why would ron come up here alone hermione asked slipping a key on a silver chain off her neck she unlocked the door in front of her and opened it wide suddenly the brass door handle was even more interesting to ginny than the tree what is going on with her hermione thought who knows what goes through my brother head ginny grumbled almost to herself i certainly don t hmm i wonder hermione walked to her small kitchen and set her satchel on the kitchen table ginny hermione asked in a tone that made ginny suddenly nervous is there something you want to tell me she sighed look i wasntsupposed to say anything but ginny was cut off by a knock on the door hermione looked at the door with an expression of mild annoyance go on hermione ushered nervously glancing back at ginny no really we should get the door ginny suggested extremely pleased with the timely interruption which only exacerbated hermione fraying nerves before hermione could stop her or even say another word ginny was greeting the guests hello harry ginny said cheerfully and the creature who is unfortunately a relative of mine ginny said this with much less enthusiasm well it nice to see you too ron said with just as much cheerfulness as his sister hey ginny said harry as he shiftily glanced toward the kitchen after saying hello to hermione he immediately made his move to depart are you ready to go ginny looked back at hermione who made every grand effort to radiate her clearest ginny weasley dontyou dare leave whatever this is on me warning message but to no avail ginny making the executive decision that it was best to not say another word all but propelled harry into the yard she could practically hear them running from the house what was that all about hermione asked as she walked to the window pulling back the white curtain she saw the couple walking down the road the way they had come harry arm around ginny lower back the two were conversing about something that obviously had them worried and were most certainly not going in the direction of the park ron shrugged from behind her dunno he muttered quietly before nervously running his fingers through his flaming red hair ironically he wasnttrying to get his hair to stay down but was rather trying to make it stick up for fear of it being too neat he stopped quite abruptly when hermione turned back around i talked to ginny hermione sat down on a couch next to the door oh ron said erm you you did he shifted on his feet what did you talk about hermione couldnthelp but notice how nervous he sounded as she sat down on the couch well about your father birthday dinner tomorrow firstly then how she and harry were going to the park with that she scoffed the little liar also about how you were coming up to visit me only she never told me why not that i mind or anything but normally you wouldntcome unless you were with ginny or harry he sat down next to her on the couch facing her yeah oh yeah about that he swallowed hermione he looked away to watch her trace the design in the fabric with her index finger mmm hm have you he started but he seemed to change his mind and steered the conversation in a new direction we re friends right hermione was taken aback by this question well of course we are what kind of question is that ron you re being daft hermione smiled a little and she saw some tension leave ron shoulders he even laughed a little well yes but have you he still didntseem to be pleased with his conversation have you ever thought about us being he looked back at her eyes holding his breath only to find that she was looking at him with amusement it was understandable he wasntmaking very much sense not even to himself let alone her more more than just friends uh oh despite all persevering attempts at denial hermione had almost had a feeling for weeks now that something like this might happen she had started to notice small signs in ginny behavior in ron comments and harry conversations but she had ignored it all too willingly today should have been a glaring confirmation normally harry would have been in no hurry to leave he d much rather sit around and eat her homemade food the only problem with accepting reality was that hermione didntwant to have a conversation like this today so what was hermione only option play dumb well sure hermione was surprised at how fast his nervous expression dissipated and was instantly replaced with a glowing triumph she was unfortunately less surprised at its immediate departure after she replied you and ginny and harry are all like family to me since my parents she paused slightly since my parents died each of you have been there for me she said in a softer and quieter tone i cantever thank you enough no no ron said in a tone just as soft ron had fears too he knew that something like this would happen what was he thinking he didntwant to be the one to stir up bad memories he thought he had waited long enough after her parents accident to finally tell her but now it obviously seemed that he hadntwaited long enough but he couldntturn back now i mean you and i have you ever thought that maybe we could be he didntseem to know how to finish he didntneed to however because hermione was starting to pity the blatant struggle she was pushing him through and had begun to pretend to catch on she d stopped tracing the design with her finger i mean not like family but not friends no i mean friends but as he tried to explain himself further his ears started to turn pink more than that momentarily hermione lost herself and tried to stifle a giggle finding his genuineness more endearing and heartwarming to her than he could ever realize she tried covering it with her hand but it was too late ron noticed she knew it would be misconstrued and she desperately didntwant to hurt his feelings after all hermione knew how flustered ron could get and laughing wouldntdo anything to help in this situation what so funny ron demanded indignantly i trying to say something he said obviously frustrated with himself hermione sobered and calmed herself making sure that she would listen intently to whatever he said next i sorry ron she said sincerely go ahead and say what you were going to say you know i not good with words ron started staring at his hands in his lap i always say things i dontmean and mean things that i dontsay this brought a smile to hermione lips and some more tension lifted off his slouched shoulders he locked gazes with her so i just going to have to say it then ron did something that shocked her greatly he gently slid his hands over to hers clasping his fingers carefully around her small newly calloused hands he grasped them in both of his the next thing he said showed no sign of nervousness whether he felt it or not and it had such a serious tone that hermione couldnttear her eyes away have you ever thought that we could be together i hermione was too stunned to even form a sentence i suppose i have she whispered still excruciatingly aware of his hands holding hers i know this is sudden ron said or perhaps not so sudden but either way i ve liked you for a long time hermione i always have even if i didntalways know it ever since you and your parents moved here when you were little i ve only just realized it recently i realized it before the the accident he glanced back up at hermione eyes praying that she not cry he didntlike bringing up any subject relating to how hermione parents died especially to her i sorry i shouldnthave no hermione said quietly it okay really go on then hermione surprised him and herself when she slowly caressed his hands with her thumbs encouraging him to continue empowered by this action he nodded i realized my feelings just before and after it happened i was just too afraid to say anything i mean i still am actually i thought the timing may be too close to their passing i didntwant you to feel like i was taking advantage of you to put this on your shoulders when you had so much trouble and pressure there already with the farm and and everything hermione nodded but it been a while almost a year and i hoped i gathered up my courage i i ll understand if you dont want i mean if you dontfeel the same way he was getting flustered again despite the fact that she was still massaging his hands and trying to keep him calm no hermione whispered as she looked down at her lap where their hands rested ron face instantly fell oh he looked openly disappointed and hurt well i mean i can understand no no hermione said hastily nervously looking up at him again quickly that not what i meant i meant i no i it just logical hermione always so articulate and expressive was suddenly having an inexplicably difficult time trying to find the right words to say ron mind meanwhile had suddenly become the most eloquent machine in the country a plethora of profane curses toppled over one another in his mind eye as he waited in dread of course it was only the natural sadistic course of the universe that would have his creative abilities in expression suddenly be capable the second it was not his turn to speak this is a complete and utter disaster he thought miserably ron we ve always been friends and we ll always be friends and we could be more than that she couldnthelp but smile slightly as she noticed the way ron face started glowing again albeit cautiously that was the joy of being ron friend one could see everything he was feeling just written there on his face but she needed to be clear it just so soon hermione concluded i understand ron looked down and heaved a small sigh before looking back up into her brown eyes i promise i really do but will you think about us though hermione nodded of course i will i promise they both smiled bashfully at each other erm well i should probably be going ron said nervously pulling his hands back from his hold and instantly regretting the loss of her touch mum wanted me to pick up some ingredients from the market for dinner bill and charlie are coming home tonight percy fred and george arrived yesterday dad birthday dinner isntuntil tomorrow but you know mum she ll use any excuse to make a large dinner well larger than normal anyway considering the size of our family both laughed a little despite the strain within the inherently lame joke and were grateful to find an outlet for the awkwardness you re coming tomorrow right of course hermione smiled and ron felt his stomach do a somersault i ll be there great then ron said as she opened the door and he stepped out i guess i ll see you there he said going down the three steps and looking back up at her i guess so hermione still smiled bye he said as he waved and started to walk down the rock path bye hermione whispered she smiled at him and he smiled back before she turned around went inside and closed the door behind her ron heard the door give a soft indistinct thud as it closed tightly in its frame before turning to the road almost immediately his smile morphed into an all too common combination of a scowl and a sulk his shoulders gave way to defeat and he scuffed his feet along the pebbles as he walked down hermione driveway as he neared the rocky bottom he glanced back at the house hoping to see her looking back out at him through the window he was very much disappointed to see all of the window curtains closed and no figure peeking out through them ron sighed and turned back around unfortunately also forgetting to duck under a certain obstacle that happened to stick out in the path this resulted in him getting smacked between the eyes by the very large birch branch adding to his already forming headache he stumbled backwards rubbing his freckled forehead vigorously and releasing one of his imaginative string of curses with conviction still verbally attacking all tree branches rocky driveways and mother nature for putting them on the planet in the first place ron stepped off the path and on to the main road he made sure to kick a pebble for good measure ron could guarantee that harry and ginny would want to know what happened as soon as he returned and he was not at all looking forward to the conversation ron walked along the empty road shivering as the almost winter breeze nipped at his face autumn would soon be leaving their little town of little whinging and the sky was becoming whiter with the cold every day he stopped on the deserted road and rubbed his forehead slightly once more easing the remaining stinging pain in his skull maybe if i lucky she ll come around by summer he thought with hope but ron felt in his heart that after a lifetime worth of disappointing almost there experiences he was anything but lucky hermione all but collapsed against the door this was not what she needed right now it not that she wasnthappy about ron sudden confession she just had so much to do with the bank pounding on her door every other day and her constant calculation of all the loans with the constant sorting through of her inheritance from her parents with tax collection just around the corner with the farm needing tending to with a house to clean she barely had enough money for food let alone taxes forget money to pay off loans she had too many responsibilities now responsibilities that ron or harry or ginny wouldnthave to deal with for a while the weasleys werentpoor but they werentexactly wealthy with the size of their family who could be mrs weasley stayed home most of the time to tend to their farm and house cook meals clean and the like meanwhile mr weasley worked as a researcher studying more primitive cultures over in the new world some people of higher rank from london often looked down upon the weasleys for arthur weasley job and she knew that his children had often received the brunt of most of the prejudice while in spending short periods of time in the city regardless mr weasley made enough money to get by and with an organized budget the family managed to have amenities and luxuries that people with more acceptable occupations enjoyed hermione knew with a rising sense of bitterness that ginny and ron and harry who was living with the weasleys wouldnthave to worry about finances for a long time she sighed and stepped away from the door squashing her envy in an instant she couldntjust sit around and think when there was work to be done she went to the kitchen and took the food she bought at the market out of her satchel she put the bread and sugar away before walking to her small bedroom then set the satchel on the hook on the wall to the left of her bed and went to close the white curtains at her two windows before she pulled them shut however she looked around outside it had almost been a year now it was just last winter that her parents had died hermione shook her head she noted that the leaves had long ago changed colors and begun to fall the bare trees signaled the oncoming winter and it looked as if it would be an especially cold one to boot all the more reason to get moving she told herself it was already far past midday and she hadnteven done her normal chores she stepped out of her bedroom and walked toward the back door it was a rather small but well kept area containing a large horse stable a barn a high fenced pasture and a chicken coop past that was a large open field with tall grass browned from the abusive winds much farther back to the left was a cliff with much shorter grass one could see the entire town from there it was a beautiful scene the small village encased by valleys and hills folded into blankets of green and gold sun rays under soft bundles of ever changing clouds sometimes when she was younger she would sit out there alone at sunset and watch it drop over the horizon while her father bailed the hay and the scent of her mother cooking wafted out into the clearing she hadnthad time to do any of that since her parents funeral with a sigh she gazed past the cliff and stared there looming over her was what her village called the forbidden forest despite her father assurances of their home relative safety she had rightfully never gone very far into the forest and had never gone in alone it extended all the way into the next three neighboring villages but no one knew how deep or how dense the forest had really grown hermione had only gone in with her father once when they were desperate for firewood in a particularly cold winter they had only ventured in a few meters just enough so they could still see the house through the trees and hermione had used every ounce of her courage to impress her father by holding in her young whimpers it was not long until they had quickly hurried back out and she had never gone in again her parents always forbade it they told her it was dangerous and she didntneed to be told twice even the old man storyteller in the market had a story about this particular forest alastor moody better known as mad eye moody or just mad eye wore clothes that were always dirty and a worn leather eye patch he had long gray hair and a big chunk missing from his nose and mad eye always sat on a silver bucket near the fountain in the town square to tell the children stories as long as they shared a small slice of bread people in the town thought him insane but listened to his harmless entertaining tales anyway hermione and her mother had passed by the old man one day when hermione was around the age of seven just after she had moved to little eye said that on the other side of the forest was a beautiful kingdom with a king and queen and even a prince it was a place where everybody was happy and there was no such thing as war or hunger to logical hermione this place did not hold a high likelihood of existence but she nevertheless liked a good fantasy tale her mother had been concerned that this story would encourage her to enter the forest at first thinking that her daughter might frolic into forest thinking that there was a wonderful kingdom located on the other side but was soon put at ease she could tell by hermione reaction that her head was much too properly seated on her shoulders to be concerned hermione remembered a boy younger than she asking mad eye how he knew such things mad eye grunted and replied that he had gone through the forest of course the children looked highly skeptical but continued to listen intently hermione pleaded for her mother to let her listen to the rest of the story but her mother declined and told her that they didnthave enough time to stay any longer hermione sighed and grudgingly walked back to her home holding onto her mother hand luckily for hermione she hadntmissed much as she had confirmed with one of the other children later in the week the story hand ended quite soon after her departure because there was nothing more to tell mad eye told the story of the forest quite often and the children quickly grew tired of hearing it for it was the same every time some would listen to the story only to see if there were any additions but were quickly disappointed when mad eye realized that the children were becoming less interested he adapted and only shared the tale when a newcomer came mad eye told many other stories to suit his audience needs such as the young boy who escaped a giant dragon with a flying broomstick or the young girl who traveled through time to save the life of a magical creature the stories grew more bizarre and less believable with the passing years hermione had passed mad eye with her mother again seven years later when hermione was fourteen hermione was surprised to hear mad eye telling the story of the forest yet again to a large group of children again only this time it was a much different version there isnta happy castle there now ye hear mad eye had growled in his usual voice it all dark always gloomy the king and queen are gone most of the people are too the only thing that left of the whole kingdom is the shadowy old fortress deserted the prince who used to be loved and adored by the kingdom is now in hiding no one knows why some people say the prince suddenly turned so ugly that anyone who looks at him would die right there on the spot like from a basilisk other people say the prince became an evil sorcerer and turned all of the servants and royal subjects into broomsticks and teacups mad eye paused whatever the reason he hiding up there in that castle of his hermione doubted that anyone would ever die from seeing someone truly ugly just as she doubted there being a sorcerer turning the people who adored him into inanimate objects and she told this to her mother with a haughty air convinced that as a young adult she was too mature to be fooled by a children story but as usual it was only a mad eye moody story not something that should be taken too seriously although people were interested in the new version it too quickly grew old and mad eye had to revert back to more enticing tales hermione hadntheard him tell the story since after a few hours had passed and the kitchen was clean hermione grabbed a basket that was sitting to the left of the door and headed towards the chicken coop to gather eggs she honestly didntknow how she felt about ron anymore she had had a rather large crush on him when she was younger but he never showed any signs indicating that the feeling was mutual hermione still remembered her very first day in the town she was about to turn seven years old and was feeling very of shy that day and had pleaded with her father to just let her hide in her room forever with her books but then as she was emerging from the door five year old ginny walked up the driveway with mrs weasley hermione remembered how tired and out of breath ginny looked but how upbeat and rosy molly had been mrs weasley offered them a homemade mince pie and continued to offer them one every christmas which they gratefully accepted and invited them to dinner so that they could be later introduced to all of town it was no surprise that hermione and ginny had become good friends very quickly and hermione mother smiled as hermione left her books inside her new room to walk to the other side of town with the two weasleys hermione played with ginny all day in her old town she had mostly kept to herself and did nothing but read hermione had never gone to school in either town as her father home schooled her so it had been a very nice change to have a friend like ginny ginny taught her how to play hide and seek which would quickly become hermione favorite game her parents came over for dinner that night with a large loaf of bread for the weasleys at which point hermione met both ron and his best friend harry harry parents had died from a mysterious disease when he was very young for which he had some indescribable genetic immunity that confounded doctors everywhere since he had no living family except for his godfather but rumor had it that he was insane and not capable of being a guardian for harry the weasleys took him in despite the overwhelming amount of food that was consistently served at the weasleys harry was very thin for his age he wore spectacles and had messy hair part of which covered an odd shaped scar on his forehead he received when he was only a baby in some carriage accident not long after the death of his parents in fact at first ron and harry didntpay much attention to hermione at first presumed to be just another tag along like ginny hermione thoroughly shocked them once they had seen how fast she could run while playing tag and they discovered how clever her hiding spots were it didnttake long before deemed her a worthy ally and ginny was admitted into the team as well their friendships had only strengthened since ginny had remained her best friend and hermione ginny s hermione couldntrun nearly as fast anymore but then again she had no time for tag neither did they despite their close connection ginny and hermione began to grow in distinctly separate directions over the years despite the fact that ginny was a year younger than hermione she consistently had many more relationships and kept her conversations with hermione regularly occupied with advice and proverbial boy trouble at first hermione had worried that perhaps there was something developmentally wrong with her but eventually she realized that she just hadntbeen as interested in boys as ginny had been true she had crushes like with ron for example or when the rather well known cricket player viktor krum had visited town but that all they ever were hermione had wild brown hair that she too often forced into braid as her sole battle strategy and when she was younger she had grown increasingly self conscious of her large front teeth she was grateful when they finally fell out and new ones grew in hermione thought that she was pretty in her own way ginny was more outgoing and didntalways have her nose in a book like everyone said hermione did so hermione understood why men werentas drawn to her as her friend hermione was fine with that she had decided that when she found love she would want it to last she wanted more than a simple crush she wanted a passion a supportive connection a challenge ron was probably the closest one to do any of that she admitted walking out of the chicken coop with a basket full of large white eggs but not quite maybe time would change that though it d probably be better for me he would take care of me and protect me he wouldntlet anything hurt me he d love me she set the basket on the kitchen table to go outside and do her other chores but could i ever return the feelings i dontknow so ron wanted to court her ron who had always accused her of being boring who had only realized that she was more than bookworm tomboy just three years earlier hermione thought on this until the sun began to set and the sky began to turn different shades of purples oranges and reds she finished her other chores before walking to the horse stable which was occupied by her two most prized possessions the first one old ronan was especially helpful in plowing but the other auror was her unabashed favorite he had a beautiful brown coat with a white diamond marking between his eyes and a dark mane and tail on the other hand ronan his elder had no markings but was especially strong and fast auror was sometimes even entered into competitions in which he usually won hermione gracious amounts of prize money but what made him even more special was that auror had been given to her as a special gift from her parents two years after she came to the small town of little whinging a horse that could grow up with her that could teach her responsibility hermione had never felt so proud auror she whispered with a smile the perfect name from my favorite children book she stepped inside the stable and smirked at her two most precious companions i bet you still dontknow anything about a boy wizard story but you like your name all the same dontyou she refilled their oat buckets and prepared the horses to be taken outside for a while before they went back in for the night ronan and auror both responded to hermione belated actions with annoyance in their own horse manner neighing at her when she took them out of their stalls sorry hermione said i couldntget you out any earlier she patted ronan on the neck in an apologetic sort of way before going to auror to do the same thing was a little distracted you know they happily nipped at the carrots she fed them and she took them outside the stable she led them over to the pasture and shut the wooden gate behind them choosing to watch them for a bit when she turned around she saw the tall grassy area and behind that the cliff from where she had viewed the sunset so many times before hermione sighed i ll just sit for awhile hermione thought her chores were done and she was exhausted with everything that had happened that day she had good reason to be she walked to the cliff reveling tall pieces of grass that brushed against her increasingly dirty dress she avoided the edge and plopped herself on the much shorter grass with a sigh leaning back with her hands behind her and her legs extended in front of her hermione lazily watched the sun continue its descent over the horizon hermione didntknow for how long she sat there but when she finally stood and brushed the dirt off herself the sun was well out of view and the full moon was already visible after she stood up she spotted the first few stars to shine that night hermione suddenly remembered the nursery rhyme she learned as a child about wishing on stars hermione smiled a little could she wish for ron and her to be together for their happiness was it what she wanted she was staring at the dazzling star above her when ronan made a soft noise and nudged his mouth up against a piece of wood in the gate the wishing star was forgotten as hermione made her way back through the tall grass and a cool breeze rustled hermione hair she gave a small shudder i ll be right back hermione told the two horses as ronan continued to nudge the gate auror had now joined ronan at the fence and was staring at her i just going to get my cloak hermione walked in through the back door stepping inside and moving toward three hooks nailed into the wall with dismay hermione remembered why only one hook was occupied she slipped the black cotton cloak from the wall and put it on as she returned outside to the fence there you go hermione whispered soothingly to the two horses as she opened the gate and stepped inside the fence come on now hermione took the reins around ronan neck with one hand and gently pulled him outside the fence she closed the gate and locked it again i ll be right back auror dontyou worry she walked ronan back to the stable and secured him in his stall when she was sure that he was locked in she headed back to the fenced area auror was waiting patiently for her when she returned he was staring at her intently his two big glassy black eyes focused on her good boy auror hermione whispered as she opened the gate that a good boy come here hermione stepped inside and grabbed the reins around his brown neck and gently pulled him toward the gate come on she whispered as she walked back through the gate now just a second she told him as she went to lock the gate again good boy hermione praised him rubbing his neck lovingly okay time to go back to the stable come on auror followed hermione as she started to tug on his reins again hermione headed to the barn with auror patting his neck and whispering something occasionally half way to the barn auror stopped hermione tugged gently at his reins come on auror she whispered she tugged at his reins more forcefully auror she said move but he did not he had planted his hooves firmly into the dry soil and was not moving in the slightest hermione pulled at his reins but still auror made so sign of wanting to go anywhere she turned toward him about to snap something at him and once again try pitifully to move him when she noticed that his gaze was transfixed hermione turned in the direction where auror was staring the forest her brows knitted in confusion she turned back to auror who was still staring into the woods then back to the trees she held her breath and listened intently to her surroundings there were no crickets no birds and no distant indistinct far off sounds coming from down the road and in the town a slight breeze rustled her hair and yet there were no sounds of leaves rustling she gave a sharp intake of breath as the cold wind nipped at her face and she wrapped her cloak tighter around herself winter almost here she thought it ll probably snow soon hermione shook her head suddenly she could hear crickets in the field and owls hooting from the distant trees strange it must have been just the wind she reasoned it had grown very dark while she was putting the horses away and now the blackness had almost fully taken over the tree branches blew in the wind and hermione could once again hear the leaves whispering over the whistle of the breeze hermione looked around come on auror hermione said let get you in the stable then we both can get some sleep okay hermione said patting his head auror continued to stare at the forest and stay put auror i serious this is not cute not only was hermione getting increasingly annoyed at his behavior but she was really starting to worry she swore that not even thirty seconds before she couldnthear anything it had been eerily silent and she was sure that it wasntbecause she had gone temporarily deaf something was wrong which was all the more reason for auror to get his big brown tail into the stable and for her to go inside lock all doors and windows and try to get some sleep but auror wasntcooperating auror she pleaded come on please what wrong with you hermione stood in front of him and pulled at his reins with all her might he just stared ugh hermione groaned and held her hands up in frustration dropping the reins hermione put her hands on her forehead than ran them through her untidy hair which had long ago fallen loose of its braid the wind was still blowing gently picking up every once in awhile to send a shiver down her spine this is just great but auror had already taken off toward the forest auror hermione quickly let her hands fall to her sides and with a look of horror she watched her horse run away auror hermione cried and started run after him but auror was galloping at his fullest speed and disappeared into the forest before she could even make it half way panting and gasping for breath hermione skidded to a halt in the tall grassy field auror her shout tore out with unadulterated despair and confusion she stood there in the middle of the field staring into the quiet forest with the moon shining down on her and the wind rustling her cloak and hair what do i do she thought should i go get help but what if something happens to him before someone can get up here the memory of her parents warning her about the wild animals in the forest came to mind and a knot began twisting in her stomach what if something hurts him he my best horse not only do i need him for the contests but mom dad hermione sighed i cantjust let him go in there and not even try to get him back hermione stepped closer to the forest she continued walking until she reached the end of the field but then stopped again but what if something happens to me she thought the knot twisting more violently the memory of her parents warning resurfaced i donthave any protection no guns she instantly regretted not getting a gun earlier her father only had one when he was alive but that was long gone and when hermione had thought about getting a new one she figured that she wouldntneed one logical hermione of course had chosen not to after taking the nonexistent local crime rate into consideration as well as the fact that she was not a hunter but what good did those excuses do her now her parents had told her the forest was dangerous she believed them now more than ever and in all honesty she knew the real reason for not wanting one not after what happened the wind blew rustling her hair and her cloak again she heard owls hooting off in the distance why am i just standing here it must have been a few minutes already auror canthave gone too far and if i were to go and get help they might as well just say it hopeless before they even get up here i cantjust leave him alone in the woods my sense of direction isnttoo shabby and i went camping a couple of times before if i need to i can always use some of dad old survival tips on how to get home she told herself this though she desperately wished it wouldntcome to that right i cantjust let him stay in there alone and not even try to help with that in mind hermione ran out of the field and towards the forest hesitating slightly as she reached the entrance with a quick shake of her head and her mind set on finding auror she quickly ran through the forest taking the path that she took with her father to get firewood she reached the spot where they had gathered the wood in no time at all and only grew more anxious as she pressed on she continued to run down the path that odd a path in this forest and started calling out auror name for some time before she finally ran out of air and had to slow down to a brisk walk she kept glancing over her shoulder expecting auror to be there or something else her shouts became whispers eventually hermione had gotten so deep into the forest that she could barely make out the moon through the thick tree branches from what she could see the giant pine trees were bunched up together so densely that it seemed unnatural and the branches were thick with needles occasionally she d bump into a particularly large branch that happened to grow out into the way of the path and was showered with dry pine needles the only things she could hear were her steady footsteps against the dirt the occasional whisper from the wind blowing the leaves and her heart beating loudly in her ears she had been walking for quite some time when she gave up on calling for auror it seemed that the deeper she went into forest the quieter it grew and the more breaking the silence grew more daunting hermione had thought about turning back quite a few times on her way but now the thought seemed more tempting than ever the forest had gone so quiet that hermione was afraid to breathe too loudly she began to wonder why she even bothered to come in how had she expected to find auror anyway he could be anywhere he might not have even taken the path he could have wandered off into the trees he could even be dead no she thought please dontlet him be dead she walked along the path her heart thumping loudly in her ears everything else was inaudible i so stupid stupid stupid stupid i supposed to be logical hermione i should just go home yet she continued walking her mind was thinking about going home and yet her feet were continuing to go forward i cantstand the thought of leaving auror but what else am i going to do walk around the dangerous forest until i starve to death or get eaten by some animal she stopped this is hopeless hermione sighed and was about to turn around when something caught her eye up ahead there was a rustling noise and the sound of hooves trotting towards her her breath caught in her throat as she saw the moonlight reflect off a piece of metal in mid air just around the height of her eyes auror hermione whispered fearfully praying with all her might that it was she didntknow what she d do if it wasn t she was pretty sure she wouldntbe able to do anything indeed it was auror and he soon came into full view his brown coat and mane a glossy black in the darkness and his white marking a dark gray he neighed happily at the sight of her and stared at her intently he didntseem to be hurt and his reins were still around his neck auror she cried quietly reaching out to pat his neck as he slowly walked toward her you scared me half to death what were you thinking hermione snapped at him but her giant smile did not leave her face i dontknow why you did what you did but she sighed let s just go home now that she had found auror she didntwant to stay in the forest any longer she stopped petting him and reached for his reins okay let go hermione said as she started to walk down the path in the direction of her home but auror wouldntmove ugh hermione groaned careful not to let the reins slip out of her hand not this again she looked him in the eyes what is wrong with you she stared at him angrily before softening a bit please auror she whispered let s go home but auror only stared at her then with hermione still holding onto the reins auror turned around and faced the dark deserted path in front of them hermione stared at the back of his head in confusion and total astonishment before auror started walking down the path his hooves giving soft thuds as he walked on the dry soil auror she asked and began tugging at his reins again he kept walking auror she asked a little louder no longer caring about the forest sacred silence hermione dug her heels into the ground but she still slid forward with his movements rather than be dragged to wherever auror was going she started walking along side him occasionally pulling on his reins and trying to stop him again each time however was unsuccessful hermione apprehension about the forest had not decreased in the slightest and walking further into the forest did not please her at all especially since she had auror again hermione wrapped the cloak around her more tightly and lifted the hood up over her head she was shivering from the dank cold air and desperately wished she were at home in her nice warm bed she walked closer to auror and tried to absorb some of his body heat every now and then hermione would glance to each side of her listening intently for anything that might be lurking in the darkness she didnthear anything and didntsee anything but that didntcalm the horrible sensation she felt when she walked unarmed through the blackness just because she didntsee anything didntmean nothing was there she could almost sense something else far off in the trees as hermione was trying to halt her horse for the umpteenth time she spotted a rather small dark creature flying towards her hermione eyes widened and her mouth fell open slightly was some dangerous animal finally coming to attack but it a bird well it can still peck my eyes out hermione thought with a shudder and once again pulled the cloak tight around her she gasped quietly and stopped pulling on the reins as she watched the bird like figure swoop down and land on a high tree branch to her left two yellow eyes stared down at her an owl hermione whispered she couldntsee properly in the dark but she was sure it was an owl an eagle owl most likely if her memory served her correctly but she d have to see it in the light to know exactly it watched their movements intently hermione stared into the golden orbs while auror continued to walk down the path unfazed hermione finally tore her eyes away from the animal gaze the animal flew over their heads circling them twice before soaring with unbelievable speed straight ahead down the path hermione stared in front of her and for the first time realized that up ahead it was noticeably lighter for how long now had the density of the trees been thinning it almost looked as if there were an exit hermione raised a sable brow it appeared to be a clearing of some sort despite the distance away from the supposed clearing hermione could see rays of moonlight shining down on the ground and there was something falling to the ground was that snow is this why the path is here hermione thought to get to this clearing what on earth hermione inquired silently to no one in particular as auror and hermione got closer hermione began to think that what they were walking towards was actually the end of the forest hermione wondered just how far she had wandered in she had to be in at least a few good miles she had been walking for hours and her legs had grown tired her muscles were sore and she was drowsy from the lack of sleep her head was aching and her eyelids were stubbornly heavy when she had run into the forest she hadntexpected to have gone in this far but she hadntexpected auror not to come home willingly either as she remembered this hermione made a move as if she was going to start pulling on auror reins again but she realized that she was only twenty feet away from the edge and to try to turn back now was pointless so hermione defeated and unsatisfied let auror continue walking her towards the clearing without any tension in his reigns the eagle owl was sitting up on a branch at eye level to her right in one of the last trees before the open space hermione could clearly see the moonlight shining down on the open soil now she could see that the ground had a thin layer of white snow which an ambivalently welcome contrast to the hours of near complete darkness as hermione and auror stepped out of the trees she shielded her eyes and looked away to the ground at auror feet when she removed her hand from her face and looked up at the rows of trees her eyes adjusted to the unfamiliar light hermione patted auror on the neck a little before turning towards the middle of the clearing only this was no clearing she gasped loudly as her eyes traveled along the impossible height of a giant ominous castle in the middle of the trees tall domineering pines and an overbearing mountain surrounded the large castle and the full moon hung over the area like a condemning eye from the heavens all the world seemed to have gained a bluish tint and it looked to logical hermione as though it had been plucked straight from a fairy tale a terribly written fairy tale she decided goodness hermione whispered mad eye was right about the castle hermione brows drew together in concentration she d always thought that he made them up either for the children entertainment or for his own sake and lack of sanity she had never actually considered that the tale might be true hermione shook her head no this was a dream it had to be but her leg hurt very badly when she reached down to give it a good pinch wincing at her own strength hermione investigated further hermione was astounded at the sheer size of the pine trees the ones that were on the side of the forest where hermione lived were very tall but were nothing compared to the ones surrounding this castle hermione wasntsurprised at how difficult it might be to see in the forest now that she saw just how tall the trees loomed from the way it appeared as she had walked through the forest the trees might actually have been growing in size hermione wondered just how she had never managed to see the castle before from back on her side of the forest the castle was so big but these trees was this natural hermione continued to marvel at the scene when a noise broke her from her reverie hermione snapped her head in the direction of the path only to see that auror was galloping away back down the path she looked down at her hand to see that she had yet again dropped the reins auror hermione cried but he soon faded out of view into the darkness mentally cursing herself for yet another extreme display of carelessness that day hermione slapped her head in aggravation it all seemed like some wild goose chase and some stupid joke only no one was laughing hermione really did not want to run back and forth through a dangerous forest during the night chasing after an ungrateful horse hermione swore that if auror went back in the forest again once they got home no matter how much she loved him he would be left to his own sources hermione took a step toward the forest but was startled when the eagle owl which had been watching the pair from the tree branch the entire time swooped down in front of her hooted loudly and planted itself firmly in the center of the entrance to the path facing her hermione eyebrows shot into her hairline and she stepped to the left to walk around the owl unfortunately the owl only mirrored her actions by stepping to its right and subsequently blocked her from the path hermione scoffed and took two steps to her right the owl once again imitated her and cut her off again well hermione whispered i thought i couldntget any crazier tonight but it seems i mistaken she jumped backwards the owl hopped forwards hermione went to the left the owl went to its right suddenly hermione jumped to the right twice then to the left forward then backward three paces her arms flailing about madly when she stopped she stared at the owl waiting for its reaction the owl merely cocked its head to the side interestedly and gave an amused hoot hermione groaned in frustration and brought her hands up to her eyes she peered through her fingers at the eagle owl ever so carefully hermione slid her right foot to the right the owl imitating her suddenly hermione jerked her hands away from her face feinting to the left and started sprinting forward into the forest she only made it a few steps before the owl had once again planted itself firmly on the dirt in front of her gave a stubborn hoot and stared agh hermione groaned gripping her untidy hair in her hands what do you want she spat angrily at the owl what the owl gave a hearty hoot and cocked its head to the side once more staring at her bemusedly this was not helpful what hermione repeated what do you want from me she asked again you want me to stay out here all night stay out in the middle of nowhere miles away from home while my stupid horse has already scared the life out of me she asked the owl stooping low so she could stare at it at its eye level or what hermione laughed without any actual mirth in her tone you want me to stay up in that castle she pointed behind her go up and knock on those big doors and ask some empty suit of rusty armor for a cup of tea go in and find the place littered with broomsticks and teacups like good ol mad eye suggested is that it the castle hermione asked sarcastically then she smiled a very sad smile she was sitting there talking to an owl in the middle of the night beyond a dangerous forest asking the owl if it wanted her to go spend the night up in the not so imaginary castle with only magical teacups and broomsticks for company if only the village could see me now she thought the owl hooted happily and bobbed up and down with joy hermione leaned back and looked the owl with total astonishment you re kidding she said incredulously the owl flapped its wings fervently you re not hermione said slowly you re not hermione gave a large exasperated sigh before letting her head fall down to her chest still kneeling on the snow covered ground not caring if her dress was getting even dirtier or if her face and hair was spotted with grime and mud hermione looked back at the eagle owl fine hermione said fine she repeated you win she stood up slowly and the owl continued to bounce with delight then after one last final hearty hoot the owl took off and fled towards an open window in a tall tower hermione watched it soar up to one of the highest towers and perched itself on open stone window hermione raised her eyebrows once again at the owl peculiar antics before turning towards the castle doors was she really going to try and enter hermione shivered and pulled her cloak tighter around her she realized that her hood had fallen down she assumed it was during her pathetic little dance to confuse the owl and that her messy hair was now sprinkled with ice crystals she brushed them off quickly shivering as some melted and slid down her back then pulled her hood back up over her head hermione continued to stare at the castle she bit her bottom lip considering her options on the one hand she could turn back and go through the forest again but she already hated this option she did not like the idea of going back in there in the middle of the night still unarmed exhausted and ready to drop to the ground at any given moment what if something finally did decide to attack her she d be worse than when she started earlier that evening and she wasntthat great to begin with on the other hand she could at least try to go in the castle it seemed absolutely pointless spending the night up in a deserted empty castle all alone then a new horrible thought entered hermione mind what if criminals were using the castle to hide out no she thought that ludicrous the snow continued to fall as she contemplated her options she was growing colder by the minute if she didntmake up her mind soon she d freeze to death forget wild animals hypothermia or pneumonia was more of a threat at the moment finally hermione covered in snow freezing to the bone and tired beyond belief decided to spend the night in the castle as soon as the sun rose she d quickly make her way back through the forest and when she got home and see if auror was there if he was well she d be angry she knew that much then she could go back to her life and look back on this one day and laugh but somehow she didntthink that this was or would ever be a laughing matter if auror werenthome she didntwant to think about the possibility if he werenthome then she would have to buy a new horse but she d need money which was something she didnthave and she didnthave time to scrounge around for any she already owed enough to the town for the past year alone and couldntborrow anymore she d have to count on old ronan and pray that he was still competent in his old age if ronan were to die from the increased workload she didntknow what she d do the hole in which she was trapped seemed to be getting deeper and deeper but she couldntworry about all this now not when snow was starting to pile on her eyelashes hermione shook her head and brushed the snow off again giving an exhausted sigh she stepped in the direction of the castle doors they seemed taller and more ominous looking then ever she stared at them as she walked and swallowed hard when she reached the giant silver door handles there was one handle on each door large and blue in the snow reflection of the moonlight both handles were roughly half hermione size on the left the handle was in the shape of the torso of a badger body and a large raven head the raven head complete with very detailed silver engravings of the feathers was peering over the badger whose body was likewise exquisite in detail the most disturbing were the eyes they were nothing more than smooth silver mounds between what were supposed to be the silver folds of skin both mouths were open wide and on each face was an expression that looked to hermione as if they had been captured between a ferocious snarl and a horrifyingly painful cry hermione swallowed again at the sight of their faces the badger left paw was curved upward and touched its left shoulder creating what hermione assumed was the actual handle on the right was a similar handle only instead of the badger and raven there was a lion and a serpent both with their mouths raging open the lion took the place of the badger also only half of its body visible the lion had a large silvery mane and two blank mounds for eyes hermione nervously looked at the amount of sharp gleaming teeth sticking out from the lion mouth before mentally slapping herself did she really think the silvery lion was going to come to life and attack her still she d rather not think of anything even remotely frightening until she was in better circumstances and broad daylight the lion mane took up most of the handle and covered a quarter of the body visible then circling the stomach of the lion was the serpent the silver scaly reptile tail started at the front of the lion body and bent upwards and hid itself behind the lion creating a large handle like the badger paw the other end of the tail twisted itself fully around the mammal midsection then cut behind the lion head and peered out to the left the snake head was to the lion right and rested its open jaw which was complete with two very sharp venomous looking teeth and snake like tongue on the lion furry shoulder rather than looking hurt or angry like the badger and raven these two new animals looked hungry for blood and ready to kill hermione stared into the eyes of the snake and lion for a moment or two taking in the extreme detail of each before slowly reaching for the snake tail whoever used to live in this castle hermione thought obviously didntlike visitors she watched her hand move towards the handle then feeling her hand clasp the icy metal her eyes quickly jumped back up to the eyes of each animal looking back at her hand she slowly pulled not sure just how heavy the large door would be it didntrequire much effort to open enough to get in but she merely opened it wide enough to allow herself some room then let go of the handle and started to walk inside giving the handles one last glance before walking in all the way they had to have been very old and couldnthave been used in many years they had looked almost polished to hermione outside but it could have just been the moonlight hermione shrugged and squinted in the blackness inside was dark and her eyes had to adjust to the new light again she pushed the door closed gently then turned back around pulling down her hood slowly still letting her eyes adjust to the light hermione gently called out into the darkness hello thanks for reviewing i appreciate it very much

back and clean up my previous chapters inside was dark and her eyes had to adjust to the new light again letting her eyes get used to the darker scenery she turned around to find two ordinary circular door handles she then gently closed the door and turned back around pulling down her hood slowly still letting her eyes adjust to the lack of light hermione called out into the darkness hello hello hermione repeated it was silly really hermione didntknow why she called out it was obvious she wouldntget an answer she looked around in the darkness and found herself in what looked like a giant entrance hall the area alone looked as if it could fit a house inside the ceiling and stone walls were extremely high and the corridor was very long slowly hermione began to walk down the large hallway hermione could make out dark marble under her feet and she tried not to think too hard about the cold unfeeling sounds her footsteps made against the grey if she squinted hard enough she could swear that there was a glass chandelier hanging from the ceiling at the very end small windows in the walls held old wax candles and hermione saw three suits of armor standing side by side as she walked past alas she noted with bitter humor no teacups or broomsticks nearby despite its rather ominous appearance and its old age it seemed to hermione that it might really still be quite beautiful at least she suspected in the daytime she could start to make out what looked like a grand marble staircase up in front of her and just before that to the right was a doorway to what looked like a very large room hermione stared at it as she walked trying to figure out what it was it huge she thought maybe that where the people used to have balls or ssssh hermione whipped around trying not to make a sound she squinted into the darkness behind her she could ve sworn she had heard voices and a quick shuffle of movement as well she stared at one of sconces about ten feet behind her but saw nothing she slowly turned back around finally letting out a breath she hadntrealized she d been holding in hermione continued walking down the corridor this time with softer footsteps quieter breaths and a glance or two over her shoulder much more frequently she almost heard us do ya think she she looked this way she might ve three small dark figures took cover in the shadows in the nook of a sconce shrouded in darkness what d we do crabbe asked a small half way full peppershaker its small p was facing the stone wall but facing the girl was a small pudgy face contorted in a expression of confusion i dunno goyle said an equally small saltshaker which was also half full and sported an s on the back of the glass container it likewise had a face with just an equally pudgy confused expression neville it snapped rudely yes asked an even smaller figure timidly about the size of a teacup stood a terra cotta pot filled to the rim with dry soil also in this pot was one small green stem with two limber branches pressing into themselves like worrying hands two leaves graced one branch and one leaf graced the other this pot had a face but unlike the two others its expression was very anxious go tell somebody crabbe the saltshaker said yeah goyle joined in like mcgoogle or snape or somebody important the peppershaker hopped over closer to the ledge of the window to see that the girl was almost to the staircase and didntbother to prevent the soft clinking noises that came as its glass met stone b but hurry up goyle ground out that is unless you want to be nothing but a bunch of clay pieces the peppershaker shook its glass body menacingly yeah the saltshaker hopped up and down a bunch of clay pieces with a small eep of terror the small brown pot quietly hopped over to the edge trying not to let its clay body make too much noise against the stone extending its small green stems out the pot twisted them around a nearby metal sconce and swung off the edge dangling for a second or two the pot readjusted its grip and extended one green arm to the next sconce which was lower to the ground as neville repeated the process the sconces went down in a diagonal line leading neville so close to the floor that he was only about six inches off the ground with a small swing the pot let go of the sconce and landed on the floor with only the smallest of clinks then hopped his way down the hallway hermione finally reached the staircase she had thought it was large from back at the entrance but she now realized that it had clearly been an understatement and that room it must have been a ballroom it was larger than the entrance hall which she hadntimagined possible whoever had owned the castle must have been very very wealthy looking back up the marble staircase hermione debated whether to go up or stay downstairs a bedroom would be much more easily found above she decided longing for the reprieve of her bed at home a force was pulling her up the stairs but her consciousness was already dwindling she was so very tired and didntwant to think about anything anymore madam mcgonagall madam mcgonagall neville hopped into the small little kitchen as quickly as he could and instantly began searching for the head of the servants madam mcgonagall neville cried out clinking his way across the tiled floor of the kitchen only two small candles in the room were lit and the illumination they provided wasntmuch as neville passed through the darkness various personified items looked up as he went by grimacing every time his voice broke through the silence plates teacups saucers and silverware warily opened an eye or two to watch him through the glass of their cabinets or from their corners some stoves against the wall cringed as neville accidentally clunked himself against their edges and the annoyed tap spurted out a few drops of water as it awoke from his frantic calls a broomstick in the corner with very tan sandy colored twigs and a face hidden within them sleepily opened one eye to look at neville as he came closer neville the broomstick said groggily wha ss all the fuss about seamus neville shrieked causing the broomstick along with the others around them to wince where madam mcgonagall wha at seamus yawned it really important neville exclaimed really really important what could be so important that you barge in like this longbottom asked an irritated plate from behind the cupboard glass door there a girl in the castle neville smiled excitedly there was a loud round of gasps from each of the items what a girl no it couldntbe impossible but that what he said a girl the excited murmurs flew around the kitchen soon every teacup saucer fork knife spoon and appliance was wide awake and discussing this incredible news neville stood there in the corner with seamus as the others began to hop from their sleeping places and crowd around the two is it true neville asked a young pot is there really a girl in the castle uh huh neville nodded while others gave him disbelieving looks i saw her with my own eyes now isntthat convincing a smooth voice drawled from a dark corner in the opposite side of the room by the stoves neville gave a little gasp sir s snape neville stuttered we re not telling tall tales now are we longbottom a large black cauldron with a face consisting of a large hooked nose crept out of the dark corner and came into the small light from the candles neville slowly shook his head no snape asked then what this i hear about you spotting a girl in this castle the cauldron asked and more importantly why are you not at your station on patrol i s sorry sir y you see never mind i do not want to hear your pitiful excuses return to your station and continue your shift i will not have you giving the others false notions of another outsider presence in the castle snape snapped what going on here a large black pointed hat appeared the mouth was a rip near the brim and was currently pressed together tightly in a thin line giving the face an overall stern appearance the hat looked as if it had been interrupted from a nice sleep and was not at all thrilled madam mcgonagall neville cried looking past snape at the hat the hat looked at neville for a second before turning to look at snape what the meaning of this severus she asked longbottom here seems to have let his imagination run away with his undersized brain he seems to believe that there is a girl in the castle snape said as he turned and raised a dark brow a girl she scoffed as her nostrils flared that couldntbe no one ever dares to venture through the forest the only one crazy enough is that old man who we will hopefully never deal with again mcgonagall said as an afterthought with a sigh longbottom i am disappointed in you you should know better than to raise everyone hopes up about something so important as this but madam neville started longbottom please let me remind you of the last time you thought you saw something in the castle what was it a fox the hat paused trying to remember the last time you cried wolf you sent the entire castle on alert for a mouse now listen to me mcgonagall released another sigh everyone is to go back to their sleeping quarters immediately following my announcement she raised her voice so everyone in the kitchen could hear her longbottom you will return to your patrol station and finish out your shift mcgonagall threw a glance at the terra cotta pot as he attempted to protest meanwhile sir snape and i will quickly investigate and search for any sign of humans snape black pewter lip curled into a small sneer mcgonagall didntpay him any mind any questions no one replied very well good night everyone and with that everyone headed back to their cupboards and counters or to their corners or cabinets muttering amongst themselves seamus yawned widely arching his suddenly very flexible wooden handle in a stretch and swished back over to his little corner and rested against the white wall neville however stayed behind but madam good night longbottom madam mcgonagall said with such finality that neville didntdare persist i will see you in the morning for your garden duties at the usual time in the ballroom your shift should almost be over i suggest you return to your post the hat bounced a little closer to the pot understood neville sighed yes madam the pot said defeated neville then clanked out of the kitchen still trying to be quiet for the others sakes but not trying all that hard at all the hat cast a glance at the disgruntled cauldron then looked around to make sure that all of the kitchen staff was settled in seeing that they were madam mcgonagall faced snape once more and bounced over to him leading him into the corridor we can talk in the ballroom the hat said as she bounced over to a swinging door at the far end of the kitchen that had been used for the servants to deliver food the cauldron followed with a scowl on its face snape pushed the door open without much difficulty and mcgonagall followed him out letting the door swing slightly in its frame behind them they entered the dark empty grand ballroom there was only one small candle lit on each of the four walls a puny flame flickering on each stick of wax luckily the moonlight filtered in through the large windows and through the glass doors to the terrace mcgonagall noticed with annoyance that it was still snowing and the stone railing and seats were covered in inches of snow before she could stop herself she made a mental note to remember to have someone shovel the next day ah she thought with bitterness but what would be the point minerva tell me you re not seriously considering that we spend half the night searching for a figment of longbottom overactive imagination snape drawled it not even our own patrol shifts i had no intention of spending half the night searching for anything she said i did however intend on making sure that the castle was in order and checking each station to see if they had seen something you never know it could have been that madman again somehow snape drawled i dontthink they will have seen anything our only witness is longbottom after all well him and crabbe and goyle but i trust i dontneed to explain how impressive their credibility is i know longbottom isntexactly the most reliable person in the castle but i still think it would be better to be safe than sorry a quick check throughout the castle couldntdo much harm mcgonagall stated hopping along with snape to the exit leading to the entrance hall one less hour of sleep is enough harm for me snape complained he was about to continue when something flew in from behind them snape and mcgonagall turned around in unison to see an eagle owl swoop in from the veranda slightly covered in ice crystals the owl gave a quick little shake in attempt to get rid of them unfortunately he failed ah midas mcgonagall exclaimed happily back so soon any sign of the lunatic snape asked midas gave a little squawk and shook his head thank goodness mcgonagall said i dontknow how much more of him i can handle he already tried to break into the castle three times before who knows what he capable of snape said scowling at the moon these nightly patrol shifts are going on much too long i cantwait until that man gives up she sighed again had anyone who was not a resident of the castle witnessed the scene playing out in the ballroom would not have been able to believe their eyes an old hat a pewter cauldron and eagle owl were having a conversation as if it were as normal as the sun rising each morning midas hopped up and down giving another couple of squawks suddenly mcgonagall cheerful face turned serious and snape scowl grew shocked what snape whispered midas flew up into the air and circled around for a bit and then he quickly turned squawking frantically and pointing to the ground with his wing as if he had spotted something midas instantly dropped to the marble floor and started galloping like a horse he turned around and pointed to nothing behind him then squawked once more is there really mcgonagall asked she seemed to be thinking deeply snape had serious matters on his mind as well a girl in the castle her eyes widened in a mixture of delight and excitement this is what we ve been waiting for what kind of girl would travel through the forest snape asked skeptically although you could see somewhere in his pewter eyes that he too was letting the marvel of the situation register oh what does that matter mcgonagall asked ooh neville was right suddenly her eyes showed fear midas she said where is she now midas squawked and motioned towards the exit and the stairs the hat looked as if it were going to be torn up literally quick midas she said suddenly as the severity of it all digested in her mind inform the others tell those on the third floor she exclaimed quickly turning around and hopping over to a door left of the two entrances to the kitchen the cauldron and owl had trouble keeping up with her she was moving so fast that midas even resorted to flying alongside snape rather than running then if you have time come help severus and i stop her dontlet her go any higher than the third floor if she gets any higher we may not get to her first mcgonagall shouted as she reached the door midas turned around in the air and flew to the exit and down the hallway in the direction of the main staircase i shudder to think what the master would do if he found her mcgonagall told snape as she did in fact shudder you know how his temper gets she pushed open the swinging door and hopped down a very small and dark hallway the cauldron followed all the way all too well snape responded grimly as hermione walked along hermione tried to distract herself from sleep with the various fixtures of the corridors the countless furnished cabinets lining the walls were from cherry trees and polished enough to look like a mirror even in the dark every piece of silver was polished and gleaming in the moonlight that shone through the large windows she searched for something that resembled a bedroom any type of room with a bed or couch she wasnttoo picky hermione would peak in open doors as she walked but only ended up being disappointed as she found storage rooms and closets perhaps i should have gone higher up she thought with a sigh as she continued along she turned the corner and came to another corridor with a stone railing on her left if hermione looked over the railing she could see the ground floor again and the large staircase off in the distance then far across on the other side of the staircase was another corridor just like the one she was currently in with another stone railing of its own as she looked up she could see countless floors all designed exactly like this one opening wide into the space before the grand staircase the heart of the castle she wondered just how many floors there were when she had been outside with the castle looming over her it had looked huge but now that she was inside she couldnthelp but wonder just how large the castle really was there were no windows in this corridor and it was very dark the majority of the light came from over the railing suddenly she stopped walking and gasped in mid yawn hermione first thought was that there was an animal sitting on the railing ready to attack but as she looked closer she realized that it was only a stone gargoyle sitting on the railing in fact hermione noticed that there were many gargoyles all sitting in the same position with the same fiendish grin splattered across their faces it was a while until hermione came to another staircase this one was much much smaller compared to the main staircase also unlike the main staircase this set of stairs had a line of sconces hung on the wall none of them lit yawning twice as she went up hoped with all hope that there would be a bed waiting for her at the top as hermione reached the top she realized something near the end of the hall was flickering light into the upcoming corridor midas silently swooped out the ballroom and through the large open area containing the main staircase gliding along he rose up to the second floor and sat next to one of the gargoyles on the railing he skimmed the opposite side of the stairs for any sign of the girl his golden orbs flickering in the moonlight he hopped a little to left to get a better view of the third floor and squinted nothing as midas was hopping back a little closer to the gargoyle he heard movement from behind him on the stairs coming up the staircase was the girl midas had seen in the forest and she was walking towards him as she passed by him he was sure to swerve around the stone gargoyle keeping out of sight wasting no time he swooped from the railing and into the air not stopping until he reached his destination gliding along the new corridor madam mcgonagall voice kept ringing in his head dontlet her go any higher than the third floor there was a small room at the end of the corridor on the third floor where a few servants usually slept endearingly called the common room by its regular occupants midas gave himself a little shake as he swooped down and reached its door giving the slightly ajar door a nudge with his feathery head his eyes raked over the cozy round room full of red squishy armchairs the fire in the stone hearth had already almost died completely and midas had to search the room more closely for the two servants he was looking for snoring softly on a throw pillow in one of the armchairs was a paintbrush there was a small face hidden in the bristles of the sleeping utensil but its closed eyes were barely visible in the dark brush he rushed to the armchair where the paintbrush was sleeping the subsequent breeze of air disturbing the glowing embers in the fireplace suddenly a lone white candle sitting on the hearth stirred and a flame came alight at its wick a face materialized as the wax shifted and two brows appeared as they furrowed together underneath a hole in the wax opened wide with a sleepy yawn blaise eyes opened groggily and glared in the direction of the bird who had disturbed his lovely dream he had been snogging that feather duster who slept in the fifth floor storage room giving another large yawn he glanced at a gold clock hanging on the wall he looked at midas who was now nudging the pillow where dean was trying to sleep then looked back at the clock midas blaise said fighting back yet another violent yawn it not our night to patrol let the poor artist sleep midas quickly turned around causing blaise to jump with such strength that his flame almost went out the next thing blaise knew midas was right up in front of his wax nose jumping around and making bizarre gestures with his feathery wings squawking every once and awhile for good measure blaise followed midas with his eyes trying to decipher whatever message midas seemed to be trying to give him finally after thirty more seconds of insane wing gesticulations midas stopped and let his wings drop back to his sides he stood there in front of him looking at him expectantly for an answer blaise just stared dumbly three years he had spent with the owl as a candle and he never once had this much difficulty trying to translate midas gestures erm blaise said could you repeat that midas looked at the candle unbelievingly instead of repeating the message again like blaise requested midas quickly hopped back over to the armchair where dean was still snoring midas started nudging the red throw pillow again attempting to wake dean up but failed horribly blaise sighed he hopped his way over to the end of the side table and jumped to his neighboring armchair he hopped across the cushions until he reached the opposite arm using his fortunate amount of momentum he vaulted off the arm for the armchair where dean was still sleeping soundly he landed very nicely on a gold throw pillow near dean and hopped his way over to the paintbrush oi blaise said he bent over his wax body suddenly very flexible and moved his mouth close to where dean ears would be if he had any wake up and figure out what this bird trying to tell me blaise said to the paintbrush dean slept on as if nothing had happened blaise and midas shared eye contact for a second before blaise turned back dean he tried again impatience growing dean thomas oh for the love of wake up you bloody artist dean was up instantly he gave a startled cry and made a move as if he was going to bolt for the door but blaise and midas quickly stopped him midas threw a quick glance at the door to see if the girl was coming down the hallway she hadntreached the third floor yet but he knew that she d be here very soon bloody hell blaise dean said noticing that is was in fact midas and blaise who had woken him up and were now towering over him you didnthave to scream in my ear blaise was about to comment but wasntgiven the chance what d you wake me up for anyway he asked we donthave patrol duty tonight i know blaise said giving midas an annoyed glance midas merely shrugged ask the bird he woke me up too dean looked questioningly at midas who was glaring at blaise for calling him the bird midas instantly restarted his odd wing gesture message blaise sat on his gold throw pillow staring at midas dumbly again midas wings were moving so fast he couldntmake out anything the owl was trying to tell them midas message finally ended and his wings dropped to his sides like two very heavy bricks his shoulders drooped down a little and he looked exhausted blaise was debating if he should dare try asking midas to repeat it again when dean spoke no he said his dark eyes wide is there really he shook his head cantbe his voice filled with incredulity blaise was too preoccupied with trying to figure out how dean understood anything from midas wild wing gestures rather than trying to figure out what couldntbe i mean dean went on that impossible midas shook his head blaise looked back and forth between the two he finally focused on what dean was saying what is blaise asked didntyou get what midas just told us dean looked at blaise but didntgive him a chance to answer because he turned back to face midas he didntsee the indignant look on the candle face either in the castle there s there a a blimey a what blaise said impatiently he didntlike it when he didntknow things that other people knew it happened a lot there a girl dean said a girl is in the castle dean eyes suddenly filled with excitement she hasntseen anyone from the castle yet well except for midas but none of us dean began to speak very quickly she from the other side of the forest midas lured her here with the help of her horse midas says he a real nice guy anyway she come to break the spell dean blaise said only she doesntknow that yet madam mcgonagall going to have her live in the castle dean continued she going to spend her time here in one of the old guest rooms and turn us all back to normal dean slow down blaise was feeling dizzy did dean say there was a girl in the castle dean stopped talking and looked at the confused candle did you just say blaise started that there a girl in the castle dean nodded vigorously blaise looked at him as if he was insane a girl in this castle blaise echoed slowly dean nodded again blaise gradually turned his gaze to the floor his eyes widened the statement had finally dawned on him there a girl in the castle blaise said excitedly and whooped with joy i ll be human again the candlestick began jumping around and bouncing up and down on throw pillows almost setting them on fire oh what i d give to be mortal again i swear the first thing i ll do when i human is find that feather duster from the fifth floor storage room britney bridgett dean cocked an eyebrow whatever blaise continued her yeah bridgett and then i ll midas made a large squawk blaise looked slightly upset for being interrupted dean looked thankful but had no time to mope for midas began telling them that the girl was coming this way and that he didntknow how she d take seeing a talking candlestick and paintbrush he warned them to be cautious when she finally saw them they didntwant to scare her away the two sat like statues as midas told them staring at the owl intently when midas finished he felt like flopping down and going to sleep luckily he managed to hold himself up there a girl in the castle dean repeated quietly blaise nodded there a girl blaise repeated in the castle they were in awe wait a second blaise said his forehead scrunching up together mcgoogle going to let her stay in the castle he raised a brow and turned to midas does he know about it yet blaise didntsound very excited anymore dean caught on and his excitement died down as well midas shook his head slowly but dean said if he doesntknow then we re going to be in so much trouble blaise interrupted hanging his head dean nodded his head gravely in agreement midas nervously glanced back out in the hallway and his bottom beak fell open the girl was almost half way down the hall his eyes widened and he suddenly turned towards blaise and dean and started quietly giving them instructions hermione continued to walk along the corridor of the third floor squinting hard to see what had been at the end of the hallway there was a fire burning in that room she knew that much from the constant flickering of light through the crack of the open door but who on earth would light a fire in an abandoned castle like this criminals hermione pushed the idea back out of her mind she thought it d be better if she didntgive herself anything else to worry about if there were criminals then well she d be done for but hermione decided she didntreally want to think about that she reached the door seeing that it was open just a crack she peered in when she didntsee anyone or any movement of any kind she gently pushed the door open wider it was an ordinary room filled with armchairs and couches the only thing peculiar about the room was the fact that there was a dying fire burning freely in the hearth well that and the two items on a side table near an armchair hermione walked over to the table to get a better look at them there was a clean paintbrush and a white candle in a green holder her brows furrowed together in thought as she reached for the paintbrush picking it up she took another look around the room she turned the paintbrush over in her fingers for a little bit before gently setting it back down on the table she picked up the candleholder and brought it up to her eyes she looked at the fancy designs on the holder before setting it back down on the table and walking to the fireplace the mantle was bare but oddly enough not covered in even the thinnest layer of dust hermione wiped her finger across the wood and rubbed it together her with her thumb no dust at all we like to keep things tidy a voice said hermione jumped and gave a small cry of surprise her hand instinctively placing itself over her chest to calm her heart which was now bouncing around in her ribcage she turned around expecting to see a man standing in the doorway instead she found the eagle owl she had seen earlier that night he was sitting on the top of the armchair near the side table with the two interesting objects hermione looked around the room where did hermione cut off glancing at the bird who where did you come from hermione finally managed to say she looked around the room again there were no windows so the only entrance to the room was the door who said that hermione was so surprised to see the bird again that she almost forgot someone had just spoken to her i did the voice said again cheerfully hermione looked around but saw no one she moved a little to the side to look out through the wide open door but saw that there wasntanyone in the corridor not there said the voice amused not there either down here hermione looked at the spot where the voice was coming from she raised a brow questioningly as she looked at the side table giving the bird a quick frustrated glance at the top of his armchair hermione bent down a little to see the items better er hermione started hello well this is stupid she thought first i talking to an owl now i on to inanimate objects hermione was about to go back to the idea that this was all a very bad dream and she d wake up nice and cozy in her own bed in just a few more seconds when the voice spoke again hello it chirped midas slapped a wing to his forehead in a very annoyed manner but hermione didntsee she stumbled backwards with a strangled noise it was if her throat tried to gasp and scream at the same time but couldntmake up its mind resulting in a very odd noise that resembled something being smacked very hard in the face a face had popped up in the candle with two eyes a nose and a mouth resembling that of any human face the candle had spoken clearly and happily to her as if there was nothing unusual about this situation at first hermione couldntspeak she just stood there staring at the candle unbelievingly the candle wore a large smile and was staring at her evidently finding nothing wrong with his ability to communicate how hermione was trying to say something but found herself with nothing you can but you cant hermione kept spitting out words but hadntmanaged to form a sentence yet you re a a candle but you can hermione slapped her hand to her forehead i going crazy she concluded closing her eyes no you re not said another voice hermione eyes popped open in time to see a face appear in the bristles of the paintbrush i can talk too the brush said happily hermione eyes widened and midas gaped at the two with his beak wide open in shock ohh hermione groaned i already insane she whispered to herself the eagle owl fluttered his wings a little as he plopped down onto the arm of the chair and nodded his head towards the two objects hermione looked at the owl then at the paintbrush and finally the candlestick she slowly backed away and plopped down when she felt the bottom of a couch touch her heels she sat there with her hands limp in her lap staring at the three this cantbe happening hermione said out loud you re an owl you re a paintbrush and you re a candlestick she pointed at each of them you canttalk but we can said the candlestick still smiling at her bemusedly hermione continued to stare at the objects this time when she tried to speak she didnthave much difficulty but why how you re definitely not supposed to hermione was feeling dizzy now she put her head in her hands and tried to soothe away an oncoming headache too tired too tired too tired it a long story the candlestick told her hopping off the table onto the cushioned chair and onto the red carpet but we can explain that later the paintbrush and owl followed the candlestick to the couch oh he exclaimed i terribly sorry and he bowed so low that hermione was afraid he might set the carpet on fire we haventbeen properly introduced still bowing he continued all the while giving her a very charming smile blaise zabini at your service this here is my good friend dean thomas dean interrupted bowing as well blaise gave him an annoyed look that went unnoticed your very own art expert dean looked at the owl midas hooted happily and bowed just as low as dean and blaise blaise was finally allowed another chance to speak the owl next to him whom you ve already met is midas blaise finally stood up and ended his bow and just who might you be miss hermione looked up and stared at them she still found the idea of all this being a dream very appealing but answered their question nonetheless i hermione she replied er hermione granger that is she scratched her forehead absentmindedly well miss hermione granger blaise said it a pleasure to have you here i do believe you re very tired and all this excitement is only adding to your fatigue he hopped a little closer to the couch where hermione was sitting dean and i will escort you to your room he started hopping toward the door but hermione didntmove from the couch oh why thank you hermione said quietly deciding that she d just give in she didntexactly believe that following three inanimate objects around an old castle was an excellent idea but she didnthave too much of a choice and this had to be a dream after all right she was less picky with her options as she steadily grew more tired she knew it was long past midnight and dawn would arrive quickly hermione came in the castle looking for a place to sleep so why shouldntshe accept the offer of a nice warm room to sleep in wait hermione paused my room surely you mean as in for tonight only she looked at the three warily er blaise and dean looked at each other well hermione was about to ask him what he meant when she heard something in the corridor where could he be madam mcgonagall said as she hopped up another few steps taking two at a time when she could i haventthe slightest idea snape replied normally i d assume that he d be off brooding in his chambers at this time of night but i dontsuppose he d be there now considering what tonight is the two had walked down a small dark hallway for only a minute or so before they came to a wooden staircase that was just as wide as the hallway maybe miss parkinson would know where he is mcgonagall thought out loud we donthave enough time to get to her snape said besides i doubt she would tell us true mcgonagall said hopping up another step finally she hopped off the last step onto a long landing which led to another wooden door minerva snape said as he hopped up onto the landing and went toward her just what are you planning to tell him when we find him madam mcgonagall pursed her lips in a thoughtful way i really dontknow severus she replied opening the door i guess we ll just have to tell him the truth i canteven fathom hiding something as important as this i suppose afterwards we ll just have to give him a chance to calm himself and hope that he doesntdo anything rash she didntseem satisfied with her answer but before she could give any further response snape replied the truth snape asked raising a brow questioningly we just let a stranger practically waltz right into the castle and we have no intention of sending her home he said do you honestly think he ll be calm he asked as he followed mcgonagall into anther much smaller hallway he hates visitors i know mcgonagall sighed as she reached the end of the hallway there was a frame for a door but no door actually resided there it led to a room that was filled with broomsticks mops feather dusters and many more cleaning utensils that were all sound asleep some were even snoring softly i know mcgonagall whispered again careful not to wake the others but i sure he wontbe so quick to turn her away as soon as he just thinks about the possibilities and surely you can knock some sense into him i minerva snape asked almost forgetting to whisper what on earth makes you believe he d listen to me madam mcgonagall gave him a dry look you re the only one he ll listen to she answered impatiently mcgonagall hopped over to another sliding door and pushed it open now she said looking left and right where could he be they were in another corridor one that almost resembled the corridors hermione was walking down at that very moment the stone floors had a red velvet rug running down the center sconces were hanging on the walls and wooden furniture was sitting against the wall there were even a couple of suits of armor on each side of the hallway snape deliberated this way snape told mcgonagall as he went left mcgonagall followed what are you thinking severus mcgonagall asked i thought you said that he wouldntbe in his chambers tonight that he d be off in some other part of the castle i did snape interrupted as he hopped further down the corridor we arentgoing to his rooms his tone was almost impatient where are we going then she asked to the astronomy tower he replied not bothering to turn around the astronomy tower they reached the end of the corridor and came to a small set of stairs reaching the top they continued to hop down the corridor and turned right when it that came to an end they continued to go down numerous corridors coming to a staircase or cutting through a special room every so often they had traveled up at least five floors before they spoke again minerva snape whispered glancing about the hallway it was eerily quiet in the corridor the only noise being the soft clinks of the cauldron hopping along the stone tiles and the muffled swishing sound of the hat sweeping across the floor the hallway was very plain carpets were absent from the corridor floors and no furnishings or decorations of any sort sat in the hall just the usual line of sconces on the walls very few of which were lit however whatever the corridor lacked in detail elaborateness it certainly made up for in its height the stone walls towered over the two figures not nearly as high as the ceiling of the grand ballroom but still very high to the left were windows all of which were just as large it was dark outside but the full moon rays showered down on everything below and filtered in through these windows causing the figures shadows to mirror their movements on the wall to their left outside the snow glittered in the bluish light whether it was covering the numerous tree branches the clearing around the castle the castle itself or the very sky as the snowflakes drifted closer and closer to the earth madam mcgonagall was so absorbed in her thoughts of the night events and her plans for the future that she didnthear snape until he was directly in front of her causing them to almost collide her eyes snapped up just in time to see him and she instantly stopped oh mcgonagall said feeling a headache starting sorry severus you were saying snape hadntreally been saying anything just calling her a name a few times but he still gave her a very stern look if it had been anyone but madam mcgonagall i was saying snape said trying not to sound too impatient with the headmistress i just hope you realize that this may not go very well he hopped to the left and began walking side by side with mcgonagall again for all we know he could very well have lost all hope completely a long time ago he may not even have enough sense to give this a try in fact if he already given up entirely then who to say he wontjust kill the girl the first time he lays eyes on her think of the punishment we d receive for letting someone into the castle mcgonagall shook her head slightly i realize that i do and knowing him i honestly wouldntbe surprised if he has given up all hope mcgonagall said how encouraging snape scowled you didntlet me finish mcgonagall said purposely ignoring his sarcasm i not about to let our chance to become human again be lost forever because our master is too incapable of controlling his emotions she said determinedly as the pace of her walk found a new briskness besides he wouldntreally hurt anyone no matter how much he threatened even i can see that mcgonagall tone suddenly grew somber and quiet snape knew she was right it had been disturbing to see the reactions of his master to everything he d done during his first night as a werewolf snape himself had a hard enough time helping to clean up the corpses and blood strewn all over the castle but he canteven begin to fathom what it must have been like for him the stench of the dead had been unbearable if snape found difficulty in walking these halls what kind of torture had the prince endured with his heightened senses everywhere he d walked snape had found servants and royal subjects mutilated some barely even recognizable the guilt weighing down over the prince must have been unbearable the prince had confined himself to his chambers again and this time no one tried to make him emerge when it came time to try to encourage him come out once more weeks after snape was the only one that seemed to have any success the prince would yell at the servants who brought him food to go away that he wished for everyone to leave him alone when snape came to give the prince his food he hadntspoken at all snape knocked twice on the large wooden doors trying not to drop the silver tray balancing on top of him he was so frustrated recently not being able to do things normally it was very hard to do anything anymore his actions being limited by his new form as they were he no longer had the use of hands after all master snape sat outside the two doors scowling silently as he waited for a response nothing snape gave an impatient sigh and knocked again still nothing he hadntreally expected any sort of reply from the prince but he was still very irritated seeing as he would definitely have to open the door on his own all the while balancing a very heavy tray on top of what he d like to think was his head the other servants would just leave the master meal outside the door so the prince could take it when he couldnthear anyone out in the hall but snape had had enough it was time for the prince to start venturing out into the other parts of the castle again not because he was supposed to rule there wasntmuch left to rule of course but for his own sanity after much effort and a lot of quiet grunting master snape managed to open the door enough to slide inside at first he was confused he almost thought that he d gone to the wrong room which was to say ridiculous he thought he d stumbled upon one of those deserted storage rooms that were no longer used the room was extremely dark despite the fact that it was around noon the curtains were closed tightly and not even the smallest ray of sunlight made it inside the room the prince four poster bed was now a three post nest of ripped blankets and pillows the floors were littered with feathers from the torn pillows and tattered cloth in one area the ground was covered with shards of glass from one of the many antique trinkets that had been sitting somewhere on his many shelves books were scattered about the room as if they had been ripped out of their places in a mad rage and hurled in every direction pages were crudely severed from the bindings and laid about the room in shredded pieces all furniture in sight had been damaged somehow oddly enough snape master wasntin sight sir snape carefully slid forward a little just enough to be out of the way of the door when it opened and slowly and cautiously set down the tray only spilling a little of the milk after almost successfully setting down the meal snape continued to look around the massacred room more books scattered about the room shredded pages a thin blanket across the floor sheets thrown up over the windows and were pinned up at the entrance the balcony to help keep out the light garments and more torn cloth strewn all about these things gave snape a terrible feeling of sadness a feeling that he couldntseem to describe but there was one damaged item in particular that troubled him there on the wall lopsided and barely hanging on its nail was the mangled portrait of the prince but it didntlook much like him anymore it had been done just before the king and queen mysteriously fell ill when the kingdom was still a happy place a knot began twisting violently in the pit of snape stomach but he instantly fought down the feeling this was no time to mourn what had been especially not for snape he was never one to dwell on the past the best painter in the kingdom which had in fact been the royal family personal painter was hired to do the task snape remembered seeing the final product and thinking that dean had indeed done a very good job he bitterly remembered how his master complained about having to sit still for so long you would have thought being as vain as he was that he would ve loved the process of having his own personal portrait being made but alas he complained and complained and complained the prince never really sat well with boredom now that poor painter hard work was thrown away slash marks from his very own claws were made down the center of the prince face and then three more slashes in a half hazard pattern that snape couldntdecipher the part of the canvas where his face was painted being ripped and torn fell limply toward the ground only his chin was left visible the rest of the face was practically hanging on the wall by threads snape stared at the portrait with some sort of grim fascination he wanted to look away but he just couldntbring himself to avert his gaze he could ve sat there all day and just looked at it but soon his common sense returned and he realized he would be needed in the kitchen soon feeling slightly disgusted with himself for getting so absorbed in his old memories snape headed for the door but as he was turning for the doors he saw something out of his peripheral vision his master the prince hadntmoved snape had only just noticed his presence he was near the entrance to his balcony sitting on the floor with his forearms resting on his knees he was in the same tattered clothing that he had been wearing the night it happened and snape noticed with a feeling of disgust that there were still some bloodstains on the cloth the prince was staring off into space to his right looking at something without actually seeing it sir snape nor any other servant for that matter had really seen the prince since he transformed and snape couldntexactly say that they had gotten a good look at him running for their lives and all but his master didntlook like some ferocious bloodthirsty monster now he was not some vicious carnivorous beast that would slaughter them all without the slightest hesitation he was a sad lonely boy grieving for his beloved parents and the many people who he had unknowingly murdered snape didnttry to resist the painful knot in his stomach this time the prince was not only his master his lord he was family but he knew that trying to console the prince was futile if anything it d only make matters worse so instead snape simply informed the prince that his meal was on the floor and that if he needed anything else he d be in the kitchen snape didntreceive a reply though he hadntexpected one the prince didnteven acknowledge the fact that he was there snape bowed slightly then made his way to the door the prince still silently staring off into space never uttering a sound the servants had been buried and the endless blood was scrubbed away from every nook and cranny known in the castle lord riddle body had been disposed of first understandably snape had never honestly trusted lord riddle much but he never thought anything like this would come from him his body and belongings were burnt to cinders not even the smallest traces of bones were visible the ashes were then scattered miles away in a place the prince would never have reason to visit the castle was stripped of anything having to do with lord riddle and his bedchamber on one of the lower levels near the dungeons was locked and blocked off completely it was as if tom riddle had never existed two weeks after that night the castle looked as if nothing out of the ordinary happened save its inhabitants the servants continued their work as if nothing had happened desperately trying to adjust to their new bodies no one ever spoke directly of that night again in an unspoken agreement between all who lived in the castle it was decided that to speak of that night was forbidden riddle name would never be uttered again it took weeks for the prince to emerge and it took even longer for parts of his old self to resurface the temper returned the self absorption the sarcastic witticisms but where was the warmth that snape remembered the young snarky carefree troublemaker that used to sneak visits to him in the kitchen to slip out a spare biscuit when he thought he wasntlooking the thoughtful son who only wanted to please his parents where had that boy gone he died that night snape knew died with tom riddle with his countless subjects and with his hope with a small sigh master snape came back to the present leaving his memories in the far corners of his mind he glanced to the left and watched the snowfall as he walked we should move faster he said hopping along the stone a little quicker who knows how much time has passed since we left the ballroom mcgonagall moved along just as fast what makes you think he ll be in the tower she asked him she had been wondering for a while now it just a hunch snape answered vaguely staring in front of him for the girl sake i hope you re right she hopped along faster he could very well be downstairs actually racing to wherever she is right now she tried to clear the image from her mind i hope so too snape said inaudibly as they reached the staircase that would lead them to the highest tower it was dark but that was preferable he belonged there he sat on the railing of the outer balcony leaning his back against the ancient bricks of the castle wall he didntmove to brush off the thin layer of snow covering him or the snowflakes that drifted down lazily to sit on his head and shoulders he sat there on the ledge staring off at the endless expanse of large trees sighing slightly he let his head fall back against the wall and closed his eyes not bothering to flinch as the snow fell on his closed eyelids or shiver when a slight breeze ruffled his black cloak he barely felt them opening his eyes he tilted his head up and looked at the sky there staring back at him was the face of the man which appeared every month when it was hideously full how ironic he decided that the universe would send him a full moon on such a night he glared at the countless dots of light above him cursing each and every one of them silently for what he didntknow they were alongside the moon that was reason enough but he grew distracted by snow covered branches of the trees and he watched as they glittered in the moonlight and as they swayed in the slight breeze for hours he had been up here staring at everything and nothing at the same time oblivious to everything else that was happening around him he d ignored those that were foolish enough to come up to his chambers to speak with him and so he d eventually sought refuge in the tower the trees and the moon were his only company but someone was coming now he realized with irritation his ears perked up at the swishing sound that could only belong to mcgonagall and the sound of pewter colliding with stone that he knew far too well scoffing and staring at the trees again he ignored their presence they of all people should know better than to try to disturb him they d give up soon enough and he d go back to staring at the trees in precious silence he heard them come up the staircase leading to the astronomy tower and their quiet whispering to each other though he didntbother to decipher what was being said no matter he thought they ll be gone soon enough they reached the top of the stairs and entered the large room he could hear them walking toward the balcony where he sat making sure not to knock over any of the rusting telescopes or instruments on their way he hadntbothered to close the glass door when he came out meaning the snow had probably filtered its way into the building along with the wind and cold oh well let the castle get cold master mcgonagall said as she stepped out onto the snow covered balcony there was fear in her voice as much as she tried to hide it he ignored her master she tried again i think we have some information that you might want to know about she hopped out onto the stone balcony snape right behind her mcgonagall had fought down her apprehension and now her voice was full of determination he could tell that snape just had the usual slight scowl on his face as he continued to stare at the trees he heard him give a sigh barely audible to his own ears master draco snape said trying his very best not to let his impatience show it seems we have a visitor if it that old man again i dontcare draco replied not taking his eyes off a particular tree branch to the left do whatever you need to just keep him out of the castle and get him out of my hair he waved his right paw in a dismissive kind of way in what he hoped was their direction go leave me alone master draco snape said trying harder than ever to be patient the last thing he wanted to do was thoroughly irritate his master before adding fuel to the proverbial fire have you sensed any unfamiliar presence around the castle recently snape moved a little closer to the ledge draco heaved a dramatic sigh no he said curtly i haven t you haventsmelt any unfamiliar scent about the castle then mcgonagall also hopped closer no nothing out of the ordinary snape added draco turned his head to look at the two of them they were eyeing him expectantly what are you two up to draco bushy eyebrows furrowed together suspiciously what are you talking about an unfamiliar presence he scoffed like you two would let anything really get in the castle he sighed again and slumped back against the brick ignoring the sharp jab of pain he felt in his lower back from the impact he turned his gaze to the stars and mcgonagall and snape shared a look of mutual uneasiness master draco snape continued after receiving a meaningful glance from mcgonagall midas discovered someone in the forest tonight get rid of them he said instantly not turning his gaze away from the trees we think you might be interested in them mcgonagall told him i not draco replied indifferently send them away and leave me alone i dontwant to hear of anyone from the other side of this forest understood he didntwait for a reply now leave me master draco snape gritted out in one giant leap he was now on top of the ledge in front of the prince who watched him in slight surprise under different circumstances snape might have been more yielding toward draco brooding and sulking but not tonight tonight someone who had the ability to change everything stepped right into their castle and he was not going to let draco ruin it i suggest my lord that you listen to what we have to say mcgonagall stepped closer to the ledge looking very bold draco eyed them warily what are you two going on about master draco snape said slowly we think you might be interested in her the prince didntrespond and mcgonagall used the moment to her advantage someone stumbled upon the castle tonight mcgonagall said midas discovered a young woman near the opposite end of the forest this evening and lured her here with the help of her horse she tried to speak calmly and seriously but it was impossible not to notice the slight tinge of excitement in her voice the excitement that was overpowering her apprehension she here in the castle at this very moment snape informed him waiting for a reaction draco was staring at him but didntseem to actually see him this is our only chance he blurted out she the only girl that been even remotely near the castle in years snape went on if she isntthe one to break the spell then we re destined for an eternity as cooking appliances and cleaning utensils and you as what you are mcgonagall eyed him cautiously but trusted his judgment master draco her tone was almost pleading she our last hope this girl she can break the spell she the one they waited for his response master snape asked wariness just barely noticeable draco turned toward them and swung his legs over the stone ledge resting his paws on the railing he stared at them all the while finally as snape was about to say his name again he spoke cocking his head to the side and closing his eyes his voice sounded strained and disbelieving a stranger in the castle he said his eyes still closed snape and mcgonagall shared a quick nervous glance yes my lord but mcgonagall started werentmy direct orders to let no one in this castle his voice sounded more strained than ever as if it was taking everything he had to keep his voice at one volume they re not welcome send them away now draco sneered as a normal human this expression had been bad enough but with the addition of his werewolf appearance the result could terrify grown men into running for their lives snape however was no grown man currently he was a pewter cauldron and this cauldron had had enough of his master painful tenacity and was ready to be human again damn it all but they couldntjust force him to take in the young woman no that wouldntwork he d probably scare her off and that would just as bad as not trying at all they had to handle this slowly and carefully delicately diplomatically snape thought carefully for a few seconds they had to do the planning the strategy but make it seem to him like he was really calling the shots he d be making the decisions but it would be madam mcgonagall and he who would be pushing him in all the right directions but how to make it appear this way my lord snape started not bothering as much to hide the plea in his tone his chance at being human again was at stake surely you realize you have nothing to lose from letting her stay in the castle my peace of mind draco answered sourly giving snape a glare of annoyance it was a look snape didntoften receive himself but snape did not notice his patience was almost at its limit if this had been anyone other than draco mcgonagall let out a small cry of frustration apparently she was well past her breaking point her fabric face scrunched up into the scariest fiercest glare snape had ever seen which was to say very scary you are positively impossible i going to check on her and the others she announced defiantly to the prince who couldntmanage to completely hide the shock he felt there had been few occasions where any servants questioned him let alone challenged him you knock some sense in to him she said exasperatedly to snape her face contorted with rage for all of our sakes and with that she swiftly turned toward the door striding back into the castle tall and resolute draco who seemed to have lost his composure for the past few moments suddenly found his voice you how dare come back here mcgonagall draco bellowed but she didntstop after hearing the prince call the hat stood up straighter snape was sure that if mcgonagall had been human then she would have left the room with her nose in the air draco rounded on snape just who does she think she is he spat angrily talking to me like that what respect he scowled as he returned his gaze to the chef who was returning his glare in full force the two had a full fledged staring contest going for at least a minute before snape broke the silence the girl snape said simply what about her draco said his eyes narrowing snape fought down the urge to bang him over the head with one of the telescopes sitting on the balcony i had assumed i need not remind you of the curse placed over all of our heads snape said barely aware of just how venomous his voice sounded in all honesty he was getting dangerously close to stepping over some boundaries but of course desperate times call for desperate measures but i think now that a reminder is necessary seeing as you clearly cantseem to put two and two together to find that a solution to that very curse is right in front of you waiting for you in your very own castle draco eyes narrowed further more dangerously but snape didntseem to notice donttell me that the possibility hasnteven crossed your mind at least once his voice softened somewhat and draco turned to the trees especially now now that there a young woman here have you even thought of actually trying to break the spell of course i ve thought about it draco growled out suddenly i think about it everyday i cantget it out of my head his blue eyes turned toward snape maliciously of course i ve thought about the possibility of course the thought has occurred to me the thought haunted me ever since i became this this this monster i not an idiot snape draco glowered at the stone tiles his voice acidic dontthink that i dontrealize what a girl coming across the castle could mean for our future he said his voice thickening and his grimace slowly fading away but there a thought that plagued my mind far more often than the possibility of becoming human again the thought of staying forever in the body of this hideous thing that i am and all of you trapped forever in whatever place you re left his eyes were staring blankly at the tile again snape was silent he wasntsure what he could say i understand that the fate of everyone who ever cared for me is in my hands he looked at his arms and chuckled mirthlessly paws he stared up at the moon again eyes narrowing and mouth curving into that frightening sneer snape vaguely realized that it was still snowing and that he was very cold but who to say that girl down there wontrun screaming at the very sight of me draco turned toward snape his voice sharp and resentful or if she stays but decides within the next few days that the sight of me sickens her what stopping her from escaping and when she returns home to tell everyone in her village that the old lunatic who keeps coming around here isntreally as senile and crazy as everyone would like to believe what stopping them from coming and terrorizing the castle until our time is up he turned back to the sky lost in his thoughts suppose she does stay here and my appearance doesntcompletely make her cringe suppose she feels nothing for me for her entire stay except the deepest loathing for me as her captor and all of your efforts tonight are completely wasted he scoffed and above all sir snape what even gives you the idea that i ll feel anything for this commoner his sneer returned more horrid than before the wind blew against the glass panes of the door leading back into the tower snape repressed a shiver as the breeze nipped at his nose draco didntseem to notice destined to love a peasant girl am i draco said with a small sad smile his voice eerily hollow or we re all destined for a horrible eternity to share with only ourselves as we slowly descend into madness snape didnttrust himself enough to speak there were a few more moments of silence draco broke himself from his quiet little reverie i ll let her stay here draco said indifferently but under my own terms understood draco stood from the ledge and walked to the glass doors he didntbother letting snape answer and the chef knew it was rhetorical anyway snape hopped down from the icy ledge which now seemed like a very dangerous spot being stories high above the ground he hopped into the soft fluffy padding of fresh snow on the balcony floor and followed his master back into that castle well at least he allowing her to stay snape thought but there was something in the way the prince had agreed that snape didntlike wait hermione paused my room surely you mean as in for tonight only she looked at the three warily er blaise and dean looked at each other well hermione was about to ask him what he meant when she heard something in the corridor her eyes widened slightly at the noise and she instinctively leaned slightly forward to hear only there werentany footsteps just a soft sweeping noise as if someone was brushing a piece of fabric across the wall she sent an inquisitive look in blaise direction but it seemed that hermione was long forgotten to all of her newfound friends for they were obviously more concerned with whoever or whatever was out in the hall madam mcgoo mcgonagall blaise suddenly chirped how lovely you look this evening save it mr zabini hermione heard a woman voice she didntsound pleased at all i donthave time or the patience to deal with your antics so sorry madam blaise bowed my sincerest apologies spare me said the woman exasperated hermione could hear the sweeping sound more clearly now she looked up expecting to find a woman older than she but saw nothing the voice had sounded so close that she could ve sworn she was in the room and yet there was no woman i right down here dear said the voice hermione looked down and was amazed yet somehow not entirely surprised to see another not so inanimate item there sitting on the floor was an old worn pointed hat the hat face was the only thing in which hermione could truly see a resemblance to any human hermione was so caught up in the mesh of endless thoughts swimming around in her brain that she didntrealize that dean was speaking to her miss hermione granger he asked miss granger hermione he told him call me hermione please she blinked a few times to clear the last couple of thoughts from her mind well miss granger or hermione i believe we owe you some explanations the hat said in a very authoritative manner allow me to introduce myself she stepped out of the doorway and closer to the couch where hermione sat you may refer to me as madam mcgonagall mcgoogle blaise coughed quietly in the background i what you could call the headmistress of this castle mcgonagall who had heard blaise comment and dean muffled sniggers turned to give them an annoyed look forgive me but please excuse them i hope they haventgiven you an unpleasant impression of what we re like here at the castle oh no not at all hermione said instantly they have been very courteous she smiled slightly and dean and blaise puffed up with pride if not a little terrifying you said what we re like are there more of you mcgonagall gave a little solemn sigh and blaise and dean hopped closer to her feet midas flew over to the arm of the couch and looked at hermione with sad eyes yes mcgonagall said simply many more but how we never used to be this way mcgonagall told her quietly we were human a few years before but a great tragedy fell upon our kingdom hermione didntsay anything there was but she paused as if unsure if she should go on the others were looking at her earnestly there was obviously something significant in what she was planning to say there was an extreme betrayal mcgonagall lowered her eyes as did the others no one could ve expected it nor could it have been prevented in anyway but because of it we were cursed by a gypsy to live as what we are hermione stayed silent wanting to hear more and positive that she had nothing to say a spell was cast upon us she continued we as in the servants of the royal family were to take on the forms of the objects that we were most associated with royal family hermione asked mcgonagall nodded just a few years before this kingdom flourished the king and queen were loved and admired and at peace with all other kingdoms around have you ever heard of our kingdom the royal malfoy family hermione shook her head and she could ve sworn that she heard dean give a disappointed sigh we were sure that the people who had left the kingdom a great many people did would have shared with others about what was happening we thought that even despite the curse we would have had that at least wait hermione stiffened oh my goodness am i the first to visit hermione asked guardedly the second actually blaise said we ve had a few unwelcome visits from some lunatic who keeps causing trouble but nothing other than that lunatic hermione asked but she already knew yeah dean scoffed the man been trying to spy on us you know he breaks in through windows and all sorts of stuff but he always gets away midas nodded fervently hermione stiffened mad eye her mind screamed it was mad eye i sure of it i cantbelieve it but it was just a made up story he canthave been telling the truth he not sane well neither are you bloody annoying he is blaise commented unaware of hermione epiphany language mr zabini no worries madam she going to be staying with us for awhile so there no need to put up a formal act now besides i sure hermione here doesntmind wait a second hermione said suddenly you know hermione started i have heard of this kingdom in fairy tales blaise looked taken aback fairy tales dean asked he looked as if he wasntexactly opposed to this idea am i in them blaise asked mr zabini sorry the man who keeps coming to the castle i know him well in a manner of speaking he tells stories to the children in my village on the other side of the forest hermione was vaguely reminded of the fact that she was losing whatever sanity she had left erm he used to tell us of a happy and peaceful kingdom on the other side where no one fought and people were kind but recently his stories have been less than cheerful she paused so the bloke was spying on us for stories was he dean asked no one in particular mcgonagall shook her head it was clear that he lived on the other side she said but i never imagined that he was telling others about us in fairy tales it no wonder we didnthave other visitors she said crossly no one would believe a maniac about us if anything our castle is the last place anyone would think of going she sighed a fairy tale are you sure he didntmention blaise the candlestick at anytime mr zabini sorry sorry what are his stories like now what does he say he doesntseem to know what really going on i suppose hermione said thoughtfully he has many theories and says that others who know of the castle have their own though he never explains who these supposed individuals are she thought back to when she was fourteen and of the version she had most recently heard the last time i heard him tell the story of the castle was a little less than three years ago if the story changed at all i wouldntknow she looked at them he described the kingdom as dark and gloomy he said that the king and queen were gone as well as most of the royal subjects all that was left was this castle and the few servants still living here hermione then got to the topic she was actually most curious about he also mentioned a prince he told us that this prince who had been popular among the kingdom much earlier on was hiding from the rest of the world she bit her bottom lip it was the prince that mad eye what we call our story teller had the littlest information about i guess he didntknow why someone would shun those who used to adore him and many others that crossed his path especially when it seemed to mad eye that he had been very happy in the past he made up so many theories about what really happened that he couldntkeep all of them straight they all sat there in silence no one moving to offer any other information hermione was curious about what kind of tragedy fell upon such an interesting group of people a betrayal she was told but who betrayed them and why hermione had a feeling that they werentprone to conversation about the matter but what had happened in addition to these annoying questions hermione still didntknow the details of this curse she didntknow anything about this prince either did he know she was there if he were supposed to be hiding from everyone would he really let her stay the night once again her mind was flooded with questions she wanted to know more about this betrayal and this gypsy what happened to all of them hermione wondered how powerful this curse was and if there was anything that once she got a good night sleep and found a way home she could do to help them that is of course only if this whole nightmare wasntactually a dream hermione was still questioning her sanity when blaise interrupted her thoughts you know blaise said since you ll be here to break hush mcgonagall said suddenly and the others looked at her in alarm she thought she had heard something in the corridor it seemed that snape had finally succeeded in bringing their master down what the verdict would be well mcgonagall could only hope for the best she was surprised at how long it had taken for them to come down she and the others had a much longer conversation than she expected mcgonagall wasntsure whether the delay could be considered good news or bad rather than attempting to interpret the actions of her master she turned to hermione dear i terribly sorry mcgonagall said hopping closer to her she began to whisper though she was fully aware that any attempts at some secrecy were futile with her master impeccable hearing i should ve warned you sooner but i afraid our mouths got carried away with us the sound of footsteps approaching grew closer our master has been only just informed of your presence here i not intruding am i hermione looked alarmed no dear mcgonagall smiled slightly but it was strained it a pleasure to have you here and all of us welcome you and are glad for your stay i can assure you her smile faltered but i afraid our master does have a bit of a temper and he not very fond of visitors these

chapter 4 first impressions now she said for my last warning she looked at the doorway i should tell you that the curse was different for our master she said this hurriedly for the footsteps were almost to the room hermione thought she heard a slight clinking noise along with the footfall what do you mean hermione asked but she never received an answer the lights had gone out the fire was out in a sudden gust of wind causing the room to go as dark as the inside of the forest blaise hadntducked as he felt the oncoming breeze and gave himself the trouble of re lighting his flame leaving the room completely pitch black until he could do so hermione gasped softly as she felt the cold air brush past her skin someone had entered the room their master hermione thought with trepidation master she could hear blaise speaking timidly such a stark contrast to the confident wise guy disposition he had sported only a few moments before hermione preferred the laid back personality over this frightened one lovely evening sir silence a deep voice cut through hermione tried to swallow but a giant lump had formed in her throat it seemed that their master was probably going to be less welcoming than his subjects midas the voice said hermione eyes were beginning to adjust to the dark and she could barely see a flap of wings off to the side you re responsible we ll discuss this later hermione wasntexactly fond of the bird she was still sensitive about the whole ordeal in the forest and her less than dignified dance routine at the edge but she felt some sort of protectiveness for the owl against this prince but his aura was overwhelming so for now she kept her mouth shut and her breathing as quiet as she could you peasant at first hermione wasntquite sure whom he was addressing peasant wasntexactly a name she answered to regularly as she ignored the rising force of her indignation snape and mcgonagall meanwhile lamented their master behavior it looked as if it was taking everything mcgonagall had to behave herself i meant no harm hermione told the voice suddenly feeling her indignation being overtaken by her confusion all i wanted was a place to stay a place to rest before i returned to my village i didntrealize the castle was still inhabited and i swear that i intended no one any inconvenience if you will just please excuse my mistake i can leave immediately silence he said quickly those who have entered this castle do not leave hermione looked up what she breathed too many times has an unwanted visitor taken what he has seen of our lives and used it for his personal gain you have entered my territory without permission and are therefore a trespasser you know too much and cannot be trusted therefore you are prohibited from leaving the castle and are now my prisoner an awkward silence followed prisoner hermione whispered her mind reeling no please she exclaimed hurriedly wondering how everything could already be crashing down around her when she couldnteven fully realize what was happening i promise i wonttell anyone about any of this i swear it but i cantstay here i need to go back home hermione ran her hands through her hair getting caught in tangles but she didntnotice wake up wake up your promises mean nothing the voice said impatiently indifferently this is where you live now please hermione whispered wake up i cantstay here let me go she looked around frantically in the darkness but saw nothing you re wasting your breath he said as if that settled the matter mcgonagall he barked yes my lord her voice was strained i take it then that you ll be informing the girl of her new arrangements then hermione sank back into the couch with her head in her hands hearing but not hearing the voices as they discussed her fate just wake up but by now hermione had realized that she was anything but fast asleep in the comfort of her bed there has to be some way out of this she thought there has to be i just need time to think the master gave an impatient cough hermione looked up in the direction of the voice i need more time lowering her head in defeat she gave a tiny nod there was nothing she could do until she came up with a plan come it ordered there was a rustle of fabric and the clinking sound of a cauldron moving along the floor hermione reluctantly obeyed slowly standing up from the couch and taking a step forward the door opened on its own accord gradually allowing light from the corridor to filter into the room hermione glanced toward the spot where she supposed their master should be but he had shrunken into the shadows she paused unsure of whether or not she was supposed to go first or not but her silent question was answered when she heard a soft noise to the right her head instinctively turned in that direction and her eyes instantly searched for any source of movement there was another pause one that seemed almost hesitant to hermione before she heard the rustling sound of a cloak and a footstep against the floor a small gasp escaped her dry lips her eyes widened slightly but she didnttake a step backwards her feet seemed to be stuck to the floor towering over her was a creature like nothing she had ever seen before so tall was he that she was practically facing the ceiling to see his head which along with the rest of his body was covered in thick dark golden fur what with the two short ears perched upon his head a long wolfish snout and teeth sharper than any blade in any butcher shop she barely noticed that the feet and hands were paws equipped with claws only slightly duller than the razor sharp teeth when she had recovered from the initial shock she was instantly reminded of a dog or a wolf some canine only this creature was capable of standing on two feet she subconsciously began racking her brain for information about this creature where have i heard of something like this before the beast did nothing but glare at her with his cold gray eyes hermione felt her breath hitch in her throat at the hatred within them they were saturated with blame with accusation as if she were the sole bane of his existence as if he were using every ounce of his energy to searing his loathing onto her soul a little voice in the corner of her mind frantically searched for any explanation what could she have done to deserve this unavoidable scorching gaze surely this could not be the result of such a simple misunderstanding as getting lost in the woods but his eyes what an extremely strange pair to belong to such a creature the eyes didntseem to fit the form of the beast although they certainly seemed to suit his personality bluish gray spheres of ice that burned like fire as hermione found her breath again the beast the creature whatever he was turned and faced the door with a swish of a black cloak that she hadntrealized he d been wearing hermione watched a small black cauldron follow his master out the door and although she was no longer surprised at its ability to move she had forgotten that there were others in the room besides the creature a few short moments later midas soared out after them she stood there for a few seconds in a shocked silence half covered in the light coming in from the corridor and oblivious to the anxious stares she was receiving from the rest of the supposedly royal subjects miss granger madam mcgonagall spoke softly she slowly inched her way to where hermione was looking out into the corridor watching their master make his way down the hallway there is much to explain i afraid too much for tonight but i promise that all of your questions will be answered soon blaise and dean made their way over to hermione feet as well i imagine how tired you must be and i certain beyond all measure that this confusion cannot be aiding your state hermione finally tore her eyes away from the beast back and looked down at them unspoken apologies were clearly written across their solemn faces for a split second hermione had the irrational thought that when she would have finally come up with an escape plan she wouldnthave the heart to leave them what kind of life have they endured she knew so little about them she had to help somehow but the others images of ron and harry and ginny swirled mercilessly in her mind and the determination returned full force there were others who were counting on her she wished to help these newfound acquaintances but hadntron been the one to tell her just a few short weeks ago that she should stop focusing so intently on looking out for other creatures and focus on taking care of herself her lips dipped downward grimly as she thought of auror masquerade through the forest oh ron if only i had listened to you she would have to leave at the first opportunity no matter the consequences if she could help these melancholy creatures she would but she had to concentrate on getting out first she knew almost nothing about any of them what if this was some kind of trap was that even possible were these small dismal beings really capable of doing something like that and what would their motives be for such a plot but her mind wouldnthave any more of it her headache was doubling in pain and was throbbing with such a consistent rhythm that hermione felt the need to push the heels of her palm into her temples until her brain squished out through the top i said to follow me the beast ground out from quite a distance ahead he was waiting at the end of the hall but not too patiently his furry arms were crossed and his scowl had grown none the more pleasant come along then miss granger madam mcgonagall told her quietly you may visit mr zabini and mr thomas tomorrow if you like she turned in their direction and gave them a silent order to behave themselves as much as possible after they left for she knew that asking them to go to sleep at the moment was futile with a small nod and a goodnight hermione from each they turned around headed back to their sleeping areas no doubt planning to discuss the night events the second they were sure that the others were out of earshot goodnight to you both hermione whispered without feeling as she took a step out of the room hanging her head and looking at the carpet she wordlessly made her way down the corridor with mcgonagall hermione didntfail to notice however the almost inaudible scoffs and sighs the creature was making as he impatiently waited for her to catch up but she was so tired move along peasant he snapped now obviously annoyed she was only five feet or so away from him we donthave all night you know her head snapped up so fast that she was sure that she had heard it crack she wasntas surprised to hear the insult the second time but the indignity had now returned with a vengeance apparently sleep deprivation was a great alleviator of fear as her eyebrows furrowed in unbidden anger and her mouth opened slightly in protest hermione immersed herself in a fierce staring contest between the prince and herself he was glaring daggers at her that was for certain but he seemed to be searching for something else simultaneously perhaps he was just waiting for her reaction watching her for any signs of fear or an urge to run away whatever it was she didntlike the feeling of such scrutiny and so she rose to the challenge hermione stared up at him trying to make herself as tall as she could which obviously didntcome as much of an advantage and unblinking hermione told him just what was on her mind i moving just fine considering hermione rasped affronted and irritated if the cauldron or the hat seemed surprised they didntshow it they merely shared a small wary glance it all a matter of opinion he spat his lips curving up into a sneer then perhaps i think he cut in smoothly his raspy voice taking an alarming tone it was becoming extremely difficult not to strangle her after all he noted that there are a few things that i need to make crystal clear he took a step closer to her and the sneer grew hermione made no attempt to speak but held her ground you are a prisoner prisoners are not often asked for their suggestions nor are they without stipulations and rules he took another step emphasizing his height more than ever but hermione managed not to flinch firstly he snipped impatiently as hermione glared you are to do what you are told the second you re told to do it why dontwe make this understanding a little bit easier on you with a simple demonstration here is a perfect example i ordering you to follow me you are to walk no more or no less than five steps behind me at all times understand or am i going too fast for you hermione mouth was open in outrage she was suddenly very awake adrenaline filling her blood with power her lungs with air and her mind with plenty of perfectly constructed angry retorts that she good secondly you ll eat when i eat if i dontfeel particularly hungry one day then you wonteat until i sit down at a table and i satisfied you however will be eating in the kitchen with the servants so i wontbe forced to endure your ill bred table etiquette a turn to the left thirdly since you re planning on escaping hermione burning eyes jumped to his as he turned his head to look at her behind him oh please girl i know you already are his voice came out icy and bitter as he turned back to look ahead it might be a good idea for me to warn you that if you do manage to make it out of the castle without my notice he scoffed then you wonthave the same protection against the forest creatures as you did tonight hermione was listening intently i dontknow what possessed midas to help you he looked nastily in the owl direction which shrank back and swooped down on the opposite side of snape using the cauldron as a shield from his master piercing gaze but i can guarantee that it wonthappen again fourthly he continued hermione briefly turned her attention away from him to look around her head had started throbbing more painfully if possible with an overwhelming sense of helplessness she realized that she had absolutely no idea where she was in the castle she hadntbeen keeping track of where they were going and didntknow how to get back a lump formed in her throat how can this get any worse but hermione didntcome up with any appropriate answers because she noticed that the creature was no longer talking instead he was whispering something harshly to the cauldron on the ground her brows scrunched together as she desperately tried to hear what they were saying but their voices were extraordinarily quiet hermione pretended be greatly interested in some vase off to the right while watching the trio out of her peripheral vision but the fierce expression on her features made it impossibly difficult to look innocent although she couldntfully make out what was being said she did hear little bits and pieces like room and insane and cheesecake but maybe she had misheard that last one the fourth he continued more crossly than before concerns your allowed locations in this castle there are limits she thought she heard mcgonagall give a tiny little sigh which was confirmed by a small twitch of the creature short wolf like ears and a short glare that he sent back in mcgonagall direction the hat paid it no mind you are allowed in the following areas all of the corridors leading directly to the kitchen and all of the chambers along your quarter corridor the floor directly above your room room hermione couldntstop herself you re not putting me in a dungeon cell or an ominous tower he went very still as she mentioned the dungeons but it was so brief and so slight that hermione nearly missed it would you prefer it there the beast ground out through clenched teeth seemingly angry at the interruption no then shut up he said annoyed hermione began making not so nice yet subtle faces at his back and finally the entrance hall they had come to a staircase if i find you in any place other than the ones mentioned he paused and turned his head to look at her who had noticed the movement just in time to stop her most recent rude gesticulation at his back there will be a price to pay his voice was dangerously low this creature was serious and the fifth his voice resumed to its normal superior tone if you dontbother me i wontbother you there is no curfew but if you disturb me in anyway expect a punishment he threw a threatening glare in her direction stay off my nerves and your stay will be a semi comfortable one the cauldron gave a small cough which could have passed for a fake and midas slapped his feathery head with his wing they reached the top of the stairs my servants are here to assist you it seemed to pain him to say all this they ll be showing you the way to the kitchen and wherever else you want to go that is of course an acceptable location he took a deep breath as if he was mentally preparing for what was to come your stay at my castle will be a long one so i suggest that you try to stay on good terms with me he turned around to glare at her i not too congenial when i angry it took a lot for hermione to keep her expression neutral and to stop herself from commenting they took another right i wonder if he calls this congenial they walked in silence down a high ceilinged hallway which was carpeted with the same red rug as the hallways close to the entrance hall the walls and floor were made of stone and at the end of the corridor was a window that practically matched the height of the wall through which you could see that the snow was still gently falling to the ground she couldntsee the moon for it was probably all the way on the other side of the castle setting and waiting for the arrival of the sun that must mean that my room is in the east wing she noted adding this to a small mental list of useful information also on this list was the number of floors she had traveled and some basic left right directions from the spot where she d realized that she didntknow where she was i ll have to learn more about this castle later looking back out the window she could also see the very tips of those mysteriously large trees expanding out into the vast forest only to come to an end at a line of snow capped mountains that hermione could still never really remember seeing from her house home the lump was back in her throat larger and trying to make it difficult to breathe more than ever she could feel the tears welling up in the corners of her eyes and for one terrifying moment hermione was sure that they d spill down her cheeks and crash to the ground in outrageously loud splashes splattering herself and filling up the corridor until she drowned in them but before she could flood anything the creature began to speak again this he said stopping in front of the set of doors closest to the window will be your room swallowing the lump and looking up hermione saw two elegant doors made of cherry wood glossed and stained for a shiny finish the brass door handles were simple enough but the whole effect was rather luxurious the creature quickly turned one of the handles and held the door open for her impatiently upon entering the room hermione found that she no longer had the power to walk frozen to her spot just a meter away from the door hermione stood in complete awe at her surroundings lips parted in wonder this was definitely something that no one in her village could ever hope to afford everywhere she looked was opulence tasteful and ornate furniture with refined and courtly matching bed curtains and comforters fresh white linens peeking out from under the feather quilts and pillows that looked fluffier and fuller than any she had ever seen before and as for the pillows there were more pillows on that bed than she had ever seen in a shop some even looked like she wasntsupposed to put her head on them scratch that not even the entire village put together could afford this the floor was a lighter wood than the doors but suited the room and all of its cherry wood furniture nicely the ceiling and the walls were of the same stone that she saw in the corridor to her right was a large bed big enough to surely fit at least ten people in it and beyond the bed was a room which she assumed to be the washroom at the wall opposite of her there was a large red seat below a large window the window above cushioned bench allowed her to barely see the tops of the trees and the mountain off in the distance she was on a fairly high floor hermione subconsciously added that to her list and a tip the creature who had been watching her reaction from his place in the doorway with his paw still on the handle broke her from her reverie you may want to wash up that stench of yours is disgusting his nose scrunched up in displeasure further proving his point hermione turned around bristling with resentment and exhaled sharply as her brows scrunched together while she formed a reasonable reply but yet again before she managed to respond the creature had cut her off he slammed the door with enough strength to make the door shudder in its frame and all was silent except for hermione ragged breathing and the resounding echo of the prince exit taking deep breaths hermione closed her eyes trying to think of anything anything else with a cry of fury hermione thrust her fists into the air and made her way over to the bed that jerk hermione mumbled that overbearing arrogant egotistical prat she grumbled on quite enjoying the satisfaction of finally voicing her thoughts smug domineering git that conceited stuck up bastard and with another groan of anger and frustration hermione plopped down onto the bed ungracefully and savagely ripped one of the pillows from their neat arrangement near the head burying her head into the pillow hermione suddenly felt grateful that no one had been there to witness her lack of control feeling ashamed and more homesick than ever hermione bit her bottom lip wincing as its soft skin brushed up against the scratchy material of the pillow she had the sudden need to cry i not usually this well violent back home she spoke quietly to herself shamefully even during rows with harry or ron i not like this at all sure i ll yell and throw a few deserved barbs but it never like this but this shame was quickly replaced by sadness and homesickness none of them have any idea where i am she whispered hollow auror most likely went back she said feeling the pang of hurt she felt at the fact that it was all his doing unintentionally for certain that got her here i dontunderstand what he was doing but even if auror there the others wouldntthink of anything like this it may be a while before they even notice i gone hermione started to talk rapidly it could be days until they need to talk to me again she suddenly panicked gasping quietly and covered her mouth with a hand mr weasley birthday dinner she said horrified i promised that i d be there she ran her hands through her crazy mop tangling the curls even more oh no they ll think i mad at them or and ron ah ron she dropped her head into her hands i can only imagine how he going to reason out my absence or they could think i sick then they d come to check up on me and find that i missing but then they ll automatically assume the worst and have no clue as to where i really am she closed her eyes and laid down on her stomach holding onto the pillow for dear life they ll think i ve been kidnapped by bandits or something she chuckled mirthlessly at the absurdity of her actual situation when i really being held prisoner by a creature who basking in the nonexistent rays of his superiority in a cursed castle beyond a mystical forest which lies right in my backyard she spat the volume of her voice gradually rising but it not like i wanted to stay in this castle she told the pillow angrily it not my fault this prince her brows furrowed in thought for a moment deflated i donteven know his name with a sigh she shook her head to clear the thought it doesntmatter what his name is he nothing but a stubborn prat with a royal scepter shoved up his now now i think that pillow has suffered enough with a small cry hermione instantly dropped the pillow she hadntrealized that she d been tearing apart she glanced around the room for the female voice that she d heard who said that me the voice spoke again over here hermione watched in growing amazement but not with so much surprise she was getting used to this by now as her cherry wardrobe just walked over to her using each of its four wooden legs while eyes and a mouth appeared above the cabinet doors my name is parvati patil but you can just call me parvati the armoire giggled it giggled hermione had a wardrobe that giggled oh dear and i lavender brown who are you asked a voice from the left looking over hermione saw her matching bureau join parvati at the bed uhm hermione she answered suddenly finding herself dumbfounded i hermione well parvati said not missing a beat i sure you have much to talk about parvati exclaimed so go on how did you get here why d you come where do you live was it scary in the forest lavender chirped in have you met blaise yet have you seen the courtyard what do you think of our master how old are you what your family like how do you feel about wearing the color green there have only been a few times in hermione life during which hermione had felt that people were truly unnecessarily invading her personal space this hermione decided definitely qualified as one of the times where people were uninvitingly entering her proverbial bubble i ooh lavender bounced up and down though careful not to break her giant mirror i so excited we finally have someone to dress up eh yes parvati agreed hermione but she stopped herself short and sighed she looked hermione over carefully taking in her dirty and disheveled appearance hermione didntoften feel self conscious around others but under parvati analytical stare and disapproving look it was difficult not to lavender yes hermione sensed that the two seemed to be having an unspoken conversation with one another they were plotting something evil she was sure of it and hermione was growing more and more afraid of their evil plans the more she watched the expressions on their faces with mounting horror she saw their eyes start to look almost predatory and quickly tried to think of what terrible things they could be planning for her i think our first target should be the hair lavender announced lifting her face to stare at the brown mess residing atop hermione head my hair hermione asked worriedly reaching up to protectively grab a clump near her face she was somewhat bothered by the number of twigs and leaves entwined in it but didnthave much time to think about them oh i definitely agree parvati told her ignoring hermione question what do you think a braid maybe that should tame the frizz a little dontyou think a wonderful idea lavender smile returned and then for formal occasions a bun perhaps a chignon an upswept french knot i brilliant lavender parvati was also smiling and for tomorrow i think she should wear this instantly one of her doors popped open and a large display of different dresses in various colors and styles appeared before their eyes but hermione tried to cut in desperately oh wonderful choice parvati lavender cooed i love the color it will really bring out the base tones in her complexion i thought so parvati said as she held up a pretty green dress it should fit i think she held it up in front of hermione to get a clearer picture in her mind of what it d look like now wait just a good evening ladies i afraid we re going to have to interrupt with an overwhelming sense of relief hermione turned towards the door to find madam mcgonagall and midas perched on the door handle there both looking tired and ready for a nice long nap madam mcgonagall hermione breathed with such gratitude that it was barely believable miss patil miss brown she addressed them as she neared the bed i going to have to ask you to hold off for tonight she reached the bed at first hermione thought that she was going to jump up onto the bed but then she realized that it was much too high for her she found it slightly amusing when midas came swooping down picked mcgonagall up by the tip and dropped her clumsily onto the bed a little more gently next time mcgonagall said somewhat annoyed while midas somehow managed to look sheepish after taking a moment to compose herself mcgonagall cleared her throat and began to speak i believe we owe you an explanation she said quietly her voice taking on a more somber tone lavender and parvati excitement which had died down considerably since mcgonagall entered had completely diminished at the sight of her grave expression mcgonagall quickly glanced at the two girls asking them to leave would be futile they d merely eavesdrop she thought i ll just have to make do i suppose i know you must have many questions all of which cannot be answered in one night and i know for a fact that you will have many more by the time i leave you to rest tonight but for now i afraid that you ll have to be satisfied with what information i can give you she sighed i think you need to hear our story just three years ago this castle this cold and empty shelter that you are now in was a magnificent palace surrounded by a grand and peaceful kingdom and the royal family the malfoys rest their souls parvati and lavender said in unison mcgonagall nodded solemnly her fabric lips tight the malfoys had been in control of the kingdom for generations for centuries and centuries the malfoys had reigned over our people and all was well mcgonagall paused to let this information sink in her eyes turned to the designs in the comforter on the bed all was well or at least we thought it was without war famine or conflict for years we were happy and content with what we had but it seemed that years of inexplicable peace had made us na ve and unaware we were oblivious to the treason being conducted before our very eyes even now i still find it difficult to believe that such a traitor could come from the one that the malfoys trusted the most she sighed but the one who was hurt the most she closed her eyes in remembrance was master draco malfoy our current lord and master who you met tonight draco hermione asked quietly letting the word sink in it an odd name she mused thinking of her own oh mcgonagall looked slightly embarrassed i beg your pardon child assumed that you had been informed of his name by perhaps dean or blaise ahh the girls squealed loudly catching hermione off guard and causing her to jump two inches off the bed so you have met blaise what do you think ladies mcgonagall warning tone quieted them some but it was her stern look that did the trick hermione had gotten the impression over the course of the night activities that madam mcgonagall was not someone to cross as i was saying she coughed and gave the two another look the girls giggled in response and hermione had a very hard time trying not to roll her eyes it was draco that was hurt the most by the betrayal she said quietly and as before the girls suddenly become quiet and serious but hermione began what happened who betrayed the royal family there was a moment of complete silence and for a second hermione thought that she had said something terribly offensive by the looks on their faces you must know miss granger mcgonagall whispered so quietly that she had to strain to hear her that we do not speak of this betrayal ever she looked hermione directly in the eyes it is forbidden the prince forbids you to talk about it he has never directly told us to never speak of it but we know what it would mean for any of us to openly converse about the matter no one ever dares to mention the ordeal in his presence and during the few times that must be mentioned it is discussed far out of his hearing range and above all miss granger we do not say his name hermione found that even if she had wanted to she would not have been able to tear her eyes away from mcgonagall s instead we refer to him as he who must not be named or you know who her whisper was still extremely quiet do not ask me to speak his name because you will find that i now physically incapable of speaking it it certainly pains me to even think it she said earnestly in fact if it were not for this curse i d have removed his name from my memory years ago entirely but what is this curse hermione couldntrefrain from asking any longer who put this spell on all of you and why i think mcgonagall spoke that i need to continue on with my story to fully answer your questions or at least answer them the best i can for tonight we were not yet aware of his great betrayal even as his plans were unfolding so careless were we didnteven realize what was happening even while we were in the midst of it all a few months before we were cursed the king and queen lucius and narcissa malfoy grew deathly ill they passed away not a month after rest their souls they repeated again in unison while midas bowed his head hermione watched in somber silence rest their souls she repeated as expected the kingdom was in turmoil but not as much as their son draco so his parents are dead hermione thought we have something in common she felt a pang in her chest at the thought of her own parents but her snarling features made it difficult for him to consider him with sympathy not when he acted like such an arse this prince what was he exactly for days he wouldntleave his room mcgonagall broke hermione from her thoughts he d barely eat what we brought to him and he wouldntspeak to any of us not even sir snape you ve met severus snape not properly of course but you ve seen him he was the black cauldron that accompanied master draco to your room you ll soon learn that if there anyone who can get master draco to do something it sir snape i wontgo off on sir snape for too long for i know that blaise and dean will surely explain and introduce you to most of the castle tomorrow but i will tell you what i think you should know sir snape although only a chef in the kitchen and technically considered a servant has always had a soft spot for master draco and everyone in the castle can see it however know that if he were to ever hear anyone voice that out loud there would certainly be punishments dealt the rip in the hat that served as a mouth threatened to curl upwards in an amused grin but mcgonagall quickly caught herself and continued just as snape has some paternal feelings for master draco draco has a great deal of trust for sir snape mcgonagall paused unsure of how much she should tell looking at hermione she could tell that the girl was confused if she should tell just how attached her master was to severus she d mostly likely end up telling hermione at some point about the intense attachment master draco had once felt to riddle closing her eyes and pushing the painful memories away she looked back at hermione who was still regarding her with a curious expression deciding not to tell hermione everything just yet she continued on our master she started choosing her words carefully as you can see isntexactly fond of she searched for the right word but found no acceptable euphemism she just hoped the truth wouldntpush hermione even farther away from liking him let alone getting her to love him so desperate and tired she chose one of the less impolite words well he isntfond of commoners in general you might say she sounded a little sheepish hermione resisted the urge to snort i figured it took a lot for hermione not to be sarcastic with mcgonagall she didntwant to vent her anger at the beast on madam mcgonagall especially when mcgonagall was being so kind to her yes well mcgonagall sighed it been a bit of a family trait from what i ve heard despite that he very fond of the our executive chef sir snape our master will follow snape will over anyone else s so while master draco can be cold and arrogant sometimes she said once again choosing her diction precisely he can very unsure and insecure at others and as hard as it is to believe she said with meaningful glance at hermione who whether she knew it or not herself was hanging on to mcgonagall every word with a tiny triumphant smile mcgonagall continued he can be very caring when he wants to be ohh what he would do to me if he heard me say any of this mcgonagall thought with a shudder caring hermione asked incredulously an eyebrow rose inquisitively mcgonagall nodded i know she continued to nod but you ll see soon enough yes she stopped nodding you ll see curious about mcgonagall suddenly wistful tone but more curious about the other questions floating around in her mind hermione spoke so the betrayal really happened during his parents death she asked quietly or was it after actually dear mcgonagall said sad and tired once again i rather think that he had something to do with their deaths her eyes narrowed not that there any evidence of course but you can imagine she sighed i dontknow how he could ve done it but i just have to believe that it was his doing master draco was heartbroken completely isolated himself for days and days the king and queen were dead and the majority of our population thought that it wasntworth staying only those truly loyal to the malfoy family remained but now with the queen and king gone we needed another ruler but master draco was still only on the brink of young adulthood and certainly not old enough to rule an entire kingdom by himself slowly and gradually master draco began to emerge from his room at first only roaming the corridors and still silent to all he passed then little by little he started to become his old self again first speaking to well you know who then to snape and myself and occasionally to a servant he was particularly close to hermione realized that her resolve was weakening she almost felt bad for the beast almost he was still an offensive rascal one that needed to show her a slice of respect before she went around showing him sympathy come on her mind argued show some compassion look at all he been through look at all i ve been through another voice argued look at everything that i ve had to do on my own but did you have an entire kingdom resting on your shoulders did the fate of hundreds of people lie in your hands at such a young age her mind countered that no excuse for his arrogance he my age and he hasntdone anything extraordinary not that you know anyway oh please he was born into royalty so he rich struts around his big empty castle and rules a bunch on cursed royal subjects now that an accomplishment but she suddenly felt ashamed of her earlier thoughts about the prince and the lack of sympathy she felt for him even if he was an arrogant git and didnt deserve any sympathy from her she still thought of him as a prat that certainly hadntchanged but she felt bad that she hadntfelt bad for him the curse was placed on us on the eve of his coronation mcgonagall began to speak quickly we were all preparing for the ceremony that was supposed to have taken place the next day painting and cooking and cleaning like normal hermione heard one of the girls sniff to the left of her she had forgotten that they were in the room with her we were content she said simply we were still mourning the loss of our king and queen but we were healing his coronation was supposed to be a celebration despite the fact that it only reminded us of his parents deaths we were trying the majority of the servants had been in the grand ballroom at the time you most likely saw it as you came in it large and beautiful and absolutely wonderful with the right atmosphere but there wontbe a single time that i dontstep into it and not remember the events that occurred there on that night she looked at the designs in the comforter finding that they were much safer to look at than the sad faces of her fellow servants or hermione confused one it was late the exact time escapes my memory she went on in monotone the master barged into the ballroom looking lost and confused we tried to go toward him as he went to the center of the ballroom but before anyone got near enough he grabbed his head in pain the next thing we knew mcgonagall became very very quiet he was a werewolf a werewolf her brows furrowed as she let her words sink in but how can that be she asked finally i ve read about them and if he is one then why isnthe i mean how is that he can speak and walk like humans wouldnta werewolf just be running around and she couldntbring herself to finish mcgonagall nodded that night he was not like he is now she went on he was a real werewolf you mean hermione breathed she nodded again countless people died the entire kingdom was chaos people everywhere were in a panic the rest of the kingdom left out of fear losing whatever respect they had might have had for the family finally after hours and hours of running and hiding and tending to those who still had a dying chance the sun began to rise master draco had somehow made his way to the ballroom again when the moon went down over the horizon i had been in the kitchens earlier with snape to retrieve some more of the injured and tend to their wounds when we heard we were going to run for our lives when suddenly everything became silent we looked on from a crack in the door master draco was grabbing his head and our master returned but he didntchange back the creature swayed and tottered because he was unused to his feet and looked more confused and lost than ever i think i remember that he almost vomited at the sight of the dead and torn bodies littering the floor the scent must have been driving him crazy as well and yet all he did was stare at the blood on his paws and then her eyes narrowed dangerously hermione was shocked by the sudden change in her tone you know who arrived out of nowhere and he must have been insane he demanded to know why he wasntdead she spat venomously at that time snape and i came out from behind the door as quietly as we could we didntknow what we could do to help but i remember that we were willing to try anything and then completely out of nowhere there was this this puff of green smoke and this woman appeared out of thin air she looked at hermione somewhat sheepishly i kid you not i remember that when i first saw her i couldntbelieve my eyes her magic was merely trickery to me all of it was nonsense but it had appeared that this gypsy sybill trelawney she and you know who had made a deal of some sort her eyes were narrowed again you know who demanded to know why he wasntdead when the gypsy spoke we were all suddenly in well a dream like trance you could say she told us all that killing him was never her intentions rather she wanted to teach him an important lesson she just repeated what she had said earlier going on about what you know who had hired her for calm the entire time like she knew things would work out she went on and on about the good in master draco she couldntresist sneaking a glance at hermione but the girl was staring at the comforter and the grudges that you know who was carrying you know who tried to attack the gypsy but master draco was quicker and went after him she sighed at the memory it was all very confusing we didntknow what to believe master draco grabbed the knife i suppose it seemed more human as terrible as that sounds for him to use the knife rather than his bloodied paws but you know who was already dying from the impact of having been thrown to the floor and the master weight crushing down on him you know who said something to him then but we couldnthear what it was she whispered shaking with rage but whatever it was it hit a nerve master draco stabbed him then stood up unsteadily and dropped the knife he just stood there shaking and staring for what seemed like an eternity hermione couldntspeak i ll never forget the scream that echoed throughout all of the castle walls and during all this the gypsy hadntmoved one bit he turned his attention to her then she paused she couldnttell her what would break the spell not yet then what hermione asked finding herself terrified that she d stop at a place like that what happened i dontremember the exact words that the gypsy said she started again severus wrote everything down as soon as he could word for word though i do know that she did apologize for everything that had happened another sigh and then she placed the spell on us the gypsy was aware of master draco great dislike for those beneath him and claimed to teach him a valuable lesson in humility before more people were hurt master draco was to remain in the body of a werewolf and we were to keep him company as the objects that we knew best eventually master draco will turn into a true werewolf as he was on that night she sighed again and the rest of us will really turn into our respective objects forever what hermione asked aghast eventually but there has to be some way to break the spell mcgonagall had to hide her small smile let me continue she said gently and hermione at once felt bad for interrupting we were all suddenly being pulled into the ballroom all of us the gypsy had left in another puff of green smoke but we barely even had time to reflect on what had happened we were floating in midair surrounded by green sparks of light and being blown about by a sudden gust of wind and before any of us knew it we were what we are now the change was quick and without pain so none of us knew what was happening until after it had happened the gypsy also chose one of draco most loyal subjects and trapped her in a mirror in his quarters he can see anything he wants in that mirror even if it thousands of miles away she paused to take a breath a mirror in which he can see anything hermione added this to her list as well worrying her lip she was going to ask what this girl name was but mcgonagall continued but as one last parting gift the gypsy gave us a messenger someone who could help us communicate with others beyond the forest which is something that the girl in the mirror cannot do it was he mcgonagall said with a small smile who helped to bring you here in the first place instantly hermione glanced in the owl direction midas she asked turning back to mcgonagall you were the gypsy s the bird nodded drawing a pattern in the comforter with his wing rather sheepishly but why did you help to bring me here she asked him edgily very curious you would ve died out in the forest hermione mcgonagall cut in smoothly you would have frozen in the snow hermione nodded slightly and looked out the large window to her left the snow was still falling and the sun would rise in just less than an hour and now i frozen in here instead so how can it be broken hermione asked after a moment silence she knew deep inside that against her better judgment she desperately wanted to help them as soon as she found a way to get home of course mcgonagall merely gave her a small sad and knowing smile the gypsy had said this curse is irreversible only one thing can break it but what that was she did not say after seeing that hermione was staring out the window she gave small warning looks to the girls at the edge of the bed what hermione turned back to mcgonagall and couldnthelp but sound appalled she didntsay mouth open in abomination hermione shook her head but there has to be some way to break it surely you have already tried mcgonagall shook her head we ll save the rest of this conversation for tomorrow she feigned a small yawn but hermione followed suit too tired not to i afraid i talked much longer than i had wanted to you must be tired and you need your rest at the word rest hermione gave another wide yawn i am tired she breathed sleepily miss patil miss brown she nodded to each of them as midas picked her up and set her down on floor being more gentle this time miss granger needs her rest the girls nodded in agreement though each of them looked equally disappointed parvati and lavender returned to their spots against the wall as hermione took off her shoes would you like something else to sleep in mcgonagall asked indicating hermione dirty dress no thanks hermione yawned as she undid the clasp of her cloak around her neck she dropped it next to her shoes i too tired to change she said drowsily alright madam mcgonagall told hermione as she slipped beneath the covers thank you hermione managed to whisper she closed her eyes she could hear mcgonagall quietly swishing her way to the door and her whisper come midas you can visit tomorrow and then the flap of wings accompanied by the turning of the door handle and its soft thud as it closed in its frame hermione fell asleep to the drone of the many voices in her head some sounded like her mother and father while others sounded uncannily similar to various members of the weasley family and harry madam pince was talking about sword fights while mcgonagall and mad eye like voices were both telling her stories about a serious betrayal that caused the downfall of an entire kingdom but the majority of the inquisitive voices sounded like her own why would sybill go through such drastic measures just to teach the prince a lesson was he really that terrible if tonight had been any indication there has to be a way to break the spell but what what about those who left the kingdom why didntthey ever say anything about the castle did they forget about it somehow but it has only been three years is that another side effect of the curse or is mad eye to blame what with his tall tales did he really frighten people off i cantremember what i was doing three years ago where was i when this happened will i be seeing mad eye here soon why is mcgonagall a hat why am i in such a comfortable bed when i a prisoner she turned on her side and what about the prince how was he going to rule a kingdom when he supposedly hates the people he rules is that part of the reason why the people left in the first place did they think that he d rule them unfairly did the people know that he hated them did he get it from his parents did they feel the same way about commoners how long will i really be stuck here and before she knew it hermione was fast asleep author

enjoy author notes edit 7 23 11 simple edits chapter 5 an unhappy holiday draco leaned his forehead against the door and raised a clenched fist angrily at the girl inside displaying his sharp claws to the wood master draco i believe it d be wise to distance yourself from her for awhile snape suggested trying not to rile up his master nerves any more than they already were at least of course until they were out of the girl earshot can you believe this he whispered rhetorically stepping away from the door and stomping down the corridor snape waited for his master to continue holding in a sigh with much difficulty this is unbelievable draco sneered disgustedly absolutely unbelievable i ll tell you what is unbelievable mcgonagall whispered venomously ignoring draco narrowed eyes and his mouth opening to respond the way you treated that girl mcgonagall fumed he can be truly immature when he wants to be she a peasant draco hissed she s our guest mcgonagall interrupted and the look she received from the prince was indeed a very unpleasant one a peasant she scoffed what did you expect princess aurora to show up on your doorstep this is a normal girl who has probably been living within fifty miles of you your entire life she tired and alone homesick without a doubt and didntmean any harm she s not a guest draco spat back at her he distantly heard a feminine voice back from within the room that jerk she throwing insults at me this very instant draco said nastily and looked back at the door i should go back in there right now and you ll do nothing of the sort mcgonagall shouted how dare and she has every right to mcgonagall threw at him before draco or even snape had a chance to interject he knew he d have his turn with the prince after awhile draco was merely releasing a little steam on mcgonagall though he d like to keep the violence at a minimum nonetheless she a prisoner and a rather tactless dirty and stubborn one at that he said distastefully how are you planning on breaking the spell thinking like that mcgonagall asked seemingly appalled at his attitude you re supposed to be trying to fall love with her not insulting her you re already treading on thin ice with me mcgonagall draco warned as he turned a corner and besides he complained she in there yelling at me have you no respect respect mcgonagall nearly screeched the tip of the hat went pin straight and shook with violent anger midas swooped around to the other side of snape using the cauldron as a shield from mcgonagall someone he had previously thought to be safe snape sent him one of his infamous next person who looks at me will get bathroom detail looks and midas quickly went back to soaring above them all draco would be lying if he said that he wasntsurprised at mcgonagall ability to express anger but he didntshow it as he continued to fume down the corridor madam mcgonagall does prove a very valid point master snape cut in silkily there no way any of us will get back to normal again if you donttry to make peace with the girl draco sighed that ll take forever he replied we dont have forever mcgonagall replied we donthave much time at all she persisted i know draco said dully after tonight i know he snapped they all stopped staring at their master expectedly as he came to a halt midas silently came down to rest at mcgonagall right after a few moments of awkward silence and feeling slightly guilty at the sight of draco rueful frame mcgonagall announced that she was going to check on the girl to make sure that she was all right midas watched her make it halfway down the corridor before he couldnttake the feeling of snape eyes boring into him any longer and turned to face the cauldron glancing at the hat and then back at snape he waited for the chef to give him an order snape nodded at mcgonagall without needing to be told twice midas soared off after mcgonagall toward the girl room we ll discuss this tomorrow midas draco spoke indifferently to the bird as he left his spot on the floor the eagle turned around to glance back at his master nervously before speeding off to catch up with mcgonagall snape watched the bird disappear behind a corner and waited in silence for his master to say something what am i going to do snape draco whispered i tried to find something about her i liked no i really did try but i just cant he started walking again snape followed i mean his voice suddenly changed from helplessness to dislike look at her he sneered again and snape made a mental note that he had to get his master to refrain from doing that somehow for instance draco continued did you see her reaction to the room draco asked disgustedly i didnteven give her a particularly large one but did you see the look on her face a sneer and a scoff unbelievable he repeated how am i supposed to fall in love with a girl so unaccustomed to these sorts of things he spat suddenly frustrated and angry again what did you expect her to do draco snape asked i dontknow i just didntexpect her to be so surprised or fascinated by the whole thing if i have to put up with a measly peasant with her head stuck in the clouds for the rest of my life i swear something tells me that you wonthave to worry about that snape cut in ignoring draco somewhat bothered look at being interrupted i think that she ll get used to her new surroundings in time draco shoulders relaxed slightly but snape continued and draco arched an eyebrow in response as well as it will take time for her to adapt it will take patience on your part snape stopped to turn and face his master with a warning glare what are you looking at me like that for draco asked sounding offended i can be patient and mr longbottom will lead england to glory one day snape remarked evenly as draco had to stop himself from snorting but you dontneed a lecture on that right now snape switched the subject and draco found himself immensely grateful tell me he went on what do you really think of her draco cast him a disdainful look you cantbe serious he said as he reached a staircase quite the contrary snape answered struggling to keep up with his master draco took two sometimes three steps at a time and it was often extremely difficult to maintain his master pace go on snape draco said threateningly but he knew that his threats had never really had any effect on the chef the cauldron shot him a glare from four or five steps behind him draco sighed i expected a much stronger reaction when she first saw me he admitted quietly reaching the top she didntact very afraid i couldntsmell any fear he thought confused what kind of idiot wouldntfear something like me which snape coughed reaching the top step of the long staircase is a very fortunate thing for us draco waited with his back to snape and upon hearing him reach the top he continued walking at his normal pace ignoring snape somewhat labored breathing you could ve been more understanding however snape said bringing up the rather heated conversation he and mcgonagall had been discussing before was all that coldness really necessary i told you draco cautioned i ll handle things on my own terms she can stay but only under certain conditions i cantsay that forcing her eat in the kitchens was the wisest decision snape remarked meals could ve been used as a bonding time i dontwant to watch her eat he said simply with a sneer snape thought it was rather interesting that he d dare to say that when it was he who had the atrocious table manners and difficulty holding normal utensils she doesntlisten draco said randomly changing the subject and her walking pace even after i told her to hurry up was borderline insolence he scowled at the cauldron she was merely tired draco snape explained although he had an idea that her fatigue might not have been the entire reason why i dontremember anyone being so defiant in years draco complained one girl shows up and my castle in chaos you can hardly call it chaos oh i can call it chaos all right draco replied there been plenty of disorder around here since she came snape sighed stubborn uncooperative headstrong draco rattled each of them off a clawed finger how am i supposed to stand this girl let alone l ove her he shuddered draco and did you see the way she practically jumped right out of her skin when i mentioned her escaping draco chuckled mirthlessly she really was planning something a lot sooner that i would ve thought actually draco scoffed draco snape began levelly what forest animals were you talking about he raised a sable brow there arentany creatures in the forest he stated coolly we all know there haventbeen any for centuries draco nodded what she doesntknow wonthurt her he sent a warning glance at snape and more importantly what she doesntknow will keep her from trying to escape not necessarily snape commented evenly she might want to take the risk of facing supposedly terrible forest demons if it means getting back home draco just about choked on the terrible snickering laugh in his throat as he came to another staircase i highly doubt she d even make it past the entrance hall he told snape confidently a girl like that wouldnthave had much of an education anyway he went on a smirk playing at his lips probably not too clever you re not making it any easier for you two to be together snape narrowed his eyes showing his irritation draco returned the glare suddenly angry with snape for not showing more sympathy towards his situation snape should ve been consoling the living daylights out of him by now agreeing on the unfairness of draco dreadful predicament but this is what i get his eyes narrowed further you re no better than mcgonagall draco scorned turning around on the steps to glower in his direction i d have thought that you out of everyone might ve somewhat understood what kind of a position i in you have no idea how far the range of my understanding of your current dilemma really goes snape hopped up a few steps it only you that doesntseem to comprehend that your tiniest actions can make all the difference draco clenched his fists it you that doesntquite seem to realize that at some point in your life you re going to have to grow up he hissed draco snarled lowering himself to look snape directly in the eyes and bare his sharp teeth it about time you start trying to look at things differently he continued unflinching and unwilling to stand down you might be surprised at what you see and after a short silence saturated with angry tension snape nodded once to his speechless master mocked a bow and headed off down the staircase back to the girl room he was somewhat surprised when he did not hear a response from his master on his way to mcgonagall and midas draco wasntone to allow his opponent so to speak to have the last word but then again snape found that at the moment he really didntcare this was turning out to be a rather long night and with an exhausted sigh and an exasperated comment to midas mcgonagall sadly knew that she wouldntbe able to fall asleep again and to think this all started because i thought that madman was out there again she whispered to midas careful not to wake the girl on the other side of the door though somehow she knew that the girl was already dead asleep midas nodded without fervor and stretched his wings high over his head unleashing a large yawn i guess i d better get a head start on my rounds then she announced to midas who in all honesty wasntreally paying much attention anymore even if mcgonagall wasntplanning on trying to salvage some glorious shut eye that didntmean that midas wasntand he told her so with much wing gesticulation before flying off to head up to his favorite window in the highest tower with a small nod as he left mcgonagall tried to hold back another yawn and made her way down the corridor deciding which chore she should do first minerva a deep voice called from around the corner she recognized it as snape voice at once especially since he was one of only two people in the castle who had ever addressed her by her first name she noted with some concern and curiosity that he sounded thoroughly irritated what happened she asked as her usual impatience was once again kicked in snape sighed his eyebrows scrunching together in frustration he going to be difficult he told her lamely turning around and walking with her down the corridor well we should expect as much she said feeling defeated and wearied once again it not as if we really thought he was going to have a breakthrough and change his arrogant ways in one night they continued down the hallway as another silence crept in on them what did you tell her snape blurted out how much information did you give away you mean mcgonagall started knowingly did i tell her what was going to break the spell snape was silent i told her what happened everything only i conveniently excluded that little piece of information in our discussion i mentioned something about sybill telling us that the curse was irreversible and that we had yet to find something that could remove it how did she take that he asked though still attempting to hide his curiosity by avoiding eye contact she was quite appalled actually mcgonagall couldnthelp but smile the girl has a large heart and was quite abhorrent to the whole idea of us never being mortal again convenient he commented quite she grinned the brim in the hat curving upwards for the first time in hours and snape clenched and unclenched his teeth thoughtfully what are her views on our lovely little ball of royalty himself mcgonagall snorted she was rather embarrassed about her unladylike action when she thought about it later but at the moment she didntmind nor did she notice snape rather amused smirk i can only imagine the deep hatred for him that running through her veins she exclaimed and what worse is that she has every right to hate him i completely agree snape said unhappily did you talk to her at all about him i tried to mcgonagall sighed i left little hints subtle things that i hope she might ve picked up on whether she realizes that she did or not they turned another corner but i not sure if i got through to her i ll have to tell mr zabini and mr thomas to get some of that information she is fond of them i suppose those two snape exclaimed incredulously thomas perhaps but surely not zabini would you prefer mr longbottom snape glared i will choose to ignore that suggestion for by suggesting it you have now clearly recommended that we never become human again i am now farther away from mortality than i ever was for just having listened to it mcgonagall sent him a look but let it slide well what wrong with mr zabini then she found herself tremendously curious at this despite the fact that she had doubts as well mr zabini he ll practically be this girl guide her familiar and you want him to give her the first impression of what we re like his hormonal adolescent impression think about it mcgonagall i have she said somewhat defensively and believe me i thought about the same things that you did but hermione already seems to trust blaise and dean they were the first one she met here besides you and i cantdo it because we re going to be too busy what about their duties i can relinquish them of their chores for tomorrow for special royal services she replied but what about the girls in her room wouldntthey be just as suitable for the job he suggested struggling to remember if he had ever bothered to learn their names or not miss patil and miss brown never mind you have to admit she sighed mr zabini and mr thomas are the best options but they re practically animals snape sneered just remember that when the castle is in ruins and all of us are awaiting our fate as inanimate objects it ll be your fault for appointing such a consequential duty to them you just reminded me of something she told him not having paid attention to the last part of his little speech what was draco talking about there arentany animals in the forest there haventbeen any in years it just a little lie of his to keep her from trying to escape he sighed though his cockiness prevents the idea of her actually being able to leave from forming in his head i not surprised i suspect he ll want us to inform the others of this little lie then i d suspect so snape agreed i can take care of the east and south wing if you can take care of the north and west she suggested or you could tell patil and brown and be done with it they re quite the gossip mill with the servants arentthey mcgonagall chose to ignore that comment north and west for you it is then why thank you severus he sent a glare in her direction but mcgonagall ignored it they then made their way down to the main staircase in comfortable silence gratefully relishing the lack of noise in the corridors and knew all too well that within a few hours time it would be anything but quiet but something suddenly occurred to snape a thought he couldntbelieve he hadntthought of before minerva he said carefully knowing that the atmosphere around them would change drastically the instant he asked what does she know of you know who when she spoke her voice was crisp and short and no louder than a soft whisper she knows who he is mcgonagall chose her words carefully but she does not know his name she looked to see if he knew what she meant after searching her eyes for any more hidden meanings snape nodded in understanding and went down the large staircase separating from mcgonagall to go take care of his first chore of the day mcgonagall watched until he reached the bottom lost in her thoughts making a mental list of the things she needed to do mcgonagall turned around headed towards the east wing again to tell blaise and dean her plans with much dread and an equal amount of exhaustion she knew that it was going to be another long long day she could hear him stomping to his room from all the way over in the next corridor after her initial excitement died down it was replaced by annoyance she d heard what was supposedly going on in the castle gotten wind of the rumors and usually rumors were good to hear gossip kept her entertained rumors such as questions regarding whether or not snape used to sleep in red frilly pajamas or if blaise had had his way with patil or brown yet two mindless chatterboxes it wasntas if she was giving up on her favorite pastime it was just that there was one rumor in particular that she didnt like and what was worse was the fact that she had no idea whether it was true this had never happened before she could see everything that went on in the castle after all though trapped in this godforsaken mirror she could see everything from the cobwebbed corners of the towers in the far corners of the countryside to the busy streets in london anything she wanted to see except for this but as if that wasnttorture enough draco her last chance at finding out the verity of this rumor had the nerve not to even come check on her and she had stayed up the whole night worrying about him and waiting for him to come even if it was well a holiday that none of them had been looking forward to he should ve remembered her trapped up in his room behind her glass he should ve had the decency to think of her suffering as well she fumed silently from behind her glass wall impatiently waiting for him to stomp down the rest of the corridor his entrance was more dramatic than usual or necessary she thought and the door was slammed shut so hard that it was left with only one remaining hinge to connect it to the wall she could barely make out some of his infamous mumbled cursing and noticed that his ears were pinned back to his head angrily she d be lying if she said that she wasntscared even though she knew that he would never harm her draco what going on she demanded to know rumors have been spreading around the castle like mad neville stopped by around one or so to tell me but he couldntstay long enough to explain what he saying is complete bollocks but the entire castle believes it pansy draco said through clenched teeth clutching his head in an attempt to dull the annoying throb of his headache inadvertently looking very much like he did that night if you ve got a point then spit it out pansy scoffed indignantly the nerve of him no one tells me anything anymore she complained throwing her hands up in the air i stuck up here by myself for hours at a time and when something happens no one has the decency to come up and talk to me about it she crossed her arms strands of her blonde hair falling from their place behind her ears and what worse is oh like you ve got a lot to complain about draco threw his arms to his side as he turned to glare at pansy she had been about to tell him what she couldntsee but on thinking it over she decided that she might not want to share that detail even if he were to ask her flat out that would be showing him a weakness and draco hated weaknesses more than anything well almost anything come off it pans he sighed making his way over to what could only be a bed despite the fact that it looked absolutely nothing like one pansy annoyance started to slowly drift away hugging herself as if she were cold and feeling ashamed for not noticing earlier just how upset he was pansy sorted her thoughts i sorry draco she spoke as softly as she could draco collapsed onto his nest and rested his elbows on his knees staring at the dirty floor there was a slight silence as pansy bit her lip thoughtfully debating whether or not to ask him the question that had been playing through her mind for the last couple of hours finally her curiosity won her over when neville came by she started out quietly looking at something to the right and knowing that he had no problem hearing her and told me what was going on i didntbelieve him she looked up at him but he was still staring at the floor she looked at the floor as well he told me that there was she glanced back up at him to find him massaging his temples with his paw that there was a girl in the castle with a deep breath pansy waited for a reaction of some sort she was very disappointed when she received none is it true draco she asked more quietly than before afraid to hear the answer he sighed again it is he replied dully pansy closed her eyes and was shocked to find that she could almost feel tears already beginning to form but she was stronger than that and held them back preventing them from coming before they even had a chance instead she nodded slowly as the realization sank in what her name pansy asked at a loss for anything better to say well there was that and the idea that if she had this girl name she might be able to finally find her or at least she was hoping so anyway hell if i know draco scoffed and continued to rub his eyes pansy watched in concerned silence pondering what to do next draco was clearly not satisfied with the girl fate had brought him and even though she knew that it was probably not a good thing for her or for the other members of the castle pansy couldntbe happier at the fact how bad is it pansy asked at last unable to quench her curiosity draco sighed and lay back down on his bed staring dully at the ceiling bad he said disdainfully unbelievably bad he crossed his arms over his chest and i even got mcgonagall and snape ragging on me about the whole thing the whole castle turned into a bunch of disrespectful idiots the whole lot of them snape draco nodded but i thought you and snape were well i thought so too he said angrily sitting up and throwing an arm out into the air to prove his frustration he continued out of everyone i would ve thought that he would ve been a bit more sympathetic but no the big mentor snape kicks in at the most inconvenient time and he starts chastising me just as badly as mcgonagall if not worse what about me pansy thought angrily unable to stop feeling hurt at his tactless words you didntthink that i d understand without fully realizing what she was doing she began to glare at him i hate this predicament just as much as you do if not more where do you get off thinking that i wouldntbe here to hate this with you just rattling off in his stupid lecture about how i need some sense knocked into me draco shook his head angrily and looked to pansy what kind of bollocks is that i the only one with some sense in me pansy sighed angrily and continued to go on glaring unnoticed to draco and his terrible mood this girl draco stopped his arms remaining in midair pansy unconsciously stopped scowling at him waiting for whatever description he was going to give this girl but draco seemed at a loss for words what words does one use to express the utmost loathing and the ultimate feelings of disgust and feeling even more frustrated at his sudden inarticulateness draco threw his hands up in defeat fell back down on his bed and released such a growl of frustration and anger that pansy jumped that bad pansy asked sympathetically secretly enjoying the fact that draco wanted nothing to do with this girl draco turned to glare at her yes it that bad his eyes narrowed she a bloody commoner how can it not be bad his expression softened a bit and pansy wished more than anything that she could ve been out of the mirror at that moment pansy sighed sadly she opened her mouth to say something but then closed it quickly for she realized that she had nothing to really say pansy couldntsay anything that would possibly cause draco to think twice about the girl she wouldntbe able to live knowing that she d been the one to finally get draco to see some of the possibly good things about her but she needed draco to see her as comforting and sympathetic and she didntknow how to be either of those things very well let alone comfort him about something for which she might need comfort too but luckily pansy speechlessness went unnoticed as draco began to complain again i canttake this pans draco closed his eyes and held his head pansy gingerly touched the glass in front of her and tried to simply will it to go away she was unsuccessful i even went so low as to try to look for things in her that werentso bad draco sneered pansy looked up at him she swallowed did you find anything she asked hesitantly no he sighed i mean have you even taken a look at her pansy didntrespond but apparently draco hadntreally wanted her to because he went on without giving her much of a pause she not very pretty for one so it ll be a bloody miracle if i feel any physical attraction to her at all he commented not feeling the slightest bit guilty it was the truth after all pansy tried to hide her wicked grin she wasntvery successful at that either what would she look like hanging on my arm when i mortal again he thought with disapproval especially compared to the beautiful princesses who had been throwing themselves in line for my attention at least i d still be the one getting all of the attention in the end but after feeling smug for a millisecond draco remembered what he looked like now and his scowl returned and who knows what kind of schooling she had she could be the dumbest girl in her whole village i mean what kind of an idiot would walk through that pitch black forest during the middle of the night the girl insane he pounded his fist into a torn up pillow next to him ha he shouted mirthlessly i d probably be better off marrying that madman decisions decisions pansy interrupted sardonically with a small smile speaking at last but pansy wasntna ve and didntlet down her guard just yet she knew that draco no matter how stubborn or how much he refused to admit it was really lonely his feelings could change drastically especially with the help of an entire castle attempting to play matchmaker even if he doesntrealize it yet she thought he needs someone she swallowed and for the longest time i was the one he needed you re telling me he said darkly i sick and tired of this girl already i sorry draco she told him no you re not he said scornfully you re just saying that because i complained about the other lot what do you have to be sorry about you get a free ride back to mortality dontyou dare go putting words in my mouth draco malfoy she whispered fiercely you know none of that true and if you don t then i not sure you deserve to be human again draco leapt up from his bed and vaulted himself in her direction with a snarl stopping only a few centimeters away from the glass pansy tried not to jump she knew he wouldnthurt her but she ended up flinching a little anyway draco tried to keep up his sneer but it soon faded away draco was left staring intently at pansy and pansy doing the same in return then what do you suggest i do oh wise one he stepped back from the mirror and crossed his arms over his chest draco never apologizes at first she gave him a look for his sarcasm even though she was glad that she had gotten him to start acting like his usual self again pansy bit her lip taking a rather long moment to figure out what to say what no advice from i think she cut in hoping that what she was about to say was safe that you should just go with the flow she finished lamely feeling extremely unsatisfied with her statement go with the flow draco echoed slowly a brow rising questioningly those are your words of wisdom yes they are she threw back at him defensively you should bear them in mind too she sighed do you have any idea of what you re asking he went to his curtained balcony and pulled back one of the ratty blankets to peak out through the glass window go with the flow and what if i dontlike where i going what your insightful answer to that he turned back around to face her dropping the sheet and cutting off the moonlight from flowing in well what do you want me to say draco she spat angrily you seem to have something you re waiting to hear why dontyou just go ahead and let me on in this little thing that you so desperately want to hear so we could make both of our lives a hell of a lot easier for a moment all draco did was look at her you know what pansy he asked calmly shaking his head and turning back to pull open the curtain again just he grabbed the handle to the glass doorway which hadntbeen used in years and cracked it open the sun was just beginning to rise a small gust of wind came inside blowing in a small pile of snow and causing draco next words to come out in visible icy wisps just forget it and with that draco opened the door making sure that the curtain was still hanging over the window he stepped out onto the snowy balcony leaving pansy speechless and upset all over again with the sound of the icy glass window closing in its frame with a defeated sigh pansy turned away from the closed door and looked for something to distract her unfortunately the first thing she saw wasntmuch of help sighing again she leaned her head against the glass and continued to stare at his mangled portrait it was sad to think about everything draco had gone through it was even more tragic to think about how he had gone through the majority of it alone but that not really true she thought he always had me she closed her eyes and now he ll have her but he hates her she quietly whispered to herself making sure that it was far too low for even draco to understand her he hates her because she a commoner but i a servant i practically a commoner myself she shook her head to clear the thought but he known me for years i ve watched him experience terrible and wonderful things that she ll never be able to share with him it the castle that needs her not draco draco has me but a new thought occurred to her as she looked at the portrait again slate eyes stared back at her coldly but will he come to know her as he knows me she swallowed what if she starts to know him better than i do she laughed at her own stupidity in the first place it would take a lot for him to let anyone let alone this girl get to know the real him and secondly i know draco better than anyone the eyes were still staring at her happy seventeenth birthday draco disclaimer this story is based on

disney version of beauty and the beast and any other things specified and i not making any profits from this fic author notes canon draco is a totally misunderstood and complex character i love him so it taken me a little while to get back into the swing of fanfiction after having finished hbp on the day that it was released and obsessing over canon for the following 96 hours but now it is time to continue on with this fic and canon blaise nyah my portrayal of blaise was a long shot to begin with but he is now so far out of character that there hardly any connection i will slowly incorporate canon blaise characteristics basically just the physical ones into my blaise but not all at once psh white candle go me likewise i also apologize for what is now a very very ooc madam pince although my defense is that when i wrote her she didnthave much of a character enjoy author notes edit 7 24 11 edited chapter 6 the contents of a traitor diary that sun is bloody annoying hermione thought desperately trying to hide from the persistent sunlight after discovering that neither turning on her side nor shoving her head between one of the many layers of pillows would shelter from the first hazy rays of warmth she decided that it may be time to get up and close her tattered old curtains i going to have to replace them soon she noted mentally but when she opened her eyes she realized that the ceiling above her was most definitely not her ceiling similarly the curtains hanging over a window also did not belong to her nor did the furniture against the unfamiliar walls that surrounded her she abruptly sat up in the bed that she didntpossess and her eyes darted around anxiously trying to find anything that would give her a clue as to whom the items really belonged where but as soon as the word had escaped her lips her mind was flooded with images of the previous night events and she plopped back down onto the soft linen sheets with a sigh it hadntbeen a dream after all had it before she could feel herself burst into a panic logical hermione returned and she attempted to find a silver lining if i werenthere at the castle i could ve been a corpse out there in the snow that sounds like a sufficient upside hermione ignored the voice that told her that instead of being at the castle she could have also been at her house they probably wouldnthave ever found my body which means that i probably would not have had a proper burial no one would know what really had happened and everyone would ve driven themselves crazy especially ron and harry she thought with a small sigh but isntthat what going to happen now i supposed to be stuck here for the rest of my captivated life i just as good as dead so much for her silver lining i have to get out of here she closed her eyes and began to brainstorm one clich theory included the method of tying her sheets into a long rope and climbing down from her window but that plan was quickly thrown to the side after she d had a glimpse of how high up she d been last night she turned her head to face the large window and squinted to protect her eyes from the glare she was practically as high as the top of the trees there no way she had enough material to make any kind of rope long enough to reach the ground she stared at the ceiling again speaking of the sheets they were even softer than they had looked and they had looked very soft to begin with i ll think of something as soon as i get up she promised herself but in the meantime she decided that if she had any chance of making it out of imprisonment she needed to be well rested and this comforter was just the perfect comrade for such a mission hermione hastily got out of the bed to close the thick curtains and proceeded to jump back into the sheets like she used to do when she was little and still lived in the city with her parents sighing softly hermione pulled the soft covers up to her chin and slid her body down so that she had practically melted herself into the mattress shutting her eyes with a sleepy smile she prepared herself for another gratifying hour of sleep or three she was quite comfortable and halfway to unconsciousness when she vaguely heard some noise off to her left her brows furrowed slightly at the disturbance but her stubbornness didntallow her to think much of it when her brain was so looking forward to the restful calm before the planning brainstorm good morning sunshine her eyes snapped open and with a gasp her hands flew to her head to scrape back the clumps of dirty hair from her face so she could properly see who had fatally interrupted her beating heart her face set in a disgusted grimace as she held up a rather muddy looking wad of hair and thought that a bath might also be a good idea she glanced through blurry eyes at the sheets that she had adored so much and frowned guiltily at the grime that she had left embedded in the threads in her exhaustion how d you sleep a second voice asked mm hermione grumbled incoherently trying to get her mouth to form actual words again she was in the middle of figuring out how to get i wouldntknow considering you d woken me up from her brain to her mouth in that particular order when the first voice started bouncing around the bed she couldntever remember being this grumpy in the morning before perhaps her incaraceration had something to do with that i bursting with excitement dean the first voice which hermione still groggy and incoherent somehow miraculously decided was not dean due to the fact that she hoped people in this castle did not talk in the third person though that wouldntbe the strangest thing around here would it just overflowing with it i think i going to burst well if you re going to do so please do it without delay the second voice which hermione had now associated with dean said coldly although there was underlying amusement in his tone i really canttake much more of you and it barely even lunch time oh come off it you re just jealous you know the first voice said hermione who had finally left her foggy stage of post sleep opened her eyes with a yawn to see none other than blaise the candlestick jumping around on her fluffy comforter of what asked dean from the other side of her legs looking annoyed and oddly entertained all at once of my ability to express my thoughts and emotions in such a charming and lovable way he responded isntit charming and lovable he asked hermione who was caught completely off guard uh well of course it is milady blaise interrupted i told you so that cheating well hermione blaise cut in smoothly and shuffled his way up to a pillow next to her head i suggest that we get a move on then you ve got a busy day ahead of you and i d imagine that you d fancy a bath before you plunge into the castle we re sorry we donthave any breakfast er brunch dean apologised but all of us have learned long ago that concealing food in these forms doesntwork out very well and the master would know if you werenteating in the kitchen he stared at the quilt sheepishly oh hermione said sitting up that all right i had forgotten about my appetite to be perfectly honest with you she scratched her head absent mindedly and pulled her finger back to examine it ugh she thought with another grimace i really really need a bath i wouldntmind taking a bath first hermione said pulling on a strand of hair if you dontmind she added on ah of course be our guest blaise called out and jumped from a pillow to her nightstand from there with a giant leap he made it to a waist high mahogany chest and continued along the top until he reached the door to the bathroom he jumped on the handle and pushing it down with his weight he opened the door with ease show off dean muttered oh hermione eyebrows rose thank you anytime he replied with a bow enjoy your bath milady he told her as she slipped off the covers and stood we d run the water for you but he wiggled and hermione stared transfixed no hands everything you ll need is already in there said dean but if you need anything lavender and parvati will be right out here for you where are they hermione asked stretching and looking around the room the just went down the fall for a few moments to catch up on a few things with the other servants but they ll be back soon dean assured her making his way to the door as will we blaise said following dean take your time no need to rush see you in a bit miss granger hermione she insisted offering a perplexed smile right see you in a bit then hermione said dean as he and blaise exited the room hermione gave a small wave of her fingers as they left before she tried to rub away the remaining tiredness in her eyes with one last yawn and a stretch hermione started for the bathroom her footsteps were silent on the floor and were eerily quiet as she walked through the room not a single noise from the corridor or the sound of a bird outside absolutely nothing until a particular floorboard gave way under her feet creaking loudly and causing hermione to jump back in surprise she looked down at the floorboard testing it out with her foot again and making a mental note to avoid that floorboard in the future and hermione enjoyed the best bath she could ever have imagined the bathroom was nearly half the size of her bedroom which was extremely large to begin with and was just as fine and deluxe as the room if not more lavish but hermione didntstop to admire it for very long because the tub looked more appealing than anything else she spent a luxurious half hour there soaking and soothing the sore muscles that the cozy mattress could not even hope to ease then she spent a rather stressful amount of time washing her hair which rivaled her in her own stubbornness after much grunting and many strands of hair lost thanks to a brush that had been left on the counter hermione dried off with a fluffy white she left the bathroom wearing a comfortable white bathrobe feeling refreshed and rejuvenated although she wasntexactly satisfied with her hair then again she never was she back she heard blaise exclaim as she stepped through the door she was surprised to find them already there and questioned how long she had been in the tub after taking a step out of the bathroom she realized that she had left her clothes in the bathroom she was about to go back and retrieve them from the counter before things could be considered improper when she noticed with some dismay that her wardrobe and dresser had awakened oh dear out you go lavender said as she trailed after dean shoo we ll see you later blaise parvati called as the two objects stood in the doorway dontbe a stranger we ll be back hermione again blaise nodded before he and dean set off down the corridor and the door shut wait now parvati and lavender simultaneously turned around to face her sending her more scrutinizing gazes than they had last night i believe we have some work to do i agree lavender said with what hermione could only classify as a smirk an evil smirk ladies hermione held up a negotiating hand the other clasping the bathrobe around her tightly she took a step backwards toward the bathroom as her furniture closed in on her if i can just make it to the room and lock the door i appreciate your enthusiasm but i sure that my clothes will be just fine with a good wash oh nonsense hermione lavender laughed but it was one of the terrible kinds that usually only girls half hermione age could manage to emit from their throat the sound of which hermione found she more often than not disliked immensely that dress is practically in tatters you re our guest parvati told her cheerfully getting dangerously close when hermione was still a hefty two meters away from the door you deserve the best that we have to offer and we have the best lavender told her proudly ah but you see i got the impression that i was a prisoner rather than a guest from your master last night so i think it would really be a bad the dark green one parvati asked with a small giggle hermione still found it excruciatingly difficult not to roll her eyes the dark green one lavender agreed well hermione and just as hermione thought she was going to make it lavender and parvati took her by her arms with their wooden drawers and cabinet doors leading her to the center of the room and away from her marbled sanctuary just a few mere meters away hermione looked back forlornly over her shoulder at the bathroom as she let herself be dragged to her bed now parvati opened her doors your dress she pulled out the dark green dress that she had shown hermione the night before and set it in her lap careful not to get it wrinkled and here are some matching shoes she pulled them out of a lower compartment below the dress rack you change while lavender and i discuss what to do with your hair but really hurry up lavender ordered blaise and dean will be back soon to pick you up go and as lavender and parvati went into the bathroom to plot whatever terrible schemes concerning her hair they were plotting hermione extended the dress out in front of her looking it over doubtfully she sighed and began to change she was just finishing as parvati and lavender came out of the bathroom again holding hairbrushes and combs and giggling madly at something hermione couldnthear but had the sneaking suspicion that she really wouldntwant to know ooh doesntthat dress look nice parvati chirped smiling proudly i love that dress so do i lavender agreed you see how the bottom is sewed like that creative and practical i think this red dress in here has a similar pattern actually parvati opened a door and began to search for said dress and lavender began to help oh here it is hermione gave a small cough but it went unnoticed she sighed and began to tap her bare foot on the wooden floor which was inaudible to the others as well she crossed her arms impatiently and waited but it seemed that lavender and parvati had forgotten all about hermione for they were much too busy discussing the many different kinds of dresses in parvati compartment hermione sat on the bed not really worrying too much if her dress got a little wrinkled and put on her matching shoes much to hermione surprise and luck the shoes fit shoes and dress on and ready for whatever came next hermione held her hands in her lap and waited and waited the never ending mindless chatter of the girls in the background was driving hermione raving mad and she thought that if she didntget out of the room soon she was going to explode she began to look at the room in the daylight thinking that it looked even more wonderful with a little illumination hermione lazily wondered if the two girls were best friends most likely she thought they sure act like it but then she thought that they might just act this way around everyone with a twisted feeling in the pit of her stomach she was suddenly reminded of ginny harry and ron her own best friends during her third or fourth inspection of the room hermione stood up and slowly walked to the door she glanced back at her furniture noting that they were completely oblivious with some insane spurt of giddy excitement and a rush of adrenaline hermione quietly stepped towards the door and pushed down the handle stealing one more glance back at the preoccupied girls across the room hermione pulled the door open just enough to slide through and closed the door as gently as she could without hesitation hermione hastily went down the corridor wondering just how long the girls would take to notice that she was gone if i could just get to the entrance hall i might be able to start laying some groundwork for my plan she was pondering the maximum length of a conversation about dresses when she heard voices around the corner and instantly pressed her back up against the stone wall quieting her breathing so as not to draw attention to herself and waited for the voices to pass she couldntremember if the prince required supervision for her when she was out of her room now that she thought of it this is ridiculous she muttered angrily under her breath before the voices could get too close flattening herself against the wall as much as she could she closed her eyes and tried to listen to the conversation around the corner how am i supposed to know you bloody wanker came an entirely ruffled sounding voice how i ask how dean came another voice this one exasperated and condescending you have connections mate you re supposed to know these things funny i didntsee that anywhere in the job description a pause what your job then to thoroughly ravage and or take advantage of every attractive and able female in the castle for my own personal benefit of course ha dean scoffed lightly well dontbother asking me for a letter of recommendation of your character should you ever choose to seek new employment you know in a candle shop oh har har blaise mocked honestly though what would you classify a job like mine as blaise asked curiously male prostitution with a sigh of relief and a small laugh of amusement hermione stepped away from the wall blushing slightly and continued around the corner are you implying something dean blaise asked accusingly possibly dean answered simply hullo hermione he said spotting hermione coming around the corner good morning she smiled hello blaise said quickly how much of that did you hear quite a bit actually she answered truthfully we were just discussing blaise s i would just like to take this moment to announce that under no circumstances would i ever indulge in questionable activities for money blaise interrupted hermione quirked an eyebrow inquisitively dean stared at him doubtfully unless of course it was a rather large sum of money he said as an afterthought dean rolled his eyes or if i was promised a suitable position of power in some tropical city where i was forced to enjoy alcoholic beverages for hours on end or if point taken dean said loudly and turned to hermione would you like a tour we could sneak you into the kitchens for some breakfast but i haven t yes please you dean are insufferable he pouted isnthe insufferable he asked hermione and yet you somehow manage to tolerate me anyway dean answered for her lucky me quit your whining mate blaise chirped all ill attitude toward the paintbrush forgotten we ve got a castle to present he turned around dean and hermione in tow and bounced off toward some unknown destination and my dear lady i hope i haventmade a negative impression on you er splendid come along then hermione he turned to smile at her from his location far up ahead coming hermione called surprised at his sudden ability to move so fast we ll start with our bachelor pad it was a perfect morning the melodic singing of the birds and the creative formations of the clouds followed a breathtaking sunrise dobby woke up with the feeling that he was going bake his best loaves of bread that he had done all week and the blacksmith just knew that his profits were going to be twice as much as the previous month it was the perfect morning the weasleys agreed mrs weasley who had been especially frantic the day before calmly prepared for the upcoming celebration of the evening and hummed her favorite tune while cleaning out the rooms for the sons who were returning home mr weasley took a morning stroll around town before coming home to read the paper and fred and george had naturally slept in but something had definitely gone wrong somewhere in between the perfect morning and the present ron knew for sure because things certainly werentperfect anymore where is she he asked for what was surely the seventeenth time in the last hour alone she probably just a little busy said harry making an atrocious attempt to sound comforting or walking slowly ron gave him a skeptical look walking slowly he echoed well harry rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly sure with a groan ron let his head connect with the picnic table harry sighed from his right this is hermione ron said despairingly she never late oh come off it ron percy cut in from behind as he came to sit down at ron left stop worrying before you have an epileptic fit she ll probably be here anytime now shut up percy ron glared bringing his forehead away from the tabletop that what everyone said an hour ago he paused to scowl and an hour before that well i saying it again percy took a sip from the cup he was holding honestly ron you re going to give yourself a hernia over this sod off percy well then percy replied indignantly tipping his noise to the sky and standing up from the picnic table bench to join bill and kingsley shacklebolt in a conversation elsewhere ron ran his hands through his hair with another sigh if you re really that worried ron we could just go over there she not here yet came ginny voice as she sat down on harry right sod off ginny touchy she commented casting a questioning glance at harry who in turn gave her a shrug calm down ron there has to be some reason why she taking so long yeah there has to be something said george with a smirk arriving at the table across from the others didntscare her off now did you ronnikins fred added taking a seat next to his twin love proposals can be quite intimidating when they re not done properly you know ron ears went redder than his hair how did or when the recipient is completely off guard where or when the person proposing is a completely incompetent idiot with red hair how d you two find out ron all but shouted his face matching his ears and hair harry watched on a little sympathetically while ginny ate a pear that had been in a bowl on the table he rounded on harry and ginny ready to interrogate but the looks on their faces looked too sincerely clueless and innocent for him to bother careful ronald wouldntwant to scare hermione away with that tone of yours now would you george said tauntingly plucking a green apple from the basket in front of him and taking a bite i swear if you tell anyone else oh please dear ronnikins said fred taking an apple as well we wouldntdream of interfering with your uh what you d call your love life unrequited love is always a bit tricky isntit ron opened and closed his mouth many times his ears burning pink feeling tired and somewhat hopeless ron slouched down and grudgingly repeated his question how d you hear about it he asked with a menacing glare though his tone had lost most of its venom a little birdie told us fred replied i serious ron continued to glare so are we c mon ron grumbled you guys haventseen me in months is this really how you want to treat me sorry ronald george said in between bites we must make up for lost time you d think he d have learned what to expect after seventeen years but no fred told harry got an awfully thick head that one he pointed his thumb at a seething ron that cantbe too attractive why you ronald weasley if i see your fingers making that hand gesture again you may just lose them mrs weasley warned approaching the picnic table ron put down his hand another scowl creeping across his face how are we all doing mrs weasley asked standing at the end of the table and looking at everyone individually her brow furrowed when she counted so few at the table where hermione she not here yet mum fred told his mother a bit too cheerfully as ron glowered no she cast a worried glance at ron who was getting more indignant by the second oh well then no need to worry i sure though she looked at ron worriedly and his were returning to its abnormal pinkish tint i sure it had nothing to do with what you said yesterday you know ron asked horrified does everyone know fred and george sniggered openly molly mr weasley called from the backdoor of the house where the pepper oh dear mrs weasley sighed and turned to her husband i ll be right there arthur with one last sympathetic glance to an extremely embarrassed ron and a small pat on his shoulder mrs weasley ran to the backdoor shouting to arthur about the blasted pepper and its ever changing location i love how everything about my life is made public does shacklebolt know yet maybe we should all tell dobby and tonks how i was rejected too a thick layer of sarcasm coated his tone why not fill them in on the details ron glared at the twins in fact why dontwe just publish my whole conversation in the paper that d solve everything what a wonderful idea said george honestly ron fred said more seriously you should know better than to try to keep secrets in little whinging and yes careful ron george added your face is going to get stuck like that if you keep scowling so much he smirked as stood up from the table fred who was sporting a smirk of his own followed suit just ignore them ron ginny said finishing her pear you know your reactions only incite them further nice to know that my family gets its entertainment out of my misery ron grumbled resting his head on his arms i still think we should go see her you know or even meet her on the way harry said looking at a deflated ron if she still busy at the house then we can help her out and get her here sooner ron groaned this just figures he continued to scowl this kind of stuff always happens to me oh stop complaining ron ginny said mildly irritated just walk down with us so you ll see that there nothing wrong and you can stop worrying so much she stood up followed by harry and a reluctant ron yeah harry told him heading for the gate to the front yard i sure everything fine and here we have what we like to call the main staircase blaise gestured to the large staircase that hermione used first the night before because it the main staircase and it large thank you for that said dean dryly quite welcome blaise said cheerfully although you should know that it interchangeable with the grand staircase as well a little more pompous that one and to the left we have the entrance to the kitchens although you cantreally see it unless you re looking for it as they went down the steps hermione looked to where where blaise was pointing see that door right there the one next to the picture of the huge green pear hermione didnthave much trouble finding it we have another kitchen but we dontuse that as much anymore it a lot bigger than the one we use now and well we dontreally get the company that we used to blaise shrugged no need to use such large one right dean interrupted before she had a chance to respond sir snape the main chef dean explained great talent that man though he is a bit rough around the but why is he called sir if he only a chef hermione asked curiously ah dean paused never really thought about it before when did we start calling him sir blaise got me the candlestick replied reaching the bottom i ve always known him as that perhaps as a tribute to alliteration well dean started either way he may be just a chef but he got a bloody lot of influence over the master for just a cook in fact he probably wontbe in the kitchen right now most likely off somewhere in the castle doing business for the prince with mcgonagall or something the master usually listens to snape over anybody else so we all figured that we ought to wow he said i ve just realized the logic behind that ah shut up you you re going to go all philosophical on me pretty soon if you keep up that attitude blaise said from ten meters ahead the point is that snape important so he gets a sir before his name he paused looking up at the ceiling sir zabini he nodded i like the sound of it splendid dean sounded horrorstruck and hermione couldnthelp but laugh so if sir snape is a cauldron because he cooks hermione began and you re a paintbrush because you re an artist he nodded the what kind of job do you have blaise besides the more questionable tasks that is he stuck his nose in the air my job is a highly significant one he said haughtily without me you all would be stumbling around in the dark he a bit touchy his about real job dean whispered to hermione who had to bend down a great deal to hear making it a little difficult while she tried to walk down the stairs it was the only open position when he got here they reached the bottom while we were still mortal dean continued to whisper and hermione began to feel as though she d never be able to stand upright again blaise was quite the loner hermione eyebrows shot up into her hairline i know hard to imagine but he was quite the quiet one the only time any of us really ever paid attention to him was at night when he lit the candles and in the morning when he blew them out no hermione shook her head not him difficult to believe he nodded i know i can hear you blaise said but he didntsound completely annoyed about it i ve developed a little motto since our transformation i d like to think that it helped to release me from my shell it really an amazing slogan dean commented he become quite the philosopher since his brain is made of wax oh do shut up dean you re one to talk bristle brains whiskery bristly fiber brains so this motto is hermione asked hoping to draw the conversation away from brains when in doubt blaise said proudly inhaling deeply make a complete fool of yourself pardon me you see hermione blaise continued waiting for hermione and dean to catch up there is a microscopically thin line between being brilliantly creative and acting like the most gigantic idiot on earth he shrugged so what the hell leap sounds philosophical enough hermione observed with a shrug i rather thought so too blaise agreed here the kitchens dean said pushing open the swinging door and keeping it open for hermione she stepped in letting her eyes take in the appliances and the many many moving objects all cooking and cleaning all of them were much too busy doing whatever it was that they were doing to pay too much attention to hermione or her two tour guides dean let go of the door which promptly smacked blaise in the wick sliding him two meters back from the door i d like to know what i did to deserve that they could hear the muffled sound of blaise indignant cry from the other side are you two friends hermione asked trying to sound tactful more or less dean replied we re roommates more than we are mates that was bloody uncalled for blaise exclaimed opening the door and stepping in the kitchen entrance do you see what i have to put up with he turned to hermione the indignity of it all indeed hermione said consolingly with an amused smile how do you manage please hermione dean pleaded dontencourage him i beseech you i beg your pardon blaise exclaimed causing many of the working objects to look up in surprise how dare miss miss many small teacups and saucers cried running or rolling towards the door and tugging at the hem of hermione dress pulling her to a small wooden table to the left sit miss they ordered pulling out a chair for her and pushing the seat in after she had sat down please sit miss back off you bunch of guest stealing leeches blaise jumped onto the table shooing away the many teacups that were placing a napkin in hermione lap neat miss and those who were setting the table in front of her off with you dean watched amusedly finding it wiser not to try to stop blaise just yet hermione only watched the teacups at first slightly shocked at the service she was receiving before she came to her senses and tried to help them no really she said softly to one teacup who was extremely determined to place a fork in the correct spot but was having some difficulty moving it to the right location by itself you donthave do that she moved her hand as if she was going to help no miss the teacup looked startled and was looking quite distressed about the matter no help miss but really please no help miss the teacup cried fearfully dragging the metal fork to its spot it grunted and groaned as it dragged it onto the place mat miss no help arrrrrgghhh blaise roared pathetically but it was enough to scare away the fearful little teacups which immediately stopped what they were doing to run off and hide in a cupboard above a sink the other kitchen workers didntlook too pleased with blaise that ought to show em blaise hermione exclaimed watching the teacups frantically accumulate in the glass cabinet what he asked hermione sent him a look oh dear came a squeaky voice to the left no children it quite all right hermione turned to the cupboard that the small teacups had squashed themselves into unmercifully to see a shockingly white tiny book hopping up and down frantically trying to calm the frightened teacups his frenzy alarmed them somewhat more but they calmed down after a few more gently calming and consoling words they reluctantly emerged from the glass cabinet above the sink and continued their chores in the kitchen though they tried to avoid blaise as much as possible and were quite jumpy the rest of the time that hermione was in the kitchen good morning miss the teeny white book greeted from the top of the table in front of her hermione jumped slightly she hadntseen him get on the top i am filius flitwick you wontoften see me in the kitchens other than at meal times but i do hope that we shall meet again soon he squeaked pleasantly hermione smiled feeling slightly dumbfounded once again i hermione she told the book hermione granger very pleased to meet you miss granger he smiled his pages crinkling noisily the book was quite old though it didntlook too haggard or used the pages were stiff with age and scuffled every time it moved here is your menu oh she said stunned gently taking the menu in front of her thank you the little book bowed and hopped off of the table onto a rolling cart to her left which promptly rolled back to the other side of the kitchen hermione watched in amazement before turning to look at the brushes washing the plates and silverware in the sink and the stove cooking marvelously delicious smelling things in the pots and pans on its burners she turned to her own plate and silverware picking up the fork that the poor little teacup had had so much trouble with and inspecting it carefully she turned to blaise and dean who were sitting in the chairs across from her the chairs were so low however that blaise and dean had to sit on tall stacks of books towels and other assorted items to reach the top these hermione pointed to the fork and plates they aren t well alive are they she asked timidly of course not blaise told her comfortingly those are one hundred percent inanimate hermione took another look at them just to be sure she then turned to her menu brunch flitwick rolled back with his cart to the edge of the table and hopped off countless teacups began jumping off the cart all tinkling and clanging carrying plates and platters filled with various foods the only other place hermione had ever seen so much food although it was never all for her was the weasleys table ignoring the quickening of her heart she watched as they brought out meat potatoes fruits and vegetables not to mention sweets desserts and candies of every kind imaginable the table was looking rather full but the teacups continued to bring more off another cart that had arrived oh hermione sat speechless erm thank you why miss flitwick looked shocked there is no need for thanks though he looked rather pleased anyway the teacups finished packing the table with food then scurried back onto their rolling carts flitwick hopped on the last one to leave the table squeaked enjoy your meal miss do not fear to ask for anything you need and then he rolled off back to the other side of the kitchen leaving behind five teacups all of which were sitting at the end of the table waiting obediently for an order you kind of get used to them running around after awhile dean told hermione i used to work in the kitchen sometimes he looked sullen there wasntalways a lot of work for a painter you know hermione was about to reply when blaise interrupted no he scolded one of the remaining teacups that were trying to take one of the towels from underneath him stop that blaise hermione gave him a look what he asked innocently dean rolled his eyes never mind him hermione dean told her apologetically i think you d better eat something soon the little guys are going to explode if they re not given something to clean i can have hermione gestured to what was on the table anything sure blaise said i recommend the chicken and the roast beef and the potatoes you can never go wrong with potatoes he nodded go with the potatoes potatoes it is then hermione shrugged feeling a little overwhelmed and instantly the tiny teacups burst to life and raced for the plate of baked potatoes before hermione even had a chance to reach for the plate grunting the little teacups brought the plate over to hermione and began loading her plate with potatoes but honestly hermione said softly you really donthave to enough miss one asked shoveling another spoonful of potatoes onto her plate stop now yes hermione said instantly and watched them with some displeasure return the plate back to its original location and return to their spots they returned to the edge of the table waiting for their next order you ll get used to them dean promised after awhile you might not even know they re there he said looking a little sheepish you dontstrike me as a particularly good liar hermione said truthfully no actually dean admitted i not hermione glanced at the teacups warily will they ever let me lift a finger hermione asked they ll let you eat dean replied though i cantmake any promises when you try to help yourself to something hermione looked down at her plate and picked up a fork the teacups jerked to life but remained in their spots flitwick called them children she whispered not exactly fond of talking about them when they were right next to her but she had the distinct feeling that they werentgoing to be leaving anytime soon are they paid er they have a place to sleep and have things to eat dean said looking somewhat sheepish again but they dontmind really are you kidding blaise cut in from his chair they live to serve they quite enjoy it hermione scoffed well i quite sure that it only because they dontknow any better she whispered harshly with a wary glance to her left they didntseem to notice what she was talking about how old are they well uh blaise thought i dunno she looked at dean who shrugged pretty young i guess dean didntseem to find anything wrong with his statement much to hermione indignant anger for them you guess hermione asked incredulously well dean looked uncomfortable if they dontmind working why should we because they dontknow any better hermione whispered harshly hermione blaise interrupted getting off of his chair and finding a tiny open spot on the table you cantworry about them they re happy hermione sighed frustrated where are their parents dunno blaise said offhandedly orphans oh hermione said looking sullen her thoughts traveled to harry and to her own parents er dean fumbled a plain look of guilt on his face dontworry about it he tried to sound consoling they re happy working here but no buts blaise interrupted now if you dontmind i going straight for the ice cream blaise announced and bounced over to the opposite end of the table finding it rather difficult to find open spots bring back some cherries blaise dean called down to him and donteat all the yorkshire pudding suddenly the teacups burst from their spots with such speed that dean fell over backwards off his pile of towels and books they dashed madly across the table after blaise who was now enjoying chocolate cookies and somehow holding a jar of maraschino cherries blaise shrieked madly as they dodged his cherry slinging with some difficulty hermione stared dumbfounded for a second before blaise hermione cried taking hold of the candleholder and the cherries the teacups stopped immediately forming a line out in front of her and waiting for instructions enough hermione told them that right hermione blaise cheered you tell em all of you are allowed to eat this food all right hermione said to them they looked at each other confused and unsure this had clearly never happened before i dontmind if blaise and dean eat this just like the rest of you she set blaise down next to dean who had just recently managed to get back onto the pile and set the cherries between them thanking her they began to stuff their faces incessantly their mouths becoming comically lumpy with sweets hermione pushed one plate of cookies a little closer to the teacups in hope that they might take some but they looked far too timid to try a little disappointed but not discouraged hermione took a bite out of her potato looking at the rest of the kitchen it appeared that they had all been watching interestedly but as soon as she turned to them they continued to work wait a second hermione said slowly after swallowing you can eat ub corth blaise said his mouth ridiculously full with cherries he swallowed loudly it a favorite pastime of ours but how she shook her head trying to find a way to phrase her question i mean where oh you know what hermione stabbed her potato causing a few of the teacups to jump and making hermione feel guilty never mind i dontthink i want to know suit yourself said an empty mouthed blaise before he slurped some milk noisily hermione watched in what she could only describe as grim fascination it kind of like watching a carriage wreck or something innit dean asked thoughtfully popping another cherry into his mouth and suddenly her train of thought was jerked from blaise and dean to carriages to accidents to scars and then finally to harry she swallowed and blinked wondering what wouldnt remind her of her friends you cantbear to watch but you cantlook away i her at blaise exclaimed sounding amply offended he hopped down from his seat and bounced to the other side of the kitchen just got to get more cherries he explained after hermione inquisitive glance friends temporarily forgotten she held up her hand pretending that she was going to yawn so as not to let them see her laugh and ended up yawning anyway tired dean asked a little she said which wasntcompletely dishonest so what dean had started but broke off suddenly and looking meanly at something he thought to be extremely vile behind her dean hermione asked worriedly dean she repeated again his eyes jerked back to hers and his facial expression returned to normal what oh dean shook his head sorry bout that what just wotcher seamus they could hear blaise holler even from the other side of the room dean groaned and let face meet the table fancy seeing you here blaise you big glutton you said a broom with sandy colored bristles good naturedly good cherries eh he asked spotting the new maraschino cherry jar bet you but he cut himself short when he looked at the table and spotted hermione the look he gave her was so incredulous and filled with shocked wonder that hermione couldnthelp but feel a little uncomfortable the gaze didntlast long however and soon his speechlessness wore off he grinned broadly sweeping himself over to her right and extending a clump of his bristles to shake her hand with me name seamus he introduced himself hermione laughed a little at the absurdity of the gesture as she shook hands with him real pleasure to meet you miss hermione she said feeling a little tired of introducing herself so many times in twenty four hours everyone knew her back home there wasnta need for introductions anymore and hermione oddly felt out of practice hermione desperately tried to push away the terrible recurrent feeling of homesickness in the pit of her stomach glad to meet you seamus and finally releasing the bristles hermione glanced at blaise at he somehow managed to get back up on a seat across from her with a full jar of juicy cherries you can join us if you like his eyes seemed to light up and his mouth opened as if he were going to accept but then they heard a forced cough to her left dean did not look happy but smiled innocently when she turned to him no hermione thought raising a brow he definitely not a particularly good liar you know seamus said bringing hermione attention away from dean i d love to wonderful hermione said as seamus sat next to blaise across from she and dean the teacups continued to hover in their spots just waiting to be given orders dean didntlook at seamus seamus didntlook at dean blaise was painfully oblivious and yet again filled with cherries hermione wasntstupid and she was about to start a conversation hopefully forcing the brush and broom to speak blaise blurted out these things never get old do they he popped another into his mouth you can have a million a gazillion even and they ll never stop tasting fantastic in went another hm dean said noncommittally interesting so hermione seamus started turning to the only mortal at the table have you gotten used to all of us being well you know hermione half shrugged it still a little different she finished she decided she needed more potatoes she reached for the platter when the teacups sprang to life and started to run toward it when she held out her finger ah ah ah hermione shook her head we just spoke about this but miss they all cried here she gave them a potato enjoy they stared at the vegetable dubiously before running to the edge of the table carrying it all the way and cautiously digging in once they reached their destinations she took a bite out of the chicken that had been put on her plate at some point and sat back contentedly seamus watched interestedly what was that all about he asked her i ve never seen them do that i just cutting them a little slack she told him with a smirk feeling more satisfied that all i told her to just leave them be blaise threw in between cherries but she wouldntlisten i dontunderstand why they should be made to serve my every whim when it so obviously unfair to them hermione stabbed her potato seamus jumped slightly and the potato split open they re children no less well seamus swallowed eyeing her fork warily that usually the price you pay when you lead a life of royal servitude he said truthfully it isntalways fair to the servants i still dontthink it right hermione said stubbornly popping her bit of potato in her mouth she swallowed and was about to take another piece when she suddenly looked up at seamus are you hungry at all oh no i fine seamus told her i ate earlier this morning thank you though seamus smiled at her and hermione returned the favor dean rolled his eyes in a not so subtle way is there a problem thomas he arched an eyebrow no no dean replied looking at his plate fine everything is just fine finnegan well seamus replied isntthat just great i rather think it is dean said returning seamus gaze fine fine hermione glanced back and forth between the two not really sure how to respond blaise of course was still eating his cherries mmm blaise commented licking his lips satisfactorily good you know what seamus suddenly looked at hermione it been a wonderful pleasure meeting you but i sorry i really have things to do he half smiled as he shook her hand again and apologized some more are you sure you dontwant anything to eat before you go she asked unsatisfied with the lack of communication between the two servants no thank you seamus repeated getting off of the chair i fine well hermione shrugged slightly if you re sure goodbye seamus she smiled bye hermione see you around and with a quick smile seamus walked to the other side of the kitchen and disappeared behind one of the doors hermione turned to dean planning to ask him what had happened but he interrupted her before she had a chance you know what dean asked but continued before waiting for a reply i have something really quick i have to do too he gave her a small apologetic grin i ll be back soon he told her getting off of the high pile of objects but what about i ll be back soon he called walking out the door that they had come in hermione sighed feeling a little more than frustrated bye she repeated dully stabbing her potatoes again the teacups shrieked and jumped again but hermione didntnotice why the long face hermione blaise asked his mouth finally empty you look a bit down and you re potatoes arentlooking so hot either oh sorry she looked up nothing wrong in particular at least aside from the obvious i suppose hermione shook her head it just what was going on between seamus and dean oh those two blaise nodded wisely yeah dontworry about that they re just in a bit of row right now but that all right these sorts of things between the two of them come and go they re friends then best mates then what happened hermione asked curiously well you see blaise started about a week ago we were holding our weekly game night laundry room this time we keep having to switch rooms because people can get a little too irritated about it the whole lot of us were up there now we usually donthave any problems with the game as we re all quite experienced he paused a bit but last week seamus was doing unusually well and won the entire pot a whopper of a pot too with his last hand what wrong with that dean accused seamus of cheating but seamus was having none of it blaise shook his head said that dean was just jealous it was just the luck of the irish is all ha blaise smirked anyway they had this huge fight about it and have barely been civil since seamus started sleeping down here in the kitchen too did he really cheat blaise shrugged dunno it didntreally matter all that much to me though i terrible with gambling though it certainly doesntstop me he said with a wink hermione sat for awhile not really sure what to think of a bunch of broom and candles and paintbrushes gambling when blaise hopped from his chair to the floor and informed her that they had to get a move on with the tour there still much to see you know he began walking to the door big bloody castle ehm blaise can i ask you for a favor at your service could i just go back up to my room for awhile to take a nap hermione asked sounding apologetic i d love to go see the castle some more but i think i still just too tired to do anything right now of course my dear hermione blaise replied happily we ll be sure to see the castle later hermione smiled at him gratefully thank you blaise i do live to serve smiling at her in return he opened the door for her like a true gentleman and bowed so low that his flame reached the tiles hermione walked out into the grand hallway waiting for blaise to lead her back to her room hermione was too groggy to pay detailed attention to the floor design of the castle this morning but now that she had something in her stomach she could begin to plan her escape so did you enjoy your meal blaise asked interrupting hermione thoughts what oh yes hermione assured him very much i especially liked the potatoes i not sure your fork thought so wait what you said it was inanimate she grasped her throat and covered her mouth looking absolutely mortified what oh they are blaise explained eh pardon my wording i er tend to it just a habit i have when talking i mean you know what i mean i hope hermione looked much more relieved and removed her hands yes i think i do she sighed you scared me for a moment there pardon that he said apologetically it just that it kind of hard getting used to seeing a mortal again after so long you know blaise said his tone a little more serious no hermione thought not really all settled then yes blaise hermione said stepping into her room and walking toward the bed thank you not a problem he replied cheerily from the doorway now lavender and parvati went down the hall for awhile but if you need anything just call them and they ll take care of it understand hermione nodded well okay then i ll be back in an hour or so to see how you re doing enjoy your nap i will hermione smiled softly and waved as he turned to leave and closed the door hermione closed her eyes and sighed quietly the smile slowly leaving her face she turned around to look through the huge window only to find the pine tree branches heavily covered with a layer of snow she made her way to the seat by the window checking that no one was around kneeling on the seat hermione placed a hand on the wall to her right and looked down at the ground sure enough after hermione eyes adjusted to the blinding glare of the white snow she could see that it was an awfully long way down she d never be able to escape from her window she plopped down onto the seat grabbing one of the many throw pillows from behind her and bit her lip thoughtfully going over her options what was she to do she couldntjust walk right out the front door in the middle of the night the prince most likely has guards that is unless he doesntthink i actually going to try anything she pondered this he probably doesntthink i the least bit capable she thought angrily the pompous arse but then again this might be an advantage she stared out the window would he really have guards or would he not want to waste any more of his servants on me hermione leaned back against the wall taking slight comfort in the cool touch of the stone he wouldnthave guards she decided her brows furrowed in deep thought but what would he use to keep me here then and he never directly said what would happen if i wandered through the castle who would take care of that she looked out at the trees of course the forest was filled with animals bugger hermione thought tossing the pillow back onto the seat and standing up how could i have possibly forgotten i ll have to have something to protect myself she noted i can find something later she began to pace back and forth wringing her hands how do i get out of the castle i ll have to have blaise and dean take me around some more hermione stopped mid pace what about dean and blaise never being able to return to their mortal forms what about madam mcgonagall sir snape and seamus or lavender and parvati even what about that spoilt arrogant prat of prince himself can i really just leave all of them behind without a second glance she bit her lip maybe i could somehow leave something behind for blaise and dean something to let them know that if i ever found anything that might help that i d come back no matter what the prince might say she looked at the trees again i want to help them she turned to the spots where lavender and parvati usually sat i do but i needed more elsewhere she nodded slightly to herself deciding that this was the way it had to be she needed to get home and with this determined frame of mind hermione glanced around the room she spotted a desk in the corner to the left of her window and instantly went there to look for some parchment i can start a map she thought so i ll actually know where i going when they take me around i ll look for a room that not too high from the ground maybe i can get out that way hermione hastily opened drawer after drawer searching for parchment and something to write with after six drawers and no success she began to get frustrated what kind of desk doesnthave any utensils she scoffed under her breath maybe the git doesntthink women high class or otherwise are literate that d explain it she shut another drawer okay hermione she glanced around the room again her bed a chair nothing helpful if you were some parchment where would you be in a desk hermione thought angrily she checked her nightstand but all she found were some spare candles she looked through the desk again and found a quill which would come in handy but nothing to write on she sighed frustrated i ll take anything at this point she muttered under her breath a tiny scrap anything she searched through another dresser and some shelves but found nothing great hermione muttered the only place left to look is the bathroom ha but hermione had nothing to lose so off to the bathroom she went to look this is absolutely ridicul but hermione was interrupted by a great long creak of the floorboard beneath her with a small shriek hermione jumped away glaring at the floorboard so much for my mental note when she looked carefully the middle was sagging ever so slightly and one edge was just barely higher than the other was putting her search for some parchment on hold hermione knelt on the ground and took hold of the higher edge she tried to get it back into place but it was stuck come on she said just go in a little further instead the end of the floorboard sprang up nearly hitting hermione in the face and completely knocking her over backwards sitting up on her forearms hermione cursed the floorboard angrily she knelt in front of it again still muttering and grabbed the end with one hand and braced herself against the floor with the other she started to push it down when something in the cavity caught her eye cocking her head to the side curiously hermione gingerly reached into the hollow space and took out a small thin book the book had a shabby black leather cover and water stained pages they werentas old as flitwick pages which crinkled with every move but they were beginning to turn yellow and were stiff around the edges hermione turned it over in her hands carefully on the back was the name of a variety shop that she recognized from her parents who had often traveled to back to their previous home of london she sighed at the memory as she continued to read the address of the store she recognized the name of the street as well as she and her mother had gone shopping there a few times before hermione opened the cover of the book there on the inside cover was the name tom marvolo riddle she stared at the name for a moment why would this tom riddle keep a book under a floorboard in a lady guest room she turned the book over in her hands again what in here that he d want to hide what is it exactly a diary hermione looked at the name again she had never heard it before hermione had always been one to intensely respect others privacy but the intense curiosity was eating away at her insides get a hold of yourself hermione he was probably just some servant she told herself there isntgoing to be anything special in here yet even still hermione couldntresist the urge to look what if there was some information that could somehow allow her to escape but before she did anything else hermione hastily closed the floorboard leaving it as it was before and ran to the door hugging the diary close to her she opened one of the doors a crack and took a peek outside not a sound hermione didntknow which room lavender and parvati were in or when any of them were going to be back she closed the door quietly and ran to the seat by the window she plopped down on the red cushions leaning against the many pillows with the book in her lap taking in a deep breath hermione opened the book again she paused still hesitant about invading someone privacy especially if they were seemingly no longer around to really protect it but with one more look at tom name hermione flipped the page without a second thought on the first two pages was what looked like a family tree starting with a name that she couldntmake out and ending with the man to whom the book belonged it was blurred in some areas to hermione displeasure including the top of the page that noted the year both because of old age and when it had gotten wet she flipped the page again indeed it was a diary she took another deep breath and began to read june 5 xxxx i believe it is now time to start a diary of my own as is tradition one that will explain my progressions for reclaiming the throne i have read and studied the diaries of those who came before me enough to have memorized their words and now it is my duty to inscribe my own i tom marvalo riddle descendent of tom riddle and merope gaunt am the true heir of salazar slytherin as the prophecy states i shall be the one to finally succeed in possessing the kingdom that our bloodline so deserves this diary a chronicle of my success at reclaiming the throne will provide all the essential knowledge of my history though i will not ever achieve immortality myself i shall forever be immortalized in this journal which will therefore guide my descendants to rule once i am gone the others before have all kept diaries to record the kingdom development whether from outside the castle walls or like i from a position among the royal staff as like all of the others they have explained our story some in more detail than others have assuming that the future readers of this diary will have had adequate education regarding our history in their coming of age studies i will make the story as brief as possible most are ignorantly unaware that the slytherin castle was once used as a school hogwarts founded by four powerful and wealthy rulers salazar slytherin included hogwarts became a famous school for the wealthy and noble helga hufflepuff rowena ravenclaw and godric gryffindor the other founders of the school and self proclaimed equalists believed that hogwarts should serve all bloodlines slytherin refused outright eventually however hogwarts allowed the enrollment of a more diverse population much to the resentment of the parents of current students and salazar himself it was no longer slytherin castle slytherin left in outrage swearing vengeance on those who had taken his castle from him and disappeared from past diaries it is said that slytherin instructed all of his descendants to keep records of the school and its founders which is how our tradition began he also predicted that when at last his true heir was born the castle would be reclaimed and he would be avenged centuries after slytherin disappearance the school enrollment began to dwindle and decrease gradually losing students each year until the school was at last forced to close the other founders vision had failed but not before tainting the hogwarts grounds with impure blood through questionable means no doubt laced with corruption prince lucius malfoy one of the last royal students to attend hogwarts and his family managed to reserve the vacant castle as the future home of his union with princess narcissa of the black family not long after their marriage and lucius coronation a new kingdom was born meanwhile my mother was carrying me in her womb she had never succeeded in making it onto the royal staff yet she did manage to earn me a position in the castle by seducing tom riddle my father he had been an associate of lucius in school because he was one of the few left with any noble blood though much poorer in status it was at this point in time that my father was actually serving them as a royal advisor he mysteriously died a few weeks before my mother showed up at the feet of the king and queen in their throne room begging to see the father of her baby the malfoys as i shall explain further are as talented as they are deceitful they may have their kingdom fooled and their servants perhaps but anyone who genuinely knows a malfoy knows the truth their compassion is false the malfoy family has been wildly prosperous only due to their impeccable sense of self preservation their cunning and their flawless capability of lying to their own subjects i have learned much from them so when my pregnant mother came in begging to see a man who had been somewhat of a friend to lucius claiming that he was the father of her baby a bastard child whose noble blood was tainted with the blood of a peasant lucius had half a mind to send us both off to rot in the dungeons but upon further consideration of the matter albus dumbledore a professor lucius had permitted to stay merely because of his prestige and a reminder that claimed responsibility for our well being lucius allowed my mother to stay in the servants quarters she died while giving birth leaving the servants tending to her only with what was going to be my name and a whisper the diaries the heir i was dumbledore responsibility until i came of age then my education exceeding many of those of royal blood because of the undeniable brilliance of my professor but mark my words brilliant he may be but he is as skilled in determining character as he is unwise never foolish never imprudent but never wise dumbledore never trusted me his suspicion is well founded but he is the only one with concern i was never able to shield my true opinions from him no matter how i tried he was the only considerable threat to my destiny and when i became the royal advisor myself he was the first to go once i have achieved my goal he shall be removed permanently the malfoys one would never think that a pair such as they could rule a kingdom so smoothly their reign has lasted about seventeen years just over my current age but their rule has not been tainted with so much as a battle their subjects are sickening to whom do they credit this peace and prosperity to the malfoys the family that has stolen from them and cheated them right from underneath them all and then snatched the unjust rewards if i could document the corruption the lies but this diary is not the place and soon enough none of it will even matter soon enough this work will all be mine the townspeople that come to beg for lucius and narcissa mercy disgust me the things that they ask for the pleas that they beseech what i have accomplished in the world save for the final act of my pitiful mother and the fortuitous egregious error of dumbledore i have done by myself without the aid of those pitying me know this dependence demonstrates weakness the worst weakness of all i am not weak i do not depend on anything but myself and look where that has gotten me where it will get me both lucius and narcissa were feared during their hogwarts days for they both came from wealthy powerful and important lineages while never admired by those who knew them best they were respected and feared for their strict control their peaceful kingdom their gracious pretenses it all just a fabrication a disguise created to maintain control i one of the only ones who know the truth and soon with all of the lessons they have inadvertently taught me it will be my turn my birthright under the care of dumbledore i grew up in the castle i was fascinated with knowledge and dedicated my free time to learning all there was to know devouring every piece of literary work in the castle with an ease that dumbledore often found astonishing yet disturbing all the same i was obsessed with my family line for reasons i wouldntunderstand until later i was determined to find out more about the last phrase uttered from my mother lips the servant who had relayed my mother message to me when i came of age urged me to never speak of this message to the king or queen or to dumbledore she left that night off to another kingdom and i can only assume that she and my mother had made a deal but under what conditions or for what i dontknow i know not the details of my mother life and for reasons unknown to me until just recently i often wandered about the dungeons starting as soon as i was allowed to roam the castle unaccompanied another reason dumbledore found motivation to suspect that something was strange about me every aspect of the dungeons intrigued me then as fate would have it one day just about a year ago years after i had become the royal advisor and had gained the malfoys trust i was taking my normal stroll through the castle taking my time in the dungeons as i usually did when something in an open cell caught my eye one of the stones in the wall had been loose and behind had been a compartment filled with stacks of diaries i had found part of the meaning of my mother dying words secretly bringing each of them to my room at various intervals so not as to attract attention or suspicion i read them late at night in the privacy of my room devouring each of them with a hunger i had never felt before i learned the true tale of hogwarts not the biased and tampered version that dumbledore had taught me but the truth i learned of the diary tradition every generation that had managed to write a diary as expected of slytherin managed to somehow store the diary in the compartment in the dungeons even if it meant committing a crime before they died the diary must enter the compartment and most importantly i learned that my mother had meant i was salazar slytherin heir her small brief and scraggly diary had somehow managed to make its way into the compartment as well from the diaries i have learned that slytherin had gone to a seer seeking to manipulate her into doing deeds for his revenge or to curse the others if possible and yet rather then benefiting him in the way he had imagined the seer made a prediction a prophecy concerning his heir born thousands of years from then the exact words spoken by the unnamed prophet herself stated that i d be the one to avenge him the predicted date of the heir birth matched mine thousands of years after slytherin death and from that night on i began devising my plan considering the possibility of using a witch like slytherin had intended i had already gained the trust of the royal family although it had been simply for personal ambition at first i must admit it will surely aid me i was always jealous of the malfoys for their power over the kingdom the ability to control so many people i had always secretly wanted that power for myself i tried to get as close to it as i could gaining the malfoys trust so i could influence their decisions to my liking but more significantly i remembered that years before learning about my fate and just shortly after i had taken title of lord riddle lucius had slipped in passing something about my royal blood i had never heard of this from dumbledore and instantly suspected that its importance was far greater than i could imagine i learned that i was royalty by some measure and therefore if lucius and narcissa were to be unable to rule without having had an heir after i had come of age i could take the throne remembering this conversation my scheme began to form i needed a way to rid myself of lucius and narcissa at just the right time the scheme had to be inconspicuous unobtrusive and untraceable back to me it was only when i thought i had come up with the perfect solution that lucius and narcissa announced that she was with child the possibility of killing them all at once while narcissa was still pregnant occurred to me more than once but the idea proved more complicated than i imagined and i found that the best option was to wait until the brat was born he was already causing problems for me draco tonight the apparent heir to throne was born completely healthy and with untainted blood the boy will die as well but not yet first he must suffer i d like to see this prince handle being orphaned i d like to see him face things on his own i can only imagine how the final product so to speak will turn out knowing the kind of treatment he going to receive taking care of himself is something i sure draco will never think he ll have to worry about i despise him already he ruined my plan he in the prophecy although from what i can interpret from the seer who seemed to have enjoyed speaking in riddles draco wontbe much of threat i ve learned that life is unfair and life can be cruel only the strong survive and yet here life gives another example of its cruelty here a boy is born with two powerful parents who will never have to work for the power that he is promised while my family has had to display an exhibition of cunning so extreme just to make it into the castle i have had to charm and lie my way to reach the top but this boy this boy who will never have to lift a finger so long as he shall live he will have such a great amount of power at his fingertips that it sickens me luckily i ll have put his life to an end before he can even so much as touch the throne lucius and narcissa will be quite enjoyable to kill but draco is the real prize i going to have to wait a long time before i can even begin to take action but it ll be worth it just to see him suffer hermione stared blankly at the page as she came to the end of the first entry her hands shaking profusely tom riddle is the one who betrayed them who knows about this diary there were too many thoughts swirling around in her head hermione looked up from the book speechless she didntknow why but she had the distinct feeling that no one in the castle had read this diary before breathing hard and desperately trying to figure out what to do she heard something out in the corridor eyes wide she immediately turned to the door someone was coming back to the room panicking hermione threw herself to the floor and ripped up the floorboard hastily placing the diary back in the hollow she closed it again and jumped onto the bed taking off her shoes and tossing them to the ground only after she was under the sheets she quickly turned away from the door as she heard them reach the door hermione tried to steady her breathing making it as even as she could but failing her eyes shut tightly as the door behind her opened hermione it was dean are you awake he whispered she didntanswer keeping her eyes tightly shut instead and willing her wild heart to quell dean waited a moment before gently closing the door without another word releasing a fierce sigh of relief hermione waiting another minute lying down to calm herself finally hermione slowly sat up and looked at the floorboard to anyone else it would look the same as it did before hermione came to the castle to anyone else it was just another old floorboard but now she knew and there was something that she knew above all else she d have to read it some more disclaimer this story is based on characters and situations created and owned by jk rowling various publishers including but not limited to bloomsbury books scholastic books and raincoast books and warner bros inc the plot is from disney version of beauty and the beast and any other things specified and i not making any profits from this fic an it been just over five years since i last updated this fic and it only thanks to kite1011 that i even considered the notion of looking back on it my writing style has changed so much i wonder how obvious it will be in the following chapters and oh how i miss my beta irene unfortunately we lost contact shortly after i last updated i would hate to ask anyone else to be my beta after irene stayed with me so faithfully through the first six chapters so please excuse any errors you might find in the following chapters i will try my best to proofread also i was always so appreciative of irene helping me to put this story into the british spellings without her i afraid i ve just grown too accustomed to using the americanized versions so this is the format that the story will use from now on enjoy hermione ron called out as he pushed the door open hearing nothing but its responding creak it strange that she left her door unlocked ron muttered to harry and ginny behind him he stepped inside and paused on the threshold examining the interior i ll check her room ginny announced as she made her way down a corridor to the left hermione she called out tell me you re not still asleep i wonder if she ill harry mused striding into the kitchen she would have sent notice to us somehow ron countered true harry admitted but not unless she didntwant us to sacrifice the party plans to come look after her harry paused but no she would have at least told us not to worry ron glanced at him brows furrowed he had just opened his mouth to say something else to harry when ginny emerged from the hallway her boots tromping quickly on the floor she not here ginny said forcing her voice to stay light she not in her bedroom nor the washroom nor the sitting area she turned to harry looking for an answer and ron followed suit something isntright he thought harry steeled himself and swallowed perhaps she outside he suggested in the chicken coop or tending to the horses maybe she just running a little late with her chores and needs some help she would ve seen us coming up the road ron said quietly his mouth hanging open as his forehead creased in consternation he looked to the back door and sprung toward it without another word yanking it open and bursting into the backyard hermione ron called out as he ran to the coop harry and ginny followed nearly running as they ran to and fro around the property calling out hermione name this is silly ginny said coming to a halt she didntquite seem to believe herself as she said hermione is probably just buying some supplies for the party she may already be on her way there now as we sit around up here like fools she looked to the sky squaring her shoulders and searching the clouds she has to be harry had come to a stop as well ginny whispered where else could she be harry turned to ginny watching the way the wind whipped the flaming locks around her worried face but didntrespond ron came to a stop behind the stables resting his hands on his knees as he worked to calm his ragged breathing i dontunderstand it he whispered everything in order he stood up looking toward the cliff where hermione liked to watch the sunset maybe she really is out in town and i just being sensitive about what happened yesterday he sighed and brushed off some twigs and dust that had fallen onto his shoulders admitting that perhaps they should head into town to see if hermione might have paid a visit to one of the shops just as he was about to round the corner of the stables and head back toward harry and ginny movement from the corner of his eye made him hesitate on edge he swung back around only to find a dark horse trotting through the pasture oi auror way to scare me to death you big goat ron half laughed then suddenly the air escaped from his lungs he stared at the pasture willing his eyes to make auror disappear he didntnotice that harry and ginny had caught sight of ron beyond the stables and ran to join him what auror doing outside ginny asked confused the pasture gate isnteven locked shut harry shoulders grew tense hermione wouldntleave auror out in the night this late in november he said while ron continued to stare fixated on the horse she babies them both too much something happened ron whispered ginny started ron dontjump to conclusions she said though her voice sounded shaky perhaps auror just learned how to jump his stall or open the door or something and hermione doesnteven know he still out here whatever happened we d best put auror back inside harry said as he made his way to the pasture ron followed a look of deep concentration on his face all the while as they lead auror back to the stables the three noticed that the horse was uncharacteristically cooperative and even nuzzled the back of harry head instead of playfully nipping his untamed hair when it came time for auror to enter the stall ginny didnteven have to lure him in with a carrot or oats ron shut the gate and locked it while auror seemed to watch with interest well that odd said harry scratching the back of his head what do you think is up with him ginny shrugged harry looked behind her and asked where did ron go ron ginny turned around i think he went outside and sure enough ron was standing near the gate of the pasture with his hands in his pockets and his face turned grimly toward the forest hermione went into the woods last night he stated plainly when harry and ginny arrived his face betrayed his calm voice i just have this feeling harry and ginny looked at one another perplexed harry opened his mouth to say something but he then felt ginny fingertips on his arm he looked to her and she gently shook her head he turned to ron back once more and then gazed upward at the expanse of trees before him let check the town first harry said at last we ll ask around he looked at ginny who was now examining the forest with trepidation if we cantfigure out where she is from the townspeople then the forest is the first place we ll look ron said nothing but continued to glare at the path among the trees blast said hermione under her breath as she closed the bathroom door behind her she turned her head to the side and listened as parvati and lavendar giggles continued on through the wood at this rate i ll never get another chance to look at that diary hermione had been trying to sneak another peak at the book all afternoon but had not yet been able to find herself alone what with lavendar and parvati barging in to share gossip every ten minutes and blaise and dean constantly checking in on her every so often hermione was sure that she would only have enough time to think of the diary before she was interrupted again with one hand still on the handle she fell against the door resting her head on the molding and trying to get a grip on her swirling thoughts it was tom riddle who made the great betrayal hermione mused as she bit her lip but what happened he was looking for the aid of a witch did he ask her to cast this spell on them hermione turned to the window but mcgonagall said that a gypsy placed the spell over the castle are they the same thing riddle intended to kill the prince not transform him where did all of the people go what happened to the king and queen she bit the inside of her cheek desperately wishing to go back and snatch the diary up from underneath the floorboard what a horrible man hermione whispered thinking of riddle he was against them from the very start and they must never have even suspected she ran a hand through her curly mane knowing with certainly that her dressers would be highly distressed to know that it had already fallen out of the neat bun they had so meticulously created for her the prince must have been devastated she looked up to the ceiling as if she might be able to sense the prince whereabouts and examined the tiles with sad eyes he d be even more devastated if he knew about this diary hermione tensed suddenly worried what if he found out that i had found this evidence and that i was reading all of the traitor dark secrets after that single encounter that we ve shared i doubt he would hesitate to take his anger out on me hermione gripped the door handle even more tightly what do i do she mouthed do i tell blaise or dean even mcgonagall doesntspeak his name she rested her eyelids suddenly exhausted it wontdo them any good to tell anyone about it not yet she told herself quietly it wontchange anything that happened and it will only get me thrown in the dungeons or killed or brutally mauled hermione swallowed and pressed the heels of her palms into her closed eyes no one can protect me here she whispered i have to protect myself she slid her hands to her temples the servants can be as nice to me as they like but they have no control over the prince decisions i still his prisoner here her hands dropped to her sides as the realization finally started to sink in i a prisoner she repeated she felt her body slid down the door and she hit the ground with a dull thud her hands falling limply into her lap her eyes were aimed toward the bathtub but they saw nothing but a hazy mesh of colors she was trapped in that castle regardless of her newfound pleasant acquaintances or the luxury in which she slept it did not matter how seasoned the potatoes were or how free she was to roam about certain areas of the castle for she was a prisoner and just that morning before the diary had distracted her she had been planning to escape how could i have almost forgotten hermione mouthed disbelievingly to herself as she sat crumpled on the bathroom floor i was so captivated by that awful diary that i wasted precious time time i could have used to learn the castle layout she shook her head angry with herself and i never even found the materials for that map she tapped her fingers on the floor tiles i ve been nothing but careless since yesterday with the map with the forest with auror and that when the true weight of her situation came crashing down on her she had no idea what had happened to auror after all that happened in the forest the night before everything that she had done to find him had been in vain and now she was paying for it she desperately hoped that he found his way back to her property but she knew that there would be no way to know for sure until she returned home but why on earth didnti just think like that before and prevent myself from getting into this whole mess auror is capable and intelligent why did i worry so much hermione sighed even as she berated herself she knew that she would never have been able to allow auror to go into the forest abyss without some attempt on her part to bring him home he meant too much to her she laughed mirthlessly and asked do you know what you re doing to me auror she scoffed and continued i just hope that someone finds you when you bring your sorry hide home and has the patience to lure you into the stables ron ron and ginny and harry her hands quickly rose to her mouth but whether it was an attempt to contain her gasp or to help prevent herself from vomiting she wasntsure suddenly her stomach was raging in knots and her head felt light they would come looking for her she realized once again what would they think when she was nowhere to be found oh ron she breathed what will you what will you she held her head in her hands and felt her tears brimming at the corners of her eyes what if i dontfind a way to make it out of here in time what if the bank collectors take away my home and auror and ronan are sold and the weasleys pronounce me dead and hermione gripped the hem of her dress inhaling deeply and shutting her eyes against her thoughts she couldntthink like that not now or she would surely break down and draw suspicion she was surely growing all the more conspicuous now as she sat in the bathroom whispering to herself for goodness knew how long hermione was suddenly grateful for the ladies idle chatter and knew that it was the only reason she had not been checked on as of yet get a hold of yourself hermione she breathed deeply and gently dabbed at her eyes checking to see that no tears had escaped gently she pulled herself up to the mirror where she inspected the damage bracing herself with the sink she took yet another few calming breaths and focused on acting out her cheerful demeanor once she returned among the servants staring at the mirror hermione drew herself up to her full stature and swallowed i will not waste anymore time thinking on this diary or this traitor or this prince she looked to the door and noticed that the prattling had grown louder i want to help my new friends but my true friends need me more she turned back to the mirror i need to escape and from now on that will be my full focus there will be plenty of time to unravel later while in ron loving embrace hermione bit her lips as the voice from the back of her mind suddenly mocked her she had forgotten about ron proposal and she had no idea from where this awkward reminder had sprouted what would she say to him when she returned miss granger she heard lavender call from the other room are you all right there will be time to figure that out later hermione nodded decisively it wontmatter what my feelings are for ron if i never make it out of this castle without further delay hermione made her way into the bedroom managing a genuine smile as she entered i fine hermione said with as much pleasant conviction as she could muster and please i asked you to call me hermione she stopped once she saw the gathering that was taking place on top of her comforter what going on she looked around at the assorted bureaus and other objects huddled about her bed all seeming to bubble with excitement lavender was beaming well parvati started suggestively it looks like you re in for a lovely surprise what do you mean hermione cocked an eyebrow looking curiously from object to object she tried to stifle the sliver of anxiety that began creeping back into her thoughts hermione lavender began literally teetering with excitement her drawers began rocking in and out of their sockets as she danced around the floor you ve been invited to dine with the master tonight hermione looked to the others who were all awaiting her reaction with starved looks hermione paused taking a moment to register this news then smiled broadly and asked oh is that so before she knew it the ladies on her bedspread had begun bombarding her wardrobe plans hairstyle suggestions and tips on how to soothe the master ego hermione nodded appropriately in all the right places but used this time as an opportunity to organize her thoughts she would escape tonight an also i must have forgotten to credit cynthia heimel for her quote in the previous chapter i love this saying and i wanted to incorporate it into the story somehow for some reason when in doubt make a fool of yourself there is a microscopically thin line between being brilliantly creative and acting like the most gigantic idiot on earth so what the hell leap looking back on it now it really wasntrelevant but it meant a lot to me and so i had blaise use it i also dontknow what on earth i was thinking with that prophecy i know it made sense to me five years ago but now i cantmake heads or tails of it so i went back and cut it out i ll try to rectify this in upcoming chapters as well this chapter is obviously much shorter than the previous chapters i dontknow if this will be the case from here on out but i ve learned from experience over the past few years that pulling out smaller portions of writing is much easier to manage than forcing myself to produce huge bouts of writing one at a time it helps to keep myself motivated and as i dearly want this story to eventually be finished it quite possible that this may happen please let me know what you think it been a long time since i ve really gotten into this fic and any suggestions or comments would be greatly appreciated disclaimer this story is based on characters and situations created and owned by jk rowling various publishers including but not limited to bloomsbury books scholastic books and raincoast books and warner bros inc the plot is from disney version of beauty and the beast and any other things specified and i not making any profits from this fic an i still cantget over how much my writing style has changed since chapter 6 it unbelievable what five years and lots of practice can do i cantbelieve how parenthesis crazy i was especially my writing has definitely improved and i excited to get back into this story please take a moment after you finish to drop your thoughts in a review thanks this is stupid draco huffed mcgonagall swore she nearly saw smoke dispersing from his nostrils enough draco snape drawled from his spot on the ledge above the hearth we ve already discussed this mealtimes are perfect opportunities to make acquaintances and i need not remind you how desperately we need to learn more about this individual in particular draco paced back and forth on the rug wildly growling deep and low the more you see her the better our chances mcgonagall said sternly looking at him over the rims of her glasses her no nonsense attitude was set even more firmly in place after the previous night happenings and dean sent both her and sir snape a wary glance from his spot further down the ledge unused to being so close to so many authoritative figures of the castle all at once dean was especially mindful of his behavior blaise dean pleaded mentally just hurry up and bring hermione down already dean knew from countless stories from the servant quarters that the master was always testy but dean hoped that he would not have to witness his wrath firsthand dean mcgonagall cut through his thoughts i asked you how your progress was going with miss granger has blaise been doing his part even through the firelight dean could see madam mcgonagall threaded brow rise dean turned to sir snape with a start only to find him waiting impatiently and to the master who had paused his stalking about the carpet and seared him with a scowl dean gulped uh yes dean started yes madam blaise and i have spent most of the day with her we ve mostly been introducing her to castle life and allowing her to rest but we do believe we have been making a favorable impression upon her dean almost wanted to mention that hermione seemed to be a pleasantly decent girl but felt his bristles rise on end under the prince gaze and decided against it good mcgonagall stated briskly and what of the master have you mentioned anything of him draco eyed dean suspiciously and dean gulped once more not as of yet madam dean said nervously as prince draco began to growl but we know for a fact that the ladies upstairs kept her busy with talk of prince draco since the announcement of the dinner invitation was made this afternoon his eyes shifted to the master and back to madam mcgonagall feeling his nerves grow no calmer he added though blaise and i do intend to have a conversation tomorrow about the progression of tonight events and use that time to form an admirable impression on her of the master indeed sir snape said silkily sharing a glance with madam mcgonagall draco the castle is doing all that they can to assist you in this predicament and are willing to go to great lengths to ensure your success he stared at the creature below pointedly please remember that while she is in your presence draco snarled biting the air to release his frustration donti have any say in this no mcgonagall and snape replied in unison draco shook his head huffing out another bout of air midas draco roared midas what taking this girl so long you sent midas on an errand your majesty snape reminded him dean thought he sounded bored and looked nervously to the prince for his reaction it was no secret that sir snape had a certain influence over the master but it was unsettling for dean to observe it directly dean was sure that prince draco could lash out at any moment and make him into nothing more than pewter bits or do you not recall that you sent him to check the perimeter of the castle grounds draco turned away sharply then who supposed to be bringing her to me mr blaise zabini will be escorting miss granger sir snape responded with the same languid tone i dontknow who that is draco snapped he one of your servants madam mcgonagall countered he and mr dean thomas she gestured with the tip of her hat to the paintbrush who was now shaking imperceptibly in his bristles were the first to introduce themselves and she has attached herself to them quite easily they are now to be her main guides through the castle and your main liaisons to courting her dean thought he saw the master flinch but couldntbe sure and this blaise servant draco ground out through his jagged teeth would be where en route to this dining room mcgonagall replied patiently that is sir snape interjected sardonically unless you ve scared her away entirely with your behavior from last night draco rounded on the cauldron with a warning growl and had opened his long snout to spit something back at his mentor when a knock sounded on the door the room grew silent and all eyes immediately turned to the entryway prince draco scanned the open doorway searching for the peasant muddy scent but saw a lone candlestick instead his eyes narrowed good evening blaise madam mcgonagall said slowly looking at the empty space behind him ah good evening your highness blaise bowed so deeply that his flame brushed the carpet with a slight sputter blaise hastily raised himself up and tried to ignore the slightly singed threads that he had burnt he cleared his throat as if perhaps in an attempt to regain his dignity and waited to be addressed further fidgeting nervously with his wick draco was already impatient enough well well blaise swallowed when i arrived at miss hermione granger room this evening to retrieve her blaise inhaled deeply and in one rapid breath he released shewasnotthere he froze i beg your pardon madam mcgonagall breathed surely you mean to say that she was elsewhere in the castle blaise shifted his gaze to horror struck dean and then back to mcgonagall whose point was rising so taut it was nearly ripping the fabric no madam blaise said levelly blaise bowed in draco direction once more less deeply this time she gone snape mcgonagall and dean turned to the master at once prepared and yet not prepared for the ferocious roar that cut its way from draco throat dean cowered back against the wall and blaise jumped into the shadows of the door frame both panting wildly mcgonagall and snape called after draco as he rose up onto his hind legs and snarled at the window midas draco summoned the owl through his howl next thing dean knew snape and mcgonagall were shouting at prince draco all at once warning him to stay in control pleading with him to listen to reason urging him to stave off his impetuousness for one moment and think before acting and suddenly midas swooped in through the open cavity at the window highest point dean wasntsure if the master would actually ever harm the owl but he was still glad that midas hovered in the air out of the master reach find her draco snarled terribly his lips reaching so far back that his black gums could be clearly seen underneath immediately i want to know her exact location draco whirled around to face mcgonagall and snape alert the entire castle i doubt she been able to make it out of the castle stand guards at every existing exit i want this peasant found now with one last inhale and another glance among the two head figures mcgonagall was off she sprung herself from the ledge letting the air carry her down gently before she scrambled to door come out of here this instant mr zabini and move yes ma am snape was waiting for further instruction while draco ran back and forth conjuring claw marks in the upholstery of the seats and of course dean thought tiredly we ll be the ones sewing that up snape draco shouted startling dean snape didntbother to flinch i expect to be notified immediately upon her capture do not make me wait yes sire snape bowed as much as his form would allow and then he too dispatched himself from the ledge dean quite unsure as to what he should be doing as well followed snape lead you the brush draco snarled and dean swore he might have splintered into two yes your highness go back to her room and keep watch yes your majesty and be quick fool and with that dean scurried from the room snape paused at the doorway considered something for a moment and then disappeared into the shadows draco looked after him for a moment still breathing heavily he looked around noticing with disdain that he was alone again always he thought venomously but it better this way his breathing had calmed slightly but his heart was still beating madly he would never grow accustomed to this unfamiliar body or to these exaggerated organs but he knew the power of his strength and had learned to hone his senses enough to prove useful sniffing the air he searched for the one scent he least wanted to find and emitted a low growl once it was traceable crouching low draco sprung himself toward the window tearing apart the metal latch and launching himself onto the snow covered roof top of the closest tower from this vantage point he could only see trees for miles he sniffed the air again feeling the snow permeate his fur and the icy wind bite into his skin his glassy gray eyes needed no adjustment with the brightness of the snow but his nose was thrown off by the thrashing winds you can run little girl he growled but it turned into malicious laughter you can try oh god hermione tried to swallow through her wild panting she had just made it past the first line of trees when she heard a blood curdling roar from deep within one of the higher peaks of the castle hermione felt her knees go weak and she nearly fell into the deep blanket of snow but she latched onto the trunk of a tree for support and used it to propel herself onward without a second thought the castle was simply one giant maelstrom of utter chaos servants were checking every room every closet every corridor imaginable some were trying to be more discreet so as not to push miss granger further into hiding while others had thrown all caution to the wind to call after her as they ran about aimlessly blaise swung from window to window staring deeply into the forest what re you doing mate dean asked incredulously she could be anywhere stop staring out the window and help us already she already in the forest blaise said simply dean stepped back what look blaise said quietly as he gently tapped one of the lower segments of the window it opened willingly and dean merely stared we re on the first floor not more then ten feet from the ground what do you want to bet she slipped out one of these and tried to climb down damn dean breathed still staring at the window with disbelief blaised peered through the opening she out there if she got a good enough start she may just make it back to her village before the master catches on and realizes that he underestimated her if she didn t well blaise turned back to look at dean who swallowed let just hope she did that the last of them a man in a rough dark coat shouted from across the clearing ready your horses men ron tightened his grip on the reigns leaning farther into his saddle he could see the horse breath spurting out in waves of steam and ron ignored the cold that was seeping into his fingers he gave the horse a pat and stared intently at the opening in the forest we re coming hermione ron breathed feeling the hair on his skin prickling in a way he had never experienced before i coming a lantern for each another man was shouting out orders while some of the women from town brought flaming torches and lanterns to each of the thirty men assembled on horseback at the borders of hermione property the man continued throwing out demands but ron didnthear ginny approached him and handed him his lantern good luck she said softly holding onto the lantern for a moment longer than was necessary and take good care of ronan ron nodded i will ginny turned back to share one more parting glance with harry seated atop of another horse of the weasley family and ran back to the group of onlooking townspeople and above all else men stay together the man roared his voice over the crowd and at last shouted hyah ron gave ronan the signal and he sped off into the trail the sound of the horses pounding hooves deafening in his ears hermione whole body burned but she couldntstop running her lungs had lost the capacity for full precious breaths long ago and her muscles were protesting loudly she had no idea if this path looked familiar or if she was any closer to her home than she was when she first dove into the forest but her body had no intention of responding to whatever logic her mind might propose she was an animal the prey currently being hunted and through the raging tangle of incomplete thoughts racing through her mind hermione only goal was to flee only a little farther hermione mind screamed but how could she know that she couldnthave been running for very long and her home couldnthave been so close if anything she was only barely halfway through the forest just a little more her mind kept screaming hermione tried to be on the alert for strange sounds or sights among the trees for signs of animals lurking about but could barely hear anything over the sound of her own heart drumming every so often she swore she saw a shadow from something moving above but she only dared look up on one occasion and had seen nothing further she tripped on a lone root and landed in a patch of ice the wind was only knocked out of her for a second but hermione head felt light and dizzy as she rose she pressed onward fighting the feeling in her head and the sensations in her legs and ran toward the continued darkness of the path how did i get here hermione asked suddenly i slid myself out of a window near one of the servants quarters or am i hallucinating that the skin at her knees and the heels of her palms suddenly felt tight from where she had fallen on them to brace herself from the impact of fall once she could not climb the rest of the way down they prickled dotted with sharp pebbles and ice no doubt but hermione only ran faster she was only just beginning to realize how luck she had been to have escaped from the castle ground with such ease he truly had not thought her capable thank you fates hermione barely managed to breathe out as she hurdled over an overgrown root her foot caught ice and she sprawled out in the snow once more as she tore herself upward she knew that she should not be thanking anything just yet damn you girl draco crouched among the trees sniffing madly in all directions he growled loudly and lashed his arm backwards toward a tree leaving terrible crevasses in the bark draco doubled back prepared to return to the entryway and start anew when a fortuitous breeze blew a particular scent his way an awful smile spread across draco features and he nearly cackled as he veered toward the left deeper into the forest you stupid peasant draco spoke with the wind you re lost hermione couldntrun any longer her head was still whirling and her throat was ragged and hermione only paused when she needed to spit out the coppery taste of blood in her mouth but her whole body was begging to stop please please only a little further the wind was pulling at her face and her hair invoking tears that merely freeze along her temples only a little more there was that movement again with a cry hermione pushed herself forward even faster determined not to look up for even a second her skin was prickling with the ice and fear but she pushed on and on the movement appeared again and hermione lungs nearly caved in upon themselves she gasped but there was no air to take in she fell to the ground directly into a large mountain of soft snow but the crystals only prickled her skin seeping into her clothes and chilling her spine as the melted along her ever cooling skin she coughed horribly placing a hand in the snow to push herself up and keep running but her arm gave way to fatigue and she laid trapped in the snow unable to get up eyes wide with fear she tried to calm her breathing but only succeeded in making herself more frantic from the unfamiliar silence in the absence of the wind rushing past her ears she tried once more to stand and ever so unsteadily she rose up with the help of tree branch clutching onto it for support hermione looked ahead of her what is that noise she thought hazily it sounded like hooves beating against the earth many of them you fool she told herself it just the echo of your heartbeat in your ears run you idiot and hermione meant to she even took one hand off of the branch to start her journey when she gazed through the trees and saw just ten yards in front of her were two glowing gray eyes the breath of air she had been about to take never came instead she waited immobile and unable to look away for an imminent attack the pounding grew louder hermione shut her eyes for but a second but the attack never came instead there was a cry of pain and the pounding grew louder still afraid to peek hermione hesitated she opened her eyes quickly and snapped her head to the spot where she had seen that creature that not my heart hermione realized those are hooves hermione precariously let go of her branch and took a step closer to the area sensing that something had happened to the animal what if they can help me hermione asked herself feeling her lightheaded throbbing return she nearly smiled but then it turned dark what if they won t from the sound of the hooves they were still quite a distance away seemingly circling a piece of land and looking for something i have to take my chances hermione thought touching her head this may be my only opportunity to escape even if i only trading one devil for another i need to midas hermione looked up there he was flapping just over her head midas please donttell please dontlet anyone know where but before she could finish her sentence midas had already flown off into the trees to where she thought she had seen the creature she could see his white wings flapping madly in the wind as he hovered there hermione could now hear voices being carried through the wind speaking of a great animal without thinking hermione rushed toward midas and examined what was at his feet gasping once the true realization hit her there in the clearing was the creature who had trapped her in the castle injured she could not see the wound but the stench of blood was so overpowering that it nearly sent her backward her hand rushed to her nose to cover the smell but to no avail midas was thrashing wildly in the wind circling his master fiercely hermione looked up to the wayward path ahead of her and could vaguely see lanterns bobbing among the darkness hermione looked down at the creature at her feet then to the owl above him and without knowing how or why her mind suddenly came to the conclusion it did hermione grabbed the nape of the cloak the creature was wearing and used the ice below them to drag him into the seclusion of the bushes just two yards away i ll wait until they come to investigate and just when they start to turn back i ll call out and ask for help so as not to startle them hermione reasoned through her dizziness whatever mental clarity she had regained from the additional spurt of adrenaline was being clouded by the pool of blood that was now seeping into her clothes midas was hovering about his master shoulder looking at the wound this way and that hermione tried hard not to breathe and tried even harder not to think about what the beast might have done to her had he been conscious focusing on waiting for the men to finish the final leg of their path to the clearing at last three men on horseback appeared through the trees scanning the earth for a corpse did you see the size of that thing the first asked couldnthave been any normal breed said another wherever it is it badly wounded no doubt those bullets were made of the finest silver ammunition so that thing no doubt in pain hermione gasped looking to the prince shoulder silver she did not know much about the prince history nor this spell but she knew enough about werewolf folklore to understand that this supposed bullet was probably much more powerful on this particular creature than they realized by the time she looked back to the three men they were finishing their conversation no use in searching for it we ve got more important things to look for keep an eye out as we head back but dontbreak off alone the third one signaled for the others to follow and they headed off their beacons of light flowing with them wait hermione whispered extending a hand after them she opened her mouth to call out to stop them but couldnthelp but look back down at the bleeding figure in the snow her eyes had yet to readjust to the new darkness but she could sense that the blood was leaving quickly she looked to midas i dontknow if you can understand me she said her throat thick but i suppose that with everything else i ve seen it wouldntbe too crazy to assume would it the owl shook its head earnestly hermioned tried to swallow her mind reeling once more midas i need you to go get help i going to try to run and catch up with those men but not until i know that someone is taking him back to the castle understand hermione looked deep into the owl round eyes now go with a flurry of feathers midas was gone and all that was left was hermione and the bloodied prince sitting in the snow hermione stared at at the wound and watched the prince labored breathing but was suddenly afraid to move any further what if he suddenly woke up what if he lashed out in his consciousness what if he died out here in the forest anyway and she had just given up her only real chance at aid for naught she pressed her palms into her temples forcing down the cry that was begging to escape her throat her hands felt sticky and once she looked down at them she nearly vomited you re dying she told the prince as she took in the sight of her hands drenched in his blood she paused for but a moment more and then without further hesitation stood and continued to drag the prince little by little through the forest over the smoothest patches of snow and ice with her makeshift sled what am i doing she thought disbelievingly releasing labored grunts as she hit a stubborn root and hoping that she wasntdisturbing his wound too much you were going to kill me earlier werentyou her fingers were freezing and her lips were cracking from the wind why do you even deserve any of this hermione paused to look down at the body wondering what on earth possessed her to suddenly want to help the one creature she had just spent the last day and a half plotting to escape from as she looked at the creature in the snow before her however and at the slow pitiful movements of the breath within his ribcage and the limpness of his paws hermione knew that she couldnthave left him if she had tried i wouldntleave you to suffer at the hands of strange men she told him nor would i allow anyone to find out about your subjects secrets she resumed dragging him along slowly bit by bit but dontyou worry she whispered i ll still have my escape hermione wouldntremember being carried back into the castle or being stripped of her clothes and being plunged into a warm bath lavender and parvati would be the ones to fill her in on most of these details later hermione would remember however that when she was introduced to this supposed warm bath the water only felt like daggers of ice blaise would told her later that he could hear her screaming from across the castle but for some reason she wouldntbe able to remember that either stop hermione demanded i need to see him give me clothes she tried to pull herself over the side of the tub but the bath servants prodded her back inside hoping to warm her further hermione tried again managing to overpower the smaller objects this time and instinctively grabbed a towel to spurn her shivering defeated the servants begged and pleaded but gave her dry nightclothes to put on anyway which she readily threw on without so much as a preamble she marched through the doors of her room a crowd of servants in her midst and demanded that she be taken to him i afraid she might be delusional one of the servants whispered worriedly from behind the color is returning to her skin but she needs rest another servant lead the way to a room on one of the lower floors there hermione saw him laid on a large mat on the floor by the fire he too was covered in blankets but was breathing with even more difficulty than before and the fabrics were seeping with so much blood hermione stilled suddenly unsure if she should continue go on a figure said from by the fire hermione could see that it was madam mcgonagall go on child hermione approached slowly now aware that there were countless servants in the room watching her what had i even been planning on doing hermione shook her head and tried to clear away her thoughts as she knelt over him you silly girl start using your head do you have a blade hermione turned to the servants questioning no one came forward immediately but soon enough a kitchen maid in the shape of a soup pot came from the corner to lend hermione one of her knives am i really going to do this but as soon as the blade touched her hand her decision was final with one last look at the prince pained face and a silent plea to something hermione positioned the tip of the blade at the entry point of the bullet in one single movement she plunged the blade deeper into the flesh ignored the wail she had emitted from the creature and curved the blade upward so that she could feel the bullet dislodging as she pressed the handle down as a lever hermione had slunk back against the wall before she even heard the silver bullet drop to the floor and the servants cried out in terror as their master attempted to gain his footing his half lidded eyes and his twitching claws frightened hermione he stared at her but he seemed to see nothing at first and attempted to move closer to where she was standing hermione slid farther along the wall trying desperately not to back herself into a corner but failing and keeping alert eyes on her once again predator the servants in the room screeched and moved about frantically all moving to and fro without any sense of where was safe hermione she looked up to see that the voice who had called out was now at her feet blaise my dear perhaps you should find a way out of that corner too late now she whispered in a matter of seconds the prince had regained his senses he stood slowly as if cautious of damaging any progress and used his hind legs to bring himself to his full stature blaise unconsciously backed up into hermione legs but neither of them noticed at nearly seven feet tall draco was at his most frightening and he used it to his advantage he stared down his long nose at the commoner in the corner emitting a rumbling growl from the deepest part of his throat blaise gulped and hermione tried to look away you should be more careful with where your filthy hands are peasant draco spat hermione stared at him disbelievingly if i wanted your filth to touch me then i would have gone down to your disgusting village and run among your people long ago hermione wasntsure if it was due to the fatigue to the near hypothermia or possibly due to incessant and seemingly impossible conversations with inanimate objects but hermione had finally had enough i beg your pardon at first a whisper was all that her torn throat could manage draco who had already been making his way to the door to retire for the evening paused and looked back at hermione corner incredulously the servants all took one subtle step back i just saved your life hermione thrust a finger out to point at the mountain blood soaked make shift bandages draco couldntquite seem to comprehend what was happening at first but once the situation registered his face curled into a snarling grimace all over again what are you talking about draco growled hermione huffed incredulous did you think that was any ordinary bullet that those men put inside you the room looked to the blooded chunk of metal by the fire it was silver you d be dead right now if it werentfor me draco shifted his angry gaze back to hermione who inhaled sharply at the movement but managed not to flinch as roughly as before how dare you draco spat do you have any idea who you are you would have died hermione insisted if you would have preferred that i keep my filthy bumpkin hands to myself despite my ability in removing a chunk of silver from your torn flesh then by all means please make your foolishness known draco snarled coming within feet of where hermione was standing but her adrenaline was already sending fresh waves of chemicals into her muscles and she was feeling so much stronger than she had in the forest here she was still prey and just as likely to receive pain but now she was armed with her words which had always been her favorite weapons you insolent wench draco spat his eyes searing into hermione face you dare challenge me in my castle in front of my subjects i am merely reminding that not five minutes ago you were near death hermione face began to burn and her voice strengthened i remove the object which would have been your demise and you insult me is this the appropriate behavior to display royal gratitude if only i could be graced with such manners in all of life occasions draco roared even more loudly stepping closer to hermione in warning blaise was nearly setting the wallpaper on fire but he was too busy staring up at hermione in amazement much like the rest of the servants in the room you dare mock me draco sneered let me remind you that you are not free in this castle you are a prisoner and an incredibly stupid one at that hermione glared at him her eyes scorching with hatred you were already free and yet you naively returned draco laughed mirthlessly what did you think that after your little act of charity that i might show mercy and release you the malicious smile fell you disobeyed direct orders and further made a mockery of my authority draco tilted his long head to the side and crouched low i should kill you hermione didntrespond immediately and first took in the fullness of the room there were servants from all corners of the castle there after three years after so much had changed was no on really brave enough to stand up to their master he was no longer their prince he was a spoiled wolfbrat too juiced up on his parents remaining power and he needed to be taught a lesson she knew it she was probably going to regret this in the morning i had every right to try to escape hermioen said levelly her voice was low but it contained twice the venom i was foolish tonight and on two separate occasions took great care in saving your life not because i was hoping for my freedom in exchange i could have taken that easily once you were wounded but because for some inexplicable reason i had enough kindness in my heart to relinquish my freedom in order to make sure the lives and secrets of both you and my new friends were safe and further that i took the liberty of removing the bullet from your flesh you should be grateful for both her eyes narrowed into slits you can do whatever you like and you can say whatever you want as i sure you have for countless years but you ll learn very quickly with me your highness that commands and threats will only get you so far and for reasons unknown to hermione she took a step forward she was but an inch away from his snout and facing him eye to eye throw me in the dungeons if you like but a simple title and set of teeth will not be enough to elicit my respect there was utter silence draco didnteven growl he glared at hermione with such force that she was sure he would break free from his silence at any moment and lash out it took all of her concentration but she stared back unflinchingly what have i just done and just as suddenly draco laughed hermione eyed him carefully immediately getting the impression that laughter was more dangerous in the prince than was his snarling she didntlike it one bit all right then draco responded low and dangerous try the dungeons why dontyou maybe you ll learn that impertinence and insolence only go so far with me still staring intently at hermione seething expression he snapped to blaise at her feet escort her downstairs i have more important things to attend to blaise started to move when draco warned i will know if she is taken elsewhere so it best that you follow my orders he sent such a warning scowl to blaise that his wick literally melted his candle about a half an inch hermione gasped in anger watching his back as he left the room in shocked silence her brows furrowing in indignation oh and girl draco paused at the threshold be aware that your next attempt at escaping wontbe so easy and with that the door slammed and hermione energy suddenly gave way she collapsed to her knees supporting her head with her hands servants rushed to her aid on every side i should have left him in that forest to his own devices so why didnti disclaimer this story is based

straight this story is certainly writing itself with ease now it just a matter of transcribing all that into chapters for all of our sakes i think i ll forgo my incredibly long chapter habit and keep to the shorter chapters instead thank you so much for your patience and support you poor dear you ll fall ill if you go down to the dungeons now why you re not even fully dry yet surely the master will make an exception someone needs to talk to him where mcgonagall no hermione said slowly rising to her feet you ll all be punished if i go anywhere else i ve already done too many careless things tonight and i wontallow any of you to suffer for my mistakes but miss granger it hermione she corrected and please let just go before he comes to check on any of you hermione this is madness blaise argued he looked to hermione determined exhausted face and gave a quick defeated nod we ll make sure to equip the dungeons at least madam mcgonagall appeared from the side straightening her brim she turned about and started shouting orders to the other servants to bring blankets and warmer clothes he can put you down there but he wontbother to check on your comfort level blaise explained he rarely ever goes down to the lower floors himself that right madam mcgonagall said briskly and what he wontknow wonthurt him thank you hermione said staring at the objects at her feet i dontknow how i can dontworry yourself about it hermione said another servant just stay warm and we ll be down to visit when we can hermione watched the servants move about the room with a newfound sense of organization as blaise and mcgonagall escorted her farther and farther down into the depths of the castle she couldnthelp but wonder what the rotten prince was doing in the floors above she could hear him before he even rounded the corner in the hallway mindless brazen out of line the door still so precariously balanced on its single abused hinge finally gave way to its ceaseless torment and fell in defeat with a crash as the prince plowed through the entrance draco what wrong an impudent senseless insignificant draco insubordinate rural trash draco and finding no other word sufficiently adequate for his cause draco emitted a mind shattering roar when pansy removed her hands from her ears all she saw was his shuddering body half encased in shadow in the middle of the room trembling with rage what did that girl do draco are you all right does it look like i all right draco spat his vocal chords were still affected by the sounds that had ripped through his throat just moments before and his voice was perforated with the rumblings of a primitive warning growl stupid pansy thought to herself as she watched him rake his claws through an already torn curtain why ask questions you already know the answer to just say something worthwhile for once draco pansy started reaching to him through the glass pane i didntsee what happened you need to tell me what did she do what did she what she did draco clawed his way through another set of upholstery pansy waited knowing that he would provide further explanation once he calmed himself it took patience and by the time draco had returned to a more controlled state as well as dissected a great number of throw pillows the moonbeams had already begun to withdraw from the window what did she say for all her knowledge and intuition pansy could not bear to wait any longer draco seethed in place she insulted me draco hissed curling his claws in front of the others when i showed her mercy after she d touched me she d touched him she she what pansy eyes bulged so she dead draco snapped his head toward the mirror she in the dungeons draco scowl became more pronounced as paced the room so pansy said trying to follow the story she in the dungeons while she awaits her sentence no draco huffed his breath visible in the cold of the room she learning a lesson in the dungeons she all but offered the idea herself my pansy remarked she is rather an idiot if she told you to put her there draco appeared unsettled by this statement but she continued did she think it would be more fitting to keep her accommodations here in the castle familiar to that of her own on the other side of the forest he scoffed she a fool she thought she was standing up to me after what had happened and she thought that by showing a small display of force i might taker her earlier words into consideration draco laughed mirthlessly at the thought but this caused pansy concern to prickle the back of her neck what earlier words idle chatter about gratitude draco huffed again she made the pitiful mistake of ostentatiously trying to transport my body back to the castle after i d been shot down by what a rag tag troop of wayward gun happy farmers no doubt i would have been fine and the stupid girl would have had the perfect opportunity to flee but she insisted that midas return for aid while draco you were injured pans enough i fine draco sent her a look of annoyance which only translated into a primitive rage when sprawled out across his features the bullet would have dislodged eventually she didntneed to go sticking a knife in me all of a sudden pansy laughed derisively and draco looked at her in surprise how barbaric pansy snickered i wonder if she often carries a blade on her person for just such occasions draco shifted his gaze elsewhere possible he muttered but i still dontunderstand the whole story pansy whispered as her brows knitted together you told her she was your prisoner so she tried to escape but then you were wounded while hunting her down and then she tried to save you her captor and then she tried to make you grateful but you weren t so she insulted you and you threw her in the dungeons draco faltered pansy it not like what you just said he advanced toward the mirror gesturing to the doorway constrained she undermined my authority by escaping so she did escape pansy nodded but how draco steeled himself i underestimated her he said with finality shifting uncomfortably it wonthappen again so she not as dumb as you thought hardly i should just know better than to leave doors and windows open when holding a prisoner draco shook his head and collapsed into his nest i can just hear my father voice now pansy looked out to him and felt her heart squeeze draco it not your fault she pushed it not as if you ve held a prisoner before how were we supposed to know what she would be capable of draco glared this entire predicament is impossible he spit out and she could hear the young boy in him once more it almost made her smile to see him so like him old self after all that had just happened of course it feels impossible pansy said softly you re not meant to hold prisoners draco it not you finally she thought she had something consoling for once but instead draco eyes narrowed and his brows creased then what am i doing pans she hesitated feeling her breath hitch in her throat what was she supposed to say well just think of what your father would say you re the prince and this simple commoner disobeyed your orders and escaped it is all within your right to hold her captive the whole act goes against your nature but it what you re supposed to do and you re doing it she smiled softly think of the boundaries she crossed when she t touched you think of the message she sent to the whole castle when she questioned your authority this is what needs to happen suddenly draco didntlook so sure about the whole situation anymore and pansy felt with desperation that he was gradually slipping away from her but for saving my life pans he whispered stupid bint she may be but he shook his head unable to finish her actions were inexcusable she persisted your reaction was warranted and you acted according to the station of a malfoy prince draco remained quiet for a few eternal moments my father had always warned me to keep my emotions in control he said with heaviness proper malfoy heirs do not invite the outside world to know their thoughts to witness their feelings he turned his head away i am not the son i should be draco dontbe ridiculous pansy pleaded if anyone would be proud tonight of how you handled that silly peasant girl it would be them draco sat with the silence once more pondering something beyond pansy reach draco what is it he didntanswer at first i still dontremember her name he stated simply looking to the window you donthave to have a name to get what you deserve pansy said feeling frustrated with this confusion separating them if only she could know what he was thinking the fate of this kingdom he began the fate of my kingdom or what little i have left of it is resting on my shoulders and i already screwing it up just like i ve done with everything else draco that not true she pressed herself against the glass you are a good royal with a good heart then what did i just do pansy he snapped if i had been that girl i would have gotten myself out of here just as fast only i would have left me in the snow she was free but she came back to prevent the soldiers from finding us and what do i actually do i throw her in the dungeons you have feelings for her pansy said stunned dontbe ridiculous he said with a snarl he looked as if he might retch she is an ugly creature disobedient and self righteous and twice as stubborn i have to see a single admirable quality within her even that quality which saved us tonight her naivete is a weakness and a disgraceful trait that only he cut off but pansy knew what he was going to say that only reminds me of myself so what now pansy asked now draco said i have to get her out of the dungeons i ll release her in the morning in the morning pansy repeated slowly but i thought you just said that i know what i said pansy draco interrupted but she still needs to be taught a lesson i am the prince of this castle and if she thinks she can just waltz in and take over then she has another thing coming and with a flourish of billowing curtains as draco retreated through the glass door to the outside balcony pansy knew that she had been dismissed
