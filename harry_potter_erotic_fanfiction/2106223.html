 hey for all of you who dontread the author note yes i know i sooooo boring i put a challenge at the very end which most of you were too lazy to read so here it is again in the letter from snape from last chapter there a special messiage to be revealed in the next chapter i am not a matermind code writer so it short and really simple to find anyone who gets it right gets a virtual cookie ummm chocalate chip his lips were now perilously close to her face she could feel his breathing maybe as a child this would have made her knees go weak but now she was only capable of one emotion fear raw burning fear tom yes ginny dear leave me alone i mean it she had lost the frailness that had been evident only a moment before in its place was a quiet confidence much to her offense tom merely laughed you re never alone miss weasley mr malfoy she groggily shook her head hmmm the nurse put her hands on her hips and tried to give them a look of disappointment failing miserable she gave up the guise and smiled is it really so boring here both of my pupils asleep ginny looked over at draco who certainly didntlook like he had just woken up madame pomfrey laughed you two may go now i dontthink anyone else will come in tonight thank you goodnight madame pomfrey ginny said distracted goodnight dears and good luck excuse me with the quidditch game of course the first match is tomorrow how could she have forgotten thank you you know the quidditch schedule draco asked why of course matches are always the busiest nights horrid sport if you ask me broken necks fractures sprained wrist thanks for that lovely bit of encouragement she glared at him for a moment as if decided whether he was mocking her or genuinely grateful his face was completely emotionless in the end she just smiled and said goodnight between the sound of the pouring rain harry encouragement and the weight of her quidditch uniform it was hard to be nervous she had always loved the rain it had something of a romantic value to it normally ginny would have reveled at the chance to be outside in a storm such as this but for playing quidditch however it was not the best conditions not at all as if insulted by her thoughts a large bolt of lightning snaked across the sky she shrugged off the rain and began to stretch harry pep talk bet that slytherin scum or i ll have you doing drills until you cantfeel your feet had finally ended and ron appeared beside her you ll be fine ron easy for you to say relax ginny pull that hair back will ya her normally bouncing curls had soaked straight through and were reduced to a dripping mess still she stubbornly refused to pull it back she hadntput her hair in a ponytail in nearly three years there was no reason to start now hermione in the stands great i think i going to be sick ginny mount up it was harry this time she nodded lee voice boomed through the stadium announcing slytherin after a few moments of cheers or booing from the rest of the school jordan voice called out gryffindor and they all flew out to meet the crowd unlike ron she had never had a problem with crowds on the contrary she enjoyed the cheering beside her ron was gagging she briefly heard lee voice call out her name before all noise was drowned out there was only the quaffle and the goal now nothing else mattered below her madam hooch blew the whistle and the game begun the rain was pouring down so hard now she could hardly see her teammates she waited where she was a flash of red to her left thank goodness for the bright uniforms they had to wear jennet a fellow chaser tossed the quaffle to her she fumbled it slightly before securing it in her grasp and racing towards the slytherin goal a feint to the right then to the left then back to the right and into the goal she smiled but didntpause to celebrate the game was still going on after all the crowd below her was still cheering dutifully could they even see from way down there doubtful another angry clash of thunder interrupted her thoughts clinging slightly more tightly to her broom she followed the quaffle down the pitch the slytherin chaser decked in green thrust the ball towards the goal only to be stopped by ron silently ginny cheered her older brother as if hearing her mental applause he made eye contact and threw the ball to her it was wet and slippery but she caught it cradling it against her chest so that she wouldntblunder she passed to jennet who with great agility threw the ball right pass the slytherin keeper marcus flint was in possession at the moment flying recklessly fast toward the goals he pitched the ball in a great heave through the center goal ron visibly winced as if expecting to hear a chorus or two of weasley is our king when no such thing happened he smiled brightly and passed to jennet just then the booming voice of jordan came on over the amplifier it potter and malfoy neck and neck i think harry spotted the snitch go harry go sorry professor he added then in a very unenthusiastic voice he added oh ah and yeah go malfoy they re close now only twenty feet above the ground the whole world seemed to pause to watch the two boys fly in a full nosedive towards the ground closer now only about eight feet above the ground harry was reaching they were going to win ginny could feel it the whistle blew confirming her thoughts just as harry caught the snitch and as malfoy hit the ground for a moment it seemed as if no one had noticed the gryffindors let out a deafening cry of victory while the slytherins seemed to all collectively growl it wasntuntil a moment later and the blond boy still hadntmoved that the silence fell oh crap following her first instinct not hesitating to think she had flown down to the ground and was at his side malfoy are you okay he groaned you she pointed to harry who was looking rather breathless and pale go get my wand he stared wide eyed for a moment now she commanded he ran to retrieve it pointing it at malfoy crumpled body she whispered mobilius his body rose off the ground malfoy are you okay she asked again i fell off my bloody broom what do you think he said somehow managing a sneer through his pain i think i should just leave you here she would have too if it werentfor that pesky little voice in the back of her head telling her that it would be wrong darn her conscience when she arrived in the infirmary draco body in tow madame pomfrey was in a righteous fury denouncing the evils of quidditch in a storm no less mrs weasley set him down here and for goodness sakes you re dripping all over the floor sorry aride the nurse ordered and immediately ginny found that her uniform was warm and dry thank you go strip off that ridiculous equipment and come help me she nodded and headed of towards the back room to remove all her quidditch gear as she walked away she heard now this might be hurt a little the words were strange and unfamiliar but he found himself not caring at all it was the voice that intrigued him the deep alto voice was smooth and melodic not at all like the high and displeasing voices he was accustomed to he slowly opened his eyes for draco malfoy it seemed like lately the world was full of swirling clouds of color so as he awoke it was only natural that there was one over him the great red blur at his bedside slowly began defining its form until he could clearly see the outline of a female setting beside his cot her body was leaned over his and he could smell a faint trace of vanilla her hand was holding a cool cloth to his head fighting off fever am i in heaven he asked slightly dazed but that didntmake any sense because heaven was not a place he expected to go after a moment his eyes focused enough for him to see who his attendant was oh no it weasley i ve died and gone the other way she jumped slightly clearly startled you re awake obviously how long was i asleep you fainted after she gave you the medication malfoys do not faint so you just up and decided that it would be a good time to be unconscious exactly here she pulled from the small table beside her a tray of food he ignored it there was no way that he was going to eat hospital food he ached all over and his head was pounding his first impulse was to roll over and go back to sleep his stomach however made its opposition clear with a loud undignified rumble he thought he saw a small smile on the girl face as he accepted the food dontyou have any painkillers or something she shook her head sorry you re spine fractured during the fall she then gestured to a small bottle covered with pictures of backbones he was too tired to read it that stuffs a bit new doesntreact well with other medications she explained he sat up a bit and coughed are you okay he nodded pneumonia from the rain and cold she said holding the cold compress as explanation we d treat you for it but well madame pomfrey didntwant to risk mixing the medicines i got a kick out of reading the side effects label though you werentplanning on having kids were you he choked kidding just kidding he glared what time is it near one in the morning then anticipating his next question she added it will be safe to give you painkillers by morning are you too cold no it hot actually she handed him the compress and looked concerned you have a fever obviously she let him finish his meal in silence having abandoned her post at his side for the moment thoroughly exhausted from chewing he rolled over and closed his eyes quietly he heard the voice again a slight relief to the pain in his throbbing head it took him a moment to realize that the song was coming from her people are trying to sleep you know she blushed slightly sorry my mother used to sing to me when i was sick it always made me feel better i just well sorry she stopped and for a minute the room was quiet he felt a slight jab of disappointment at the silence i didntsay stop you know he said eyes half closed whatever you say malfoy and once again the room was filled with her sweet voice ginny are you still down here shhhhh he asleep she whispered what are you guys doing down here we came to check on you harry whispered where madame pomfrey she left a couple hours ago i sent her home to get some sleep you need to get some rest gin i can t hermione he burning up ron frowned he obviously was not concerned with how high malfoy fever was he appeared instead distracted by the fact that his younger sister had spent the last few hours alone at the bedside of the slytherin prince he seemed almost afraid that the unconscious boy would somehow still be so impossibly good looking that even in his sleep he would somehow be able to seduce her not likely though ginny did have to admit she liked him much better asleep then awake how about this gin i ll keep him cool and you rest hermione said taking custody of the cold cloth and guiding her friend over to a hospital cot okay but only for a minute just to rest okay ginny ron said as he pulled the curtains tightly closed around the bed stomach rumbling once again draco awoke in a foul mood the cold cloth was still firmly held on his forehead he opened his eyes fully expecting to see the weaselette it was not the redhead he saw however it was to his horror hermione granger geez get off granger first weasley and now you i had a nightmare like this once shut up malfoy he looked around he didntsee the female weasley anywhere her brother and potter however were unfortunately present is whole freaking gryffindor house here my gosh i need painkiller weasley weasley bring me medicine now shut up malfoy ron hissed now weasley suddenly a livid ron weasley hand was covering his mouth listen malfoy he whispered you will shut up now and let her sleep you worthless prat sleeping on the job he sneered once ron had removed his hand she was up all night making sure you were alright i would have just let you die ron dontsay that hermione scolded but even malfoy could tell it was halfhearted aw gee granger i didntknow you cared i don t we re not here for you you know then why are you still here i d be much happier if you were gone we re here for ginny she much too kind for her own good she cares about everything even a pathetic little ferret like yourself ron said i he was cut off by a loud hoarse scream ginny ron was the first one at her side throwing away the heavy drapes ginny wake up it just a dream ginny she was awake now sitting up and from his place in the hospital cot draco could see she was drenched in sweat ron oh thank goodness she threw her arms around his neck it was so real you re alright now he smoothed her hair harry looking slightly uneasy put a comforting hand on ginny shoulder ron untangled himself from her arms hermione taking his place in comforting her and glared directly at malfoy the last thing he saw before ron pulled the curtains closed once again was ginny weasely tear streaked face hi once again please review it my birthday i am so not kidding so make me happy and review or else pulls out gun and aimes at random reader while happily singing it my party thanks to all my reviewers you re all awesome disclaimer everything you reconize from the books or movies belongs to j k rowling i making no money but if you want to send me some go ahead there you are ms weasley sorry it took so long ginny apologized she had left nearly an hour ago to get showered and changed not at all dear i have a meeting at st mungo in a little bit can you hold down the fort while i gone of course madame good and see if you cantget malfoy to eat something he been an absolute horror all day i heard that malfoy called indignantly from behind the curtain ginny smiled i ll see what i can do how is he better the medicine is working he is perfectly healed though i expect he ll be too exhausted to move around much for a while her smile brightened slightly the nurse returned her smile goodbye ginny then called goodbye mister malfoy he grunted in return as she left ginny was already bustling around the infirmary preparing his medicine which she brought to him a moment later along with his lunch he frowning at the food accepted the medicine and pushed away the food beside his bed was another tray of food which didntseem to have been touched at all have you not eaten nope he said popping the pill into his mouth i refuse to eat that crap you ll never get better if you donteat that stuff more likely to make it worse you never make things easy do you no besides it your fault i in here anyway she raised an eyebrow really your precious potter made me fall and that makes it my fault by association yes well that hardly seems fair life not always fair get used to it well in that case i blame you for global warming and world hunger too no you re not eating remember i guess i could however blame you for the increase of anorexia in teenaged girls well with that kind of logic how can i argue she frowned you have to eat no i don t would you eat if it wasnthospital food no i on a hunger strike to promote freaking world peace i going to assume that was a yes can you sit up i broke my freaking back what do you think i think you ve developed a weird emotional attachment to the word freaking here give you your arm hesitantly he did as he was told she wrapped his arm around her neck and hoisted him carefully up into a sitting position then with great care she helped settle him in a wheelchair i feel like an idiot pride isnteverything she said pushing him through the infirmary doors canti just walk you said only a minute ago that you couldnteven sit up how do you expect to walk i don t but anything has to be less humiliating then this maybe i could just crawl around for an hour or so you should be able to walk by tomorrow yippee dontbe a prat where are we going to get you food she continued walking until she reached a very familiar portrait and stopped looking slightly irked it the pear weasley he said annoyed i know how to open the freaking door she snapped it was only then that he saw the problem weasley wasntexceptionally short but then again neither was the portrait she stood on her tiptoes reaching for the pear but it just exceeded her grasp he laughed shut up how did you ever manage to get in before he couldnthelp his laughing harry or ron they always do it for me his chuckling subsiding he pulled out his wand dontworry weasley i not going to hex you wingardium leviosa she was lifted slightly off the ground high enough to reach the fruit that had eluded her she giggled slightly before letting her fingers trail across the pink fruit as soon as the door opened he not so gently dropped her on the ground she barely caught herself but smiled brightly at him as she took the handles of the wheelchair and pushed it through the passage that had just opened wow do my eyes deceive me or did draco malfoy just do something kind for once i see it as more mutual need then kindness you needed to open the door and i needed to eat we re kind of like those cleaner fish and the sharks as brilliant as i sure that was i fail to get the comparison you know those fish that latch onto sharks and eat all the dirt and parasites off their skin the shark stays healthy and the fish gets a free meal ohh i get it am i the fish or the shark he rolled his eyes and what happens if the fish gets too annoying the shark eats it i not sure that scientifically accurate weasley do you know what a metaphor is sure i do it a comparison how about a rhetorical question then of course it a question that not meant to be answered oh wait was that a rhetorical question do you work hard at being this stupid or does it just come naturally she smiled well since i certainly wasntaware i was being stupid so it must just come naturally because wouldnti know if i were working at it that weasley was a rhetorical question she smiled happily at him it was obvious she had gotten under his skin she could be quite annoying when she felt like it and she felt like it right now a small gnarled house elf walked up hello miss wheezy it said tennis ball eyes gleaming with unconcealed admiration can sir help you with something may i just have the usual please moddie of course would sir like something it asked draco ahh no i sure miss wheezy would be kind enough to share she sighed he could be just as annoying as she could and he intended to prove it sure whatever moddie would you be so kind as to bring two sets of silverware please sure i will be right back i will thank you she called as it scurried off to make whatever weasley usual was you donthave to be polite to it weasley this is its job you know this may be its job but that doesntgive anyone the right to treat it like property it he isnta slave whatever it was a very uncomfortable ten minutes while they waited for the elf to return it had never taken this long to prepare draco food before whichled him to wondering what exactly he had volunteered himself to eat here i is i told you i d be back the creature voice announced as he entered oh my gosh it multiplied he murmured to himself there were now at least five other almost identical creatures all carrying platters of food standing at the kitchen door weasley what is all this this she said gesturing happily to the food is the usual the elves set down the food and exited after the girl had assured them they werentin need of anything else he examined the plates ham and pineapple pizza sauce less pasta served only with butter and a side of bacon oreo and a jar of peanut butter scrambled eggs two bowls full of what appeared to be chocolate chip cookie dough and nameless other oddities did weasley eat anything normal this is the usual for what the whole school of course not she replied while dipping a chocolate cookie into the jar of peanut butter and eating it whole just for me that disgusting no it not have you ever tried it he shook his head i dontintend to either do you know how unhealthy that is no and please donttell me i dontwant to know that chocolate covered death do you know how much fat is in one of those things i dontreally care i d rather die fat and happy then skinny and miserable anyways how wonderful for you have you ever in your entire life said something not dripping with sarcasm i was completely sincere when i called you stupid thanks dontask for the truth if you canthandle it you know it not smart to insult the girl who pushing the wheelchair you would use my disability to cause me pain how very slytherin of you are you going to eat or not he grimaced and grabbed the nearest plate which was piled high with what appeared to be bologna topped with whipped cream here goes nothing he took a bite before reaching for a napkin and spitting it out in a very undignified manner that he said pushing the plate away was the most disgusting thing i ve ever tasted she laughed not the high feminine squeal pansy always demonstrated but instead a deep throaty laugh resonating in her stomach the look on your face was priceless i glad you find my discomfort so amusing i do i really do she giggled he gave her a sour look and she sobered slightly here try this she offered him a bowl filled with macaroni and cheese what the red stuff in it he inquired skeptically he sniffed the bowl lowering it quickly with a look of puredisgust hot sauce that is wrong on so many levels just try it it spicy he raised the fork to his mouth and murmured somehow i think i going to regret this before gulping down the whole bite narcissa narcissa she squirt billowing around her legs ran into the room yes lucius is something wrong do you know what this is weather classes since when does severus snape write of such frivolous things small talk it all small talk i asked him to dear she said putting a solacing hand on her husband arm i asked him to write me to inform us of draco performance i wouldntwant our dear son to run with the wrong crowds would you the blond man narrowed his eyes at her is he is draco associating with the enemy no not as of now love but as our dear lord always says constant vigilance is never unwise if our son should for any reason betray us i want to be the first to know besides that school is horrid i always fear for his safety when he there her husband smiled and she knew she had given him the right answer he even laughed at her poor dear narcissa always fretting about the cause dontworry darling our son is well watched stop this foolishness at once she paused was he forbidding her to continue communicating with severus could he suspect that wouldntdo at all well watched by whom she demanded faking haughtiness crabbe and goyle senior of course idiots loyal and important to the cause but fools nonetheless she encircled him in her arms lucius he is after all your son she whispered into his ear flattery did what sane words could not do you have any doubt that should he chose to he could defeat a million crabbes and a million goyles with one flick of his wand he smiled at his lovely wife fine if it puts your mind at ease you may continue you re little letters my wife the spy he had no idea how true that was when she was sure he suspected nothing she sneaked upstairs with severus letter in hand she locked the door behind her as she entered her private study quickly fetching her quill she read the letter then once she had memorized its contents she began counting one two three when she reached ten she underlined the word draco one two five seven ten dear narcissa i hope this finds you in good heath dearest draco sends his warmest regards here at the castle it is quite cool unseasonable for this month however draco seems taken with it he enjoys all his classes save his care of magical creatures horrid as it is he head of all his classes next to granger he seems to meet every challenge thrown at him which very much reminds me of someone else i know like his parents he at the top of the slytherin hierarchy his first official hogsmeade weekend is coming i expect he ll ask pansy parkinson tomorrow to go with him i dontenvy him the night he ll have to spend with her i must go fondest regards severus snape draco is taken care of she read aloud letting out a sigh of relief without realizing it that must mean the boy had found a place to stay over the holiday she skimmed the rest a second time she turned the letter over it was dated the seventeenth today was only saturday the ninth she shook her head in silent admiration as she threw the paper into the fireplace severus never ceased to amaze her weasley get up weasley hmmm weasley shove off ron i not ron charlie fred george whoever you are i not any of your stupid weasel brothers open your eyes she did as she was told the brightness of the daylight burning her eyes her whole body ached from the hard hospital chairs malfoy he was standing over her looking impatient i leaving hmmm i leaving and i need my last dose of medicine you re walking obviously okay okay give me a minute she rolled over and closed her eyes oh no you dontweasley i cantget out of here until you give me that stupid medicine fine fine she stood up and went to get his medication he took it grimacing i out of here see you saturday weasley he said turning to leave wait what saturday c est la vie

disclaimer nope still not j k rowling ifi were i d be at home with my children writing hbp right now ginny are you okay as cozy as this is darling you have to finish your homework which requires you to actually be conscious blaise said gently and then with slightly more force added besides i cantfeel my arm hmmm ginny wake up you re drooling she woke up enough to argue no i not colin then how do you explain the puddle on my shoulder blaise asked shaking his arm back and forth to rock her head off its perch she rolled over to lean on colin oh no you don t he shifted in his chair so that her head fell upon the desk i need beauty sleep she grumbled turning over and closing her eyes you just want me to be ugly after a moment she sat up frustrated grr now i cantget back to sleep poor ickle ginny blaise said tousling her already untidy hair she rolled her neck wincing at the unpleasant cracking sound my neck hurts you just spent the past half an hour sleeping on a desk what do you expect oh shut up she snapped looking annoyed at her unfinished homework colin let me copy you transfiguration homework you re not in my year anymore remember blaise she asked hopefully sorry he said shaking his head i hate you both dontsay that colin said reprimanding her i do dontmake me tickle you colin warned and i ll hate ron forever too for telling you that what blaise asked nothing ginny squealed even as colin answered poor little ginny is dreadfully ticklish really now i ll remember that for future reference colin watch you re back i know where you live i know where you sleep i will find you and get you back for that she returned her gaze back to her homework this is boring she announced packing up her books and incomplete paper on animal object transfiguration let go get something to eat ummm i bet they have pie you hate pie yeah but i love the whipped cream blaise looked scandalized how can you hate pie you gryffindor freak i am in gryffindor and i do hate pie but i doubt that the two are in anyway related she said serenely as she led her two friends through the halls that led to the kitchen sorry it a reflex if ever there is anything wrong blame it on a gryffindor fail a potions test blame gryffindor get stood up for hogsmeade blame gryffindor if you get trampled to death by a troop of rampaging hippogriffs being chased by an evil dragon with a bad case of the measles ginny inquired cheerfully blame gryffindor of course i hate to break it too you guys but you re the universal scapegoat of course and colin asked does the whole school feel this way or is it just slytherin primarily slytherin but other houses seemed to have picked up on it that explains why hannah was shooting me dirty glances in herbology ginny said hannah abbott the hufflepuff colin questioned is there another hannah at this school well no but ginny i sincerely doubt that why hannah annoyed with you her eyes narrowed why then i haventdone anything to her i cantbelieve you didntsee it before gin blaise said hannah liked seamus for ages she been peeved ever since he asked you out how did she know about that in fact how did you know about that this is hogwarts red everyone knows about it nothing stays secret here i she paused and looked impatiently up the wall at the portrait do you mind hmm oh of course blaise reached up and tickled the pear at the kitchen entrance great just what i need a bunch of gossiping girls bothering me by the way ginny draco said to remind you about saturday what that all about she paused unsure what to say finally she decided the best defense was feigned oblivion who knows mad as a hatter that one is hello seamus the blond blushed slightly but smiled sheepishly hey ginny she collapsed on the couch next to him i so tired she pulled her legs up underneath her he opened his mouth to say something and then stopped what nothing no tell me nothing i dontbelieve you persistent little thing arentyou yes she smiled proudly now tell me i just wanted to you know thank you she furrowed her brow slightly for what for saying you d go to hogsmeade tomorrow with me i ve wanted to ask you since term started i was just afraid you d say no i mean not that you would because you re the nicest girl i ve ever met but then i was scared seamus yes you re babbling i i and you are so sweet she leaned up and kissed him on the cheek goodnight seamus goodnight ginny ginny awoke saturday morning to a burning sensation in her chest the feeling passed as quickly as it had come looking at her clock she groaned it was eleven thirty much later then she normally slept in then again with her recent dreams she hadntbeen getting a lot of sleep ginny had had another one last night this time it had started off with her as a child of only eleven and tom was once again only her sweet friend more a memory then a dream really except this time he wasntinside the diary he was walking and talking like a real person strangest of all was the presence of draco malfoy who seemed to have no active part in the dream but served only as a spectator who sat quietly in the corner she shrugged off her worries as easily as she did her clothes as she stepped into the shower letting her thoughts wander to happier subjects while the hot water soothed her fatigued body she was supposed to meet seamus at one o clock and malfoy at noon she snorted as if that was going to happen she had to wonder if he was really stupid enough to expect that she would show up quickly she got dressed in a nice pair of jeans and a dark green kenmare kestrels quidditch t shirt adorned with four leaf clovers that seamus was sure to love suddenly there was another bout of burning on her chest it was only now that she realized the source of the pain the necklace this was not the normal warmth the necklace frequently acquired but instead sharp and unbearably painful much more so then it had been only a moment ago had it been any other day she would have taken this as a bad omen and paid mind to her unsettling feeling but today she ignored it she was going to meet seamus annoyed she attacked the knots in her hair with a harshness that caused her scalp to sting once again there was a twinge of pain only this time it faded not completely away but to pulsing throbs of enervating ache it seemed as if an invisible rope had wrapped itself around her gently pulling her toward the castle gate she closed her eyes trying to push away the pain and suddenly in that moment she knew though she didntcompletely understand how she knew that the only way to make the suffering stop was to do as malfoy wished and meet him in the ridiculous restaurant silently cursing the blond she checked the clock again it was nearly noon already she let out a small cry as another wave of pain washed over her a knock came at the door ginny are you okay colin you sound sick do you need to go to the hospital wing i just another small squeal just not feeling very well i fine she hollered at the door hoping he wouldntwant to come in should i get madame pomfrey no no i okay ginny let me in i think i might be contagious i dontwant to get you sick i fine really i think it just a twenty four hour bug or something i sure i ll be better by morning ginny just let me see you so that i know you re not lying to me she sighed darn colin and his stupid brotherly concern for a moment she planned to ignore him but then realized he was likely to then go and get ron then she d be in for some real brotherly concern fine colin she sighed and opened the door a crack enough that he could see her face you dontlook to good gin can i do anything for you no no i fin actually scratch that i would love you forever if you would do me a favor and you wontlove me if i don t of course not i feel so used as well you should now will you please as she finished another series of sharp pains emanated from the necklace as if adding to her story she cringed slightly further convincing her friend sure what do you need i hate to ask this of you but could you please tell seamus i probably wontbe able to make it to hogsmeade today the things i do for you thanks colin you re the best i d kiss you but then you d end up sick and hate me promise me you ll get neville or me if you get worse i promise if i not feeling better by tomorrow i ll go to the nurse happy extremely good now go and be gentle with him when she was sure he was gone she closed the door and rushed to the mirror the darn necklace looked completely normal not even a hint of the pain it was causing her was evident how could something so pretty and delicate be so evil 12 05 crap the pain was steadily growing more intense she was ready to simply run out of the dorm room when she realized what she was wearing only a few minutes ago she had thought she looked nice but now her clothes felt old and tattered she considered for a moment simply wearing them anyway merely to spite malfoy but finally she decided against it considering that if c est la vie was as nice as lavender claimed they would probably have a dress code that didntinclude jeans and t shirts while normally embarrassing the blond prat would have made her smile the thought of them not letting her into the restaurant and coming all the way back to castle changing and going all the way back with the pain of the foul necklace ripping out her insides was enough to make her change her mind not a pleasant thought hurriedly she threw open her wardrobe searching for a suitable outfit finding only worn muggle clothes and school uniforms then in answer to her silent prayer her eyes fell on something green draco was impressed he had in anticipation for the resistance that she was sure to raise made the restaurant reservations at 12 30 knowing she would probably be late it was now however nearly 12 20 and she had yet to arrive glancing around he reached into his pocket and extracted the necklace counterpart the small gold ring it was still glowing red with an irritated grunt he replaced the ring draco malfoy was not a patient person and being expected to wait on a weasley of all people was just plain degrading draco is she here no sylvia hold the table as mush as i would hate to even think that there is someone on the planet capable of resisting the malfoy charm are you sure she coming the girl voice was teeming with sarcasm but also with barely concealed concern he smiled she ll be here trust me she ll be here ginny had sprinted towards the quidditch field and urged the carriage on at breakneck speeds now making every attempt not to trip over the hem of her robes she jogged down the dusty road the pain her constant incentive seemed to be ebbing slightly she knew she was getting closer it was impossible not to see her her sun lit hair gleamed red in the bright afternoon light her finery changed from black to green as her body moved and bent the flowing skirt of her robes masked her movements which draco knew were not in the least graceful she looked vaguely confused turning her face in one direction and then another as if trying to get her bearings her dainty features were painted with uncertainty then she saw him and her look of puzzlement changed to one of annoyance intermingled with rage malfoy do you know what this stupid thing has put me through for the last hour tsk tsk you wouldnthave felt anything if you were here on time how dare you she put her hands on her hips looking as if she were debating whether to wait to kill him in his sleep or to just murder him now she furrowed her brows apparently deciding that there were far too many witnesses on the street there was something annoyingly familiar about her robes that he couldntplace weasley you re making a scene come inside and i ll explain you d better or so help me i ll draco is this her the speaker was a rather thin pale girl her flaxen face was unreadable and her crystalline blue eyes were impassive she wore a black dress that couldnthave been tighter if it had been painted on her hair the same shade as her dress fell straight down bellow her hips ginny had never seen anyone as lovely as her in her life yes this is her hmmm ginny face burned as the girl examined her very well follow me the girls walked away slowly her gently swaying hips drawing many males eyes as they entered the restaurant from the older girl their eyes soon traveled to ginny who was quite sure she was blushing she felt like she was a doll on display draco had moved ahead of the redhead and fallen in step with his exquisite cohort another one draco really this is becoming unseemly though i must say she not like your usual birds your normal booth her voice like every other part of her was beautiful but laced with an icy edge though she hadntlooked at ginny since her arrival it was spoken loud enough that she knew she was meant to hear the comment this draco said wincing is not a date more like a business proposition draco i didntknow you were that desperate she said voice dripping with repulsion it took ginny a moment to understand what the stunning waitress was implying and then in almost a righteous rage spoke to defend herself unfortunately for her she never got the chance hardly being at ease walking normally she was horribly awkward on the high heels she had borrowed from lavender closet she faltered tripped and would have crashed to the ground had it not been for the waiter who so conveniently was there to catch her are you okay he asked gripping her elbow with one arm and the other wrapped around her shoulder yes i fine draco laughed dontbother with her you can put pigs in pretty clothes but they still long to wallow in the mud yeah but at least the pig is happy you put a ferret in fancy outfits and give him lots of daddy money to spend and he not any less of a ferret isntthat ever going to get old nope ummm oh ginny blushed uncomfortably as she realized the waiter was still politely holding her up sorry quite alright he helped her onto her feet and she attempted to smooth her dress she stumbled slightly one of her heels was broken thank you she paused to read his name tag err luther yes thank you luther are you sure you re alright yes thank you the picturesque girl rolled her eyes accompanied by draco with a parting nod she hobbled after the two with as much dignity as a hurt ankle and a broken heel would allow she could feel the boy eyes on her back and her face burned as she walked away well came the boy voice from behind her this just wontdo what will people say if they see our customer hobbling out before she could reply she felt his arms wrap around her and she was lifted off her feet he smiling down at her followed after her escorts i not sure but i ll spread the word that you have great service here how quaint what you re blushing well this is the first time i ve been to a restaurant where the waiters carry you to your seat he scoffed oh how deprived you ve been clearly luther put the girl down the girl named sylvia ordered dontwant to he whined put her down fine if i have to look like this is your stop princess he carefully set her down in a plush velvet lined chair he pulled her broken heel out of his pocket and placed her foot on his knee as a father would to tie a young child shoe repairo there you are he said as the heel magically fused with her shoe she smiled thank you if i stay out past midnight will i turn into a pumpkin you re clothes might turn to rags malfoy muttered ginny glared in response that depends luther said wiping a strand of brown hair off his face will your fairy godmother swoop down and spirit you away with singing mice no she on vacation why do you think i stuck with the amazing bouncing ferret draco glared luther only managed to look confused am i supposed to understand no not really umm can i have my foot back he smiled and gently put her foot back on the ground just call if you need anything thank you i will he turned and left with sylvia ginny shivered there was something about that girl she looked at malfoy what you owe me an explanation about what cut the crap he had to give her points for bluntness i just returning the favor love excuse me look i dontfeel like wasting me valuable time explaining to you what you already know that night in the dungeons i know you heard everything and malfoys are never wrong she said bitterly so just humor me pretend for one minute that i think you re stark mad and i have no idea what you re on about he rolled his eyes fine i need a favor i need a place to stay over the winter holidays you re close in with potter and i thought well if anyone would know someplace safe it d be you why i already said you re close to potter and no she closed her eyes in what could have been frustration i mean why you need a place to stay look i wontbeg and i donthave to you owe me weasley you owe me big i hello my name is andrea and i ll be your waitress for the evening can i get you something the server was a young plump woman with a friendly smile as she spoke she placed two crystal glasses of water and offered them menus some champagne maybe this looks like a special occasion no draco said harshly very well the woman looked taken aback may i get you something else to drink i need a firewhiskey and you ma am umm this will be fine for now ginny answered gesturing to her water would you like to order or do you need a few minutes draco looked at ginny who was looking at the menu in mild puzzlement i think we ll need a minute the waitress nodded and left do you know what you re going to order i was really hopping i wouldnthave to stay to eat couldntwe just discuss this and leave they tend to frown upon that besides it would look suspicious why do you think i brought you here instead of the three broomsticks or better yet just stayed at hogwarts because then we d have people eavesdropping stupid people go to quiet places to talk a wise man uses noise to his advantage thank you for that she had stopped listening halfway through and had turned her attention back to her menu which to her dismay was written in french annoyed she looked around you yes you luther it was the waiter who had helped her walking by on his way to the kitchen she grabbed his arm and pulled him to the table i cantread this he smiled tell you a secret neither can i so what good hmmm he walked over platter in hand to stand over her shoulder feel like duck sure if it made with chicken he laughed let cross that off the list do you like salad are you kidding she looked up at him in disgust it so green i ll take that for a no hmmm how about steak do you put pepper on it yes she shook her head what about cheeseburgers do you like cheeseburgers i really dontthink that on here well for you love we ll make an exception really that would be wonderful he winked at her as he walked away much to draco annoyance the girl called andrea only returned once more to give him his firewhiskey before informing them that luther would be taking her table it was bad enough being stuck with the weasley it was just plain sick to watch men swoon over her when he finally spoke again his annoyance was evident i just need you to find a safe place for me to stay for three weeks just three weeks she sighed so you ll do it do i have a choice not really then yeah i guess i ll do it there was a long rather uncomfortable silence while they waited for their food ginny fiddled with the buttons of her robe then he remembered it was the robe she had gotten that day with him the one she had been given he wanted to make a joke about them to say she looked horrible to remind her that she had been too poor to really pay for them heck even something as remedial as to say she looked fat but the words wouldntcome the truth was he couldntblame men for swooning luther approached holding their food and smiling have i turned back into a pumpkin yet she asked smiling brilliantly nope fully human he said smiling and setting down draco food then with an extra flourish he set down a covered platter and removed the lid to reveal the best and most expensive cheeseburger ginny had ever seen lying to the side was a rose she blushed do you like it it beautiful i bet you do this for all the girls she smiled trying to cover up her surprise draco scoffed no just all the pretty red headed ones who fall into my arms you hear that draco there a proper protocol for helping girls who fall according to their hairstyle would you teach him that when i fall he just kicks my books what would you have done it i were say brunette well then i supposed i d have to give you a carnation she blushed i have to go see you later and by the way he added laying down the small leather book containing the check dinner on the house she nodded still slightly pink draco was looking at the bill he had only been charged for his own meal man i wish pansy were this cheap that was weird she said looking entirely shocked what he asked looking up the flower the bill it was almost like he was flirting with you he finished of course he was you dolt looking absolutely appalled she shook her head he however was simply amazed she hadntrealized that the waiter had been hitting on her the whole afternoon how much longer do we have to stay a few more minutes why do you have somewhere more important to be then with little ole me not that it any of your business but yes she glanced at the clock 2 00 seamus had probably already given up on her he raised his eyebrows and where is this place that so important a date sarcasm she knew it was which gave her all the more satisfaction when she smiled sweetly and nodded yes in fact he laughed what so funny she looked slightly offended what poor bloke is desperate enough to want to date you seamus he laughed again that it i ve heard you re angle i ve done my duty i donthave to sit here and take this i leaving he glanced in the direction of sylvia she nodded discreetly towards a booth in which he saw two mountains which he assumed to be men weasley we can t we re being watched to his surprise she didntask by whom i have a plan what listen we re supposed to be two angsty teenagers arentwe we ll just get into a little fight and i ll storm off think you can handle that i not an idiot weasley which she took as a yes that is a matter of opinion malfoy for a moment she said nothing leaving draco to wonder if she was going to make the first move or if he should then in answer to his question her palm connected painfully with his cheek i cantbelieve you would do this to me she screamed purposefully making a scene the music that had been playing quietly in the background stopped i thought i thought i well you were wrong okay he shouted back not to be out done what are you going to tell me it not my fault next that it not me it you no no it was all pretty much you i hate you i never want to see you again good i i arg i canteven talk to you and before he could figure out what she was doing she dumped her water on him she turned and stormed out draco slightly more quietly cursed muttering a charm to dry his clothes he too stormed out yelling at sylvia as the door slammed to charge the bill to his tab when he emerged from the building he was able to see the form of weasley slipping away through the crowd her form shaking from laughter she kept her hood up shielding her face though with the hair coloring charm she had employed for the evening she doubted it was necessary the cover was a comfort thank god it was still gently raining or else a fully cloaked and hooded figure would have been conspicuous she entered their usual building and sat at her normal corner booth it was only 6 50 she was ten minutes early she with slight hesitation pulled back her hood and waited their meetings were always always at 7 00 an hour after classes let out giving him time to shower and change and he was never late narcissa his voice was hesitant as if he didntrecognize her then again with her now black hair he might not have especially in the shadows like she was then more certainly narcissa yes severus she turned so that the light hit her draco mother had always been stunning her hair normally fair blond not like lucius and draco silver white was long almost reaching her hips when she stood her face was not angular instead her nose and chin were soft curves bright blue eyes revealed both confidence and intelligence at the corners of her mouth only evident to those who looked very carefully were slight frown marks he hated lucius for putting those there now even when she smiled it was slightly marred with sadness severus would have given anything to make her once brilliant smile shine again she extended her hand in greeting hello severus how have you been well you he shrugged and draco is taken care of thank god where i canttell you why she seemed indignant surely you must understand that his whereabouts must be secret but he my son and you want him to stay alive dontyou the less you know the better should you be tortured he didntneed to finish while she would never intentionally she knew that if lucius thought she might know where draco was he would use a truth curse on her and then she d have to tell him she sighed he safe yes promise me he promised of course he did he couldntdeny her anything when she announced she had to go a few moments later he was sorry to see her go he kissed her gently on the cheek before watching her depart pulling up her hood as she left he felt slightly guilty having withheld information from her but there was no reason to tell her the truth that he couldnttell her where draco was staying because hestill didntknow another chapter done hmm not my best chapter buti still like it please reveiw or e mail me with comments about the story construtive critism is appretiated but flames will be laughedat to everyone who reviewed my last chapter i love you you are so awesome umm rather short chapter really sorry i just really wanted to post this because i felt so bad for the last one taking forever okay i didnthave this scene planned but lavender tapped me on the shoulder and said she wanted a conversation it was the least i could do after making her so ditzy earlier so here it is i dontparticuarly like it i think it atad confusing but dontworry if you get lost the next chapter will clear things up a bit thank you sooooooooo much to my reviewers you guys make me so happy disclaimer i own nothing that you reconize from the harry potter books of movies all of it belongs to the wonderful j k rowling seamus she asked uncertainly to her immense relief he smiled brightly back at her hello gin are you feeling better yes thank you could you could you come with me he stared looking slightly bemused but nodded when they were outside of the portrait she pulled a handkerchief out of her pocket and standing on her tiptoes she secured it around his eyes i cantsee well of course silly that the point of the blindfold she took his hand and led him outside carefully guiding down the stairs she stopped and dropped his hand where are we he asked you ll see no peeking after a moment he felt her small hands on the back of his neck fumbling with the knot the blindfold fell away he stared for a minute in shock of what he saw in front of him a large red blanket had been laid out facing the lake which in the afternoon sunlight gleamed gold a small picnic basket lay discarded its contents emptied onto the blanket she smiled brilliantly at him do you like it she asked what is all this i just felt bad about well you know standing you up today i thought i d make it up to you wanna muffin she had snuck into the kitchen earlier to get food only to realize she had no earthly idea what seamus liked to eat she d asked for a good assortment of food hoping that she d get at least one thing he liked and knowing from experience that it was very likely seamus was after all a boy and boys ate everything she made sure to get muffins though lots of muffins they were the only thing she knew for sure that he liked he had she remembered been eating a muffin the night he had asked her out this is great he said accepting the proffered muffin i cantbelieve you did all this she shrugged and sat down gesturing for him to do the same he did so so she leaned back on her arms stretching out contentedly like a cat this is one of my favorite places he stared at her in amazement she was one of those people who could blend into any situation it was hard to feel uncomfortable around her why reminds me of home i suppose we have a quarry back at the burrow it filled up ages ago long before we owned the house we swim there in the summer you re lucky it must be fun to have so many brothers he said sadly seamus was an only child not really not when you re a six year old scared of heights and your brothers stage an intervention he laughed you were scared of heights terrified my brothers decided they couldntlive with the shame of a sister who wouldntplay quidditch so fred and george decided to play a little game of their own i was the quaffle i spent a week in a body cast and mum was livid on the plus side i overcame my fear you can say that again you re reckless on a broom why thank you i love playing seeker but i ve always really wanted to be a chaser i saw glynnis griffiths play once not live of course it was actually while i was still in the body cast at st mungo s i knew right then that i wanted to be just like her fearless glynnis griffiths chaser for the holyhead harpies the all girl pro team she explained as she bit into a peanut butter oreo the one guilty pleasure she had been able to resist but then after they had succeeded in ridding me of my fear they turned around and pulled a complete 1800 they said flying was too dangerous for me so when no one was looking i d sneak out and steal their brooms to practice you re a trip ginny weasley you know that hey guys what wrong in their dorm room parvati and lavender were sitting together on lavender bed hermione looked up annoyed from her book to watch lavender trying to comfort a sobbing parvati he d d d dumped me the dark haired girl wailed he dumped me who ginny asked parvati was nice enough but she went through boys faster then anyone else she knew except maybe lavender kevin whitby she spat obviously enraged a hufflepuff i was dumped by a bleeding hufflepuff ginny sat down and patted the older girl consolingly she glanced at hermione who rolled her eyes and mouthed she been at this for hours over her book it not like i even liked him or anything i was just dating him because he was hot and a great kisser i supposed to dump him of course i mean you dontthink i really liked him or anything did you because i didn t not at all i know you didn t ginny said kindly his loss lavender comforted that right it is his lose someday he going to wake up and realize how much better off he was with me and try to come back and i ll just rub it in his face you know what i think we need a girls night just the four of us lavender exclaimed ah sure hermione and i will go get some snacks but i was going to finish she held up her book helplessly as ginny clapped a hand over her mouth shut up hermione she whispered you ll never finish your book with her wailing like that at least this way we can stop her from crying fine let go as they walked out parvati aroused herself from her moping long enough to call out and hermione make sure ginny gets some normal food this time by the time they had returned arms full of candy floss chocolate frogs pumpkin pastries and other such goodies parvati had cheered up enough to discuss the various fashion mistakes she had seen that afternoon at hogsmeade did you see elsie what was she thinking green is s ooo not her color and mary beth can you believe that hair coloring charm as if anyone hair is that blonde oh my gosh what about justin did you see his pants he looked like a clown i know who justin the hufflepuff lavender answered parvati gave a slight whimper dontsay that word ginny sat down with her oreos so ginny she said how was bill i told you i couldntmake it today because of your date with seamus i know but i know you didntmeet seamus and i saw you leave the castle ginny weasley in my shoes no less no one gets that dressed up just for a casual trip to hogsmeade parvati was thrilled at the intrigue of the situation so it was you who stood seamus up today how does the whole school know about that this is hogwarts ginny hermione said so i ve heard parvati played absentmindedly with ginny hair normally she would have protested when the dark haired girl pulled out a comb and began brushing ginny locks but she made an exception today the girl had after all just been dumped but what did bill have to say quit saying bill like that what about bill hermione asked supposedly he was coming to visit ginny today i didntknow bill was coming ron didntsay anything that because it a secret hermione she said through gritted teeth hoping the older girl would get the message oh i think it a secret all right i think ginny got a secret boyfriend she not telling us about ohh how did you know parvati asked enthralled well i followed her of course and dontgive that look you were in my shoes after all i distinctly saw her go into the restaurant with a man and how do you know it wasntbill ginny asked with blond hair i dontthink so look you re right okay it wasntbill but i canttell you who it was so just drop it please lavender looked miffed fine whatever parvati was the one who broke the silence after a moment you know what this party needs a makeover oh no ginny whose hair was now in two large braids said pulling away you two arenttouching me not you though if you would just let me lighten your hair a bit no fine fine it not you i meant anyway she said glancing at hermione who was still devoutly attempting to read her book she glanced up not me no please hermione the lavender and parvati begged you ve been crushing on ron for the longest time even if you wontadmit it why dontyou just let us give you a little sprucing up she bit her lip hesitantly well maybe but nothing too drastic though hermione seemed resigned after that to just sit back and allow the two girls to spruce her up she kept shooting murderous glares in ginny direction while the girls worked they continued their chitchat ginny having never cared for makeup herself did not participate though she laughed at the appropriate times and sometimes added a few tidbits of gossip she had heard and seamus and hannah were sitting in the leaky caldron when it happened they can both testify i so sure like they were really paying attention to what was going on what ginny asked having let her attention lapse for a moment the sound of seamus name brought her back to reality oh i sorry ginny this must be a sensitive topic for you i was so stupid to bring it up what topic well you know seamus and hannah what oh my gosh you mean you dontknow well i just kind of assumed with you standing him up and all that you that i what broke up with him of course parvati said not in the least tactfully lavender at least tried to be delicate but for parvati discretion was too much of a bother he was all depressed and lonely and hannah was just sort of there i suppose they had lunch together and i happen to know for a fact that they were getting awfully cozy in that booth oh ginny are you okay hermione asked eyes full of concern she smiled she was angry of course but not at seamus in reality she found she didntmind losing seamus she minded losing the idea of seamus ginny had wanted someone to like her and seamus had he had treated her like she was special which was what she had been looking for but she also knew that she didnteven really know seamus as a person she really should have been mad that he had dated another girl but she couldntbe she had after all stood him up on their first date and had the situations been reversed she would have probably done the same thing i fine we never really officially dated are sure of course this has become so depressing lavender pouted then her face brightened let play truth or dare hermione and ginny rolled their eyes truth or dare seemed to be lavender solution for anything the girls couldntcount the times they had finally submitted and played the stupid games just to get her to shut up about it sometimes okay all the time ginny pitied the man who would end up with lavender she had a talent for annoying anything out of anyone inwardly ginny sighed she didntfeel like arguing today fine she said grudgingly good hmmm hermione truth or dare hermione gulped ummm dare solana draco has come to join me in thanking our reviewers draco i didnthave a choice i

sure seamus is a nice guy and if he wants to date hannah then i say congratulations hannah really i hardly even know seamus you donthave to know someone to like that merlin if victor and i didntprove that i dontknow what will ginny sighed it just nice to feel wanted you know love is the irresistible desire to be irresistibly desired huh robert frost muggle poet the point is i know what you mean she too sighed and ginny was pretty sure that she wasntthe only redhead on her mind hey i going down to breakfast you want to come she blushed slightly i dontthink so you cantavoid him forever but i can try ginny set her jaw in a forced smile she held her head up high as she made her way into the great hall lavender had already asked professor snape for salamander blood which everyone knew was used in anti pregnancy potions snape had flushed and sputtered but had in the end given it to her without any questions lavender not in need of the particular ingredient much to ginny relief had opted to simply throw the blood away ginny never one to let a good opportunity by had instead sent it to pansy parkinson with a baby pacifier and a note that simply said good luck and congratulations lavender and parvati had nearly collapsed in a fit of giggles hermione however still slightly sore about her own dare had simply cringed in disapproval and parvati had accomplished her task too she had snuck into the hufflepuff team locker room and put itching powder into all of their quidditch uniforms ginny had noted with some amusement that a certain kevin whitby seemed to be scratching a good deal more than any of his teammates two down and two to go ginny certainly had no intention of being last ginny yes look gin i think we need to talk seamus i kind of in the middle of something right now okay can we talk later but this is really important but i please fine could we maybe do this somewhere else come on seamus i busy fine fine look i cantkeep leading you on i met hannah at hogsmeade when you didntshow up and we had lunch together so and well then i kind of asked her to go to the next hogsmeade with me look i really really sorry ginny i feel terrible i seamus i know lavender and parvati told me i understand and you donthave to feel guilty you ve been nothing but a gentleman to me and you re okay i fine i not trying to brush you off or anything i just really have to go no hard feelings she said offering him her hand he smiled as he left and ginny couldnthelp but feel a slight twinge of annoyance as she watched hannah abbott pigtails bouncing join arms with him pushing away her irritation she continued walking past the gryffindor smiling at ron and harry winking at her dorm mates straight to the slytherin table pansy who ginny was pretty sure suspected her of the whole pacifier thing glared along with her group of slytherin girls what are you doing here weasley she scoffed she grabbed draco arm and tugged gallingly draco make her leave she ignored her and instead looked at blaise who was seated on malfoy other side blaise be a doll and move over will you i need to sit next to the ferret he obliged looking amused another dare she nodded sadly why do i do it blaise it always turns out badly what was it this time i have to sit next to him for breakfast she said jerking a thumb in malfoy direction not a very impressive dare really but the consequences if i refused were dire he raised an eyebrow they were going to say that harry and i have been having a passionate love affair all summer isntthat just what you always wanted weasel no not when i just now convincing people the exact opposite besides who gave you permission to eavesdrop that what you get for talking about me like i not here besides am i really that unappealing yes liar you know you want me draco i think you re confused pansy on the other side of you pansy crinkled her little pug nose draco smirked i could get up and leave right now and then you wouldntbe able to complete your dare yes she smiled sweetly but then you will have to deal with me tomorrow and the next day and the next day until one day i wear you down look at you two cantyou ever get along blaise asked stifling a grin no they answered simultaneously ginny spent the rest of breakfast chatting with blaise and stubbornly ignoring malfoy as much fun as this was i think it time for me to leave she turned to crabbe and goyle one more little thing i have to do gregory vincent do you mind looking completely dumbfounded both shook their heads she leaned over and gently kissed each on the cheek thank you as she walked away to her first class she could have swore she heard she heard malfoy laughing hey ginny can you do me a favor can you store this there no space in our room ron extended a huge shopping bag what is all this harry and my christmas shopping um for who for everyone ginny harry said gee i never knew you had so many cousins plus everyone from the order look what i got for snuffles smiling wickedly he held up a bag of bacon flavored doggy treats she laughed i cantbelieve i didntstart shopping already i have so much left to do maybe hermione will go with me sometime are you kidding it october she been done with her christmas shopping for at least a month oh be nice ron she scolded speaking of hermione has anyone seen her ron looked thoughtful i haventseen her since yesterday she probably messing around with a stupid time turner again ginny winked dontworry ron i think you ll see her soon enough something odd was happening in the common room lavender and parvati were sitting in the corner giggly hysterically and continually glancing in harry ron direction at the top of the girls dormitory stairs stood hermione upon seeing her entry hermione gave ginny a pleading look for a minute she didntunderstand and then realizing the time she understood it was quickly approaching seven the deadline for the dares and hermione had yet to complete hers with a deep breath hermione descended the stairs good luck ginny murmured as she passed thanks she answered without stopping i ll need it hi ron she said shyly he barely glanced up oh hi mione where were whoa hermione what did you do to yourself she looked hurt you dontlike it no it s it great ginny didntknow how hermione had gotten through the day without being noticed by ron but by the obvious surprise on his face it was clear this was the first time he had seen her and he was right she did look great as she had requested lavender and parvati hadntdone anything too drastic they had shown her a hair straightening charm that only had to be applied once a week and her brown tresses now hung in place without the slightest bit of frizz they had also added lighter highlights not quite blond that in ginny opinion looked marvelous her face had a very minimal amount of makeup hardly noticeably that accented her naturally attractive features it was hard to when her nose was in a book but standing there in lovely blue robes that someone else had picked out for her no doubt hermione ginny decided was very pretty hermione beamed then without preamble she leaned forward pulling ron up off the couch wrapped her arms firmly around his waist and kissed him it was over before ron had ended figured out what had happened hermione face was flushed bright pink as she tried to explain see it was a dare and then i not being able to find the words she turned still very pink to flee ron however caught her hand i she couldnthave finished if she had wanted to because before she could explain ron lips were on hers for a moment hermione body went rigid before she pulled herself closer and allowed him to deepen the kiss the cat calls and cheering was what finally stopped them the entire gryffindor house was in an uproar parvati and lavender were simply glowing and ginny was unable to hide her smile dean clapped ron on the back thanks man for what lee and i had a bet going i told him you two would be together by christmas but he didntthink you d hook up until after graduation dean smiled now if you excuse me i have two galleons to collect the establishment of gryffindor newest and longest awaited couple seemed to merit a party friends of hermione and ron were happy to see them finally getting over their own stupidity others simply stayed for the butterbeer the merriment lasted until nearly midnight professor mcgonagall had entered around ten to break it up but after ginny discreetly informed her of the reason for the ruckus she had quietly slipped away and let the party continue while ginny joined in the fun she couldnthelp but be slightly distracted she was getting an idea and it wasntone she liked i sorry there hasntbeen much draco in the past few chapters but i promise he ll be in the next chapter hehehehe i know something you dontknow hehehehe okay nowpush that little button right there no no to the left down down there right there the pretty little one that says review hey guys thamks soooooooo much to all my reviewers as always your critisisms are apreciated you guys make me so happy disclaimer not mine never will be stop rubbing it in today we will be changing lab partners some find this class to difficult professor snape said coldly almost daring any one to point out that the class was difficult ginny looked around the room and the only hufflepuff had indeed disappeared several slytherins snickered she looked hopefully at blaise seated beside her and he smiled in agreement the two made a good team while ginny was well learned in potions and books she was not good at coming up with new ideas of her own she was shrewdly observant and focused on what she could see blaise however used foresight he was calm and collected for her impulsiveness while she looked at the surface he was already looking beneath she was glad to have him as her partner only snape seemed to have other ideas mr zabini will be paired with mr blackwell he said pointedly glancing at a blond slytherin who blushed slightly maybe he ll be able to help you bring up your pitiful grades blackwell blaise looked apologetically at her but she shrugged him off it wasnthis fault he was good at potions miss brocklehurst your partner will be miss turpin two ravenclaws then came two more ravenclaws mary surrey and martha richards next they learned that jarred marks would work with a fellow slytherin malcolm baddock the next was a pair of slytherins tracey davis and daphne greengrass ginny looked around as the crowd of unassigned people around her dispersed mr graham will be working with mr bletchley the sinking feeling in her stomach that she had acquired when she learned blaise was not going to be her partner intensified as professor snape announced that michael and joanna the last two ravenclaws would be working together that left only one person malfoy professor draco started eager to argue his way out of being her partner not that ginny minded do you have a problem with the seating assignment mr malfoy snape cut him off and the look in his eyes discouraged dispute draco however didntback down yes i then get over it so i may start my lesson now sit down which the blond did pouting ms weasley what about you i sure as heck do we already have one class together are you crazy or do you just want me to kill malfoy or is it you just like making us unhappy is that it that enough mrs weasley we can discuss this tonight in detention now take your seat and fifteen points from gryffindor for your outburst fuming she sat down and waited impatiently for snape to finish his lecture when he let them start on their potions ginny began haphazardly cutting the caterpillars you ll lose a finger that way draco noted emotionlessly good that would get me out of classes for at least two days three if it gets infected i dontthink i ve heard anything that cheerful all day you re particularly unbearable today and you re especially tetchy today what got your knickers in a bundle nothing you know that thing at the restaurant with the water he said after a moment not part of the plan she smiled innocently and looked up at him from beneath her lashes i was improvising you re improvising nearly ruined my shirt would ve served you right ugly shirt he shook his head says the girl who shops at thrift shops yeah like i would take fashion advice from a guy who wears more frills than i do the dreams were infatuating the colors and sound were so vivid that the images replayed in his mind for hours after he woke at first the dreams were just another thing to use against her he was sure that if he kept coming eventually he would find something to use against her some admission of guilt to a past crime a secret crush a deep dark secret he had found nothing of the sort and yet he still could not keep himself from coming the dreams were forever changing morphing sometimes they were dreams of her past and ginny was young thin and full of smiles these seemed to be memories recollections of thing that had really happened the boy she called tom appeared in these as a kind friend a mentor the subject of a girlish crush often making ginny blush other times they were of the present and these were the only ones in which ginny seemed perfectly in control of what she was saying when they were current it was obvious ginny disdained tom she had even slapped him several times but was unable to leave him there was something about the boy that linked her to him transfixed her and while she broke out of her trance long enough to bicker and struggle she never managed to completely banish him from her dreams rarely they were of the future and these tended to be silent but full of emotion these usually featured an older ginny normally adorned in strange elaborate dresses and robes this one seemed to be the latter she was standing in the doorway leaning heavily against its stone frame dressed in a deep green garment that clung to her curves and cut much lower than anything she would have really worn she was much older then her fifteen years though she looked tired draco could feel the happiness radiating from her as she watched the tall dark haired man approach holding a small raven haired boy on his shoulders from behind her skirt two small heads appeared identical from their small freckled noses to their shockingly red hair they were clearly members of the weasley clan only instead of ginny green eyes theirs were a deep blue black obviously the mark of their father tom eyes he realized the man set down the boy who ran excitedly toward ginny smiling happily draco could now clearly see the light sprinkling of freckles on his face and his bright green eyes mother mother look he held open his cupped hands to show her something he had found and picked up on his way home the small twins emerged from behind their mothers dress to greet their brother and again through the bond of the spell he could see what she saw feel what she felt he was overcome with a sense of pride he had never felt before a host of other emotions ripped through his chest filling his heart to a capacity he hadntthought possible most prominent was the feeling of satisfaction as she admired her children a maid appeared carrying a small weeping baby ginny older self reached out and took the baby from the servant she rocked him slightly and gurgled some incoherent words and within a moment he cooed contently and snuggled silently closer against his mother breasts the man had now reached the door he leaned carefully over and kissed ginny lightly ello love she smiled brightly at him hello tom he pulled her into his arms letting her lean against his chest for support i love you he whispered forever her back ached and for a moment she couldntrecollect where she was she rubbed her eyes and waited for them to adjust to the darkness it wasntuntil she rolled over knocking the history of magic book off her lap that she remembered where she was the gryffindor common room ginny are you okay she jerked away as the warm hand touched her shoulder hey gin it just me just harry still not quite awake she didntcomprehend at first harry then a more surely harry harry what are you doing up same as you i d expect nightmares he sounded tired not physically though he surely was but instead emotionally drained i wasnthaving nightmares even to her ears the lie sounded thin and unbelievable so you just woke up screaming bloody murder for the fun of it she didntremember screaming at all but that would explain the dryness of her throat yes liar i ve slept at you re house enough summers to know that you dontjust wake up screaming that the kind of thing i think i d remember lumos he sat down and put a comforting arm around her now you just tell me what wrong she looked dubious you wonttell ron or anyone no i ve been dreaming of to voldemort lately she didntfeel compelled to add that they were dreams of a young handsome charming tom riddle as opposed to a crazy demented red eyed voldemort somehow it didntappear completely relevant besides she couldntexpect harry to understand and the last thing she needed was him mouthing off to ron she nearly laughed at the notion and ron hadntliked the idea of her dating dean what would he think of her having dreams very clearly implying lord voldemort was the father of her children is that all inquired harry sounding slightly relieved that she hadntstarted crying crying girls was defiantly not his area of expertise what do you mean is that all she drew back out of his support to look at him offended well ginny he cut in quickly to clarify his nonchalance which she had very obviously misinterpreted ginny was very rarely upset and even more rarely did she show her distress if she was this troubled by something it was clearly very important to her and harry didntwant her to feel she had mad a mistake in sharing her grievances with him it close to halloween the anniversary of the chamber it makes sense that you should dream about it now she hadntconsidered that but harry was right the dreams had all but vanished until recent weeks and it was understandable that they would occur around the same time as her original possession sinking back into his embrace she said your turn he didntanswer you said you were having nightmares she prompted though she knew he had understood he wasntlooking at her anymore instead his gaze was fixed on the wall she feared for a moment that he wouldntanswer but finally with a heavy voice he said they died on halloween she didnthave to ask who they were oh harry it seemed inadequate but she couldntfind any words that would comfort him she was overwhelmed with not only pain for her friend but also overpowering guilt here she had been worried about her own stupid dreams how petty that seemed now oh harry she said again and the roles quickly changed she went from being comforted to comforting she pulled his head down into her lap placing a soothing hand on his shoulder his whole body quaked with dry raking sobs almost as if he had no tears left in him to cry ginny felt her heart break in that moment she hated tom more then she had before for what he had done not to her but to harry draco was going crazy he had sent three letters to his mother in the past three weeks and hadntgotten a reply for any of them so many letters he knew looked unusual but he was worried out of his mind he hadntbeen able to concentrate in classes and hadntsleep well at night he couldntfind peace until he knew his mother was all right he quickly scrawled yet another note and gave it to his eagle owl who tired of flying the long distances between hogwarts and malfoy manor bit him ouch you mangy little crow he sucked at the small bead of blood that had formed once again he tried to tie the parchment to the bird leg but the owl would have none of it he stepped out of draco reach and hooted imperiously stupid bird the owl hooted once more and draco could have sworn the thing glared fine fine i ll go get an owl from the owlery they re faster anyway the bird looked at him again as if to say you really think i d fall for that arg he sighed but grabbed his cloak and walked up to the owlery grumbling all the way he selected a black and white owl that looked fast and attached his letter to its leg true to its name the bird was nearly completely black with the exception of its stomach which was streaked with white it was sleek and sharp and its eyes were intelligent this one obviously better tempered then his own pet jumped from its perch onto draco shoulder and hooted it took a strand of silver in his beak and tweaked the boy hair what draco wasntan animal person especially not since that incident with the hippogriff in third year owls made him uncomfortable they were all together too smart to be trusted and something about this one was particularly unnerving it hooted again surprising draco and making him jump this whole business with his mother was making him far too jittery do you want an owl snack or something he offered the bird a small treat which it snubbed and continued to stare slightly annoyed he asked what of course he didntexpect an answer it was just a stupid bird after all but speaking the questions aloud helped calm his nerves you just worry about getting this to mother all right he stared after the creature as it flew away completely unaware of the pair of doe green eyes watching him ginny weasley watched in wonder draco malfoy had once again unknowingly let her see behind his mask and she didntknow how to react she couldntquite identify the emotion behind his steel gray eyes as the owl flew away concern was it possible for someone as heartless as malfoy to feel concern but then again as ginny had now seen twice he wasntas emotionless as he appeared she really hadntbeen trying to spy she had simply been trying to mail a letter as soon as she heard voices she should have turned the other way after all curiosity killed the cat but being the sister of fred and george weasley had certain requirements and endless curiosity was one of them that and a ready supply of nose biting teacups but that was another story she was about to move from her hiding place when a slight rustle stopped her following the sound she saw it was only an owl returning then upon further investigation she saw that it was the very same owl that malfoy had just sent out with the post it landed with the lofty grace of all raptors not on a perch but on the floor sensing something was about she remained pressed against the rafter as closely as she could and tried to quiet her breathing then in a disgusting blend of feathers and skin the bird began to take on a new form ginny had seen someone change from animagus form before in her first year professor mcgonagal had changed from a cat to a human on the first day of class several times she had seen sirius take the form of a hulking black dog to his normal form with seemingly no effort watching this had been interesting even entertaining but those had been quick a matter of seconds at the most this was agonizingly slow every bone in the owl body seemed to break and reform at a new angle and the feathers melted away exposing pale skin beneath watching it the room seemed to spin she closed her eyes tightly and pushed down the nausea when she opened them again it was all over there looking slightly disheveled and flushed was professor severus snape he looked down at the letter that had fallen forgotten on the floor during the transformation incendio the professor sad quietly watching the letter shrivel and burn only a moment before hurrying down the stairs not waiting as long as she probably should have ginny rushed from her hiding spot and stomped fruitlessly on the burning letter wait duh ginny she pulled out her wand thanking merlin she hadntleft it in her dorm room extintor she called and immediately the flames stopped she carefully picked up the paper and unrolled it it was scorched and tattered in places restablecer she commanded and the missing patches materialized as perfectly as if they hadntbeen damaged dear mother i hope you and father are well we have a quidditch game coming up soon against hufflepuff an easy win school is as always predictable and boring the only remotely exciting class is care of magical creatures and that only because if you look away for even a second you find your arm being gnawed off by a hippogryff or blast ended skrew or some other equally horrendous creature i do however fear snape has gone mad today he paired me with the girl weasel ginny short for something and she just as unbearable as any of the others perhaps even more so i expect one of us will be dead by friday with any luck it ll be her and potter and weasley will be so depressed they ll off themselves father shall have to make a complaint about this i must go mother quidditch practice is about to start but i ll write again soon forever you devoted son draco ginny reread the letter several times and only became more mystified each time she did what in this could be so important that snape would burn it and why did he want it in the first place it made no sense it was a simple exceedingly boring run of the mill letter and she couldntsee anything so important about it unless aparecium she said pointing the tip of her want at the parchment suddenly a new message appeared below the original mother please if you are at all able reply you re lack of response has me worried out of my mind are you okay has lucius harmed you in any way if he has i swear i ll kill him i will be waiting anxiously for your reply with all my love draco slowly she folded the parchment pondering what she had just read things were definitely getting strange indeed hi guys sorry this chapter took a while but my computer died as in wouldnteven turn on but my brother got a new one andi got his old one yes as the youngest of three i always get hand me downs but i used to it this is my spring break so i ll probably update again soon please review it makes me write faster hi i back with another chapter ummm it rather short sorry i haventhad mush time because we had my aunt and her family come over so anyway thanks to all my reviewers you guys make me so happy disclaimer i own nothing that you reconize from the harry potter books or movies and no profit is beingmade please dontsue me what going on ginny asked a costume party isntit wonderful ginny hermione was positively beaming just peachy ron griped a party isntthat kind of i dontknow clich she asked looking at ron and harry who seemed nearly as unhappy about the idea of a halloween ball as she did hermione looked slightly insulted but brightened almost immediately but you haventheard the best part it for a good cause what cause exactly the aoheap hermione said cheerfully she was met with three blank stares and groaned in frustration at their ignorance the agency for house elf abuse prevention she clarified and i thought spew was bad ron grumbled hermione seemed not to hear you see i thought we could charge like a sickle to enter the contest and then at midnight we would announce the winner well not us of course the teachers would be doing the actually judging because i mean come on hermione ron said but not unkindly get on with it right the winner would get half the entrance fee and the other half would go to aoheap isntit just brilliant well it certainly is original ginny said in what she hopped sounded like a supportive voice the truth was she suspected the older girl had something more on her mind then house elves this was her gentle way of pushing ron to make some kind of commitment albeit a small one ever since their first kiss they had been following each other around like two lovesick puppies but ron hadntactually taken her on a date anywhere he hadntreally made any effort at all to further their relationship all this ginny knew through the after curfew talks that she and hermione had become very prone to having but ginny also knew that ron probably didnteven realize hermione was unhappy after she and ron had kissed hermione had ran to the library and checked out all the books on relationships she could find while ginny wasntall that well versed in relationships herself was pretty sure that all that assert yourself set rules and boundaries make him take you out at least once a week greet him at the door in saran wrap crap wasntwhat the two needed to base their relationship on especially since ginny really didntwant to picture hermione and ron snogging in a pile of saran wrap in fact herms i think it a great idea she said smiling and hoping no one would realize she was lying through her teeth hermione glowed but her smile faltered after a moment but of course i ll need some helpers to recruit participants and i dontknow where i ll find three willing volunteers no one would want to give up some of their time at the ball soliciting people for a sickle i mean i guess i could just do it by myself but i dontknow what i d do about time there no way i could get to everybody by myself maybe i could just break out the old time turner again i enough hermione harry said smiling no need to keep guilting us into it we ll do it already oh thank you harry personally i ashamed of you hermione ginny said i thought i taught you how to act better than that time turner indeed hermione laughed then in her best modest student voice she said i sorry ginny i just donthave the same experience with guilt trips as you do that okay herms you do seem to have the flattery department down pat why thank you she said giggling before noticing that ron was looking very sullen ron i never said i d do it you know he said but hermione looked stricken she had just kind of assumed that ron would help her he was her well not boyfriend yet but that would change soon if she had anything to say about it please ron she asked sweetly before shyly kissing him on the lips and whispering something into his ear that made him blush fine fine he said looking rather flustered but i not wearing a costume then his ears still rather pink he hurried up the stairs ginny made a mental note to ask hermione later what exactly she had said to him ginny had been racking her mind for a solution any solution and as of yet she hadntcome up with anything she bit her lip nervously and tugged on one of her curls as she tended to do when she thought she rolled over not wanting to think about it anymore and reached haphazardly for her wand lumos she whispered ah gin turn off the light i have an exam tomorrow i need to get some sleep sorry lavender nox quietly replacing her want on the bedside table she rolled over once again and silently prayed that she wouldntbe visited with images any scarier than ron and hermione having a go at it surrounded by cellophane are you completely daft woman he demanded looking extremely irate i am not wearing that i haventeven said i d go with you oh but please drackie we would be soooooooo cute together pansy said putting an extra accent and girlish giggle at the word so she thrust the offending article at him and he glared at it in obvious disgust it was a lacy frilly something trying to disguise itself as a costume it was meant to be a dragon draco was pretty sure but falling miserably short of its intentions the frock brought the words green rhino to draco mind and unless he was trying to entertain a bunch of five year olds with balloon animals there was no way he would even let the thing touch his perfect skin the matching costume which he couldnteven begin to imagine what it was supposed to be reminded him of a big neon pink flamingo did you not just hear me i am not wearing this i donteven want to go with you i thinking of asking that pretty ravenclaw girl from transfiguration they both knew it was a lie draco would have liked nothing better then to not have to go with pansy but social responsibility dictated otherwise she had since a very young age been on the list to potentially become his future bride and while the malfoys had long ago discarded her name they didntfeel the need to disclose this information to her father as he still continued to give generous donations to all of lucius many business enterprises his father intended to milk money out of the family for the longest time possible before having to break the news to mr parkinson that his daughter was a pug faced brat who would never tarnish the malfoy name or gene pool draco would have liked nothing better than to tell her that very thing right then just to spite his father not to mention to keep the little tart away from him but he knew doing so would incur lucius wrath draco you dont really mean that do you i mean you would never really leave me would you she attempted to make her voice silky smooth and seductive she failed horribly just shut up parkinson i not wearing this and that final if you insist on going with me then so be it but i not wearing some bleeding ridiculous costume now get out of here she simpered and ran out the room idiot he sighed and sat down on the couch in his dorm room blaise entered smiling brightly pansy just ran out of here crying like a banshee good job mate he clapped draco happily on the back but then paused when he saw the look on draco face still no answer he asked draco shook his head no not in four freaking weeks merlin i cantbelieve i was stupid enough to leave her alone with that monster he looked up at blaise with eyes full of unshed tears if anything happened to her his voice cracked if it had been anyone but blaise draco would have been horrified at this show of emotion that was so unlike him calm cool collected that was draco malfoy not some blubbering soft idiot but this was blaise the only person he didnthave to pretend around the only person he could trust draco wasnta gryffindor sacrificing wasntin his nature but blaise knew that if he ever needed anything that he could go to draco and he would get whatever he required in excess it was true draco was a fierce enemy but he was an even fiercer friend no one seemed to understand that there were so many layers so many masks and misconceptions that he had built up over the years to hid himself he knew that if you were brave enough to get through all those layers you d find a pretty decent guy underneath not that it wouldntbe hard draco fought like heck to keep anyone from encroaching his meticulously kept barriers blaise had once heard an old proverb that stated if you pushed something away and it came back it was meant to be draco put a whole new meaning to that he sat down next to his blond friend and put a comforting hand on his shoulder hey i sure she alright she dealt with him way before your time besides i ve met your mum and she a clever woman she ll take care of herself then why wontshe answer me she must know it driving me mad draco yelled knowing no one could hear him through the charmed door for a moment blaise said nothing i dontknow he finally said i just dontknow okay for those of you who didntget it marabel morgan wrote a book that become rather infamous she wrote that women shouldntneed to further their education at a university but should instead study upon the wants and needs of a husband as to be more pleasing it was supposedly very anti feminist one of the more famous things from the bok was the suggestion that to keep your relationship passinate you should greet your husband at the door wrapped in saran wrap is that what it called in england you know the plastic stuff you wrap your food in before putting itin the refrigerator and notiong else review please pretty pretty please with sugar on top hey sorry it took so long to get this chapter out but at least it long right right any ways i was sick for two days and missed school so i had a ton of makeup work so i didntwrite fora while and now i at my sister dorm room she in college obviously using her insuferable laptop and it taken me like three hours longer then it normally would have to finish this chapter so i hope ya ll like it disclaimer i own nothing except the plot unfourtunatly i am not j k rowling and i do not own any of this so dontsue me actally i have nothing to take if you sue me soi guess it doesntmatter had it been up to her she would have stayed home and sulked and eaten cake all night then hermione had come to her for help for the costume contest and she had accepted for hermione sake if it had been up to her she would have thrown a sheet over her head for her costume but of course aside from the fact that that would have been insulting to nearly headless nick and other ghosts hermione had forbid her if it had been up to her she would have pulled the covers over her head and hid of course it was not up to her so as she entered the great hall in a foul mood she sighed and tried to keep her mind off of tom descending the stairs at a careful pace she felt like a princess from one of the fairytales she had once so longed to live holding the hem of her dress up so as not to fall she felt as if any moment the music would stop and every eye would turn to watch her grand entrance perhaps victorian in style though she wasntsure the black and red dress more black than red was striking but not raffish it fit her nicely without being unseemly which considering she had not given hermione her measurements was probably the result of a fitting charm where once the neckline had been so low as to be inappropriate it now heightened at ginny insistence reached as far up her torso as her collarbone while the actual skirt of the dress was black an under layer of crimson became apparent as she walked the dark material of the dress complemented her creamy skin and emerald eyes shone like gems from behind a mask as dark as raven wings she let out a slight sigh of relief as she reached the bottom of the flight thankful that she hadnttripped or otherwise embarrassed herself the whole hall was buzzing with excitement she felt as though she had entered a whole new world the normal halloween decorations the pumpkins and jack o lanterns the dancing skeletons the bats were all up as usual but were once the great hall was a palate of only house colors and dreary gray stone walls colors of every shade whorled around her in a rainbow of shades like a stranger on a foreign planet she studied the strange costumes that surrounded her the music was nearly drowned out by the excited chatter of students and the exhilaration of the atmosphere was intoxicating it was as though everything in hogwarts had shed its dull exterior and come to life in vibrant shades just for the occasion hello ginny luna from behind a pale blue mask said in her singsong voice you look lovely adorned in bright magenta robes trimmed in white luna herself looked extremely pretty at least in ginny opinion the color amazingly suited her and set apart her eyes which ginny until this moment had never noticed were such an unusual shade of baby blue and flattered her pale blond hair it gave her an almost ethereal quality she had long ago stopped telling her friend such things though because such trifle matters as beauty couldntbother luna lovegood luna linked arms with neville s who smiled shyly at his escort looking at gin he said you look amazing gin good i feel like a moron ginny said the costume certainly hadntbeen her idea then again she should have known better then to let hermione pick it out unsupervised they harry ron and hermione had probably taken her refusal to accompany them to the shop to pick out a costume as a desire not to go to the ball which to some degree it was but the decision was also guided but her newly acquired hatred of sales people but she really didntwant to explain the story that had led her to an innate fear of sales associates to them ever since meeting daisy that day at hogsmeade she d thought twice before entering any store i guess i had better go i have a job you know i suppose you two have already entered the contest they nodded darn i have a bet going with harry to see who can ear the most money by the end of the night well then off you go dear see ya ginny good luck neville called dismissing all dark thoughts she smiled and wandered aimlessly through the crowd of gryffindors oddly enough even at a party such as this the housed still seemed to stick to their own only a few outsiders dating a member of another house dared to leave their respective group deciding the best place to start would be with the ravenclaws all of whom with the exception of luna harry had been avoiding like the plague since the cho chang incident ginny with a few polite greetings to her housemates hurried over towards a group of ravenclaw girls hello she said slightly unsure of herself would any of you be interested in participating in the costume contest one girl a pretty brunette sneered as if get a life insulted and angered by the thought of losing to harry ginny opened her mouth to retort when a voice cut her off ignore her she just jealous of hermione because she didntmake head girl michael and i would love to join though ginny was slightly unnerved when she turned around to face cho and her most current fling ginny previous boyfriend michael corner though it was true she had dumped michael it hadntexactly been a clean break awkwardness was bound to ensue whenever they were forced to be together he smiled hesitantly and she weakly returned the gesture well umm gee thanks cho she accepted the two proffered sickles from michael ironically cho ended up being her saving grace glancing back at the brunette ginny found the girl gapping open mouthed the pretty asian girl was the highest on the ravenclaw hierarchy the pinnacle of cool what she said apparently went because almost immediately every ravenclaw there formed around her to enter the contest once she finished there she glanced up at harry who was currently draining the pockets of every hufflepuff in sight ron and hermione trailed behind ron looking vaguely annoyed and not doing much of anything and hermione beaming at harry success harry saw her and gave her a very self satisfied smirked ginny in the spirit of friendly competition snorted and mouthed you wish to which harry responded by holding up a bulging leather bag filled with what ginny could only assume to be sickles she would have responded but harry was lost in the crowd once again well one thing was certain and that was that ginny weasley had no intention of losing and that left only one option slytherins she expected malice callousness indifference and all around rudeness the latter she got in abundance but her visit to the dark side was utterly lacking in the formers in fact the slytherins met her with surprising eagerness hello i was just she smiled waiting for the verbal abuse that never came at least not in the level she d expected oh i was wondering when you d finally get over here honestly pansy crinkled her little pug nose and tapped a stiletto clad foot in impatient irritation well then are you going to take my money or not dumbstruck she accepted the little silver coin form the girl oh and drackie would like to enter too she offered another coin oh no i wouldn t draco looking almost as surprised as ginny previously had shook his head then the surprise quickly turned to agitation but wouldntit be fun pansy said raising her voice in what she clearly thought was a flirtatious manner no he answered firmly she fluttered her eyelashes but i thought no but no he brought his hand sharply up beneath hers and the coin sitting in the flat of her palm flew across the room in a silver arch hey she screeched indignantly seething he said through gritted teeth go fetch in a fit of humiliation and resentment pansy stormed away a swirl of lacy blue robes draco didntfollow instead she watched as he crossed the room to the ravenclaw who had snubbed her and offered her his hand in a moment they were out on the dance floor blaise appearing from somewhere in the background shook his head can you believe that ginny asked mad as a hatter on lollipop bay blaise quirked an eyebrow but didntinquire about the unusual phrase she turned her glaze back to blaise only to find that he had been pushed away by a crowd of impatient slytherins all waiting to pay to enter the contest she accepted each with a gracious smile and polite thank you that would have made her mother proud they met her graciousness with grunts one particularly nasty looking boy grinned maliciously alright he said lowering his voice to a scheming whisper how much do i have to pay you umm a sickle no you dolt how much to win the contest i can t taken aback when she finally realized what he was asking she couldntthink to answer that he waved a thick stack of bills in front of her just this once sorry i can t this is for charity and screw the sodding house elves i want to win finally comprehension dawned the slytherins or the majority of them anyway didntwant to help the house elves probably couldntcare less they were after the prize money she stifled a laugh realizing that the amount of money the boy was offering her would probably a least double the amount he would win if he indeed was victorious loser sorry but you ll just have to compete fairly like everyone else and hope you win though admittedly it unlikely a bit of advice keep the mask on have a nice evening turning her gaze to the next person in line she effectively got rid of him as the boy walked away ginny distinctly heard him say to a friend stupid bint someone already paid her off bleeding gryffindors when the crowd had passed she smiled at blaise who had sat down at a table patiently awaiting her she fluttered her lashed in an imitation of pansy wouldntyou like to enter too blaisey poo she smiled widely and twirled around as a little girl would letting the skirt swirl around her at the new discovery that her dress perfect for spinning around in she did so again giggling madly as the hem twirled out around her in every direction almost up to her knees you look drunk he said obviously amused they spiked the punch she replied happily now spinning little half circles and then quickly changing directions listening for the satisfying whoosh of the material no they didn t trust me i d know well that my excuse and i sticking with it she said smiling i canttake you anywhere he said sighing and sounding so much like her father that she had to laugh he offered her his hand she raised an eyebrow well you look like you need a partner she smiled and let him led her to the dance floor the tune was a quick paced solo by a young myron wagtail once lead singer for the weird sisters who had once again broken up what are you suppose to be anyway blaise inquired morgan la fay she answered morgan the antagonist from arthurian legend had always fascinated her isntshe well evil evil is such a strong term more evil than snape and slightly less malevolent you know who i d say she did try to kill arthur more than once it that what you mean but she also saved his life type casting he asked with a smile hardly see i wasntexactly involved in the costume selecting process he said i figured as much right so hermione picked out the whole arthurian theme one guess who arthur harry who else anyway they at first wanted me to be guinevere but considering that ron was lancelot that was just wrong she paused and shivered anyway i insisted hermione take the part while i be morgan she was a redhead you know blaise nodded as she concluded he wasntdancing as much as he was watching ginny bop around with no apparent consideration for the beat of the song you cantdance he said after a while sure i can this is just so much more fun you re crazy i blame it on the punch she answered what punch colin arriving at their side asked nothing blaise answered i was just wondering if i could cut in colin asked wontyour girlfriend mind nah she went to the ladies toilet to freshen up which means she ll be gone at least an hour well fine but i think ginny might get lonely blaise smiled and put his arm around colin waist uhg colin cried in disgust and pushed blaise arm off ewww ginny i meant i wanted to dance with ginny the look on colin face was so comical that both blaise and ginny had to laugh he was turning a shade of red that ginny even in all her redheaded glory had never quite managed when he had gained control over himself blaise smiled and presented ginny with a mock bow she all yours watch your toes though i off to find padma as of now she still refuses to talk to me but the zabini charm will win her over eventually not likely considering i think she saw you dancing with colin here it ll take you weeks to convince everyone that you re not gay ginny said yeah especially since everyone already thinks colin gay blaise answered what i am not gay colin cried in outrage yes darling we know that but the rest of the school doesn t ginny said sadly and patted his shoulder but but i dating a girl colin was looking more flustered by the minute his face was a shade of red that rivaled her hair yeah and i heard some guys in common room making bets on how long it would take before you dumped marian for justin i but i by this time ginny couldnthelp but laugh at her friends by the time colin realized blaise was kidding he had vanished leaving a very embarrassed colin and ginny having an absolute fit stop laughing colin ordered sullen we re just having a bit of fun she chided at my expense he replied but you re such a good sport she said with a smile besides i needed a good laugh the concern was apparent in his voice as he said are you thinking about dancing she said cutting him off isntthat the reason you came over here and endured that verbal beating in the first place colin a man of strange interests liked to swing dance he had somehow convince marian to take classes with him in their spare time standing nearly a head taller than her escort swing dancing to alternative rock and wearing a dress taken straight from the fifteen hundreds she was sure they made for an odd picture which only proved to make her smile wider colin not really understanding her amusement but encouraged by her smile spun her outward as she yielded to a fit of giggles happily she spun back into him unfortunately it wasntcolin who caught her what the heck are you doing weasley they spiked the punch she answered without thinking she looked up to see whom she had crashed into draco malfoy why did he always manage to see her every time she did something clumsy ah i mean i you know what dontcare though i am glad i bumped into you she rolled her eyes bad pun hey creevey bug off colin looked uncertainly at ginny draco laughed what you think i going to take advantage of her in her drunken state i not drunk she snapped i can change that he answered sneering hey malfoy colin tried his best to puff up and look intimidating what are you going to fight me draco asked clearly amused colin small compared to ginny was dwarfed compared to malfoy ginny slapped draco on the shoulder just hard enough for a rewarding thwap not a playful slap but also not the full out blows he d received from her before a warning look creevey i not going to hurt her i just need to talk to weaselette for a minute her friend looked doubtful it okay colin i ll be right back okay but stay where i can see you colin yelled at their retreating figures ginny much to malfoy surprise put her hands on his shoulder and led him to a somewhat secluded corner weasley i know you find me irresistible but snogging me senseless in middle of a party hardly seems right we should at least find a broom closet first that disgusting well pushing me into a dark corner makes one think you re trying to seduce me i say again that disgusting then why pray tell have you lead me to said corner well you didntreally think i d trust you enough to follow you off into a dark corner where you could murder me in peace did you i like it here lots of witnesses dontyou think a malfoy and weasley talking together will arouse some suspicion he asked we re in costume remember draco snorted his silver blond hair was almost as noticeable as her weasley red the likelihood of them not being recognized was little to none besides dressed in a black shirt and black slacks the only thing costume like about his costume was the long cloak and black mask he d worn to appease pansy whining what ever i needed to talk to you about you know he slid an arm to her neck where the necklace still hung he seemed to be examining it with great care and ginny was suddenly very self conscious have you found a place he asked not removing his eyes from her collarbone unnerved she jerked away what is your fixation with my neck what are you a vampire yes he said sarcastically and i vant to suck your vlood dontchange the subject i need a few more days to make final arrangements he looked skeptical a few more days yes do you have a problem with that weasley you forget who you re talking to he wrapped his fist around the necklace and jerked pulling her head with it and forcing her to stand on her tiptoes now that he had her full attention i in control here if you do anything stupid calm down ferret i said i needed a few days so give me a few days fine one week and no more got that but i have a match got it he said giving another tug on the chain yeah good with something akin to disgust he released his hold on the trinket and turned away hey malfoy yeah he barely turned to look at her i thought you might want this back she tossed a black something across the room and on impulse he caught it soft leather met his hands and he realized with a start he was holding his own wallet thank you for your kind contribution to aoheap we appreciate your generosity she held up a gold coin a glimmering galleon before disappearing into the crowd draco was in a rage how did she always manage to get the last word how when he was supposed to be the one in control did she always find some way to humiliate him he grit his teeth in agitation that horrid little bird had some nerve pulling out the ring he fingered it in frustration he had never met someone as spirited as her before glancing at the clock he decided that it was a safe bet that she was asleep already lying down and clenching the ring in his fist he said entrar r ve and suddenly the world melted away that was the most exhausting night of my life harry said rubbing his neck and tomorrow going to be even longer you do remember the terms of our bet right ginny said with a smile yeah i still cantbelieve someone gave you a whole galleon who was it malfoy she answered the amazing bouncing ferret no way ron looked stunned how why i threatened him with another bat bogey hex she winked ron laughed ginnyweasley you had better be kidding hermione looked shocked maybe ginny said grinning mischievously well i for one am very pleased with tonight turn out hermione beamed we made nearly two hundred galleons for the house elves yeah but daphne greengrass ron said why did a slytherin of all people have to win ron be sensible we had to judge fairly now i off to bed night gin harry ron she punctuated ron name with a brief kiss before going up stairs yeah night guys ron said kissing ginny on the forehead before going into the boy dormitory harry sitting on the couch next to her said gin do you want to come and sleep in our room tonight just in case the dreams come thanks harry but i okay see you tomorrow as she made her way up the stairs she glanced back at harry huddled form and couldnthelp notice he looked slightly disappointed she paused struck by a thought halloween was a hard time for harry her presence had not just been to comfort herself but also him halfway up the stairs she turned harry i changed my mind can i come yeah sure thanks i ll just go get my blanket and be right back she climbed the remaining stairs and grabbed her sheets off the bed hermione geez gin it night go to sleep lavender groaned from her bed sorry ginny did you need something hermione asked coming out of the bathroom wrapped in a bathrobe yeah i bunking with the guys tonight see you in the morning yeah goodnight hello ginny darling go away voldemort her voice was filled with quiet determination tom raised an eyebrow voldemort is it why so formal virginia go away i hate you she spat she tried to walk away but turning she found him in front of her again stop that why what wrong love stop that i truly hurt you dontwant to see me no get away from me that hardly seems fair i haventdone anything to you are you kidding haventhurt me you he sighed exasperatedly that again you would have killed me i sorry but that the kind of thing people tend to hold grudges about i wouldnthave killed you i need you he took her hand in his and rubbed the back of it with his thumb i d miss you too much you left me bleeding to death in the chamber if harry hadntcome i d be dead potter he spat potter came and screwed up my plans of letting me die geez woman get over that already he teased with an amused smile then he sombered as soon as i had killed harry i was going to bring you back stupid git just wouldntdie i needed his energy for you you you would have killed harry to bring me back she was in a state of shock he expendable you you i need you re so powerful so important to my plans you re plans you ll join me and together i ll never join you she brought the back of her hand sharply across his face she raised her hand to hit him again how dare you he grabbed her wrist halfway and pulled her toward him how dare you strike me you wretch he slapped her hard across her face stop stop tom her eyes welled with tears of pain or possibly anger though he couldnttell the word tom brought him back from his rage as if something had broke inside him the anger slipped from his eyes as quickly as it had come his grip on her arms loosened i i so sorry ginny i d never hurt you i just i just get away from me just get away i never want to see you again but ginny i dontsay anything just stop but ginny i love you draco eyes flew open his head felt like it was splitting open and the world was spinning when his vision finally focused he realized he was staring right into the face of harry potter harry the voice was hoarse and groggy not his own but not unfamiliar to him wake up it was just a dream suddenly the world was spinning again and harry face disappeared and draco was left once again in the darkness of his room harry was standing over her when she woke ron too was awake and sitting up in his bed harry she asked wake up it was just a dream she sat up and sighed sorry i woke you it alright ron said says who dean asked grumpily from his bed dean ron said in a warning voice fine she could hear him roll over in his bed then a moment later his sheets rustled again well dash it all i awake now and i cantgo back to sleep ron stood and turned the lights on ginny could now see that harry face was haggard and pale obviously he hadntslept well either well since we re all up she glanced at neville who was still asleep in his bed nothing would wake him up who up for a game of exploding snaps sorry to all of you who were holding your breath for d g action not so much in this chapter i swear that this story will eventually earn its place in the romance catagory it coming i promise i love my reviewers a huge thank you toeveryone you re better than cookies please please please review another rather long chapter woohoo all my reviewers are awesome you re infiniatly better then cookies hope you enjoy disclaimer all situations and charecters belong to the amazing j k rowling the only thing that belongs to me is the plot draco woke the next morning with a horrible headache he hadntbeen able to go back to sleep after what he had heard last night tom was voldemort tom was voldemort no matter how many times he thought it it still sounded wrong it all made sense now in his second year someone a girl had been taken into the chamber of secrets now he knew that girl was ginny weasley he tried to remember her how she acted what she would have looked like in her first year small he remembered that even now though she was roughly average height she still seemed small she must have been tiny then she had also always appeared somehow nervous almost anxious to him it made sense now why she had been under the control of tom riddle future dark lord he knew it had been a student who opened the chamber but somehow he had always assumed it had been someone older then him maybe a sixth or seventh year but instead it had been the little weasley a first year he clenched his fists true there was no love lost between the weasleys and himself but still to use an impressionable child was wrong his father hand had been in this he had known that even as a child then he had been filled with pride that his father was laying the road for the new rise of the dark lord now he was filled with an indescribable shame it almost made him feel guilty enough to go easy on the poor girl almost ginny rubbed her neck admittedly sleeping on the floor and then quidditch practice was a bad combination but throw in a night in the infirmary and she was about ready to collapse she hadntreally been in the mood to come but she had had little homework that night and she knew she probably wouldntbe able to come in again until at least thursday long night weasel draco sneered she sighed she was really not in the mood to deal with him today yet all day he had been unusually persistent in his ridicule what do you want she snapped her temper was not something she could always control on the best of days let alone one like today where she had used the word sucked to the point where it lost all meaning nothing just thinking i never gave potter as much credit as he deserved if he got you this tired i cantgive him points for good taste though what do you oh my gosh you think i and harry we if he was implying what she thought he was implying he was in for a world of pain how dare you how dare you imply that harry and i she trailed off really really not wanting to finish the sentence come on weasley stop acting innocent you were seen entering his bedroom at night and not leaving until morning he said looking disgusted the bedroom that is also shared by my brother and two other boys she half yelled he raised an eyebrow i didnttake you for that kind of girl she didntseem to understand then after a second of silence her face lit up with understanding ewww that disgusting look i dontknow how in the heck you would know this she knew no one in gryffindor would say anything that might lead to rumors and i certainly dontfeel the need to defend myself to you but i slept on the floor between ron and harry beds i ron wasntsleeping well and he wanted someone near him gee and i thought it was bad when i thought you were with potter but your brother he smirked why must you be such a disgusting pig not everything everyone says is dripping with innuendo how many times can i say this before it gets through your thick skull i don t like harry potter she paused her rant only briefly for a breath before continuing i dontknow what your problem is did your parents not love you enough when you were a child oh wait i forgot i talking to death eater jr shut up your father must be so proud that you re following in his footsteps and your mother i said shut up leave her out of this the outburst was not characterized by his normal cool self contained anger but instead by a visible passion so unlike him that ginny fell silent he was panting and a quick look at his hands revealed fists clenched so tightly around his wand that his knuckles had gone white for draco the silence was uncomfortable especially with the girl staring at him as if she had discovered a new species of particularly loathsome bug for a while he was sure that she was just trying to decide what would be the most painful way of disposing of him but then the heat of her anger melting away he saw her eyes soften you really love her dontyou well who says there no honor among thieves she said but the question was not harsh nor was her tone mocking instead it was kind and filled with a gentle sort of wonder she my mother and malfoys are not thieves he answered defensively she frowned that doesntanswer the question it was his turn to frown of course it does she my mother you donttalk that way about your father she stated curtly you re infuriating merlin you canteven say it you canteven say the word love can you i pity you i dontneed your bleeding pity weasel she shook her head i leaving it not time to go he called after her i ll come back tomorrow she answered without turning and then she was gone madame pomfrey stuck her head in from the next room what was all this yelling about we weasley just remembered she had somewhere else to be she said she was sorry and she d be in tomorrow to make up the time oh well okay she really such a dear responsible child isntshe he rolled his eyes in disgust but the woman didntnotice oh well there really no reason to keep you any longer you may go mr malfoy but donttell that professor snape i let you out early quite a stickler for the rules that man she said shaking her head before she disappeared again before he left draco caught just a peek of what she was doing she was mesmerized by a book whose cover was decorated with a big busted woman dressed in a tight fitting corset and a shirtless man below the picture in shimmering red letters was printed the title of the book naughty naughty he shuddered some things were just too weird to contemplate homework finished and infirmary shift ended he went to bed early that night but couldntfind any peace thoughts of the annoying redheaded chit swam through his head it certainly wasntas though he wanted her pity the very thought of it disgusted him she was a weasley her whole house was worth less then his broom if anything he should pity her she had a knack for getting under his skin that topped even that of her maddening older brothers they at least had been easy to deal with insults threats and even fighting easily solved conflicts but with her it was different she could get inside his head like no one else had managed or dared to do with the exception of his closest friends and family it probably had something to do with those eyes blaise had looked at him when he had returned from the infirmary in a strut with that look that he used whenever draco was being thick well draco knew what blaise thought and he knew he was wrong blaise thought he fancied the littlest weasley which of course was ridiculous he was adult enough to admit she was attractive any dolt with eyes could see that but that certainly didntmean he liked her he loathed her he hated her with the very essence of his being true he didntwish for her death and humiliation as he did potter but that was not any indication of a romantic interest in her then why a voice in his head asked were you so relieved when she told you she didntlike potter i wasnt he answered but here alone in the darkness of the room he had to confront the fact he had been ignoring all evening well he thought maybe just a little but not because i fancy her i dontfancy her he justcouldnthave her getting too close to potter just in case the boy blunder could somehow thwart his plan and remove the necklace it was extremely unlikely but scar head was a master of dumb luck after christmas holiday ended he didntcare what the weaselette did but until that necklace comes off he thought she mine hey ginny can i talk to you harry asked ah sure what is it i d just like to thank you for last night he said he looked nearly as tired as ginny felt their game of exploding snaps had ended abruptly when dean burnt off the majority of his left eyebrow after that the four had entered a rousing game of wake neville up only when ginny finally summoned a pitcher of cold water to dump over the boy head did he wake from his slumber in a rather foul mood after they had exhausted their game ideas i know a game we can play dean said winking suggestively at ginny harry couldntdecide who was more red ginny or her brother they had moved on to simply raiding the room for sweets and staying up until nearly four in the morning talking ginny had known she would be tired in the morning but she didntwant to go back to sleep and she could tell from the look of him neither did harry so she had stayed up always keeping the group busy she smiled brightly at her friend you re a great guy harry glad you think so you mind writing that on all the stalls in the girls loo she laughed you wish potter he sighed well it was worth a shot how d it go guys harry asked hopefully only half sitting in the bed he looked over the rest of his mud splattered team the group looked around before ron finally spoke sorry harry we were close though harry head fell a day before their match against ravenclaw he had suffered a slight quidditch injury normally madame pomfrey would have been able to fix his broken leg in an instant but it seemed harry had acquired immunity to the spell needless to say he was not at all please with being unable to compete in the match but had eventually agreed to stay in bed like a good patient until his leg healed at the insistence of his team ron was brilliant ginny said the other team only scored once ron nodded ginny was really the amazing one though you should have seen her ginny had played as seeker in harry absence the substitute chasers werentthat great and gin got really ticked so she flew down and gabbed the quaffle out of the ravenclaw hands herself nearly knocking the poor kid off his broom colin who had joined them in the hospital added excitedly yeah and then she threw it straight through the goal ron finished i got it all on film colin squealed ginny blushed slightly mostly she was just relieved they hadntfelt the need to repeat her exact words you do realize that the bloody goal is that way this is a ball now get it through the stinking goal to harry yeah but madame hooch wouldntlet us keep the points ginny said technically a player wasntallowed to touch any ball save they were in pursuit of and of course the bludgers if they happened to be hit by one in grabbing the quaffle she had broken the rules but at least she must have had some effect on the chasers because after that they had made four more goals then i saw the snitch ginny said annoyed i was closest to it if my broom had been as fast as hers i would have gotten it way before cho sorry harry that all right gin harry said everyone present started this was not the reaction anyone had expected from harry ginny he noticed looked more shocked then the others her face was slightly pale and she seemed to be trying to take deep breaths he grinned think of it this way now we play hufflepuff there no way we could lose on the other hand slytherin and ravenclaw have to face off if we re lucky they ll kill each other and we ll win by default and then we ll gin what wrong harry asked causing everyone to turn ginny faced white and her hand had gone to her neck i just i just realized what time it was i promised someone i d meet them her voice was harsh and strained well okay you sure you re alright fine i got to go i ll visit you later harry sorry hey you re not going to meet a guy are you ron called after her but she was already gone well that was weird hermione said yeah that okay gin harry said comfortingly but ginny concerns had turned from their quidditch loss to the familiar burning on her chest what now she thought she breathed deeply trying to appease the intense pain emanating from the cold gem around her neck harry smiled think of it this way now we play hufflepuff there no way we could lose on the other hand slytherin and ravenclaw have to face off if we re lucky they ll kill each other and we ll win by default ginny couldntconcentrate on what he was saying cold hard wires seemed to be coiled around her chest constricting her lungs her whole mind was filled with the insatiable urge to move invisible ropes were pulling at her drawing her away from harry bed and closer to the door closer to draco malfoy she realized with a start it was saturday exactly one week after the ball she had to talk to him tonight and then we ll gin what wrong harry asked she looked up startled to find everyone attention had turned to her resisting the pull of the necklace was tiring and painful and she could feel drops of cold perspiration running down her prayed they wouldntnotice i just i just realized what time it was i promised someone i d meet them she tried to be calm but her voice sounded pained even to her own ears well okay you sure you re alright harry looked slightly confused as he said it fine i got to go i ll visit you later harry sorry he nodded farewell still looking baffled but didntquestion her thank god for harry hey you re not going to meet a guy are you she heard ron yell as she left but she didntanswer running didntfeel like running she wasntaware of her legs moving back and forth beneath her she didntknow where she was going but the ropes were pulling her and she knew where they led the pain would end though she moved as fast as her tired legs would carry her she still felt slow then abruptly the pain stopped she looked around taking in her surroundings she was in the dungeons and as far as she could tell she was alone malfoy she called she heard nothing but her echo and the dreary sound of water dripping onto the cold stone floor malfoy she called again not liking the silence for a moment she contemplated the possibility that he actually wasntthere but then discarded it almost immediately realizing the throbbing wouldnthave stopped if he were not present her next foolish thought was that maybe the necklace had stopped working she pulled at the clasp but much to her disappointment the necklace remained closed tightly malfoy i know you re here if you dontcome out this instant i ll just leave she called i counting to three one two three fine i from behind her a strong arm grabbed her pulling her into a corner hey i but she couldntfinish because a hand presumably belonging to the arm that was wrapped around her waist was over her mouth silencing her gees woman cantyou take a hint shut up a voice whispered in her ear she obliged because short of gnawing off her assailant hand she really had no other option she listened for a moment hearing only the sound of the water still dripping obdurately then footsteps echoing throughout the hall her attacker trusting her not to scream removed his hand and felt her push her body closer to his her back was meet by his hard chest and though the thought of contact with his body in any way shape or form made her skin crawl she nestled her body even closer against his so whoever was approaching wouldntsee them she waited until the footsteps had pasted and faded out of hearing range before stepping out of her hiding place why couldntyou just tell me someone was coming malfoy she yelled outraged at the blond as he sauntered out of the corner well i thought you d take the hint obviously not besides if they recognized our voices it would lead to suspicion he said and then lowered his voice now did you find a place yes but not here he snapped follow me without waiting for a reply he started off she followed grateful for the momentary delay because what she had to tell him he really wasntgoing to like i cantdecide whether i like this chaper or not itwas justkind of a filler chapter leading into the next one where you all learn as if you dontalready know where draco will be staying for christmas i knowi didnttouch too much on draco feelings about the whole tom riddle lord voldemort thing but it will definatly come up again i trying to keep all the charecters as in charecter as possible please review with any comments or suggestions or just soi know whether people are actually reading this or not but most of all because reviews make me happy the next chappie will come soon i hope but swim season is just starting up shudder so it might take me longer then usual to update at least until school ends but i ll try to write quickly especially since the next chapter is going to be a lot of fun to write mad love chapter 19 i so proud of myself this is the longest story i ve ever written yeah okay enough exclamation points now disclaimer i own nothing you reconize from the harry potter books he moved quickly and never paused to look back at her or make sure she was keeping up then again he had the necklace as assurance she wouldntrun away she followed him down the dim corridor until he stopped at a portrait of salazar slytherin scowling at her he held up a hand indicating her to stay where she was again she obeyed purebloods he muttered and with an audible creak the portrait swung open how original she murmured slytherins never really were a creative lot draco poked his head in looked around and turned back to her all clear follow me the slytherin common room was beautiful everything about it boasted wealth and good taste the floors where not covered with lush green carpet were white marble she lost all thoughts of being n a dungeon while the room was chilly the fire blazing in the large fireplace kept it from being cold soft green armchairs and small tables surrounded the room it was not at all cold or aloof as she had imagined it it actually seemed inviting what the matter weasley draco sneered never been in a room this nice before no i just never knew it was possible to have so much green in a room without it imploding from outside they heard voices hurry come with me he called and led her to the staircase on the left side of the common room unlike the ones in gryffindor these led down instead of up when he reached the door on the very bottom he murmured a password and it swung open just as they heard the main portrait rasp that was close ginny said he nodded from above them she heard music what are they doing up there she asked having a party he answered what the occasion you dontwant to know yes i do she said a little frustrated he shook his head and said gryffindor lost quidditch but we werenteven playing slytherin do they do this every time we lose basically lovely now is there something you needed to know she asked sharply you said you found a place where her face lost some of its edge you re not going to like it where remember i wouldntbe saying this unless i had considered every other option just tell me where well the burrow she said quickly the what he questioned the burr my house you ve got to be kidding me i afraid not i hate really hate the thought of you being at my house but if you think about it it actually one of the safest places you could be i mean with harry there no way no way am i spending my christmas with weasel sr and potter well the way i see it you donthave much of a choice look there will be twenty four hour guard and no one would ever think to look for you there you wontlike it but you ll be safe he was silent for a moment you planned this didntyou he asked but it wasntan actual accusation he knew she was almost as displeased with the situation as he was yes she answered sarcastically what else do i live for if not to spend all day thinking of ways to make draco malfoy miserable i even dream about it at night you dream about me oh kinky i like it you are such a freak do you realize that yes yes i do he said looking up at her and licking his lips disgusted she groaned listen i know you want me he said with a smirk but you ll have to get past the fact that i irresistibly sexy and we re in a bedroom at least long enough that we can talk about this everything been worked out all you have to do is come up with an excuse to daddy dearest why you arentcoming home for christmas simple i ll tell him potter and his crew are staying for the holiday and i want to spy on them if that doesntwork i ll just simply not show up you spy on harry he not the only one he said raising his eyebrow suggestively suddenly she felt very bare in her soiled quidditch uniform you are such a pervert she said after a moment of uncomfortable silence she shifted on her feet and sighed how long before they re done she asked pointing upward to the source of the blaring music and cheering do you goody goody gryffs ever have parties she nodded and how long do they normally last he asked oh merlin you mean they ll be up there all night he nodded how am i supposed to get out of here she asked well you could just walk out he stated yeah and have a bunch of gossipy slytherins see i can only imagine the rumors no not an option besides what happened to arousing suspicion well then weasley looks like you re spending the night are you serious i dontkid bout spending the night he said solemnly i cantstay here is this some plan for ultimate revenge some sick twisted plot to ruin my life despite what you may think weasley i do have better things to do then torment you the world doesntrevolve around you that great coming from a guy who cries when he runs out of hair gel hey i do not cry so true it more a whimper really commented his mirror he glared menacingly at it do you want me to throw the hairbrush again he snapped i swear i ll kill the man who invented enchanted mirrors ginny sighed she really wasntseeing any other option if she walked out it was impossible to depart without at least a dozen slytherins seeing her that was sure to led to gossip of what exactly she and the infamous slytherin prince were doing alone with the doors locked of course hogwarts smarter population they would realize that there was no possibility that a malfoy and a weasley were engaging in any inappropriate activities and that would led to a lot of questions she would really didntwant to or in some cases couldn t answer fine she said eventually moving to sit down in the wooden chair near his bed what do you think you re doing uhh sitting down no you re not he said kicking the chair away she glared well look at yourself he commanded and gestured to the mirror she was mud splattered and wet it had rained during the match not enough to be called a storm but defiantly enough to ensure every player was now wet and dirty her hair was tangled and flying in all directions she felt stupid standing in the lovely room dressed like a bum you do look rather pitiful dontyou dear the mirror said kindly malfoy grinned i starting to like this thing more and more he said i cantstand all night she said looking rather annoyed when he didntanswer she crossed the room and knelt beside a large wooden chest she opened the lid adorned by a small gold plate that read zabini and began rummaging through its contents what do you think you re doing he asked getting clothes she snapped standing back up holding a pair of cotton shorts and a t shirt that was clearly too big for her even in perfect condition the quidditch robe would have been uncomfortable to sleep in the bulky knee and shoulder pads where irritating and awkward and the stretchy material was all together too clingy for ginny tastes i assume you have a shower he pointed as head boy his was the nicest room in the dormitory and had it own bathroom good she went to the small room he had indicated as the shower paused and turned to look at him what he asked annoyed you think i ll look in on you i not that desperate no one that desperate she glared at him and closed the door he was positive he heard her whisper a locking charm as it shut she seemed to take forever in the shower when the sound of running water finally stopped encouraged by his incessant pounding on the door it took what seemed like another eternality for her to finally emerge when she did she looked much more comfortable at least as comfortable as she could be considering she was in the bedroom of draco malfoy the t shirt a plain white chudley cannons shirt was at least five sizes too big for her and reached at least halfway down her thighs the tips of her black shorts barely peeked out from below its hem finally he said trying not to think about how lovely her bare cream legs looked because even if she was a weasley there was still a pretty girl in his bedroom and he was still a teenager he brushed past her and into the bathroom less then five minutes later he emerged wearing green satin pajamas pants and a matching shirt unbuttoned halfway down his chest with one hand he was drying his hair with a towel the other too contained a towel weasley why was this covering the mirror i dontlike mirrors she said blushing and looking pointedly at the enchanted mirror hanging on his wall i kept feeling like it was looking at me he rolled his eyes the bathroom mirrors arentenchanted oh she said as she watched him discard the towels carelessly on the floor he sat down on the bed and suddenly something occurred to her she looked from his side of the room to blaise side where blaise she asked he and toby blackwell both have a thing for one of the patil girls i forget which one anyway at first he went over there to decide once and for all who would have the honor of following her around like a puppy and getting publicly humiliated then they got over their differences and moved on to more productive topics like how to talk her into a threesome eww eww eww are you serious i know it in your genes but please try to resist the urge to be the worlds biggest git blaise and blackwell are potions partners they re working on some extra credit work so snape doesnthave to kick toby out of the advanced class they ll be there all night okay what i actually meant by that was where is blasie bed she asked because indeed there was only one bed in the room unless is there something he not telling me because that would explain a lot your hair style for one i am not gay and there is nothing wrong with my hair either well you must admit it is a little how should i put this well pretty the mirror said arg he picked up his hairbrush and hurled it across the room smashing the mirror it shattered loudly but even as the pieces fell to the ground disappearing halfway new pieces appeared and after only a moment the mirror looked completely unscathed hey it exclaimed you deserved it draco told it sullenly it didnteven hurt you ginny pointed out she was sure if the mirror had had eyes it would have been glaring yes but it very traumatic how would you like it if i hurled a brush at you point taken i sorry she said shaking her head sadly hmph it snorted draco she noted was closely examining his hair mirror mirror on the wall who the most conceited of them all she asked but the mirror the perfect reflection of its owner was pouting too and didntreply while this has all been very fun i still want to know where the other bed is slytherin rooms were known as the only ones that didnthouse four students one reason being the little dungeon rooms were too small to hold four and also because the teachers were probably worried that if four slytherins were put together and expected to get along the world as it was would end blaise took it with him draco said dismissively he took it with him he pronounced it all very slowly as if she were dumb while never taking his eyes off his reflection come on narcissus pay attention what he asked never mind now he took the bed with him how many times do we have to go through this well if you would explain maybe i wouldnthave to stand here asking the same question over and over he shrunk the bed and took it with him why didnthe just sleep on the floor she asked malfoy stared blankly at her oh right stupid question he sat down on the bed and patted next to him dontworry he said smirking i can share share no way it your fault i stuck here i get the bed i dontthink so he said want to bet wingardium leviosa she called and he found he was being lifted off the bed she deposited him on the couch hey do you really want to be on the receiving end of my bat boogey hex she asked he shivered having seen he perform the curse on a particularly nasty fourth year who had been hazing a younger hufflepuff the experience was not one he wished to reenact first hand mmmm soft she said lying down she then tossed him a blanket enjoy it i ll have to burn the sheets can i at least have my pillow he whined she tossed it to him frowning he threw it back that is not my pillow he said annoyed she threw him another one still not my pillow he said she held up yet a third nope not it well if you didnthave so many bleeding pillows i could find it come and get it yourself he walked over to the bed leaned down over her until his body was so close to hers that he could feel her warm breath on his face he heard her breath in sharply and with a smirk leaned just a bit farther down satisfied when she shivered cold weasley yes it freezing down here she said only inches separating their faces he smirked again i know a way we could keep warm and by the way he said sweetly you re on my pillow and before she could have time to react he jerked the silk clad cushion from below her head snickering he returned to the couch jerk she cried and threw another pillow hitting him square in the face he turned and glared and despite herself ginny giggled she couldnthelp it no matter how hard he glowered he just couldntlook intimidating in pajamas he looked moderately put out but didntreply she slid underneath the covers and fluffed the remaining pillows trying to find a comfortable position going to bed he asked sounding mildly surprised yes sleepy she answered but it only ten o clock he said late are you kidding me he asked early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise she replied groggily and now we know why benjamin franklin never had kids goodnight malfoy oh and if you get any ideas i swear you ll wake up missing some very vital bpdy parts lilacs the whole room smelled of lilacs the fragrance filled her nose and the intensity of it left her head spinning it was intoxicating she took a deep breath savoring the sweetness of it suddenly she found herself being lifted off the ground by two strong arms she was cradled tightly against a man chest and the feeling of his steady breath rocking her body like the ocean was comforting she sighed contented and leaned closer against him wrapping her arms around his neck again she breathed in deeply and over the fragrance of lilacs she smelt the strong clean scent of soap and a vaguely familiar aroma that was distinctly male she couldntplace it but it was so familiar she jumped back with a start and looked into the face of her companion tom put me down she ordered beating her fists against his chest he laughed even as she continued her assault so fickle darling and here i thought it was going rather well let me go she yelled letting her voice raise an octave on each word but we re not there yet he said grinning down at here as though he couldnteven feel the blows now close your eyes the world went dark and feeling utterly betrayed she realized her body had obeyed she knew she wasntin control anymore this was tom realm open them he ordered softly setting her down despite herself she gasped the round bed he had set her down on was soft molding to every curve of her body as if in some child fantasy world it was placed on a pedestal of white marble and surrounded by a sheer curtain smooth and thin as silk everywhere was lilacs with a smile at her reaction he pulled away the canopy to give her a better view of what lay beyond her perch a clear blue lake shimmering like sapphires in the bright sun greeted her weeping willows graceful branches hanging in dignified arcs covered the shoreline sea gulls called merrily to her from above the clouds were tinted pink as the first sings of sunset approached it was truly without a doubt the most beautiful place she had ever seen do you like it he asked his voice filled with a hint of boyishness the lilacs are they still you re favorite wordlessly she nodded good i had hoped you would i made it just for you for us she stared up at him startled what this and so much more can be yours if you just join me his voiced was strained with what sounded like earnest longing he took her small hand in his it the only way we can be together she couldntstand those eyes looking at her those eyes once so filled with concern and caring looked upon so trustingly now only filled her heart with coldness she laughed spitefully surprising even herself at how cold and bitter she sounded never tom do you know what you have become now you re not even a fraction of what you once were you arenteven really alive it only a matter of time before harry destroys you you re just a memory now wench he cried jumping with catlike grace to her side horrified she scrambled to her seat slipping on the smooth sheets horrid wretched slut how dare you she had untangled herself enough to stand but tripping over the sheer canopy she fell to the ground he closed in on her like a vulture rushing to its fallen prey with one sturdy arm he pinned her shoulders against the cold marble floor the other hand wrapped around her neck so tightly she couldntbreath you will join me and i will win there nothing you or anyone can do to stop me though the effort to speech burned her throat she managed to croak you ve already lost her eyes closed the last of her breath escaping her lungs and accepted the darkness that was closing in on her then with a great crash tom arms were pushed away she inhaled as deeply as her bruised lungs would allow savoring the sweetness of the air she didntbother to open her eyes until she felt herself being lifted up again her eyes fluttered open lonely a moment but before the world dimmed again she saw a brief glimpse of silver and a new scent one that smelled like cinnamon yes the long awaited announcement of where he ll be staying as if you didntalready know narcissus if you didntknow is a charecter from greek mythology who was so handsome and conceited that when he saw his reflection he fell in love with it and wasted away thank you to all my reviewers from the last chapter you re great please please please review i love your input hi guys i soooooo sorry it took so long to update doddges rotton fruit but everythings been really hectic lately at least it a long chapter right that counts for something right right okay anyway i ll try and get the next chapter out a lot faster disclaimer i do not own any of the charecters or settings from harry potter i am only a poor poor armadillo loving author so dontsue me draco woke to the sounds of screaming it took him a moment to realize the screams were coming from outside the room he looked around and weasley was nowhere to be found for a moment he panicked until he saw stellotaped to the door a small scrape of parchment sorry it read i couldntresist so she had already left then he took a brief look around his room and everything seemed to be in order the shorts and t shirt she had worn were folded neatly and stacked on top of blaise trunk he grabbed a towel and headed for the shower confident that whatever she had done was the cause of the ruckus and if he knew her at all he was sure it would still be there after he showered and he was right when he emerged from his room dressed and showered it was immediately obvious what form her trickery had taken the once dignified room was now a mockery the floors had been covered in a shag carpet in a ridiculous shade of red the comfortable chairs had all been changed into an awful shade of bright yellow banners still in red and yellow of a rather comical snake sticking its tongue out with the mantra i know you are but what am i written across the bottom adorned the walls looking down at his robes he discovered that the slytherin crest there too had been changed not a single hint of green remained in the entire room well he murmured looks like someone recovering just fine draco draco have you seen this pansy shrill voice cried out do you see this see what he asked calmly this she said throwing her arm out widely to gesture to the d cor no i hadntnoticed for a minute she stared at him in disbelief then slowly she realized it had been sarcasm really draco your sense of humor rears its ugly head at the most inappropriate times look what those horrid little gryffindors did to our lovely room you know blaise said it wasntnecessarily gryffindor that did this are you mad of course it was them why else would it be in these awful colors maybe because slytherin hates gryffindor whoever this was clearly wanted to make an impression they knew that if they decorated our house in gryffindor colors we d be livid it could have been anyone putting up yellow and black or even blue and silver just wouldnthave had the same affect or going out a limb gryffindor could have been framed so so it could have been anyone pansy said exactly blaise answered but then who who do we she sat down obviously she couldntdecide whom she should punish for this and the stress was driving her crazy when she knew with whom the fault laid it was easy enough a few hexes would keep them miserable for weeks but this was harder it was downright psychological warfare in her opinion draco looked from her face screwed up in concentration to blaise who was fighting very hard not to laugh well draco said isntsomeone going to take it down the worst part of it was gryffindors had no fashion sense red and yellow clashed horribly we can t blaise said no matter what we try it wontchange back even snape came down and had a go at it pansy said finally he gave up he said it would have to wear off how long will that take dontknow blaise answered let go draco snape will have us strung up by our toes if we re tardy again how many times must i tell you blaise it not tardy it fashionably late blaise half pushed him out of the door once in the hall he started laughing how d she do it blaise asked through his laughter who ginny how d she get everything to change weasley what makes you think it was her oh come on this has her name written all over it how did she manage it all i dontbloody well know ask her you dontknow hmm i thought maybe it was you who let her in why the heck would i do that draco yelled dontget all defensive he smiled you have to admit it was pretty clever wasntit sure clever indeed blaise watched his friend walk away not bringing up the fact that he had a t shirt and a pair of shorts on the top of his trunk that had not been there when he left a t shirt that now smelled distinctly like vanilla when he showed up to potions she wasntthere by his magical healing class she still hadntshown up she made a brief appearance to dinner staying only long enough to scoop some food unto her plate and vanish again he noticed that even inside where it was warm and dry she wore her scarf annoyed he found himself wondering if there was something wrong darn it draco he thought annoyed you had to do it you just had to go soft didntyou a small part of him was glad she hadntshown up for classes because he wasntsure that he would be able to act natural around her he had acted based on emotions how many times had he been told as a child never to act on emotions thousands perhaps millions and yet he had done it anyway you were just being a decent human being nothing wrong with that decent another part of his head thought as if any thoughts you were having were decent he smirked a bit remembering how limp her body had been in his arms decent he reminded himself flashback she looked so helpless lying there the life slowly draining out of her of course he realized it was just a dream and therefore it could not really hurt her but still the sight was killing him you ve already lost she managed and that was the breaking point not wanting to but unable to stop himself he sprang up and pushed tom off of her landing painfully on the hard marble ground he rolled to face ginny assailant the boy was huddled on the ground he stood and with one cold hate filled glare in draco direction disappeared draco picked her up marveling at how light she was with every intention of putting her back on the bed but before he could reach it the familiar pulling sensation informed him the dream was over and the scene faded from his view she was the first thing he saw when his eyes opened immediately remembering himself he closed his eyes and listened it would look suspicious if he woke at the same time as her hearing nothing he slit his eyes open on the bed she wasntmoving his eyes flew open and he pushed away the blanket carefully he climbed onto the bed checking for a pulse it was slightly quickened but steady she had kicked away the cover and the pillows were in disarray not thinking about what he was doing he climbed closer to her and let her head rest against his shoulder after a while he closed his eyes and dozed off to sleep her stirring next to him was what woke him she rolled over once twice before slowly opening her eyes her emerald eyes widened in surprise and terror but she didntscream well good morning to you to sweetheart i her voice sounded hoarse here he took out his wand pointed it at her and whispered a painkilling spell what do you think you re doing she asked almost immediately he regretted giving her the spell you didntlook like you were sleeping well he answered simply oh right she said so you just decided to come comfort me get off or so help me i ll blast your balls off she shoved him off the bed brandishing her wand and he suppressed a smirk you wouldntknow the spell he said she raised her wand menacingly and for a moment he was afraid she would make good her threat but instead she simply said aquarious nothing happened she repeated herself several times abandoning any actual form and simply beating her wand around wildly as if she were conducting a demented version of flight of the bumblebee transfiguration was definitely not her best subject here he said aquarious a glass of water appeared in his hand he offered it to her and with a scowl she accepted it as he gave it to her their fingers touched she rubbed at her skin now i have to go shower do i turn you on that much he asked grinning up at her from where he still lay on the floor eww this time he did smirk i always knew you d end up spending the night sometime you re a pig you know what they say about those who lay with pigs he paused to look at her for a moment i really am sorry about this he said she opened her mouth to question him but before she could form the words her eyes rolled back for a brief second her muscles convulsed before her head lolled back and her body went limp he stared for a moment weasley no response smirking he asked what your full name virginia anne louise weasley her voice sounded strained and her eyes never opened for minute he stared it was strange talking to her like this her eyes were closed and to all the world she appeared asleep her voice normally so animated and full of emotion was now flat and impassive does this hurt he asked vaguely concerned that the truth serum he had slipped into her drink would cause her pain truth spells he was very familiar with but he had never used this particular one before she shook her head the rest of her body strangely still it uncomfortable though i need you to tell me everything about tom who is he voldemort i dontunderstand how that possible explain he preserved himself in a diary to give himself a second chance at immortality should he fail in the future then in my first year lucius gave you the book he finished he recalled now the first dream he had visited wondering why she could possibly be so afraid of a book she nodded at first i thought it was just a diary then it wrote back i started telling him all my secrets everything about myself so you opened the chamber how i i dontknow i cantremember he took over and i i cantremember so what does he want with you now he asked he had grown up in the shadow of voldemort and his followers all his life there had to be a reason that he would take such an interest in the girl maybe he hoped to get information about the order from her that of course draco knew was futile everyone knew they were very strict about age minimums for their members besides he had seen the many older weasels in protective mode there was no way that anyone would tell ginny of all people any information that would put her in danger yet somehow it seemed like something the dark lord would try he had a tendency to come up with stupid plans i dontknow she answered the silence that followed was eerie it was broken only when she stirred slightly and he realized the truth serum must have been wearing off hey weasley he said unable to resist you dontreally think my hair makes me look gay do you but she didntanswer instead she rolled over onto her back what time is it she grumbled dontworry go back to sleep he told her not that she had much of a choice considering how much sleeping draught he d put in her drink he leaned over and pulled the blanket up to cover her she grabbed his hand no tom he wonthurt you hurts she said i wontlet him go to sleep her eyes were squeezed tightly closed and it looked as though she d turn away then she stopped cinnamon she murmured she sunk back onto the pillows but didntrelease his hand goodnight he whispered when he thought she was asleep but then she said one last thing promise you ll be here when i wake up of course he answered after all she still had his hand he waited until her breath became slow and even again he paused a minute longer then necessary just to be sure she was really asleep this time weasley no response ginny she stirred slightly but didntwake up sorry love but i canthave you remembering this now can i she cringed slightly as he preformed the memory charm and then was still potionsthe nextday was particularly miserable normally being an avid student he had no qualms about that class but today the whole house of slytherin was in a foul mood they had hoped to keep the embarrassing state of their common room a secret but that had been impossible due to the factthat the transfiguration of the slytherin crests on their uniforms was not limited to the common room as every other aspect of the curse seemed to be and it still hadntworn off one thing was certain ginny weasley would pay for this no one jeopardized draco malfoy pride as she had done and by defiling the heart of the slytherin house she had knowingly or not thrown down a gauntlet that could not simply be ignored but of course that would have to wait until after he d figured everything else out first something very odd was going on with the weasley girl something much bigger he suspected then she could even guess his thoughts were interrupted by a large crash from outside the classroom holy freaking muffins draco smirked as ginny walked in the door in complete disarray her always wild hair was now even more disastrous then normal flying in all directions her uniform was wrinkled and askew as though she had just thrown them on as she staggered in she was still putting on her right shoe and appeared to be missing a sock if her ragged attire hadntgiven away her exhaustion the look on her face would have she was pale more so than usual and her eyes were surrounded by dark black circles okay right outside the door yeah not a good place for a gargoyle she said looking annoyed snape however was more then annoyed he was furious she was nearly half an hour late ms weasley can you please explain to me why you are late his voice was startling calm at the way her face darkened draco was sure snape had just asked the wrong question you wanna know why i late first i had to stay up all night finishing a stupid report for this class i wrote a whole freaking paper which would be great if the stupid idiots in gryffindor hadntdecided to play exploding snaps right by all my stuff look at my book she held up what had once been a book the cover was charred and black and the majority of the pages were singed her paper she explained had suffered the same fate so i spent the whole morning in the library doing the paper i was supposed to be finishing the rest of the homework i couldntdo because of the stupid paper do you know how boring goat tongues are snape opened his mouth to reply but she wasntfinished and because i was in the library i missed breakfast which would have been bad enough but oh no it gets worse peeves was in the hall singing some ridicules song and i couldntget by and i had to eat and i had to get the paper and i had i had she didntseem to know what to say she sat down on the ground in the manner of a five year old this is all your fault you greasy haired git she murmured for a moment draco thought she was talking about snape before he realized her glare was directed at him he suspected her current state had more to do with a certain raven haired dark lord and night spent in enemy territory than any essay snape however didntseem to notice that what did you call me he roared nothing i can repeat in good company she replied miss weasley i dontyou yell at me she said i had a really really bad day and i dontneed you yelling at me it not my fault you didntdo your assignment she reddened not from embarrassment but from anger i did the freaking paper it right here she pulled out her parchment and waved it wildly around do you know what the ten healing properties of goat tongue are i do then crossing her arms she said goat tongue is used to purify the liver and spleen miss weasley it can be used to help relieve the effects of poisoning from many natural poisons when boiled with dragon breath it can also be used as a source of vitamin a and b when mixed with eucalyptus leaves it miss weasley she continued ignoring all professor snape attempts to stop her mr zabini snape asked finally goat tongue is commonly used in sobering potions and as a neutralizer in unstable mixtures ginny said frowning arentyou friends with her the professor asked blaise nodded however when mixed with powdered beetles it becomes explosive ginny continued is there any way to shut her up blaise stood and walked over to ginny goat tongue is boring she said as greeting and when added to a polyjuice potion it turns green and fizzes i want to find out why it does that doesntanybody know he asked kindly the best thing to do when she was in a mood like this was humor her unless you wanted to be the proud recipient of an infamous weasley breakdown nope nobody been stupid enough to try it someday i ll find out why it does that she said i sure you will bad day the worst tell you bout it later did you know goat tongue supposedly has a bitter taste to it who would be stupid enough to eat a goat tongue or any other part of a goat for that matter i dontknow one of the great mysteries of the universe now as amusing as it was to what you have an emotional breakdown in the middle of class what it going take to get you to stop this pie she said i want pie fine he said with a glance towards professor snape who snorted but obligingly summoned a piece of pie and gave it to blaise after all every physiology book he had ever read said you were supposed to indulge lunatics goat tongue is used to fight infections of the lungs she said shyly no blaise said holding the plate just out of her reach one more fact about goats and you dontget your pie fine she said reaching for the pie he handed the plate over to her and watched as she scooped off all the whipped cream and ate it in one bite when she swallowed she grinned brightly want my pie she asked blaise returning the plate to him are you kidding me someone asked she glared pie is not a joking matter she stood wiped of her robes and took her seat as though nothing had happened blaise smiled and handed the plate back to the professor who was openly gaping she doesntlike pie he explained then why why did she whipped cream she wanted the whipped cream then why didntshe just ask for whipped cream he asked completely baffled in all his years of teaching he d never had a student behave like she had acted this morning she was clearly delusional cause then you dontget all the yummy pie flavor she said i swear you re a five year old where colin blaise asked it was his turn to watch you today i resent that she said i can take care of myself blaise snorted hence this little demonstration today was an exception i didnthave my coffee she said professor snape having finally regained control of the classroom was opening his mouth to deliver a rant that would no doubt have been the equivalent of sliding down a banister of broken glass and landing in a pool of malnourished piranhas was fortunately cut short by the bell ginny got up followed closely by blaise and walked unabashed out of the door leaving the rest of the class including her rather incensed professor gawking after a moment of awkward silence her bright red head popped back into view from the doorway oh and i suppose i ll have detention tonight after dinner she asked snape merely nodded whew finally finished umm i dontlike this chapter as much as i like the others it kinda strange but whatever i want to give a huge thank you to all my reviewers i check my mail like ten times a day just looking for reviews pathetic i know but highly entertaining please please please review for a cookie for pie licks lips umm pie wow i took forever to update sorry i haventabandoned you draco despite our pleading umm i afaid to say this chapter isntvery good it kinda the result of two weeks off and on writing i think it a little disjointed but that just me it also kind of a weird chapter anyway school just let out so i promise the next chapter will be longer and come soner and not suck hopefully just another note i found out ginny full name about a week after i first started writting this fic i do know her name is really ginevra i just didntfeel like changing it becausei think virgina prettier and because i too lazy to go back and change it every time disclaimer i am j k rowling i own harry potter everyone out there writting fanfiction is just wasting their time anyone buying this anyone didntthink so hey what was with you today is everything all right yeah everything fine i just had a bad morning a bad morning you expect me to believe that all that been bothering you nothing bothering me blaise ginny said all at once annoyed and touched by his concern listen i know you ginny weasley and i ve seen your freak outs before there are multiply levels of insanity ginny looked at him questioningly see i like to rate them on a scale of one to ten one being hexing anyone you see and forcing them to sing really bad show tunes for an hour and ten resulting in an extended visit to the hospital wing reverting back to age five and begging for pie ranks pretty high up there i just tired okay he looked at her why was it that all the sudden his friends were all keeping secrets from him he sighed okay gin but if you ever want to talk she leaned over and kissed him on the cheek you re way too sweet to be in slytherin draco sat fingering the letter he should have been more relieved happier but something was wrong his initial relief when a black and white owl had delivered his mother reply had been replaced by a subtle but constant nagging feeling that something was amiss the feeling had only become more concrete as he had reread her note he sighed there was nothing in the letter that should give him such a profound sense of wrongness and yet it was there folding the parchment carefully he placed it under his pillow he was probably so used to the idea of being paranoid that normalcy had become foreign to him he smirked at least tonight endeavor would take his mind off things draco had planned to seek revenge at a later date but how could he refuse what was given to him so conveniently there was almost ten minutes before her detention started his smirk broadened as he sat down in professor snape large wooden chair propped his legs up on the desk and just pictured what her reaction would be when she found that he was the one supervising her detention he had been brooding on the idea all day and it had become more and more appealing every moment he had almost given up the idea because despite all its allure there was no way to go about getting alone with her without rising suspicions when snape had asked him if he could oversee detentions for the night his excuse was that he had to run into town for some potion ingredients but draco was fairly sure snape motives were the same or at least vaguely similar to his own revenge slytherins were as a whole a very vindictive lot and draco was pretty sure the professor had a few guesses as to who was behind the prank in the common room a slight expected crash announced her presence moments later she couldntexactly be called graceful he heard the distant sound of laughter accompanied by creevey gratingly high voice ron almost had a heart attack when i told him you had detention with snape apparently he afraid that he ll drag you into a dark corner and have his way with you draco couldntsee her but he was almost sure she winced i in a very bad mental place right now he heard her say and it entirely your fault besides snape may be a git but that hardly makes him evil no colin said that tattoo on his arm is purely decorative in fact he thinking of getting another one maybe one with a big heart and mom written on it ginny laughed he not that bad at least i dontthink he is sometimes sometimes what gin nothing we re here want me to go in with you he asked quietly opening the door for her colin i ve had detentions before yeah but well well well draco interrupted isntthis sweet the weasel got herself a puppy colin looked vaguely insulted ginny simply looked annoyed oh very clever malfoy colin snapped thank you for noticing draco said but he was looking at ginny gauging her reaction where snape she asked suddenly he had to make a run into town he answered her face brightened so no detention tonight you wish i supervising tonight part of my duties as head boy you know he puffed out his chest slightly emphasizing the prominently placed head boy badge he sneered eagerly anticipating her gasp of surprise or anger waiting for her face to turn its customary red neither happened in fact he could discern no visible change in her expression whatsoever strange for someone whose emotions were usually so unveiled i staying colin said firmly i dontthink so for two reasons one detention is meant to be a punishment two i dontwant to have to look at your scrawny face for the next hour so just run along now no way i stay never mind i wontstay and neither will ginny come on gin colin said pulling on her sleeve i i for a moment she didntmove come on gin let go he tugged again no colin it okay i ll stay but but malfoy is just trying to make me mad if i ditch tonight i ll have another week i might as well just get it over with now she said with a sigh but ginny i colin she said warningly draco smirked and here he had thought she only spoke to him like that fine but i not happy about this he glanced in malfoy direction if you harm her in any way shape or form and i ll beat you so bad that your small intestine comes out of your ear ginny cringed colin paused that was a rather odd way of expressing myself wasntit she smiled encouragingly at him you tried draco patted his arm in mock sympathy not everyone has the gift colin really i ll be fine go she said leading him forcefully toward the exit fine but if you re not back by morning i calling the ministry colin said giving her one last doubtful look before retreating through the classroom door do you really want to be alone with me that badly i mean i know i hot but really look malfoy if this is going to work we re going to have to tolerate each other i dontwant to be friends with you i not even saying i have to like you but we re going to have to spend a lot of time together and draco didntlook terribly thrilled with that he scoffed she glared in response okay she corrected we will have to spend some time in the same general vicinity whichever way if either of us are actually going to be able to enjoy the holiday we ll have to learn to be in the same room for five minutes with out something exploding or the loss of vital body parts weasley he asked when exactly did you decide you were in charge i own you as long as that necklace is on your neck i ll do whatever i bloody well please and you ll be happy about it let not fight why donti just get started what am i supposed to be doing tonight she was angry she wouldntlet it show but she was he could see it she must have really been making an effort to be nice to him he had thought for sure that that last comment would have set her off but she sat smiling still albeit through gritted teeth when he didntreply she raised her head almost defiantly daring him to reject her offer the motion was enough to loosen her scarf slightly from its tight embrace drawing his attention to the garment it was cold in the castle especially down in the dungeons but even here there was no use for a coat she wore no jacket or cloak or any other indication that she had just come in from outside why then did the scarf remain why dontyou sit down take your scarf off get comfortable he asked attempting to sound amiable it sounded strange to his ears he thought back had she been wearing it all day the day before he wasntsure no thanks she said shifting uncomfortably from one foot to another i chill easily unconsciously he took a step closer to her pointing his wand at the fireplace he murmured a spell and watched as a bright green flame leapt hungrily from wand to wood the flare died down until only the heart of the flame burned blue better he asked and without realizing it stepped closer still i prefer to leave it on thanks what are you hiding weasley one hand wrapped instinctively almost protectively around the scarf she replied nothing he smirked not as innocent as people assume has potter taken to role playing then she stared at him in bafflement just a bit of advice but next time your speccy little boyfriend decides to become count dracula make sure he doesntleave a mark her eyes widened as she finally understood his allegation he was accusing her innocent ginny weasley of all people of having a hickey on the other hand draco was nearly praying it was as simple as that but from her expression he was pretty sure it wasn t what are you insinuating malfoy because if it anything like i think your suggesting you re dead well he said sadly reprimanding her that doesntsound very friendly of you malfoy he didntgive her a chance to riposte he took two more long steps closing the distance between them the scarf weasley not a request she backed up finding only the wall behind her she was going to refuse he could see it in her expression tucking one hand discreetly into his pocket he felt for the ring there and punctuated his non request with a sharp jab from the necklace she winced nearly imperceptibly but there nonetheless then her bright eyes shining with anger she slowly began to unwrap the scarf fold by fold he gasped as the final loop came unfastened exposing her pale neck it couldntbe but it was it had to be it wasntpossible and yet there it was he carefully put his hand to her neck not wanting to cause her pain by touching the bruise lightly he allowed his fingers to wrap around her neck following the pattern of the mark it was as he expected the perfect shape and size of a hand the image of tom closing his hand around her neck came crashing back to him he closed his eyes trying to dismiss the picture but found it only more vivid in his mind her pale face glowing with sweat growing red with pain the shallowness of her breathing her gasping for air as her throat was released he wanted to say something but couldntseem to open his mouth then again even if he had been able to he had no word to comfort her he remembered waking once from a nightmare lucius had been away on business and draco no more than five years old had snuck to his mothers room and curled up in the bed with her shush darling she had said wrapping an arm around his thin frame it only a dream it not real nothing can hurt you since when could dreams leave bruises how could he console her when the only thing he could think to say was a lie tom could hurt her he d already proven that her eyes averted until now met his for a second he was struck he had never seen such emotion before in her eyes he saw anger sadness regret confusion hatred betrayal draco couldntimagine possessing those emotions all at once there was something so very tragically beautiful about her that moment that he felt the urge to reach out and pull her into his arms to comfort her they were only a hairs width apart one step and he could close the gap and too close he thought backing away quickly way too close his whole body rebelled at the thought moving from her his whole mind trying to get as far away as possible the impulse to flee won out and he retreated several steps burning to get as far away from her as possible just go weasley he heard himself say she nodded wrapping the scarf around her neck again detention is over for the night just leave he ordered sitting down not wanting to face her and with one final look at him she did you managed to make it through yet another chapter you

faster thank you allso much disclaimer i dontown harry potter or any of the settings just the plot take that too if you want it ginny had always had classes with malfoy she d just never really noticed until now well of course she hadntbeen completely oblivious to his presence he made that entirely impossible between his snide remarks and his blatant amusement at making her angry but at least after the few customary insults her threats of violence his entirely too confident innuendos and one of them acting upon afore mentioned treats of violence and hexing the other the classes had passed in nearly tolerable silence now he was everywhere during breakfast his eyes never left her he talked normally if not more than usual with pansy but throughout the whole conversation she felt his unabashed gaze on the way down to the dungeons for potions she could hear footsteps behind her annoyed and unnerved she turned only to find there was nothing there when she continued the footsteps resumed turning again trying to catch a glimpse of her pursuer she saw nothing by the time she finally reached the classroom she was positive she had a slight case of whiplash draco malfoy entered nearly three full minutes later just as the final bell rang during the class he hardly spoke at all except to correct her use of themes when the potion clearly called for a pinch of sage although his definition of correct vastly differed from ginny s his meaning instead matched that which she had always associated with antagonize despite his uncharacteristic silence he eyes never seemed to leave her he watched her every move with an intense concentration that was so drastically out of character for the usually remote slytherin that several times she found herself shirking away from his prying eyes if she had had any doubts it had been him that she had heard in the dungeons they were removed when he took the long way to defense against the dark arts which happened to coincide with her regular route to herbology he stayed at a carefully maintained distance away from her but there was no denying that he was following her in fact he didntseem to care at all if she noticed that he was behind her or not at lunch his watch became even more unguarded he seemed to have a total disregard for the fact that his gaze was now drawing attention ginny ron said through a mouthful of potatoes looking slightly concerned i think malfoy looking at you ginny looked up from her plate which she had been studying very intently for the past several minutes and glanced at the slytherin table where the blond sat staring at her luna sighed contently ahh young love she said staring off into space with a dreamy look upon her face ron looked suspiciously at ginny apparently the thought that she and malfoy could be in love was horrifying enough to make him stop eating and considering it was ron that was quite impressive looking simply disgusted he said ginny you re not of course not ron she interrupted wrinkling her nose in distaste that just revolting you know luna said smiling male zorlacks will stare for hours upon end at a female until he decides whether or not she suitable for mating malfoy better not be even thinking about mating with my little sister or merlin help him ron stood apparently with every intention of demonstrating to malfoy just how painful having one head bashed in with a mallet could be ron i ve said it a thousand times there nothing going on between malfoy and me ginny said exasperated pulling her brother back down into his seat personally i think the whole process is rather sexist but when you re as rare as a red crested zorlack i suppose you have the right to be selective luna continued actually no including that time you ve only said it twice i would appreciate to hear it the other nine hundred and ninety eight times now he said looking from hermione fixedly reading her book to harry who had fallen asleep with his head on the table for agreement ron hermione added reasonably looking up from her book ginny dislikes malfoy nearly as much as you do supposedly there are only twenty three left in the wild luna added so really there arentthat many choices anyway fine ron would you like me to yell it right here ginny asked feeling more then a little exasperated with her brother stupidity write a song about my endless disdain for malfoys a limerick maybe yes actually he said that would be rather nice about now ron you re making a dig deal out of nothing ginny insisted temper flaring a bit ginny if there something going on between you and the ferret i have a right to know teetering on the edge of a outburst she said first off there is nothing going on second even if there was it my own business if there was is there i your brother and and what ron and you want to protect me is that it i perfectly capable of taking care of myself she said raising her voice several octaves of course you are he said looking taken aback by her sudden anger i just i just mean really you two are making a spectacle hermione said blushing slightly ginny looked around people one blond in particular were indeed staring at them so what ginny asked feeling irrationally annoyed with hermione for breaking up the argument i could stand here screaming bloody murder what does it matter if i do i harry are you alright a rather loud thump interrupted her as harry fell off his chair onto the ground appearing startled and confused harry looked up at his friends concerned faces from the ground rubbing the back of his head bloody harry are you okay hermione asked almost immediately at his side scar he said lowering his voice it was bothering me all night and again just now i think he planning something that probably why malfoy been such a fruit case today it must have been harry he was looking at ron said looking slightly relieved that draco hadntbeen lusting after his sister after all you know he in on all of daddy little plans ron hermione said reproachfully she turned back to harry but this isntexactly new news is it harry i mean your scar been bothering you constantly lately right yeah but this is different stronger somehow maybe we should talk about this later hermione said shooting a look at malfoy who was still staring in their direction why ron asked looking completely clueless after a second his face brightened in understanding oh he said cleverly i got it hermione patted her boyfriend hand good job ron ginny sighed she couldntstay one more minute in the room between ron plotting and malfoy staring without saying something to her brother she would regret later and a fight with ron was really not something she needed at the moment let go luna i got to get some air ginny said offering her ravenclaw friend a hand up sure luna said taking proffered hand and following ginny out as an afterthought the redhead added bye ron harry herm uh huh ron said waving her off without looking you know luna said a little more loudly than normal he seemed much more interested when we were discussing your mating habits ginny laughed as ron waved them off again in complete oblivion exactly as ginny wished she could be to the pair of slate grey eyes still following her the rest of the day followed in much the same manner everywhere she went she could feel his gaze following her by the end of the day she was ready to skip dinner and just escape to the safety of the gryffindor common room and would have too if that wouldnthave put ron back into protective brother mode after finishing a quick diner she and colin nearly ran to the tower sinking down onto her favorite couch she sighed and let her head fall on colin shoulder so tired she mumbled i just want to sleep he laughed the sound rumbling across his whole body rocking her head no homework tonight she shook her head at least you donthave infirmary duty tonight he said she nodded closing her eyes then suddenly her eyes flew open colin she groaned why d you have to remind me what he asked as his friend stood up quickly brushed off her robes and grabbed her bag i have to go to the hospital wing tonight cantyou just go tomorrow quidditch she answered shortly headed for the door and i haventdone my three nights this week i have to go bye gin he called but she was already through the portrait hole she of course should have known should have known as soon as colin mentioned the hospital that draco would be there she should have realized there was no way that there was no way he would not be there and despite all of that it still came as a surprise when the curtains around on of the cots were suddenly thrown open right in front of her and malfoy face was suddenly only inches from her face she gasped and stepped back draco was likewise shocked by the vastness and creativeness of her vocabulary the obscenities streaming from her mouth made even him cringe he made a mental note to never sneak up on her again as her cursing swiftly dissolved as she recognized him and was replaced by some rather painful sounding threats most of which including the removal of body parts he had grown rather fond of what are you doing here she demanded after finishing a particularly dreadful sounding threat involving a broom stick mouse trap and a shovel draco having stopped listening around the part about the shovel was staring again at her neck the scarf was gone but her normally untamed hair was brushed smooth and her curls were very deliberately arranged to fall around her neck i ve had it with you following me around you bloody wanker she continued angrily i want this to stop right now or so help me i ll she broke off looking startled as he reached out and brushed the hair behind her ear had it been under any other circumstances it would have seemed an almost affectionate gesture his eyes were full of an emotion she couldntquite place is this why you were late he asked eyes focusing suddenly and his voice sounding strangely harsh what she asked when you were late to class monday it was because of this wasntit he asked realizing belatedly that he hadntseen her at all on sunday not even at meal times how could he have been stupid enough not to realize she hadntbeen there malfoy it none of your bloody business that crap weasley something major like this happens and you donteven tell anyone he asked taking a chance of course because for all he knew she could have told the whole gryffindor house but it seemed from her blanch that he was correct in assuming she had kept it a secret how stupid can you be who did this to you he asked although of course he already knew she sneered the expression failing to portray any degree of hostility at all and instead showing a look of complete fear what a malfoy pretending to care about someone other than himself my god this is more important than you and me this is he stopped at a complete loss for words just come here she didntmove with an aggravated sigh at her stubbornness he moved to close the space between them here he pulled out his wand and gently put it to her neck where only the slight outline of the bruise remained murmuring something so softly even she couldnthear warmth jumped from his wand down her neck and rippling down her spine she shivered thank you she said quietly bruises one of the bodies most basic ways of repairing itself and therefore most deeply encrypted in the mind were oddly enough more difficult to heal then broken bones if not for that fact she would have healed it herself ages ago the spell was more of a symbolic gesture an offering of peace than anything else ginny didntpull away and draco hoped that it signified that she had understood his figurative olive branch and had accepted it tentatively she smiled at him hey after all he said with a crooked grin we might have to spend some time together in the same general vicinity umm i cantquite decide whether i liked the end or not so i guess ya ll can tell me what you think anyways thanks again i ll have another chapter up soon vacation starts for me on the 11th and i ll try to update before then plus nothing puts you in the mood for writing like a twenty four hour car ridewith nothing else to do special note to queenthayet i updated on a friday does that count hey short chapter i know but i leaving for vaction tonight or tomorrow if we dontget packed in time which is very likely so i wontbe able to update for about two weeks but it a twenty four hour car ride there and back so i ll have plenty of time to write i so depresses that the new book is coming out when i in ohio so i wontbe able to read it until i get home tell me nothing about it disclaimer i own nothing all settings and charecters belong to the wonderful j k rowling and here we go blaise said with an aggravated sigh but if it can help people then why because there will just as many idiots out there who will abuse it then use it for medical purposes draco interrupted her but it not fair that we should deny anyone the medicine they need just because stupid people misuse it ginny demanded looking annoyed so you re willing to let people slowly kill themselves so others can live you know quillwort is addictive he countered but you cantget addicted if you never try it can you if we just establish laws that would ever heard of prohibition where america banned alcohol and what good did that do it just increased the amount of people willing to break the law ginny paused for a moment and draco smirked taking an awful long time on a comeback weasley out of big words just give up and admit defeat you dontreally understand the concept of defeat do you malfoy ginny said which part he asked the bit where i win or the part where you lose i haventeven begun to fight you are so going down draco paused stared at her and then grinned that was about the worst comeback i ve ever heard yeah well your ignorance is contagious she snapped ahh you dontreally mean that do you he said flashing his most charming smile dontworry smart girls like dumb guys i sure if you apologize for all the name calling hermione will still love you she retorted with a grin of her own draco gagged that disgusting he said way below the belt what disgusting a voice asked ginny turned toward the source of the voice only to be greeted by one large pale blue eye studying her through a vacant space in the bookshelf and does your friend know he drooling dontsneak up on people like that ginny ordered before beckoning for her friend to join them does she do that often draco asked eyeing luna suspiciously as she walked toward them wearing obscenely bright green robes and miniature dragon earrings that periodically opened their mouths and spewed red flames all the time ginny answered walking over to meet her friend ever freak you out draco asked when the pair returned arm in arm all the time ginny repeated does what freak you out luna inquired the amount of drool blaise is capable of admitting while sleeping she answered looking at her dark haired friend who had fallen asleep somewhere in the middle of draco and her debate with a mischievous grin she summoned a glass of ice water something she had gotten quite good at having six older brothers and promptly dumped it over blaise head sputtering blaise said several words that would have made his mother scourgify his mouth before sending ginny a death glare madame pince the librarian sent them an irritated glance before returning to her task of re shelving the books now was that really necessary he asked moodily no she said smiling but it was fun blaise gave her another sour look as he flipped through his now damp book this is mcgonagall book i hope you know she ll have my head for this just be glad it wasntone of madame pince books luna said with a shudder luna how many times do i have to tell you ginny said exasperated with her friend there are no subliminal messages in the potions books the ancient rune books do not become carnivorous and attack you if they re overdue and above all madame pince most definitely is not secretly in love with professor trelawney although i did see her coming down from the divination classroom looking a little flustered blaise said smirking luna studied him for a moment before plainly declaring i dontlike you blaise gave her a look of mock pain and draco sniggered i dontlike you either she informed the other slytherin before turning back to ginny arentyou supposed to be at practice oh bugger quidditch she had forgotten again ron was going to have a cow wait i thought you were going to help me with my transfiguration blaise said waving his book she had been planning to help his catch up he was utterly dreadful at the subject every time he tried to change his hamster into a plate it would retain its legs and scurry away resulting in a ten minute game of find the mutant plate hamster hybrid when malfoy had showed up also to help his friend he had seemed surprised to see her but blaise kept shooting them enough secretive glances that she suspected her friend had been plotting blaise she decided should have known better than to have expected to get any work done with draco and her in the same room they had been at work little more then five minutes before they had ended up in an argument over whether or not quillwort a possibly addictive ingredient that was also used in many healing potions should be made legal i sorry she said grabbing her books but i really have to go another time draco she noticed was also gathering his belongings where are you going blaise asked looking incredulously at his blond friend i have to go to the infirmary he answered with a shrug but my midterm is tomorrow blaise complained luna sighed always the self sacrificing martyr i ll do it see you guys later ginny said turning back only once to see the look of terror on blaise face the adjoining room was dimly lit and like everything else in the house richly furnished ear pressed to the wall she listened carefully storing every word in her memory her home are you sure a gruff voice questioned of course i sure a second voice barked i thought for sure dumbledore would try to spirit the whole lot away a third voice this one deep and scornful but very obviously female commented of course there must be guards said the second voice but we can get around those the woman said a twisted amusement clear in her voice the girl herself will she be any trouble the first man who she vaguely remembered asked dolohov she thought was his name lucius had far too many cohorts to keep the all straight the second man her husband laughed a weasley i think not i dontsee why we have to even bother with the girl the woman whined wouldntit be so much easier to just off potter questioning the master bella lucius asked coolly no i just wonder why he would bother with the girl when potter would it not your place to wonder lucius snapped of course not she muttered demurely their voices were becoming more muffled distant she walked along the wall following the sound of their voices but what of potter the first man asked he ll stay at the school most likely the old man wouldntlet him out of his sight lucius answered his voice growing quieter still they must have been walking towards the door desperate to hear she moved along with them tripping in her haste she grasped the small chestnut table beside her for balance knocking the porcelain vase from its perch recoiling from the shower of broken glass shattering on the marble floor with a crash she uttered a small cry of alarm she could hear them running towards her and for a moment she was frozen as the three entered the room lucius first followed closely by the others she had sense enough to look lost grabbing her wrist glaring coldly at her lucius was enraged what are you doing in here he asked his glare enough to send shivers down her spine cleaning she said automatically there there was a spider she finished somewhat lamely and were you not informed i was to be entertaining today you know better than to interrupt regaining confidence she shook her head and glanced at the other two as if just noticing them for the first time i sent a house elf to inform you he said voice losing a bit of its edge with wide doe eyes filling with a feigned righteous rage she answered i knew it always cutting corners lucius some of those things must go they re always slinking around and they stare it unnatural her husband still looked doubtful why do you think i clean your private study myself she asked gesturing to the room around her they ll steal nasty little creatures always lurking seemingly satisfied with her response he released her wrists continuing her act now almost reveling in the thrill of her performance she excused herself with an angry if you ll pardon me i believe i have some clothes to distribute and was gone before lucius could give her a word of argument once gone dolohov whistled appreciatively runs a tight shift that narcissa lucky to have such a faithful wife lucius caught my own wench with crabbe just last week unfaithful chit yes lucky indeed lucius answered i trust you can let yourself out not even bothering to look put out at his abrupt dismissal he exited through the adjoining parlor door i donttrust her bellatrix said after the man had left no lucius answered nor do i poor narcissa keeps wandering through the pages never actually sure whether she actually part of the plot or not anyways thanks again to all my reviewers i love you all cookies to everyone well and spirits for chicklepea enjoy ahhhh jk you re killing us so without spoilers i ll say that i finished book six and alli can say is nooooooo no i didntgive up on this story i promise i was just on vacation in ohio for three weeks and then two days later school started so i ve been pretty busy things are quieting down now so i should be able to update pretty soon we should be getting to christmas holiday in the next chapter whoot and now the longand impatiently awaited chapter 24 the price is right theme song begins randomly playing in the background why would you do that hmm blaise asked suddenly becoming much more interested in his magazine you planned that draco replied why didntyou tell me she d be there planned what his friend asked absently draco glared fine is it a crime to want your two best friends to get along blaise said me and weasley get along i always knew you were nuts weasley and i blaise corrected draco stared at him as though he had just announced he was going to elope with pansy parkinson and then join the circus you expect me to put her first blaise rolled his eyes and muttered something that sounded uncannily like git again draco glared at his friend besides said blaise we dontget any work done when it just the two of us guys keep coming up to flirt with her or occasionally he added with a shudder me they all seem to think i gay after that thing with colin at the halloween dance if i werentso tired i d be seriously disturbed see colin walked over and not that draco snapped cringing keep your twisted love life to yourself i meant the fact that anyone would find weasley attractive enough to actually put some sort of effort into impressing her i mean she nice enough to look at but just being in the same room with her for three minutes is enough to make any sane man want to rip his hair out blaise laughed rip your hair out eh funny what some guys will do to ease their frustrations personally i just find a girl willing to follow me into the broom closet you re telling me that you find weasley he stumbled a bit over the wording desirable you ve known me for year and you dontfind it the least bit strange that i choose now to start randomly befriending gryffindors draco cringed so basically you re telling me you wanted to seduce weasley and i dontknow have your way with her at least now he knew why blaise had suddenly had no problem associating with a gryffindor blaise laughed well i would have put it a little more delicately but yes that was the basic plan draco cringed again oh dontworry blaise assured him i not competition i realized she not my type the blond scoffed not this again i told you i dontfancy weasley sure i don t really stupid idiot blaise and his stupid idiot assumptions no matter how much draco denied any attraction to the redheaded gryffindor blaise still kept making not so subtle references to her inviting ginny to the library had obviously been another one of his plans to get the two of them together please draco she the only one who can get under your skin you talk about her almost constantly when she not around i do not draco interrupted indignantly you get all hot and bothered any time she is around blaise continued malfoys do not get hot and bothered draco corrected scornfully you call out her name in your sleep oh now your just making things up hey say what you will but half the time there so much sexual tension between you two i afraid you ll throw her down on the table and make little pink haired babies right in front of me draco winced now theirs a scary thought weasel junior i telling you when you start using phrases like sexual tension it time to lay off pansy romance novels what are you reading now anyways teen witch magazine draco asked snatching the abandoned magazine off the arm of blaise chair blaise made an effort to snatch it back but draco was too quick and nimbly jumped out of his friend grasp the quibbler draco asked in slight disbelief as he read the title he absently fanned through the pages all emblazoned with brightly colored extraordinary looking animals and a particularly strange article about a woman who claimed to be impregnated with godric gryffindor child he stopped noticing blaise had dog eared one of the pages toward the back he scanned the page until his eyes fell on a small about the editor paragraph in the bottom right hand corner next to the article was a picture of a rather small man with large protruding eyes even further enlarged by a pair of thick glasses he had his arm around luna lovegood looking down at her affectionately luna looked from draco frowning to blaise winking i ll take that blaise snapped and grabbed it from the blonde hands and hastily rolling it up and placing it in his pocket looney lovegood blaise honestly i think i would be less disturbed if you had been looking up makeup tips and which bikini fits your figure best dontcall her that blaise said reproachfully she dating neville longbottom no she not she hasntseen him since the halloween dance she said he got too freaked out whenever she mentioned blue winged abarad to ever actually have a relationship with him draco for some reason unknown to blaise found this statement hilarious what blaise demanded feeling slightly degraded you you draco could hardly get the words out between bursts of laughter you re looney rebound guy you you re longbottom replacement luna and i arentdating blaise said defensively now if you excuse me i have to go pack you canteven replace longbottom draco howled yeah and you re in love with ginny weasley life a funny funny thing abruptly draco stopped laughing that it you re dead and then blaise and draco bonded in a manner befitting two true slytherins namely the bonding of draco fist to blaise face and then the connection of blaise foot to draco jaw ginny closed her eyes sleepily before refocusing them on her books stupid messy haired hyper competitive green eyed freak she mumbled to nothing in particular harry in preparation for the two week quidditch break had ordered a double session of practice she could swear the tips of her fingers were still numb from the cold it our last practice before holiday he had kept reminding them well now it was well past midnight and she had her last midterm before holiday to worry about and it was potions she sighed as she closed her book and began her assent up the stairs to the girl dormitory there was really no use in studying when she d just forget it all by morning and right then a warm blanket was sounding really appealing that what you get for waiting until the last minute a voice that sounded annoyingly like hermione scolded collapsing on the bed she shifted around for a minute before sliding her legs between the sheets and puling the covers up to her chin as she closed her eyes she became aware of the spot of warmth on her chest that had grown so familiar to her she fingered the necklace absently as she drifted off to sleep draco shifted around uncomfortably casting an envious glance at his peacefully sleeping roommate he rolled over yet again and let out a sigh of frustration it was far too hot to even consider sleep and no matter how many times he scourified the sheets he couldnthelp but notice they still smelled distinctly of vanilla he rolled over one last time before closing his eyes and waiting impatiently for sleep to come draco kneeled on the hard cold floor pain filling his whole body his arms were tied straight out at his sides as though he hung from some ominous crucifix leaving his bare chest exposed to the crowd of hooded men around him the constant dull ache of pain from being pinioned in such an unnatural position was broken only by the sharp pain of the curses being thrown at him he screamed a low feral cry of pain and desperation as another curse hit him full in the chest each time he jerked the chains bit deeper into his pale skin and warm blood trickled down his arm his world was in a blur everything spun and his stomach churned mocking voices laughing more curses all directed at him mixed together the effect leaving his head throbbing then maybe even more alarming then the noise came a sudden silence then as though some angel of mercy had been sent to rescue him from this private hell a pale slender hand unchained first one arm then the other draco arms fell limply to his sides unprepared for their sudden release and draco sat for a moment unable and unwilling to move then gently almost caringly his rescuer lifted him to his feet and slipped on arm gingerly around draco for support draco legs throbbed in protest when he tried to move them pain ripped through his leg stiff after so long disused still he stumbled along with his aide even assisted he couldntmanage such a far distance as across the room and fell to the ground the same person bent down again to pull him to his feet but this time not so gently draco was being dragged from the floor this time he refused to be moved with all the stubbornness befitting a malfoy draco laid his head down and closed his eyes get up boy get up draco hardly felt the foot making contact with his side that will do lucius someone announced the voice both rasping and commanding immediately draco arm was released you ve done quite well the voice announce with something that must have been akin to satisfaction the rustling of robes heading toward him was enough to make draco rouse himself to look up not even a foot away from him stood a hooded figure eyes red and cat like stared emotionlessly out at him and draco knew now of course who was before him voldemort the dark lord knelt before him looking intently into his eyes making draco repress a shudder this is not what you wish voldemort asked with some amusement his voice lowered so that no one else could here draco couldntbring himself to speak voldemort mouth twisted into an ugly smile this is what you were born for this is what you are look around you this is what you will become no draco managed you cantescape your destiny draco voldemort told him and suddenly draco was on fire every inch of his skin burned his insides too seemed to have caught ablaze he d never been n so much pain in his life he opened his mouth to scream but the sound died in his throat too parched to play host to any type of sound at all draco knew he was dieing he wanted to die if only so the pain would end every bone in his body seemed to break and reform only to be broken again then as suddenly as it had started the pain died away leaving only a dull ache filling his body this is your destiny accept it and then they were gone then a moment later he flinched at the unexpected touch as someone put a cool hand on his shoulder he was too tired to respond further he barely noticed as his shoulders began to heave in deep silent sobs malfoy he recognized the voice at once as ginny s his eyes fluttered lazily open and he made a fruitless effort to lift his heed oh draco she said sadly as she ever so gently pulled his head into her lap her hand stroked his temple wiping away sweat and blood he caught her other hand in his not so much for comfort but to prevent it from traveling farther up his arm where he knew he had been branded with the dark mark he opened his eyes only once just long enough to see her concerned face peering down at him draco woke up drenched in sweat and gasping for breath he looked down impusivily at his left arm finding nothing there he let out a sigh of irrational relief he closed his eyes and took slow deliberate breaths when his heart had slowed to it normal pace he opened his eyes again only to see blaise sitting cross legged and shirtless on the other bed looking at him with obvious concern dreams again his roommate asked he nodded pushing back the covers and swinging his legs onto the ground what time is it draco asked heading towards the bathroom to so he could wash his face six blaise replied draco groaned there was no use going back to sleep now quickly he set about penning a short letter to his mother before getting dressed for school ginny awoke groggily with the feeling she was being dragged through murky water her vision blurred momentarily before she was able to sit up parvati and lavender were both still sleeping soundly hermione was dressed and ready for school reclining on her bed with a rather large book in hand what time is it she asked blearily six hermione answered tersely eyes not leaving her page ginny groaned six she had at least another half an hour of good sleep left not that she d be able to go back to sleep after that nearly a whole week dream free only to be followed up with nightmares about malfoy of all people welll she could understand malfoy giving people nightmares but this was something completely different what are you doing up she asked last midterm today hermione answered still reading ancient runes very difficult complete sentences would be nice you know hermione paused her reading to glare at ginny fine fine ginny grumbled getting slowly to her feet i hate mornings i really like draco dream it was reallly hard to write buti like the way it came out i want to say yet another huge thank you to everyone who took the time to review it makes me so happy huggles random reviewer i wuv you guys blows kisses ahhh guys i soooooooooooooooo sorry it took so long to update i really am i know i promised thati wouldupdate soon and then i went and took the longest it porbably even taken me to write a chapter i am an aweful author i know feel free to throw tomatoes just not rotten ones but now that swim team is over ahaha behold i got ninth place overall in districts bow down to my awesome swimming ability i ll begetting home a full three hours earlier so i promise really this time that the next chapter will come out sooner plus i ve been dying to write all the christmas scenes since i started writing this so i llbe able to write a lot more quickly yes queen thayet my amazing use of grammmer more quickly not quicklier anyways seeing as i ve delayed this chapter long enough on to the story disclaimer umm cantthink of a cute disclaimer i disclaim he had entered the room looking distracted and tired and had left in much the same manner dark circles stood in contrast to his unusually pale skin leaving her to wonder if she hadntbeen the only one suffering from nightmares he had finished his test within five minutes and left the classroom without so much as looking her direction once an impressive feat considering they were seated right next to each other ginny on the contrary hadntbeen able to look away and even once he had left the youngest malfoy remained the sole occupant of her thoughts she almost wised she d never learned to think of him as anything but a condescending rich smarmy brat of course she had she just didntknow what exactly she thought he was now draco malfoy a mystery wrapped in enigma stupid prat at least she used to be able to attribute it to the fact that he was a heartless vicious cold blooded word that her mother would faint if she said out loud but now she d seen multiple times that he was at least somewhat capable of emotions that he was at the very least able to feel concern and where could concern root from if not first from love she let out a frustrated sigh why couldntshe be stuck with someone whose life was simple like maybe harry yeah that would be easy no no instead she was bound to mr death eater jr himself which now that she thought about it wasnteven strictly true he may have been a prejudiced idiot but he d never actually done anything to show he d really wanted to be a death eater in fact back in forth year during the quidditch world cup he d even warned hermione not to go back to the woods no matter how obnoxious and vulgar a warning it had been ginny remembered harry recounting his conversation with malfoy at the end of fifth year you think you re such a big man potter you wait i ll have you you cantland my father in prison malfoy was so sure of himself it was so easy black was black white was white and there was no in between now the whole world was a spiraling kaleidoscope of gray he had adored his father idolized him even and now he seemed to loathe the man was it really possible for anyone to change so drastically ashamed and not a little annoyed she found herself hoping it was maybe it was just part of her nature to think everything and everyone had a good side or maybe she was just naive but that wasnteven what was bothering her most the most troubling thing was the fact that she wasnt upset by the fact that she was dreaming about draco even more troubling was that she was upset over the thought of him having the dark mark she sighed again her focus drifting even farther from her potions assignment to the look he had had in her dream last night he had reached out and stopped her from touching his arm where the dark mark would have been and for a moment his mercury eyes had gleamed with more emotion then she had ever seen in them before he was predictable and therefore it was usually easy to tell what he was thinking even when his placid gray eyes betrayed no emotion but looking into his eyes for that one instant she had been able to see fear and pain and betrayal and even something more than that some twisted mixture of the feral need to live and the all too human desire to die that she supposed was what had really struck her what had made the whole dream so darkly fascinating to her she couldntimagine wanting to die especially as someone who was as supremely selfish as draco she had always imagined him grasping to hold onto life to hold it close to him like a dragon guarding its hoard the thought shook her deeply what had he lived through to make him not want to continue she shook her head her thoughts werenteven rational anymore it was just a dream after all no dream was worth getting this excited about she was just overanalyzing working herself into a fit over nothing still she had an incredible sense of foreboding and she let her hand rise to her neck whether to grasp the necklace or touch the spot where tom riddle had marked her she wasntsure either way the action soothed her and she breathed out deeply and then inhaled letting the bitter air rush though her i wasntunder the impression this test would be so difficult for you ginny started and looked up she knew the speaker was professor snape not because she had recognized his voice and certainly not because he seemed focused on her in the least bit on the contrary he was busily grading papers at her desk not at all looking at her but rather because he was the only other person left in the room where was everyone this was of course her last midterm of the semester and they were free to go as they finished but surely everyone couldntbe done already it was only she paused to look at her watch and gasped there was no way she d sat there an hour and forty minutes and not finished her test i ah i just really nervous this class is really important for my future healer and all that she said only paying him the slightest bit of attention while the rest of her concentration was on reading through the answers she d put on her exam answers that she couldntremember writing for the life of her she d only left the last five blank and the other answers seemed correct which wasntthat surprising considering she knew her potions book so well she could basically recite it he didntlook up how many do you have left to complete she blushed five fine miss weasley finish he said still leaving angry red marks on some student assignment letting out a breath of relief ginny smiled thank you professor he didntrespond as she quickly finished her paper and gathered her things crossed the room and placed her test on his desk he didntlook up thank you again professor it was really decent of you to let me finish my test yes virginia weasley thinks i a decent sort of man now i can die happy despite herself she grinned as she headed for the door she paused and looked back at him happy christmas professor ginny take care of things he said looking at her for the first time she was struck by how odd her name sounded coming for his lips he was staring at her and she suddenly had the feeling that he was telling her something off monumental importance her smile faltered only a moment dontworry i ll be careful hey i just wanted to give you these before i left in case i dontget to see you before christmas neville blushed looking at his redheaded friend luna simply smiled luminous christmas lights twinkling at her ears casting a blue radiance across her face the earrings abruptly changed colors switching to a lime green no ordinary christmas light had ever achieved smiling back ginny handed each their presents neville still red but this time with pleasure opened his quickly showering his two friends with bits of wrapping paper brilliant he cried happily reading the title of the book ginny had given him an advanced guild to herbology ginny he said smiling wavering as he ran his hand across the leather cover this must have cost a fortune how d you afford it she grinned dontworry about it and dontyou even think about returning it she said sternly i already wrote in it he flipped open the cover and scrawled across the title page in her familiar messy handwriting was to my dear friends neville and trevor the toad who always there when you need him except when he not he smiled and they both looked expectantly at luna who had begun systematically unwrapping her present by removing each individual piece of tape when she reached the small white box instead of opening it she set it aside and neatly folded the paper before continuing as she lifted the lid her eyes lit up with delight and ginny smiled to match your necklace ginny said as she helped luna clasp the bracelet around her wrist luna brought her new trinket closer to her face for examination the bracelet was made of at least thirty different butterbeer caps there a bunch from different countries ginny said sounding quite pleased with herself charlie brought me some from romania and hungary of course and bill got a ton from egypt and they both brought back some odds and ends from different countries they ve visited luna was currently studying one that charlie had gotten when he d gone to study in greenland for a few weeks i ah got something for you two gin neville said smiling sweetly he pulled something that looked like a brown thimble from his pocket and muttered an augmentation spell ginny watched as the thimble developed into a small flowerpot and inside it were several dark purple flowers surrounded by large green leaves they re supposed to be good luck and he said he looked up at her sheepishly drive away nightmares for a moment she felt so loved that she wasnteven angry with colin for it must have been colin for telling neville that she d been having bad dreams she happily wrapped an arm around each of her friends she felt the overwhelmingly bittersweet passing of time as if before her she could see the sand slowly dropping through the hourglass she wanted so bad it almost ached for things to remain the way they were and at the same time she knew that soon things would change and never be the same she couldntexplain the feeling nor could she explain why it had hit her with such sudden intensity i love you guys she said softly and the three of them stayed just like that for a while basking in each other presence all packed draco raised an eyebrow at his friend as he nodded the house elves had been in ages ago to pack his bags blaise grinned lazy draco huffed condescension that all i get from you anymore i think maybe this break will be good for us honestly i think i d kill you in you re sleep if you werentmy best mate i didntknow you cared draco said smiling innocently i don t but i need someone to misplace my aggression on and crabbe just cantbanter the way you can and goyle doesntlaugh at my jokes admit it i the only one that can stand you i thought that was my line after a moment contemplation draco said thoughtfully i wonder if other friends do this what witty repartee blaise asked i think it just the way we communicate last time i tried to be sincere you asked me if i was drunk draco grinned i remember that you asked me if i wanted to talk and then you asked me if i was gay but i was very supportive about it draco said solemnly you locked me out screaming something about knowing someone d been watching you in the showers well you wouldnthave been the first draco stated sounding defensive girls go wild over my rugged manliness blaise looked at him skeptically rugged manliness what so unbelievable about that draco wanted to know nothing it just you re not exactly the epitome of masculinity hey i know what colors suit your eyes best and own fifteen different types of hair gel that doesntexactly scream manliness the ladies find me irresistible the blond said sulkily of course they do just not because of your rugged manliness because you re a greek god with a face carved from marble and cold grey eyes that shine like the ocean on a stormy night draco blanched that it you re officially cut off if i catch you reading anymore of pansy romance novels i ll tell your parents that you canthide your feelings anymore and that you ve run away with crabbe and some guy named sue blaise laughed maybe you should tell them that anyway that would be the funniest thing that happened since aunt ophelia got drunk and tried to make love to that ficus on the balcony remind me not to go to any of your family get togethers i sure malfoy family gatherings are a jolly affair draco glared of course they are of course we re stuck drinking white wine with every blaise looked questioningly because red wine is too hard to check for poison draco explained oh yeah good times hey it like i always say just because i paranoid doesntmean someone not out to get me since when do you say that draco thought for a moment well i sure i ve said it at least once before where d you even hear that from my father just one of the cheery adages of lucius malfoy my personal favorite was always one of the down sides of being perfect is that people tent to think you re pretentious you are pretentious you little prig and i thought you were my friend draco said scoffing yes i ve been told i a good actor whoever told you that must have been a bloody good actor themselves to convince you of that load blaise was about to replied with a very rude word when a knock one their door interrupted them draco a voice unfortunately very recognizable called are you in there sorry pansy draco not in right now draco hollered oh clever plan blaise murmured she ll never see through that i know that you draco pansy said impatiently i not draco i blaise just because i the less attractive poor one doesntmean i donthave feelings it really hurts when you get my name wrong draco called if you re blaise then whom are you in there talking to sue they heard pansy sigh heavily draco darling you re making this very difficult for me what a shame draco muttered this is ridiculous blaise said he much to draco annoyance opened the door traitor draco said glaring pansy for her part was a very forgiving creature in this case forgiving in draco opinion meaning that a black hole in the outer reaches of deep space would have been brighter and wasted no time in sidling up and wrapping her arm in his apparently she was completely oblivious to the fact or just didntcare that only a moment before he d been yelling at her through a door in a desperate attempt to get her to leave draco love professor snape wants to see you pansy said i ll walk you down i d really rather you didn t he responded to which pansy just giggled obscenely loudly and looked at blaise isnthe just so funny she asked and then without waiting for an answer dragged draco through the doorway and up the stairs over the sound of their footsteps blaise could hear draco asked hey pansy you think i manly right and even if they hadntdrifted out of earshot before she replied blaise wouldnthave been able to hear them over his own laughter hey ginny wait up having walked luna to the ravenclaw common room and neville to the greenhouse proudly displaying his new book to an admiring professor sprout ginny was ready to get back to her room to pack hermione had been furious when she d seen that she wasntready to leave but it really wasntfair to blame her between the infirmary quidditch homework and last minute christmas shopping it wasntas though there was much spare time in her schedule hey come on ginny despite her better judgment she turned oh hey seamus what up nothing he was ginny noticed blushing look i have a huge favor to ask you and well it just you re basically the only girl friend i have and i way over my head i really need your help he put his hand on her shoulder and she felt her face flush calm down ginny since when are you the kind of girl that swoons you donteven like seamus she took a deep breath and prayed her face wasntred are you all right seamus yeah that probably wasntthe best way to start that but i pretty desperate hannah and i ve been dating for a couple of months now and i want to get her something really nice for christmas only i have no idea what and i just really dontwant to get her something really stupid like a cheap charm bracelet or makeup or anything dumb like that when she recovered from the shock of his amazing ability to turn a whole paragraph into a single sentence to be delivered in one breath she was struck with the whole new jolt that he would actually ask his ex to help him pick out a gift for his girlfriend okay technically she had to admit she wasntofficially his ex considering they d never actually gone out but the principal of the matter was still the same i ah please ginny he said looking at her with those pretty blue eyes of his isntthere someone else you could ask not really i ve never had to shop for girls before i mean if it was you i d just buy a broom cleaning kit or something but hannah not like that she hates it when i treat her like one of the guys one of the guys was that how he thought of her still she had stood him up for their first date could she really blame him for not wanting to date her anymore i want to get her something really nice he said and the look in his eyes hurt her so much she couldntstand it it wasntbecause it was seamus talking about another girl it was just the fact that she could tell he really truly cared about her he had the same look in his eyes that her parents had when they looked at each other and the same look that ron and hermione gave each other when they thought no one was looking she wanted someone to look at her like that someone who would care about her and be there for her of course she had her friends but it just wasntthe same she sighed cursing herself for being so darn nice of course i ll help you i have to go but we ll do it over break sometime he grinned thanks gin you re a lifesaver i ll floo you all right she sighed it was friday evening and she had exactly twelve hours before the train left in the morning twelve hours to figure out how she was going to explain to her parents why draco malfoy had followed her home okay not liking this chapter very much i sorry i promise the next chapter will be better and faster please review thanks to all of you who already have i lurve you so much i also promise that the end is near this story will not contrary to popular belief go on forever happy thanksgiving y all er i late i know anyway just a few things first this story just passed the one year mark well actually that happened last chapter and i just forgot to mention it i had to sleep on the couch for weeks thanks to yrouna for reminding me so i d just like to thank all of you who haventgiven up on me and my irratic posting habits i love you all so much also i will probably be doing some minor editing of earlier chapters just to check for errors and things like that and so if you get a new chapter alert dontget too excited it might just be me editing disclaimer i own nothing not a thing well the plot but i dontalways want to claim that but seriously i mean like how would it steer i dont know ginny colin said clearly exasperated circles she called in her a singsong voice i dontcare what you say just because a duck only has one foot does not mean it can only swim in circles colin cried i happen to agree with ginny luna who had decided much to ginny delight to come home for the holiday said happily ginny grabbed her hand and grinned i knew there was a reason you were my best friend she said hey i thought i was your best friend colin said indignantly she glared you dontthink one footed ducks swim in circles i ll tell you what he said if you ever find a one footed duck swimming in circles i ll concede with you re superior duck knowledge she grinned dontbother sucking up now you ve already been replaced ah ginny dontbe like that he said placing a hand on her thigh purposefully squeezing a bit just above her knee for a moment her face reddened as she tried to bite back laughter finally she succumbed and opened her mouth admitting several loud unladylike peals of laughter darn you colin you know that my tickling spot she said making an amusing attempt to glare and giggle at the same time really i d forgotten and abandoning all pretenses leapt up from his seat and began tickling her mercilessly ginny who unfortunately had not had the foresight to release luna hand collapsed onto the floor pulling an irritated luna with her as the two tumbled unceremoniously to the floor colin took this opportunity to pounce ruthlessly he raked his fingers up and down her sides as she emitted aloud squeals ginny tried to roll over only to find herself more entangled with luna who was now smiling brightly at her friends antics her expression changed after a moment from supreme amusement to a cringe as ginny elbowed her repeatedly in the ribs in her mad attempt to escape from colin and that luna and colin on the floor with ginny between them was how blaise zabini found them as he slid open the compartment door well he said and whistled approvingly congratulations creevey he was grinning crookedly we weren t i mean we didn t it s he was just joking colin ginny said her face flushed from laughter she propped herself up on one arm and rested her cheek on her palm it suited her only ginny blaise thought could manage to look perfectly at ease on the floor like that of course a voice drawled as draco malfoy looking either bored or amused stepped from behind blaise into the compartment we re not that optimistic what are you doing here colin asked voice laden with displeasure well it generally called standing in a second i ll walk over to that bench there and sit i d explain that concept but it gets a bit technical draco deadpanned blaise grinned go away malfoy colin said sourly i would if i could or actually i probably wouldn t i d probably just stand here and see how red your face can get before you explode he sneered and took a step towards colin meeting the challenge colin too stepped forward blaise thank merlin for him derailed any possible conflict by smoothly inserting himself between the two boys and explaining there arentany empty seats unless of course you want us to sit with pansy not even you could hate draco enough to wish upon him he smiled and ginny could see how he had ended up in slytherin it wasntso much what he had said as it was how he said it he had combined that gentle now you don really want to do that now do you voice with his charming smile and had that easily soothed both boys manipulative little thing she d have to remember that besides draco said almost sulkily i wouldntstay here with her if i had any sort of choice oh just give up malfoy ginny said ginning as she untangled herself from colin and luna and stood you know you love me it not love if i have to pay for it puppet he said she grinned i charge you double and for a second she glared then suddenly burst out laughing draco was startled he stared opened mouthed for a long moment before slowly he began to laugh too ginny doubled over still laughing and the more pleased she became the more draco had to laugh too blaise colin and luna stared it was blaise who laughed first holding onto draco for support growing only louder as the other two joined in luna laughing insanely loud and panting for breath and grasped blaise shoulders just to keep upright everyone except luna herself noticed when blaise abruptly stopped laughing and looked delightedly at the slender pale hand on his arm first colin now blaise i had no idea ravenclaws were so easy draco said colin blushed and ginny glared but luna was still snorting and blaise was too busy looking strangely pleased for either of them to notice draco shook his head and sighed placing a consoling hand on blaise arm i ve lost you you went and fell in love with looney lovegood luna had removed her hands and was wiping mirthful tears from her eyes she stiffened at the use of her less than flattering nickname well blaise said at least i didntfall for a gryffindor oh ginny you re so beautiful oh ginny i want to have you babies oh ginny i loooooovvvvvvvveeee you draco fumed and was ginny was quite sure about to have words with blaise four letter words in particular i knew it she cried grinning i knew you loved me in your dreams weasley he said too angry to sound indignant actually draco i believe those were your dreams she grinned again he frowned an opened his mouth to retort but closed it wordlessly only a second later and ginny got the feeling this was one of the few times she had won the rest of the ride couldntreally have been described as pleasant but it didntleave ginny feeling the need to gnaw off one of her own limbs as encounters with him usually did there were of course the standard remarks about her clothing as she changed out of her school uniform when they neared the station but all in all he actually seemed to be making an effort to be pleasant it was the first time in her life ginny had seen him make an effort to be nice to anybody or at much of anything for that matter maybe she thought allowing herself just a little hope maybe this christmas wontbe so bad after all draco wasntexactly certain what he should be doing he had his trunk ready and waited somewhat impatiently for ginny to get hers from the overhead compartment it wasnta polite gesture it was simply a testimony to the pathetic fact that the plan as it now stood was follow ginny he had been worried that they would have to try and justify the fact that draco malfoy was waiting for ginny weasley of all people but luck was on their side luna father had been waiting to greet them as the train pulled in snapping pictures with an insanely large camera luna had run off the train trunk whipping behind her so quickly that several first years had to jump back in their seats to avoid being impaled blaise had quickly said goodbye hugged ginny sapped draco on the back shot him a look that clearly said dontget into any trouble and not so subtly scurried off in luna wake colin murmured something about having to go keep his brother from jumping onto the train tracks again and with a quick embrace for ginny hurried away but that still left him here waiting ginny was up on her tiptoes trying to maneuver the enormous trunk down without getting crushed oh just move over he snapped and brushed passed her with the ease that came with being nine inches taller than her he pulled the trunk down he loved being tall not only because being a full three inches taller it meant potter had to look up to him can we go now he asked ah well yeah she grabbed her trunk and pulled it behind her and draco followed fitting her trunk through the door was not an easy task halfway through the jam the trunk got wedged in the doorway clumsily she lumbered over the thing nearly falling in the process but finally righted herself on the other side grabbing the handle she pulled with such comical effort the thing almost moved only when she was absolutely positive they was no persuading the massive trunk from its perch did she look at him isntthere something you could do she asked tapping her foot with a sigh he leaned down shoulder against her trunk ginny didntneed to be told what to do she leaned down once more and grabbed the handle on her end with him pushing and her pulling the truck never stood a chance it was immediately dislodged sending ginny tumbling backwards with it draco trunk was a bit more cooperative it slid most of the way only to get caught on the last corner it never been this hard to get these bloody things out before he snapped irritably as he leaned into his trunk someone must have hexed the door ha bloody ha with one great shove he freed the trunk only to find himself colliding with ginny what she stood frozen back to him and showed no indication at all of even realizing he had just run straight into her it took him only a moment to grasp why twisting around so he could see past her he found himself peering at potter granger and weasley all staring with looks of utter bafflement ginny were you just were you riding with malfoy ron asked too bemused to sound suspicious there werentany other open seats she said quickly getting over his uncertainty ron was beginning to look angry really ron she said soothingly you dontthink i d choose to sit with the mal ferret do you it not you i worried about he snapped looking at malfoy malfoy sneered i wouldntdo anything she didntask for ron looked furious he was about to say something and probably not anything that he would have repeated if his mother were in the room but harry bless him interjected ginny do you need help with that oh no thank you harry i ve got it draco snorted oh ginny said putting a hand to her forehead i ve forgotten my bag i ve got to go back for it on second thought harry could you take my trunk he nodded taking the handle and the three ron sending one last withering glare in draco direction headed off you shouldntbait him like that ginny said reproachfully when they were gone but he makes it so easy draco smirked forgot your bag then did you oh do shut up she snapped i couldntthink of anything better and i need to talk to you for a moment if this is going to work i need you to follow my lead and do what just go along with it that all i get go along with it what kind of plan is that but she was already walking away and he merlin help him was back to following ginny oh no ginny said as they stepped out of the platform the stationed was packed with travelers going home for the holiday all around them they could hear the happy greetings of families but none of that seemed to be what was bothering her draco followed her gaze even in the crowd it was hard to miss the woman standing on her tiptoes waving at ginny namely because she had hair in the brightest shade of bubblegum pink draco could have ever imagined and next to her were three towering redheads one was unfortunately ron also hard to miss because he stood nearly a head taller than anyone else in the crowd and beside him was mr weasley who draco remembered vaguely the third draco didntrecognize harry was kneeling down being happily licked by a huge black dog hermione smiled almost reproachfully as the creature chased its tail barked jovially at a few passing people and returned to harry ginny however was staring at the short hunched figure that seemed to be barking orders at the pink haired girl as they approached draco realized with horror who exactly the man was alastor moody was quite a sight eliciting nervous glances from people even with an eye patch covering his magic eye well then she said grimacing last chance to run he too cringed well you know what they say that which does not kill you only makes you stronger she finished wearily he gave he a queer look only delays the inevitable he corrected she laughed and draco decided it was a sound he rather liked it was gently and not forced there was absolutely nothing about it that implied that she was laughing for his benefit which draco had noticed most females seemed apt to think that the male ego was so fragile that they would be insulted if not completely devastated when a girl didntgiggle obscenely loudly at every one of jokes the only problem with that was with draco most of his jokes went quietly over their heads completely unnoticed sometimes pansy and her friends would give hi looks as though they were trying to figure out if what he said was funny or not sometimes they d still laugh not having got the joke at all but knowing that it must have been clever most times however they d just nod but ginny was different he wouldntdescribe her laughter like the sweets ringing of bells on the distant horizon as he d known some poets to do her laughter didntsound like bells it sounded like human laughter in fact it didnt sound remarkably unlike anyone else laughter it was perhaps more than anything what it did to her face that he liked when she laughed her whole face lit up and it was so truly happy that it made everyone around her smile too draco almost smiled he was talking about her almost as i they were friends which of course they weren t even if he was beginning to like the girl it didntmake them friends he paused at his own thoughts did he like her he thought for a moment before deciding that yes he did if only a little one of the things draco demanded of himself was that he should never lie to himself even if the truth was brutal but he had to admit that in the past few days he d grown almost no not fond that was too strong he couldntreally think of a word to describe what they were it fell somewhere between tolerance and familiarity dontget to close ginny advised pulling him abruptly from his thought they can smell fear only after a moment did he realize she was talking about the group that stood waiting now impatiently for her to come dontworry just follow my lead she said smiling and draco in the spirit of self actualization admitted what he might have already decided but hadntwanted to admit ginny was very pretty even if she was a weasley it almost made him sad knowing he could never have something so very exquisite he was after all never one for second best i hate you weasley still smiling she responded right back at you malfoy with that she grabbed the handle of his trunk and began fighting her way through the crowd toward the group that draco could now see also included the former professor lupin he watched her go for a moment eyes following the gentle sway of her hips as she walked allowing himself to enjoy the sight maybe he thought smirking as ginny turned around and smiled at him clearly waiting for him to follow this holiday wontbe so bad after all so brave reader i applaud you you made it through yet another chapter let me say that i dontknow if i like end it ll get better next chapter anyways thanks sooo much to those of you who take the time to review and may i say master sirius black that even though i can no longer delete you i can block you so there sticks out tounge just because i got the smarter genes in the family doesntmean you have to be jealous pats head i hate laptops and like nine pages of this chapter was written on one my dad let me take his on our road trip a 24 hour car ride to ohio so i could finish this chapter in fact i finished this in happy christmas disclaimer it one o clock in the morning i ll think of something clever to say in twelve hours or so ginny hugged her dad and the other redhead whom draco assumed to be one of her older brothers she smiled warmly as the girl shook her hand enthusiastically it was only then that draco remembered who else was there moody he felt a shiver go down his spine and forced down painful ferrety mermories so far no one had addressed the fact that draco was still there trailing only a step or two away from ginny but mad eye was following his every move with his magic eye even if he couldntsee through the patch he knew very well moody could ron too was now beginning to look suspicious ginny greeted mad eye warmly and he grunted a hello but draco could still feel the roving blue eye upon him finally ron could take no more what are just standing there for everyone who had not previously seen draco snapped their attention to him even the great lumbering dog stopped his playing to stare at him go on malfoy harry said coolly the use of his name seemed to bring them into focus moody who had apparently been trying to place him had his wand out and aimed in less than a second the older weasley son had never met him but had apparently heard enough from his younger siblings to put a hand to his wand even if he did have the restraint not to draw it lupin and mr weasley looked at him with alarm the dog let out a low menacing growl for a moment he faltered between making a snarky comment or telling the truth and had just decided to tell potter some rather uncomfortable places he could store his broomstick when ginny interrupted he coming home with us she said somewhere between commanding and hopeful lupin was the first to say anything moody for goodness sakes put that wand down the muggles it was true they had already left the platform and were surrounded by muggles who were giving them strange looks they didntneed any other reason for the people to get suspicious ginny what are you talking about ron asked utterly bewildered and not just a little angry he needed a place to stay she said shortly so he coming home with us absolutely not moody barked not lowering his wand completely against operating procedure moody mr weasley said this is exactly the kind of trick we should have expected moody said perhaps lupin said it would be better if we did this somewhere else why dontwe go ahead and portkey to the checkpoint the hermione said reasonable lupin and mr weasley all nodded their agreement and let them ambush us use your heads moody snapped ginny hesitated she had had that exact thought more times than she could count what if draco was just using her to spy on the order well it wasntlike she really had a choice besides she knew draco hated his father there was no doubting it his whole face darkened even at the mention of lucius and no one not even the famous draco malfoy could be that good of an actor no she said there no ambush but he a malfoy ron cried outraged yes we ve already established that now why dontyou go be good boy and let mummy and daddy talk for a while ginny other brother who she d quietly named as charlie snapped as ron reminded them for the fifteenth time that draco was in fact a malfoy dontyou condescend to me ron ordered then dontact like a prat charlie bit back it had taken them nearly a quarter of an hour to convince moody plus ron harry and charlie for that matter to use the portkey the argument would have no doubt lived longer if a ticket taker hadntcome and distastefully asked them to move along they now had another twenty minutes of arguing under they belts and were as far as draco could see no closer to a conclusion he had long ago settled against a large tree dead and hard for the winter and closed his eyes tuning out the argument and no one had bothered him they hadnteven consulted him at all ginny could figure it out in the meanwhile he could sleep listen ginny said harshly rounding on her father draco had heard her use that voice before it was the voice she used at the end of every argument i cantsay why just yet but i promise as soon as we re home i can explain things better to you and mum until then you ll just have to trust me if you cantdo that well then i guess there really no other solution than to just leave me here because i am not going anywhere without draco he felt irrationally nettled at the use of his first name and opened his eyes to glare at her but their attention had long drifted away for him right because it not like this argument is actually about me or anything he couldntexplain his annoyance after all she had used his name several times before and it had never bothered him for a moment he tired to decide whether she had slipped into using his first name because that was how she thought of him now as draco or if she was just caught in the moment she was he settled on just using it for dramatic affect which she had achieved after a long pause lupin sighed heavily and looked at mr weasley it your house arthur the decision is yours he took a long look at his daughter who stood somewhat flushed but proud with her chin held high fine he looked at draco not looking particularly pleased with his own decision we ll take him back to the house and see what dumbledore has to say after ginny and i have a long talk ginny threw her arms happily around her father and then there was quite a bit of bustle collecting all their things they had set down harry had been sitting on his trunk with the dog beside him hermione had let crookshanks out to stretch and was now calling up to him where he lounging on a branch just out of her reaches ron red faced and mumbling went to go help her moody watched them magic eye scrutinizing every motion he was mumbling as much as ron only much louder and draco suspected with the intention of being heard well the pink haired girl who seemed to be called tonks tonks said what now the portkey had taken them to a small snowy hill on the other side of which draco could just barely make out the lights of a village other than that it was completely deserted now lupin answered we walk the trek to the village wasntlong and wouldnthave been bad if it hadntsnowed so recently he was in excellent shape from seeking he had walked more than twice this distance no more than two miles more times than he could count while he was training as it was the fresh fallen flakes were large and wet and italian leather and snow didntmix very well he had not anticipating an icy jaunt worn his lightest cloak and the cold was indomitable and no matter of rubbing his hands together or shoving them deep into his pockets would help ginny was by no matter making it easier she was in such high spirits that she kept stopping and twirling in the snow kicking up the little crystals running ahead of the group only when mad eye yelled at her to stay with the group she had gotten well up ahead did she stop she grinned at him when he caught up poor malfoy she said playfully too much work need to stop and have a little lie down a tempting offer but we ve entirely not enough privacy i ve done some crazy things but in the snow with your father watching she didnteven rise to the jab what gone and made you so darn cheerful he grunted snow she answered sneaking in another twirl i love snow it just frozen water weasley no it magical she said and even as she spoke snowflakes started falling anew she stopped and stuck out her tongue hoping to catch some i not getting in that oh really malfoy for goodness sakes it perfectly safe hermione said clearly annoyed i m not getting in that he said saying each word slowly and purposefully hermione let out a frustrated sigh and looked entreatingly at professor lupin obviously tired of being rational he sighed heavily muggles do it all the time draco they also spend their days sitting watching a box but you dontbloody well expect me to do that too he snapped if you re referring to television mister weasley began excitedly making sure to pronounce the word correctly it really quite interesting charlie put a restraining hand on his father shoulder maybe now not the time dad he looked devastated well no i suppose not but he still looked hopefully back up at him as though he expected that at any moment draco would intercede and tell him how he couldnt possible wait to hear something so amazing when he did no such thing mr weasley lowered his voice conspiringly and whispered later well ron said irritably i say if he wontcome we just shove him in the boot draco looked mortified the glaring metal monstrosity was as far as he was concerned a general affront to nature it was old slightly rusty around the tires and the paint was chipped in places then ginny began laughing so absurdly loudly that a few people passing on the street turned to see what was happening she doubled over clutching her stomach and no matter how much he liked her laugh he didntlike it at his expense and that certainly seemed like what was happening here what he snapped you poor ickle drackie you re afraid of the car arentyou she said with wicked glee he puffed up a bit i not afraid there is a very thick line between fear and common sense the great draco malfoy afraid of cars what would the other slytherins say about this probably spot on good chap i wouldntget in that muggle death trap either he said only she couldntbe persuaded to stop laughing no matter what he said she only laughed more widely i not afraid he snapped again but she was gasping for breath so loudly he doubted she even heard angrily he stormed up to the thing threw open the door was it supposed to creak like that and got inside he looked smugly up at her and was pleased to note she had stopped laughing quickly she got in beside him it wasntuntil he she was settled neatly beside him and he began to notice the faint smell of old shoes and musty pine did he realized how easily she manipulated him why he d fallen for the oldest trick in the book he didntsay anything as moody tonks and lupin entered the car it seemed that the group could do nothing without discord there had been a fifteen minute debate on riding arrangements they had originally planned to only rent one automobile an extremely tight fit but with the addition of draco and his luggage there was absolutely no possible ways of fitting all eleven bodies and all the trunks in one car so another had been rented this led to the question of seating moody insisted that he ride with harry who in turn insisted that he not be separated from ron hermione and the big shaggy dog mr weasley didntwant to be separated from his children but no one but ginny would agree to ride with draco moody also asserted not very delicately that at least two guards should stay with the malfoy spawn as he had taken to affectionately calling him finally mad eye decided that he was the only one capable of keeping draco evil ploys at bay and immediately change positions insisting that he stay with draco lupin and tonks hovered over the whole scene staying close at each other side and not saying much finally after much deliberation it was decided that charlie mr weasley ron harry hermione and the dog quite curious that they d made as much fuss about where the dog should be placed as they had anyone else should ride in the first car and the others would follow in the second nice work weasley he whispered in her ear once the adults had settled in the front seat i almost believed that i wasntmanipulated into that we may make a slytherin out of you yet she smirked you act marvelously for someone who didntknow they were being manipulated he was about to retort when the great ambling car lurched into motion moody to everyone dismay was driving draco quite against his will let out a small cry ginny laughed and grabbed his hand for a moment he stared shocked but she wasntfacing him instead she was looking gleefully at the scenery passing by through his window he didnteven think she realized what she had done it was something she would have done to one of her brothers to harry comfort he reminded himself was her nature he considered letting go but the ride was bumpy and uncomfortable and though he wouldntadmit it he was shaking this was at least fifty times worse than riding a broom at least on a broom he could trust his own skill but now he was forced to rely on moody and it was a helpless scary feeling and her touch her thumb absently stroking his hand was much more comforting than it should have been dontworry she whispered it always scary the first time he didnteven bother to abject to her allegation you ve done this before he shouldnthave been surprised after all look who her father was she nodded we used to have one enchanted to fly he mentally slapped himself how could he have forgotten that he was the one who had gotten it taken away well his father had gotten it taken away he had just mocked ron endlessly for it how convenient that she hadntmentioned that it must have been brilliant he said softly and she looked up at him in shock that coming from him was almost an apology she smiled brightly and then seeming to realize that she had his hand in her grasp she dropped it suddenly i just figured that you wanted to hold my hand he said innocently when she looked at him who was i to deny you that pleasure she slapped him softly on the shoulder tonks turned around grinning careful wouldntwant mad eye to think your evil plots unraveling at least not until he stops driving ginny laughed the pink haired girl slapped her forehead and here i am carrying on like you remember me of course you don t i tonks she extended a hand for draco to shake which he did hesitantly i your cousin she declared happily on your mum side of course no wonder you dontrecognize me not much of a family resemblance i d say what do you think remus darling draco thought he saw remus stiffen but lupin tweaked her nose and grinned not now he said she grinned back at him and then quite literally before draco eyes she began to change her hair grew longer and hung straight and black her cheekbones shifted noticeably higher on her face she blinked several times and upon opening them the last time draco saw they had change from blue to the trademark gray malfoy eyes she did indeed now look like she could have been related to him tonks wrinkled her nose whaddaya think she asked lupin wanna come home to this every night he laughed please change back you dontlike it then you said you d love me no matter what she said batting her eyelashes this time lupin did cringe nymp if you call me nymphadora so help me i ll call of this wedding right now how many times do i have to tell you she snapped changing much more quickly back into her relatively normal self about as many times as i have to tell you i dontwant everyone to know about us yet remus interrupted calmly oh remus we ll be married in a few months anyways it not like everyone wontfind out then but until then he said i d feel much safer if you didntgo around telling everyone you meet about that enough moody barked suddenly and the two stopped arguing the two engagement was of course already common knowledge to all order members and ginny doubted lupin would have had such a problem with tonks talking about it if she werenttalking to the draco malfoy he was adorably overprotective of the younger girl stupid lovers quarrels this is exactly why members of a team shouldntget involved if you two dontshove it i ll take you off assignment until you re too old and gray to want to do anything with each other mad eye growled which isnttoo far away of dear old lupin here why look at him gray hair already tonks said at first ginny had been shocked to see tonks saying things like that so casually she was almost continually bringing up the very things that had made lupin so uncomfortable with their relationship his age the fact that they worked so closely together and most importantly his lycanthropy but the more tonks joked the better remus seemed to take it it was almost as though they thought belittling the problem would make it go away then ginny realized that tonks wasnt belittling it she was doing the opposite she was showing lupin that these things were already a part of her life she was accepting them and treating them like she would anything else lupin didntsay anything but ginny saw him take the girl hand and again ginny felt that pang in her chest it was the same one she got when she saw ron and hermione making up after a fight the same one she got when she saw hannah slide her hand into seamus s ginny weasley when did you become such a hopeless romantic she asked herself almost smiling draco she noticed was still sitting straight up looking alertly out of the windows she grinned feeling okay malfoy she asked cheerily just peachy explain to me again why we had to ride in these infernal muggle contraptions because moody snapped irritably turning around to face him his magical eye was rolled back in his head no doubt still watching the road but it was still not assuring draco shuddered and could see lupin eyeing the wheel warily the younger ones cantapparate and portkeys are easily traceably not that it matters much now we might as well just have handed voldermort the coordinates of ginny could feel draco growing angry beside her and was about to interject when lupin did it for her alastor he said warningly not happily the man fell silent and turned back towards the road ginny smiled to herself as she heard draco exhale loudly she paused to watch the scenery go by and when she looked back at him he had turned his head and looked a bit bleary eyed are you alright she asked this time seriously i feel like i just had five firewhiskeys on an empty stomach he answered with a slight groan oh no i should have warned you it motion sickness from the speed of the car he looked vaguely annoyed try looking out the window he did as he was instructed he looked away almost immediately not a good plan he said putting a hand on his stomach lupin had turned around looking concerned are you alright draco moaned and glared he was the only person ginny could imagine looking simultaneously superior and nauseous lie down the former professor ordered you ll feel better ginny didntbother to point out that you werentsupposed to get out of sight of the window but seeing as the window wasnthelping much she didntbother and if draco malfoy puked in the car she could guess who was stuck cleaning it up draco nausea only slightly hindered his enjoyment at ginny alarmed shake as he laid his head down in her lap she looked down at him startled but didntsay anything he rolled his head a little and could fell her stiffen even further he had lain in this exact position with pansy more times then he cared to remember and it had never been something he would have classified as comfortable she had bony legs and always insisted upon playing with the hair just behind his ear as if he were a dog he probably would have been much more comfortable with his feet resting in ginny lap and his head on the seat but the discomfort his proximity was causing her was much more enjoyable lupin had been right lying down had helped ease his stomach and ginny legs werentnearly as bony as pansy s now he was feeling well enough to really enjoy the situation he moaned pathetically and fidgeted a bit more hesitantly she put a hand on his head and began gently moving her fingers through his hair her touch wasntlike pansy s it was gentler and much more comforting he closed his eyes and basked in her touch he was seventeen after all and lying in the lap of a pretty girl he had decided he was going to make this christmas enjoyable no matter what it took and if he had his way and he normally did then ginny weasley was going to have a lot to do with that ok solana i can hear the angryhordes crying like seven chapters ago you promised us christmas and there still no christmas so to prevent mass chaos and mobsi can honestly say that by next chapter they will be at the weasley house really this time happy christams guys and if you really want to make me happy give me lots of review or my army of armadillos and i might have to cry ah guys i so sorry this chapter took forever but i taking geometry honors spanish ii honors english honors and business systems and tech this term so i ve been really busy sorry i ll try and have the next chapter out sooner but i cantmake any promises anyway this chapter is the much anticipated arrive at the weasley house plus for all of you who have been asking for more of the weasley brothers this a short tribute to you because there a scene i ve been dying to wirte since i first started this fic diclaimer i own nothing except the plot anything you recognize from the hp books is not mine as i unfortunatly am not jk rowling the ride was even more unbearably bumpy as they pulled onto a long dirt road after a slow drive a monstrously large and disproportioned house could you really call it a house came into view rooms hung seemingly suspended by nothing onto the house large lopsided add ons were obviously attached at different times as each was made from a different material and each in a different style draco was about to comment on the atrocity when he realized with growing horror what it was it was ginny house this was the place he d be staying he barely restrained himself from cursing his worst fears confirmed the car stopped in front of the place and ginny with absolute disregard to her trunk still in the back seat ran out of the car and into the house he sat there more than a little uncomfortably until tonks looked back at him coming she asked he still paused lupin smiled understandingly come on draco it ll be alright he followed when he entered the weasley family had already begun its reunion hermione had scurried upstairs to unpack and ginny was locked in what seemed to be a bone crushing embrace and more redheaded boys then he could count were in a twisting writhing pile in the living room floor as soon as she was released ginny jumped feet first into the pile and was received with a loud oof ginny cried mortified ginny that not appropriate another redheaded woman about the same age and looking weary said boys boys molly says stop boys ow the pile cried bill that was my nose ew ginny shave your legs another voice cried that wasnt my leg fred ginny snapped ginny boys stop that right now mrs weasley said again harry was hanging back behind the plump woman looking at the group on the floor longingly ron draco assumed was already among them hey the voice replied that wasntme it was george i thought you were george another voice replied no i fred the first answered i fred you dolt the other responded oh well then who am i george really boys the second woman said again listen to your aunt oh never mind mrs weasley said resigned ah will you re sitting on my arm come on harry a voice he recognized as ron called um mrs weasley harry said looking beseechingly oh just go harry mrs weasley said the boy ran screaming and laughing into the pile she turned and for the first time saw draco standing uncomfortably in the doorway who are you the woman asked draco the boys friend from school she asked draco wasntsure what to say he faltered for a moment before finally just shrugging and i suppose you want to join in too she asked sounding worn he shook his head no oh well sit down then get comfortable she said smiling silently he crossed the room and took a seat right about then ginny stood up amidst several loud groans and one cry of my ribs screaming i queen of the mountain not a second later the bodies under her shifted and she fell back down into the pile she was in the process of trying to stand again when her father burst through the door carrying one of their trunks ginny weasley i want a word with you he said sternly you d better come too molly the boys on the floor immediately froze and ginny slowly stood up ginny brothers all looked startled they werentused to their father being so stern it was usually their mother was the one who enforced the rules arthur was the who snuck them biscuits before dinner you had to be in really deep trouble for arthur to yell at you then ron poked one of the twins and nodded in draco direction one by one the brothers stood and glared doing a quick head count draco rapidly determined that the he was in even more trouble then he could have imagined charlie and ron the twins and ginny he recognized he vaguely remembered seeing one of the others a big tall boy with long red hair before but would never have been able to name him then there were three others who were standing silent and confused and a forth the youngest and only one not standing was still on the ground clinging stubbornly to ginny leg draco was fairly sure he hadntseen any of them before although he couldntbe certain maybe they just moved around so much he d never gotten an accurate count ginny quickly detached herself and moved towards her parents her eyes never left the floor ginny one of the twins asked what going on the other inquired glaring at him ginny your mother and i are going to have a talk if you boys fight while we re gone so help me you dontwant to know what i ll do to you arthur said and then guiding ginny firmly with one arm around her shoulders he wheeled her out of the room mrs wealsey followed with a baffled expression boys the woman in the corner said why dontwe go unpack but mum we want william weasley if you dontget upstairs this instant you wonteven see a broom for a month the woman snapped and ushered her herd up the stairs leaving only the familiar weasley faces william weasley poor kid one of the twins said shaking his head his brother patted his shoulder it had to be done eventually i just glad it wasntus why parents are such suckers for alliteration i ll never know the first said it is a quandary gred but you know what really baffles me what forge why draco malfoy is in our house and why exactly he thinks he ll leave in one piece you know i was wondering that myself by now all six of the remaining boys had rounded on him only charlie held back slightly not looking quite as suspicious as his brothers what re you doing here malfoy harry asked he merely shrugged in response the oldest looked suspicious that all the answer you have for us gritting his teeth and forcing himself to stay calm he responded i just dontsee how it any of your business the mal ferret thinks he staying here for the holiday ron said a bit of triumph in his voice for having known something his brothers didn t does he now bill asked looking more than a little suspicious and why is that ginny ron answered i dontknow what he got over her but do you ever shut up draco snapped losing the battle to stay calm come off it malfoy harry said did you really expect us to believe that ginny just invited you for a jolly holiday he smirked depends on what exactly you mean by jolly i gonna kill you ron said starting forward charlie grabbed the back of his shirt to restrain him gentlemen gentlemen one of the twins fred george did it really even matter said as much as i d love to see malfoy get pummeled we have more urgent needs the two boys held up a long fleshy chord the weasley brothers plus harry abandoned him to surround the twins draco had the distinct feeling he was missing something then he heard ginny voice loud and clear over the device i already told you i can t she was saying ginny you cantjust expect us to welcome him with open arms he s i know who he is it you that doesn t please i understand why you re upset but no ginny you dontseem to her father answered this doesntjust concern you you are putting our family the entire order everything we ve worked for in danger you think i would be doing this if i didntthink it was safe she said now only a degree away from yelling trust me i know sweetie mrs weasley said of course we trust you it him we donttrust just look who his father is i know you donttrust him but i do and if you really trust me then you ll just have to believe me and accept that because there nothing else i can tell you draco held his breath for what seemed like forever finally he heard a sigh fine ginny we ll have to talk to dumbledore of course but as far as i concerned he can stay okay little sister fred said putting an arm around ginny what you plan eh what do you mean ginny asked shifting uncomfortably for the past hour she d been avoiding her brothers but they d finally cornered her the prying eyes of all six of her brothers and harry even percy who d apparently been hiding in the kitchen to escape the reunion gleaming down at her what your plan to torture malfoy are you blackmailing him george asked he quirked an eyebrow and made a sour frown did you lure him with your feminine wiles no she said good george answered firmly so you ve hexed him prompted fred no she said again i knew it george announced shacking his head in disgust ah ha so he blackmailing you fred said indignantly no there is no blackmail involved she cried then she paused knowing that wasntstrictly true he just need a place to stay and i owed him a favor she said after a moment that was at least a little closer to the truth so he hexed her george shouted no look ginny what ever he got on you you can tell us we wontget mad ron said in what was probably meant to be an assuring manner look ronald she said keeping only a very forced restraint on her exasperation he doesnt have anything on me which again was a lie he had the necklace on her quite literally i was just doing something nice well i dontcare what you say that boy is bad road i dontlike this at all percy said well that at least one reason to like him fred murmured look i know you wontbelieve me but i dontthink the kid all that bad gee thanks for that professional opinion charlie you having known the prat all of an hour think he a pretty okay guy well that just changes everything fred snapped hey back off george bill said ginny felt awful she was going to kill malfoy for leaving her alone to deal with he brothers at least he would have been able to lie to them without compunction she on the other hand hated lying to them at least about something as major as this guys listen i not going to tell you any more than i told mum and dad seven mouths opened in protest donteven bother telling me you werentlistening she snapped i d tell you more if i could i promise as soon as this is over i ll tell you exactly what going on until then you ll just have to believe me when i say that everything going to be fine i trust him it was the second time that day she said those words and she was surprised to find she almost believed them the boys all still looked hesitant you donthave to like him she said smiling slightly you just cantkill him there was a long pause finally bill sighed and said that a lot to ask gin you know weasley ginny jumped as she opened her door only to find draco malfoy reclining on her bed surrounded by throw pillows he propped himself up on one arm i would have preferred stricter guidelines then you cantkill him like the promise of all my limbs not likely if they see you there she said indicating the bed she made a mental note to remind him later that baby blue daisy throw pillows clashed horribly with his complexion how d you hear that anyway he held up one of the extendable ears your brothers really should keep a closer eye on these things didntanybody ever tell you eavesdropping isntpolite no actually my dad told me eavesdrop only when you cantfind someone expendable to do it for you she grinned sitting down on the bed cheery i ve got loads of them he used to always tell me the best leaders inspire by example if that is not an option brute force and intimidation work just as well yes that does seem rather like your father doesntit she smiled almost reminiscently but her eyes darkened he a jerk he found himself saying before he d even contemplated the words what ginny asked looking at him in astonishment my father he spat still surprising himself he a complete wanker ginny looked taken aback for a moment she faltered and draco could tell she was debating between agreeing and trying to make him feel better well i i i dontreally know him she managed after a moment yes you do lucius malfoy is exactly what you think he is i sorry she said dontbe the silence that hung there was long awkward she reached up to fiddle with the necklace that still hung at her neck a nervous habit she had acquired somewhere in the past few months then realizing what she was doing she quickly pulled her hand away and blushed well then she said turning around so he wouldntsee her blush we d better get you to your room then he grinned what i not staying here she turned back to glance at him he was still propped up amongst her pillows now giving her a suggestive look i sorry she said sweetly my bed is much too small for me and your ego that just makes it all the more romantic she snorted and turned back away but he was quite sure he saw he blush a great deal more than she should have been during their regular repartee on the way up the stairs he made sure to accidentally brush against her shoulder he smirked at her back as she quickened her pace yes he could already think of several ways to make this holiday more interesting thanks to all of you who reviewed man i love you guys now if you dontwant me to hunt you down and attack you viciously please review i wonteven bother to apologize for taking so long to update you guys must be used to it by

polish i don t however own harry potter jingle bells snape hair smells flitwick laid an egg mcgonagall is off the wall and trelawney is nuts amateurs fred scoffed shaking his head as ron and harry skipped arms locked up the stairs that didnteven rhyme yeah well it a work in progress ginny said grinning fred shook his head oh by the way gin mum said to give you these he handed her three pales and several rags ah thanks she took them hesitantly and turned smiling nervously at draco well then come on we d better get your stuff up to your room he grabbed his trunk from where it had been left by the front door and followed her carefully up the stairs trying to ignore their strained groans weasley he said what exactly are those for uh nothing nothing ginny bedroom was on the third landing the only other room on the floor was a small bathroom directly opposite her door on either side of her room was a staircase they took the one on the left here we are she said smiling throwing the door open merlin he said followed by several less than pleasant words its not that bad she said and he noticed she was blushing it just needs a bit of sprucing up the entire left side of the room was stacked with boxes which at some point had probably been packed up for storage but had long since been torn open and ransacked their contents lay scattered across the room everything from clothes to cauldrons to an unidentified green furry object poking out from under the beg the mattress old and yellow was set on a rickety frame on the right side of the room a small wooden bed stand beside it everything was cast with nearly an inch of dust the wooden floors were grimy and smeared with odd brown stains in several places not that bad he asked incredulously it filthy and it was small the room couldnthave been much bigger then his mother closet we never use this room the ghoul used to hang out down here it a bit she bit her lip and struggled for the right word why d he leave too dirty for him no she said firmly it was bad enough that here she definitely didntneed him pointing out how inadequate it was and yes it wasntexactly neat but unlike him who she was quite sure wouldntknow a cleaning spell to save his life they couldntafford a maid he was just so ungrateful this was her house and here he was making her feel bad about it she huffed this wasntlike her she d never questioned what she had before she loved this house and the way she lived and there was no way that draco malfoy of all people was suddenly going to make her start you know you really can be a pig sometimes she said suddenly he looked mildly surprised just trying to blend with my surroundings at least you have your own room you could be staying with the twins right because that would have gone over well your stupid brothers would oh just shut up malfoy she snapped i opened my house to you and all you can do is insult me and my family well i he laughed but it wasnta pleasant sound opened your house to me i wouldnteven be here if i had given you a choice you just tell yourself whatever it is that makes you sleep at night but you re not any better then me and you know it she flushed i ginny broke off looking down at the floor she exhaled and stood silent for a moment here she said quietly offering him the rags take these she disappeared through the door with the buckets he stood staring at his feet until she got back the pales now full with water without a word she snatched one of the rags from his hands and knelt down on the floor and began to scrub what are you doing weasley what does it look like she snapped why dontyou just use your wand no magic outside of school remember oh she didntsay anything he stood watching for a moment as she pushed the rag fiercely across the floor he waited until it became apparent that she was not going to give him any instructions then slowly settled down on the floor beside her and dunked one of the other rags into the water they worked in silence for nearly an hour until they had cleaned the entire right side of the floor and ginny was still scrubbing with such ferocity that he was certain she d bored holes into the floor there was just something about him that drove her wild this was their first real fight in a long time and she couldnteven really figure out how it had happened true he d been a royal twit but she d just learned to take that for granted normally letting his comments slide he really hadntsaid anything that should have made her get as angry as she had it was stupid to let him upset her half the time she got the feeling he didnteven realize how patronizing he was being she sighed pausing her work a moment to relax her now stiff fingers this time she was the one who was at fault he was in a new place full of people he didntlike who quite frankly werentwild about him either she should have been trying to make him feel more comfortable and instead she had lost her temper you know better she scolded herself you know how he is she should say something uh malfoy she trailed off not knowing exactly what to say somehow she guessed saying gee sorry malfoy i just forgot you were a prick and just canthelp yourself from being a complete and total prat wasntgoing to make life any easier he looked up at her crossly waiting for her to continue well i never mind just just stack those boxes over there would you he wordlessly went to obey silently she fumed how was it possible with just that one word he had managed to be annoyed superior and indifferent all at once she walked over to the curtains at some time they had probably been red but the now hung brown and dank drowning out all outside light they would have to be washed standing on her tiptoes she reached to take them down from their balance as soon as she touched the thick fabric she heard a snarl and the material rippled under her touch ahh she called pulling her hand back quickly as she watched at least ten little lumps moved behind the curtain until twenty little black eyes peered at her from behind the drapery doxies you have doxies draco asked sounding somewhere between disgusted and incredulous no one even been in this room in ages she said by way of explanation she went downstairs and found the doxycide and antidote in the cupboard when she returned draco was still working but she noticed with a bit of twisted pleasure that he kept looking over his shoulder at the curtains anxiously obviously he wasntgoing to help her spray there were more of the furry creatures then she had originally thought and they moved wickedly fast she effectively stunned at least seven of them and the curtain was still rippling wildly to avoid her reach she sprayed again and her small black victim fell to the floor she quickly bent to retrieve it just as her hand closed around the hairy body of the creature a set of very sharp teeth closed on her hand she shrieked as she looked down at the doxy which had been lying in wait at the bottom of the draperies she pulled her hand away quickly but the stubborn little thing clamped its teeth down further and hung on flailing its limbs wildly ow you stupid little bugger let go she waved her hand in the air which proved to be a stupid thing to do as the doxy only bit harder to avoid being thrown across the room stop that weasley draco snapped she stopped waving her arm and found him beside her he grabbed hold of the creature with one hand and with the other he pulled the trigger of the spray bottle drenching the thing in the noxious smelling doxycide here just stay still he said carefully he pried the jaws of the doxy off her hand she bit her lip and held back tears she d been bitten by a doxy before but this one clearly had some sort of personal grudge against her it had gotten hold of the soft skin between her thumb and index finger and the cut was bleeding profusely draco gingerly wiped the blood away with a rag when he had cleared it away she could see two small punctures that pierced almost completely through the thin bit of skin she winced when he uncorked the antidote and rubbed it over the sore did i hurt you he asked pulling away a little no she said trying to smile it just stings do you have any bandages uh she couldntquite remember if they did or not if so they were probably downstairs in her bathroom he followed her down the short flight of stairs she jumped up and seated herself on the vanity by the sink and began rummaging through the little cabinet mounted on the wall aha she said after a minute of searching bandages she tried to unroll a length from the spool but she found it nearly impossible with one hand oh just give it here draco snapped grabbing the bandages from her he carefully began to wrap her hand she sat quietly impressed with how gentle his touch was she studied his hands his long soft fingers occasionally brushing against her skin you should know where your bandages are he said not looking up but continuing to stare intently at her hand as he worked if there was an emergency you should know ginny grinned aww is poor wittle drakie afraid i might get hurt he paused and looked up at her for a moment then continued working without a word it was odd to be seated like this with him his touch was almost no brotherly wasntthe right word her brothers would have never taken such care over something as small as a doxy bite but still the tenderness with which he wrapped her small hand was surprising the longer he sat silently working the more she felt the guilt from their argument earlier mounting on her draco he tied off the bandage look i just i sorry about earlier i she paused trying to formulate an acceptable apology i oww what was that for he had taken hold of her hand and was gripping it painfully pressure i wanted to stop the bleeding he said simply but she could see a glimmer of amusement in his eyes fine no apology for you she said haughtily oh is that what you were trying to do he asked smirking well what did you expect a bouquet of roses and a singing telegram no thanks i haventforgotten your last singing valentine that was uncalled for i was eleven for merlin sake she said how did it go some thing about eyes as green as pickled toads i never listening to luna again she murmured well i d say your first mistake was listening to luna at all if this is your attempt at being nice you re failing miserably actually he said i believe you were the one who was apologizing let get back to that shall we hmm i could have you write draco a hot muffin in all the girls loos she scoffed oh you re right that already there the boy more likely she said playfully well i canthelp being so devastatingly attractive well you dontexactly discourage the notion the way you strut around i he said arrogantly do not strut oh please she said laughing your hips swing more than mine do he smirked what why exactly have you been watching my hips weasley she blushed that was most certainly not what she had meant she opened her mouth to protest but she found she couldntthink of a suitable response although he said grinning crookedly i dontknow that i believe you you do have a bit of sway dontyou i cantdecide whether i should be flattered or disgusted he didntsay anything suddenly she blushed realizing he still had her hand in his warm grasp i i am sorry about before i i didntreally he shrugged looking up to meet her eyes me too weasley they were so very close seated on the vanity she was just barely taller than him she for the first time noticed how very beautiful his eyes were grey but suddenly not impassive filled with an emotion she couldntquite place her leg was lightly touching the side of his chest where it lay and she could feel his muscles contact as he breathed he leaned almost imperceptivity closer and too close too close she coughed uncomfortably and leaned away a little he paused seemingly unaware that he d gotten so close to her he stepped back quickly we d better get back to cleaning then he nodded i ah need my hand back she said hoping he didntnotice her blush he dropped it quickly right then cleaning by eight o clock the room was at least sanitary enough to stand in the sheets and curtains doxy free had been scourified several times through by mrs weasley they were red which was almost enough to make him wish they were dirty again according to ginny the floor was clean enough to eat off of which he hoped was not meant to be taken literally and the boxes were neatly stacked out of the way ginny had left nearly twenty minutes before to get cleaned up for dinner as he walked down the stairs he paused at her door he heard a knocking and thought for a moment it was ginny but then he realized the sound was much too distant he heard a door open and mrs weasley invite someone in he heard the door creak again draco he jumped merlin dontdo that ginny laughed from behind him come on dinner time he followed her down the rest of the stairs by the time they reached the kitchen it was filled with people the table had been magically elongated to fit an apparently infinite number of people fred and george sat beside each other each opposite to an identical glaring freckled face charlie sitting backwards on his chair was discussing something with bill who was casually leaning against the wall percy sat stiffly between his mother and a skinny brunette draco vaguely remembered from school mrs weasley was seated next to her husband who was leaning across the table avidity gesturing with his fork about something to lupin and a rather shaggy man with dark hair seated next to mr weasley at the head of the table looking strangely out of place and larger than life in the crowded room was dumbledore he smiled when he saw draco tonks was there too holding lupin hand under the table there was a slew of other redheaded children including ron who was whispering conspiratorially with harry and hermione as ginny approached the table a chair appeared next to harry she sat and began to fill her plate hesitantly draco followed and just as it had for ginny a chair sprang up from nowhere to accommodate him she was pleased at least that dumbledore had acknowledged them that meant someone had already told him about draco she sighed that was one less time she d have to tell someone she couldnttell them anything who are all these people i didntknow there could be this much red outside of the gryffindor common room that she said pointing to the woman who had been talking to molly when he first arrived is my aunt may and the man next to her is my uncle dave the one on the other side of hermione is my cousin ben and do you really expect me to remember names weasley of course not i expect you to say weasley really loudly and hope the right one turns around he nodded yeah that was the general plan she grinned you re the one that asked temporary insanity temporary ms weasley she looked up into the quiet blue eyes of the headmaster he hadntspoke loudly at all and yet she could easily hear him from across the table above the clatter of everyone around them could i perhaps bother you for a meeting after dinner she nodded yes professor perhaps mr malfoy could be persuaded as well he said looking at draco who nodded in turn the headmaster smiled wonderful now if i could just trouble you to pass the yams wonderful food yams headmaster albus dumbledore looked if possible even less stately to the backdrop of daisy pillows then draco did the color did make his eyes look absolutely lovely but fighting down a giggle she decided that was probably a highly inappropriate thing to say your father has informed me of your um shall we say vague reasoning i dontsuppose you could tell me he trailed off ginny was shaking her head vehemently no i had supposed as much i expect you understand the significance of what you re doing he asked looking at her seriously over his half moon glasses yes headmaster he nodded i thought so he turned to address draco professor snape says i should trust you he stated simply examining the blond for a long moment i hope you understand that there will be things which you must keep secret draco nodded he couldntfor the life of him guess what could possibly be so important that dumbledore himself felt the need to address it but he got the felling that something very serious was being asked of him good for now you are free to go but i fear i must inform you that several people are insistent upon you re immediate departure i on the other hand believe in the potential in each and every one of my students if however you prove untrustworthy there will be consequences do you understand draco nodded and you ms weasley you realize that he is now your responsibility should anything happen you will be equally to blame yes headmaster he smiled standing up good now if you ll excuse me i have a rather pressing engagement with some of molly peach cobbler someday weasley you ll have to explain to me what exactly i just agreed to she sighed dontworry you ll see soon enough there was a long pause he absolutely insane you know barking mad she smiled it part of his charm draco had been staring at the bed for twenty long minutes and was still nowhere closer to convincing himself to crawl in them he had personally watched as mrs weasley had washed them three times but he still could get the image of the damp brown sticky sheets out of his head there was a knock at the door and draco almost sighed in relief that there was at least something to take his mind off the creatures that were undoubtedly lurking under the covers waiting for him ginny was standing at the door when he opened it and without waiting for a response she pushed past him and went directly to the bed i always pictured you as the kind of girl who would need flowers and poetry but the direct route works just as well he said shrugging shove it she said but not unpleasantly as she began to strip the sheets from the mattress what are you doing weasley well your not going to sleep in them are you she asked eyeing him with amusement discarding the old ones she tossed a ball of white cotton sheets at him it only took me about a minute to realize you were probably up here staring at them waiting for a swamp giant to jump out at you i was not she looked at him just help me put those on he looked at the sheets in his hand doubtfully oh come off it those are clean i laundered them myself is that supposed to reassure me she glared you re such a snob he grinned i prefer sophisticated darling with only a little difficulty she got the sheets onto the mattress draco of course standing and watching the whole process without lifting a finger when she finished she settled down on the bed what are you doing he asked suspiciously hoping one of my brothers comes in thinks you re seducing me and attacks you it would be extremely entertaining you have a sick sense of humor weasley so i ve been told fold those she said looking around the room her eyes fell on the bed stand where two pictures stood they had not been there before one was a picture of a tall thin woman with blond hair she was smiling and waving with a start ginny recognized her as draco mother the same woman they had seen at the world cup then with her upturned nose and dead eyes ginny had though her a very unattractive woman now however she could see that was pretty she would have been absolutely striking when she was younger the image turned to smile at draco who was now very carefully attempting to fold the old sheets without actually having to touch them her eyes softened as the fell upon her son and then she turned back to ginny smiling conspiratorially the second frame held a picture of blaise who waved happily at her his arm was around a very pretty girl with long black hair who even in the picture managed an air of absolute superiority blaise was trying valiantly to cure her of that tugging on her hair and giving her bunny ears the girl gave him a withering glare and turned around blaise giggled behind his hand ginny looked at the picture trying to place where she knew the girl from she didntattend hogwarts ginny was positive blaise hadntintroduce them and she sylvia she said suddenly what draco asked looking up he had just managed to fold the sheet in half using the tip of his loafer this is sylvia the girl from the restaurant isntit she asked holding up the picture draco nodded yeah she blaise cousin ginny looked at the picture again now wondering how she couldnthave realized it before the beautiful waitress from c est la vie was just as impassive in the picture as she was in real life and ginny couldntfigure out how she hadntnoticed the resemblance between blaise and his cousin they had the same black hair and identical noses and her eyes she remembered how striking her eyes had been now she knew why they were blaise eyes not the exact same shade of blue but close and the shape was indistinguishable but no she concluded still staring at the two that was only part of it there was still something else that had bothered her about the girl she didntgo to hogwarts no draco answered beauxbatons she graduated two years ago she owns that restaurant she owns it yes draco answered looking surprised the zabinis are almost as rich as the malfoys i ve known her since before i was born she placed the picture back on the stand draco looked up at her annoyed fine she said sliding off the bed and going to help him with the sheet as she folded it over the last time she looked up to find him smirking at her what she asked i knew if i just stood there long enough you d do it ineptitude life greatest excuse she stuck her tongue out at him good thing you really are completely incompetent you re not that great of an actor oh very clever weasley thank you that is one of my greatest attributes she said with a mock bow you know malfoy we re not too bad at this getting along thing we ve been in the same room for a quarter of an hour and no one in traction i d say that commendable quite he laughed do me a favor and tell that to your brothers oh i ll be sure to tell them we get on just fine in fact i think i ll tell them just how close we re getting she said batting her eyelashes innocently well then he said moving closer and taking hold of her wrists you might as well have something to tell them draco malfoy never backed down from a challenge she faltered and he held back a smirk as her breath caught i a knock at the door stopped her and even before she knew what had happened draco had dropped her arms and stepped away just before ron freckled face appeared at the door mum sent me up to see if the ferret had enough blankets is everything alright gin ron asked suspiciously looking from draco to ginny who was still fighting down a blush of course ron she answered i was just brining malfoy some clean sheets ron glared isntit a little past your bedtime weasel draco asked smirking come on ginny ron said let go ginny hurried across the room to her brother who put one arm protectively on her elbow leading her to the door good night ginny draco called after her as the door closed ginny ron said when they were outside and safely out of earshot listen i know what you said earlier but are you sure you re okay i mean he didnt do anything to you or something ginny smiled she should have been mad but she was for the moment at least too touched by her brother concern i promise ron everything fine you ll tell me though right tell me if something happens of course ron good night she leaned up and kissed him on the cheek goodnight gin that took so long to write you have no idea anyways the first little hints of fluffiness will really start to pick up probably next chapter collective groan finally i know anyway for those of you who just cantwait that long check out my other little500review thankyou ficlet

so i know that people are actually reading this love ya ll hey guys first i just want to say thanks to all my reviewers i love you guys also i d like make afew note about the story first i know there are errors hopefully none of them are too major i read my story billions of times before i post it and try to fix all the mistakes but even still the chapters are riddled with errors so i sorry but if i was going to make it perfect it would takes weeks to even get a page typed secondly to anyone who doesntthink there had been enough draco in the story i sorry i promise there will be more of him in the next chapters disclaimer i own nothing wish i did but i don t everything here belongs to the wonderful j k rowling except the plot but she can have that too if she wants it ginny awoke in the hospital wing she tried to sit up but a sharp pain in her head stopped her she laid her head back down and went to sleep when ginny weasley opened her eyes again she was dressed in the standard flannel pajamas of the hospital wing beside her ron was asleep in a waiting room chair and colin head rested at the foot of her bed hello madame pomfrey scurried over to her bed oh good you re awake how long have i been asleep two two and a half hours the woman replied ladling some vile substance into a glass which she handed promptly to ginny colin sat up and shook his head groggily ginny how are you feeling better thank you you still have to drink that the nurse said firmly darn well bottoms up she said and reluctantly drank the liquid now if you dontmind could you please tell me what happened before you fainted well pro mcgonagall was scolding me and then the room started spinning i felt like i was going to throw up she wished she could remember something more but she couldntseem to have you eaten anything unusually that could have caused you body to react oddly no not that i know of hmmm well i found no signs of illness have you had these feelings of dizziness before she wasntfeeling well last night colin offered she nodded i had forgotten about that have you been having feelings of fatigue or exhaustion yes i have lately but i dontthink hmmmm it almost sounds like a memory charm the two students looked skeptically at her but i found no sign that your state was caused by magic i can find no other conclusion other then your affliction was caused by extreme exhaustion unless there is something else you would like to tell me no not that i can think of well just to be safe i d like to keep you in for observation until tomorrow evening but tomorrow is friday i cantmiss class it only my fourth day i sorry dear but i just want to make sure you re alright before i release you you understand now go to sleep you need your rest but listen to her gin she knows what she talking about goodnight sweetheart night colin she said and before she could say anymore she felt the effects of what had no doubt been a sleeping potion begin to kick in what d i miss ron asked sleepily rousing from his nap i ll explain it on the way back to the common room say goodnight he said to the older boy as though he was talking to very small child goodnight gin her brother said blearily and stumbled after colin neville for the millionth time i am okay i swear are you sure gin because if you start to feel sick again i feel fine neville was a great friend really he was but sometimes he just didntknow when to shut up he could be so annoying sometimes she had already told him at least a billion times in the past three days that she wasntsick despite her constant pleas he still insisted on keeping a constant watch over her and walking her to class which in a weird way was an indication of his concern considering her first class of the day was potions and it took something really important to get neville down into the dungeons of his own account but are you sure i mean it weird people dontjust faint for no reason it weird neville they had arrived at the potions classroom neville was twitching slightly as he looked at it and why would madame pomfrey bring up magic does she think someone could have cursed you why a memory charm it odd ginny just plain odd it not odd at all and if you werentsuch a remedial student maybe you would know that mr longbottom a voice hissed from within the classroom now i dontbelieve you are in this class so leave before i deduct points from your house bye neville ginny whispered and walked into class miss weasley your tardiness shows a blatant disrespect for the fine art of potions oh no professor i like potions i just then you must just feel you too advanced for this class is that it in that case tell me why patients who lose consciousness without other symptoms are tested for memory charms not so chatty now are we well can you at least tell me the key ingredients of a memory draught jade leaf and bat eyes very well take your seat i expect a 16 essay on memory charms ingredients side effects uses by the end of the week she sat in the only available seat in the front next to a dark haired slytherin since there were so few students who got accepted into advanced potions all the houses were condensed into one class period she took a mental tally one hufflepuff six ravenclaws nine slytherins and herself snape must really like you her partner said any other gryf would have gotten detention for sure you got off easy i hardly call getting 16 essay on memory charms getting off easy anything is better then detention with snape well i cantargue with that logic why not you argue with everything else an all too familiar voice said she turned her glaze skyward what did i do to deserve this she muttered she turned and saw the smirking face of none other then draco malfoy talking to yourself weaslette that a bad sign running out of good insults this early malfoy i d expect better then that from you well i do try but really weasley once you get past those hideous spots on your face and that ugly red hair there really not that much to say you re pretty boring why dontyou do everyone a favor and shut it ferret boy man dontyou guys every give it a rest the other slytherin asked you re either with me or against me i in a bad mood and in arms reach of potentially dangerous potion ingredients i d stay out of it she said evilly geez draco you re right she is mental told you so probably all that weasley inbreeding and you d know all about that wouldntyou malfoy you re the only person i know whose family tree is straight miss weasley must i take points from gryffindor snape yelled malfoy smirked and you mr malfoy i would hate to have to take points from my own house malfoy looked as though he had just been struck snape never took points from his own house unless it was absolutely necessary and even then he was easy on his students but snape had never ever threatened to punish draco malfoy especially not for patronizing a weasley but professor your seat mr malfoy now malfoy sullenly went back to his seat sorry about him ginny partner said he a nice guy once you get to know him he just goes a little overboard sometimes the redhead looked at him as though he d sprouted an extra head draco malfoy nice and he called her mental i blaise zabini by the way she nodded the name sounding somewhat familiar and i ginny weasley nice to meet you ginny could you pass me the hey wait a minute what she asked looking into the cauldron he wants us to make a strengthening potion but we donthave any beetle eyes ginny examined the ingredients on the work table in front of them they had been instructed to create the potion using only the components provided but blaise was right there werentany beetle eyes but there was eye of newt so we double the portion of eye of newt and that will make up for the lack of beetles but it will also make the potion highly unstable it could have nasty side effects true eucalyptus he cried happily we could use eucalyptus leaves to stabilize it yeah that just might work they worked for the remainder of the period without instance when it came time for them to turn in their creations at the end of class only two other groups had successfully produced the potion to her annoyance one of them was malfoy s draco woke up the next morning feeling as though he hadntslept at all with a groan he rolled over to face blaise who was sleeping in the next bed over he tossed a pillow at his friend what was that for well sleeping beauty we only have ten minutes before class i just thought you might want to know blaise looked at his watch and swore loudly as the two jumped out of their beds and ran for the showers as they reached the great hall for breakfast they found it already deserted except for the last of the stragglers who were apparently trying to delay the enviable fact that they would have to go to class the huge tables had already been cleared of their food ah crap malfoy said and headed off with a grumbling stomach to his first class when draco reached the infirmary there were only two other people present madame pomfrey and ginny weasley what is she doing her he thought bitterly as his stomach growled especially loud mr malfoy you re tardy malfoys are never tardy only fashionably late he said madame pomfrey glared at him see to it that it doesntbecome a habit with his most charming malfoy smile he said of course not madame even the poor old bat fell victim to his charm and blushed well in any instance it appears you are not the only one late for class professor snape has not shown up yet i might as well begin without him you two have been chosen to wait a minute do you mean she is the other student why yes mr malfoy is there a problem she a weasley how did she get into this class the same way as you did with talent and perseverance malfoy you mean to tell me you spent the entire day shopping with me and didntrealize why no i told you i was trying to ignore you besides how was i supposed to know all that was for magical healing well didntyou buy your supplies of course not he sniffed indignantly some of us have servants to do that kind of thing for us though i suppose you wouldntknow enough you two this is a class room and moreover it a hospital you will keep your voices down we mustntdisturb the patients the two teenagers looked around at the empty hospital beds what patients we re the only ones here you crazy old bat mr malfoy i will have to ask you to refrain from calling your instructor a crazy old bat no matter how close it is to the truth pro snape said from the entrance to the infirmary he made his way over to them smirking of course and looked first at him then at ginny you two will be working together this year aside from dropping the course which i doubt either of you wish to do there is no way around it i expect you to do all your work and do it as a team i expect no arguing or bickering it gives me a headache you two have been chosen out of all the students in you year because of your gift in potions and your apparent interest in medicine you will do all the work assigned to you by madame pomfrey or myself you are required to be here at least three nights a week for training in the infirmary if either of you at any point cannot or will not abide by these rules you will be cut from the class do you understand draco nodded and with more then a little hesitation ginny nodded too good here is your first assignment he handed them each a sheet of parchment with instructions on it the potion was meant to relieve headaches madame pomfrey led them to a back room of the infirmary which had been set up to resemble the potions room hand it in before the end of class wait you re leaving arentyou going to like teach us something miss weasley this class is to test your aptitude as much as anything else yes there will be days i will be in here with you but other times i want to see what you can accomplish without me great she mumbled as the older woman left the room so um what are we supposed to do now what do you think weasley make the potion oh right he watched her make way to the storage closet how she recognized it he wasntsure she pulled out several bottles of various shapes and color he immediately took the numerous bottles from her and began measuring the require amounts of each component with great care she reached to take the flask containing dragons breath but he grabbed her wrist and stopped her what do you think you re doing weasley um measuring oh no you re not and why is that my grade depends on this i wonthave you messing it up so what do you want me to do get out of my way malfoy that not fair i am just as capable as you are you re not capable to wipe the dirt of my shoes weasley i dontknow who you had to pay to get in this class and really i dontcare all i know is that i wontfail this class because some stupid weasel got in here and thinks she can even begin to compare to me you weasley will always be below me malfoy yes you just put in the wrong amount of dragon breath i did not did too look it turning green it supposed to be blue i know what it supposed to look like obviously these ingredients are just faulty yeah right look just admit you re wrong and get over it malfoys are never wrong he said haughtily watching he face get more and more red as she tried not to lose her temper it was really an amusing game bait her and see how long it took her to crack well obviously they are because if they werentyour potion would be blue i suppose you think you could do better weasley as a matter of fact yes i do fine then be my guest he said and stepped away with a mock bow instantly she set to work all the time muttering about those darn malfoys and idiot teachers who leave you alone with that darn malfoy eventually after several comments from the darned malfoy in question about muttering being the first sign of insanity the mumbling subsided instead she focused on the task before her taking careful measurements and once in a while taking notes on her parchment he watched amused how her face screwed up with concentration and how she bit her lower lip when she thought occasionally she would tug on her glossy red locks as if trying to pull the thought from her head once she even got up and pulled another ingredient from the closet though he couldntimagine why when she clearly had all she needed in front of her finally nearly twenty minutes later she looked up from her work and smiled delightedly finished she announced he examined the completed potion it was a deep blue with the thick murky consistency of paste he ladled a small amount into a flask and with her following close behind left the back room to find madame pomfrey done so soon their instructor asked cheerfully yes ma am the redhead beside him answered equally cheerful well let see here she examined the potion carefully good color and consistency hmmm what this she asked smelling the liquid lily pollen it sweetens the taste and smell of the potion without lessening the affectedness you enhanced the potion that takes skill my dears i very pleased the plump woman said smiling and then continued her in inspection of the potion see malfoy admit it i did well the girl said once the older woman had walked away whatever admit it i was right and you were wrong whatever weasley geez why wontyou just own up to the fact that i am just as good as you are because you will never be as good as i am i do believe that i just got us an a on that assignment yeah but i not the one who just got tricked into doing all the work now am i draco turned and walked away malfoy where are you going the bell hasntrung yet he paused just long enough to turn and face her as he did the bell dismissing them rang now it has he said and then walked away she sighed it was going to be one long year arg i dontlike this chapter very much but i hope you did please this is my first fanfic so if you have any suggestions or comments please review i ll try and update soon if you guys want me to and please no flames if you dontlike it email me and tell me how to make it better also one of my friends let me know that i still had it set to bloke anonymous reveiwers but i have fixed that so if you tried to review before and couldn t you can now draco plushies to all my reveiwers ahh remember way back when i first started this story and actually updated on time good times i dontsuppose i should even appologize for taking forever to update since your probably sick of my excuses anyway unless you hate this story and were pleasantly convinced that i had abandoned this story in which case why are this again anyway today is officially the first day of my spring break so expect an update soon really this time disclaimer of course i dontown it must you force me to remember that painful topic every time draco rolled over in bed and not only just because it was lumpier than one of neville longbottom potions for the majority of his second year draco had had a nightmare in which he was flying alone and just as he was about to reach out and catch the snitch he found he was incapable of moving his hand to grab it it was always right about then harry potter usually much more pimply and shorter than he was in reality had swooped down and snatched it right from under his nose as the scene in the bathroom replayed in his mind he couldnthelp but be reminded of that dream he had been so close there had been ginny completely flustered and perfectly innocent if he had reached up and kissed her just then he knew she wouldnthave pulled away but still he had found himself immobilized completely unprepared it was almost as if he had been nervous but that was of course completely preposterous he hadntbeen nervous around a girl since he was twelve well and there was pansy he was always nervous around pansy but that was for a completely unrelated reason he would just have to accept that whatever the dodgy fluttering feeling he d gotten in his stomach just came from the food which he had been astounded to discover had been made by mrs weasley herself he d always know the weasleys didnthave maids or house elves merlin knew he d tortured them for it but he d never really considered the applications the cleaning he had been forced into doing hadntbeen too shocking but the fact that they actual had to cook for themselves he tried to picture his mother in an apron cooking peach cobbler and nearly laughed aloud the image was pushed aside when he once again saw ginny breathing heavily green eyes shining he cursed banishing the picture and replacing it with another this one ginny standing almost cornered against the wall looking up at him in abashed uneasiness her breath catching as he approached if her idiot brother hadntwalked in just then stupid twit draco rolled over and tried to go to sleep that night he dreamt about chasing the snitch into his kitchen only to crash huge mountain of peach cobbler when he poked his head out his mother was standing there with ginny admonishing him for not using a spoon it was quarter to eleven when he woke up the next morning lazily he wallowed in the comfort of the blankets for several minutes before slowly pushing one leg over the side of the bed after another long moment he slid his other leg over the edge and stood stretching for a moment his stomach growled loudly as he climbed loudly down the stairs he paused at ginny room the door was open and no one was inside from the light trickling down from the opposite staircase he guessed ron and harry were already up and about too now at the foot of a second flight of stairs he could hear the obnoxious notes of christmas carols ringing from below for a second he considered turning around and going back upstairs but his stomach made an undignified protest grumbling when he finally reached the first floor he followed the sound of voices he found them in the living room ron and harry were signing a rather lurid christmas song entitled too big for your chimney hermione was holding a garland while ginny balancing rather precariously on the top of an armchair hung it along the top of the wall creating a festive if not garish multicolored border there were all still in there pajamas ginny wearing what was undoubtedly on of her brother shirts a long sleeved brown flannel shirt that would probably have normally come somewhere around her mid thigh was standing on her tip toes and the material was riding up considerably he paused taking a moment to appreciate her long thin legs and santa grabbed the presents and took away the tree cause for this you ll be on the naughty list until you re ninety three she finished the last line of the song with the boys some day weasley he drawled you ll have to show me exactly what this is he knew ron would make him pay for that later but the look on her face as she turned around was worth it she spun so quickly on her heel that the whole chair toppled over and with surprising grace for her at least she was able to catch herself before falling completely to the ground he smirked slightly as he noticed her try and smooth the nightshirt he turned his head slightly so that weasel and pot head wouldntsee him and then let his eyes roam slowly and suggestively down her body the gesture was more to discomfort her then for his benefit but that didntstop him from noticing how nicely the heavy material fell over her curves the deep brown set off her hair and made her ivory skin even paler then usual the effect should have made her freckles stand out more instead they matching the fabric almost exactly in shade looked like a thousand tiny jewels added purposely to finish off the ensemble he thought of pansy in her lacy pink nightgown and decided it was almost unfair that anyone should look so good in brown flannel hermione unfortunately caught his glaze and frowned she opened her mouth and was about to say something when mrs weasley came in she too was in pajamas a purple knit robe covering them oh ginny that garland lovely she said smiling noticing draco her smile faltered a moment but it was only gone a second before she plastered another one good morning mr malfoy he smiled charmingly oh please ma am just call me draco i never got the chance yesterday to thank you for your hospitality opening your house to me and on such sort notice and with so many other guests already i just hope i not putting you out too much ron and ginny both snorted loudly he ignored them oh well arentyou just too sweet mrs weasley said smiling sincerely now and dontyou worry you are no trouble at all is there anything i can get for you well i was about to find a shower no showers malfoy ginny interrupted smiling weasley family christmas rule no gets out of their pajamas for the whole first day of holiday oh ginny dontbe silly i sure draco will want to shower after how far you all traveled yesterday and she added chidingly draco is your guest i expect you to call him by his proper name she smiled again feel free to use the bathroom on the third floor come in he said the knock on the bathroom door had been almost inaudible ginny opened the door holding a light blue towel i ah realized you didntknow where the towels were she said averting her eyes and blushing furiously draco again in his attempt at honesty had to admit he was a narcissist he had a running total of every girl that had ever said anything complimentary about him and which pants had elicited that response he knew exactly which outfit to wear to make his eyes stand out so he knew that standing there in just his satin pajama pants having casually discarded his shirt on the bathroom floor he was apollo reincarnate he didntneed the mirror to tell him exactly how low the material was clinging on his hipbones he smiled at her reaching out to accept the towel what the matter weasley n n nothing she stuttered despite her valiant attempts to look at the tile her eyes had inevitably in his opinion returned to his chest he couldntexactly have been called skinny but he certainly wasntin any way heavy he had a long wiry build there were no bulging muscles seekers didntneed them everything about his body advertised an economy of resources nothing lacking nothing in excess he smirked just admit that you re freakishly attracted to me it okay i dontmind that kind of thing he said raising an eyebrow suggestively ginny breaking out of her trance snorted i swear someone needs to get you medication and lots of it dontneed it he said smugly everything in proper working condition i have a list of girls able to testify to that if you need recommendations she laughed is that all you ever think about he grinned well occasionally i think about quidditch you know he said looking thoughtful i think that the first time you ve laughed at me she snorted again certainly not i laugh at you all the time mostly loudly and cruelly when you re not in the room he looked slightly hurt i meant when i was trying to be funny you were trying to be funny hmm i thought you were trying to be honest i should have known that was unlikely he paused had this been a month ago he would have been insulted or at the very least thought she was upset but the banter had fallen into an almost friendly tone not unlike something he would have said to blaise aak he pretended to glare i sick of your abuse get out of here and if i don t she asked innocently these pants are coming off in five seconds whether you re in here or not weasley fine fine malfoy i leaving no need to threaten me she said throwing a hand over her eyes with a grin and closing the door behind her he was slightly disappointed he d almost expected her to stay narcissa sighed i just feel like there something more i should be doing you ve done enough snape said reassurances sounding awkward on his lips she smiled sadly at him draco been distant lately i guess i just worried he used to write weekly now i lucky if i hear from him more than twice a month you re sure you can t we ve been through this before narcissa it better for both of you if you dontknow you re right of course it just kills me not knowing where my son is you promise me he safe snape nodded solemnly severus you re sure that you ve got it under control the woman molly i ve told dumbledore he got double guard on her everything will be fine a double guard will that be enough i dontknow snape said honestly dumbledore seems to think so narcissa reached across the table and took his hand in hers and squeezed they sat for a moment in silence you d better go she said finally he agreed taking his coat and standing he looked at her one last time it will be okay narcissa george that doesntmatch what are you talking about it matches the one fred putting on george answered innocently what mrs weasley asked spinning to face fred who was putting on an identical purple orb fred in the meantime george slipped his own ornament onto the tree the initial plan had been for a gold and red themed christmas tree for gryffindor of course but it had quickly deteriorated into a competition of which weasley child could sneak the most of their homemade decorations onto the tree construction paper and colored clay were quickly overpowering the branches there were at least three little paper ornaments with ginny smiling school picture on them and at least twice that many of the twins who had against their will been forced to take separate school portraits to compensate they would take turns disappearing from their own ornaments to crowd into the other s there were two little lumps of red and green clay that ginny explained were charlie and were supposed to be dragons ginny cousins who had no ornaments of their own to contribute were busily haphazardly tossing garlands and tinsel which only occasionally made it to the tree there was one with a picture of the trio on it and draco observed that mrs weasley had just happened not to notice harry slipping it on the whole family had crowded into the living room for the spectacle and as ginny had said they were all still in their pajamas even arthur who d had to go into work that day had come home and immediately traded his suit for a long nightshirt the only ones who refused to participate were percy a set of twins who with their glasses and upturned noses were not only reflections of each other but miniatures of their older cousin and draco himself all of the weasleys occasionally looked over at percy sadly as if expecting that they would magically find him wearing comfortably wearing footy pajamas instead of his work clothes and a scowl after a while fred and george abandoned their decorating to teach ron and harry a second verse of too big for your chimney and molly was livid think of the example you re setting she bellowed over the chorus ginny with a grin joined in virginia weasley stop that this instant she gave up when arthur belted out the last few lines with his children she was looking imploringly at her sister in law from the other room a baby started crying on no the woman said dontworry aunt may ginny said standing up a small mountain of tinsel falling to the floor as she did i ll get it draco noticed with distinct disappointment a pair of one of her brothers baggy shorts had appeared to go under he pajamas thank you ginny why did i ever agree to it molly seven children mrs weasley laughed brotherly competition dave couldntvery well have less then arthur arnold wife anne put her foot down at six and they never let him live it down the conversation continued on and the longer ginny was gone the more acutely uncomfortable draco became his discomfort increased when he suddenly heard someone exclaim blimey draco malfoy do i have the wrong fireplace he looked up into the fire in the midst of the flames was the head of seamus finnigan the annoying gryffindor the boy caught sight of ron and harry and looked even more baffled harry was about to say something when mrs weasley turned to face the boy and said with a smile why seamus wonderful to see you did you need something i i was just looking for ginny he said still staring at the blond in front of him in bemusement then as an afterthought he added sorry to interrupt like this mrs weasley hope i not bothering you too much not at all she said beaming i ll call ginny right now there another fireplace in the kitchen it two floos down if you want to talk there seamus smiled hesitantly and muttered a quick thank you before disappearing ginny mrs weasley called and after a second ginny appeared at the doorway carrying a baby and a bottle here give him here seamus is waiting in the kitchen fireplace to talk to you ginny handed the baby to her mother and hurried off to the kitchen seamus was indeed waiting for her when she arrived ginny what on earth is going on down there i just flooed into your living room and draco malfoy was in there did you know yes why ginny why look it a terribly long story seamus i d appreciate if you didntsay anything about it is he going to be there the whole holiday she nodded i sorry gin he must be a nightmare she smiled it not too horrible did you need something seamus i just wanted to know when we could get together to shop for hannah we re going to visit my aunt for the next three days but anytime after the twelfth works the thirteenth then that a wednesday isntit that should be fine great ginny i really appreciate you doing this hannah ll be thrilled anytime seamus have a pleasant visit with your aunt she said giving him another smile before he vanished ginny walked back into the living room her mother was grinning insanely at her can we go to diagon alley this wednesday she asked of course lovely boy seamus isnthe i sure even my most loyal readers are wonder when something will actually happen i promise not only is there some actual romance on the way there is surprise surprise a plot anyway for those of you who are still reading help is on the way just kidding sort of anyway thank you all so much for being so supportive and being awesome reviewers remember helpful criticism is always appreciated love ya lots i have officially decided to never tell anyone that i ll update quickly again because everytime i do my computer goes all screwy and i can t i swear i ve had this done for like a week but my internet wasntworking dontknow why my dad fixed and i not sure how i donteven think he is sure how so sorry disclaimer grabs draco by arm takes outmagic marker and writes property of solana13 in big bold letters across his arm happy now ginny knocked quietly on his door he knew it was ginny because no one else would be coming to see him he called for her to come in and she casually took a seat on the chair next to his bed where he was reclining i suppose i was wrong about that you really are quite the actor arentyou he grinned i cantbelieve it took you this long to realize it oh mrs weasley i hope i not putting you out you are just sooo kind blah blah blah yes she did seem quite taken with me didntshe he looked immensely smug oh dontlook so pleased mum would adopt fudge if he complimented her cobbler and she hates him ginny added as an afterthought realizing there was no way draco would have known that how very modern of her i never took the weasleys as a very anti establishment kind of family it not her fault the man is a bloody prick took percy already fat head and went and inflated it more dad was so mad has this anything to do with the lack of pajamas of course he couldntbe bothered to participate he only here because charlie and bill told him if he didntcome they d string him up by his ankles mum was so please when she heard thought it meant percy was back to normal again normal for percy at least i actually glad you re here she said and he looked up a bit startled it gives them a chance to agree on something she paused struck by how odd it was to be having a normal conversation with him he too seemed to notice it too and the silence became somewhat awkward so did finnigan have anything useful to say you knew he called of course nosy prick saw me when he flooed draco said he better not say anything or i ll beat him to a bloody pulp he added without thinking as soon as the words left his mouth he regretted it but when he looked up at ginny he could see she was vaguely amused i wouldntmind entirely if you did for all the trouble he caused me the as an afterthought she added that not permission mind you he grinned of course not that would be ever so wrong so what the blond wonder done to get your knickers in a bundle i thought it was like illegal for gryffindors to fight isntthat one of the rules of pink fluffy bunny land she snorted hardly you should see ron and hermione when they ve had a row it terrifying there were many responses he could have said to that but seeing as not one of them seemed likely to endear himself further to her he turned the subject back to safer ground your mum seemed pleased to have him call seamus i mean ginny paused looking near to exasperated she thinks he ll want to date me again she convinced she ruined me as a lady by letting me hang around with the boys so much says i ought to have worn more dresses gone to formal teas and such by the time i was thirteen she d all but decided i was never going to marry should ve seen her when i first met harry i think she was more set on making him her son in law than i was and that saying something he said unpleasantly i never understood what you saw in ole potty he was kind she told him sourly you should try it sometime malfoys arentkind we re charming debonair and handsome not kind could use a bit of work in the modesty department too she snapped but she was smiling again he shrugged no one perfect i just happen to be really close well if you re done gently probing me for information i think i ll head up to bed he opened his mouth to protest oh dontbother she said i have enough brothers that i recognize the signs i must admit you have a gift i was nearly through my rant about percy before i realized what you were doing he looked at her what are you doing here weasley it wasntthe same light tone he d been using it was serious almost cold and oddly reminiscent of how he would have spoken to her weeks ago she looked at him and found she didntknow exactly what to say i dontknow exactly it just seems like you could use a friend right now and what makes you think i d choose you draco sneered then he cursed himself for saying it she laughed you re utterly predictably did you know he couldnttell at all whether she was upset or not she didntseem particularly distressed instead she just regarded him with a curious expression as if she were trying to figure out an especially hard arithmancy problem while he pondered how he was supposed to be responding she stood up and went to the door goodnight malfoy still at a loss for words he sat in silence for a moment and by the time he figured he should at least say goodnight back she was gone draco couldnthelp but smile a bit perhaps she wasntquite as helpless as he thought he leaned his head back and closed his eyes for a moment before sighing and sitting up he went to his trunk and found a bit of parchment and a quill and began a letter to his mother he hadntsent her his weekly update and he wanted to make sure she was alright when he finished scribbling out a quick note he stood to send it before realizing that he hadntbrought his owl with him and he had no idea whether or not the weasley had one potter had one a great bloody white beast but he would drop dead before he had to ask potter for a favor he sat back down on his bed and put the parchment on his bed stand he d have to wait to send it tomorrow turning off the lights he laid down and looked at the ceiling replaying his conversation with ginny she had been right when she had said he was probing her he needed to find out as much as he could about ginny weasley and in the past day all he d found out was that he knew absolutely nothing well not nothing he knew her family was important to her not in the same way that the malfoy family was important to him that was pride of a name not necessarily the people who bore it no instead they were important to her in the way that his mother was important to him and he knew that she was trying as hard to figure him out as he was her for entirely different reasons of course the real question was why she was probably convinced she could befriend him and turn him away from his life of evil he almost laughed at the thought of himself going around just like potty trying to rescue the damsel in distress no if that was what she wanted then she was going to be sorely disappointed the other possibility which in his opinion was much worse was that she was beginning to like him in any other girl this would have been expected and deemed a good thing but not with weasley if she started to actually like him he knew she would be looking for a commitment not just the holiday amusement he had in mind that of course didntmean he would use her it just wasntas much fun girls who wanted commitment always wanted to stop making out to talk about their future that was most unfortunate because he was an aesthetic and the degree of beauty he required in any women who dated him usually came without the thought capacity needed to carry on a conversation although maybe the idea of ginny actually liking him wasntso terrible because the more he thought about it the more unsure he became that he could win her over any other way then if she had feelings for him and thought those feelings were reciprocated he didnttake her for the kind of girl who would be at all please to find out that she was simply being used as a good snog and a distraction from his boredom again he had to choke down his laughter as he pictured how that conversation would go the next morning he woke up at nine o clock he rolled over trying to go back to sleep but of course he couldn t the window was open and the sun was shining straight at him in some cruel mockery of cheerfulness and he really had to find a bathroom stupid sun he mumbled as he crawled out of bed and stumble down the stairs he turned the handle of the bathroom door only to find that the door was locked he knocked oh shove off ron i said i d be out in a minute ginny voice answered this time he pounded on the door hurry up weasley hold on she called he continued to pound on the door until it opened beneath his blows would you stop that ginny asked wrapped in a light blue bathrobe and a pair of long pajama pants her hair was dripping wet and he could only assume she d just stepped out of the shower move he snapped i need to use the bathroom she grinned leaning against the doorframe he noticed that she had a clean pair of jeans and a t shirt shoved under her arm now that not very polite is wittle draco not a morning person no well we ll just have to change that wontwe she said drawing out the torture on his bladder weasley if you haventmoved in three seconds i ll make you move ginny looked amused really and how to you plan to do that three he said and then snatched he clothes from out from under her arm hey give those back malfoy she said straightening up but not moving from in front of the door come and get them he said holding the small bundle out of her reach if you think i ll going to jump for those you re mad she said he shrugged fine malfoy have it your way she said then securing the tie on her robe she rushed forward and tackled him he groaned as he hit the ground and she sitting on his chest triumphantly snatched the clothes back from him ugg weasley you re heavy my bladder she laughed that what you get she said chidingly get off i cantfeel my legs but you re much more awake now arentyou am i interrupting something ginny and draco looked up into the cold face of professor snape if draco hadntknown how angry snape must have been at the moment he would have said the professor looked almost amused ginny was on her feet in an instant blushing bright red and trying to smooth her robe no professor good he said turning his gaze on draco who was still lying on the floor molly said i d find you up here draco smiled even if he did know he was about to die how you been professor he asked snape was about to kill him he knew that much but how had he been found and why wasntginny looking more surprised as to the fact that the potions master was in her house ms weasley would you excuse us for a moment while mr malfoy and i have a chat of course professor she said still blushing and rushed into her room actually professor draco said i was just headed to the just then harry walked by on his way down from ron room and gave them an interested look after a second he seemed to either determine that they werentup to anything menacing or if they were it involved malfoy getting injured which also wasnta bad thing and turned away ron he called started down the second flight of stair bathroom empty finally ron a red blur was throwing the bathroom door closed before draco could utter a word snape looked down at him wryly you were saying draco sighed let just go have a chat then professor so how d you find me in a rather compromising position i afraid snape said dryly draco looked at him incredulously not only was the professor joking he was joking at a time he should have been furious the tips of snape mouth turned up in what was almost a smile i know it may be hard to comprehend mr malfoy but my life doesntrevolve around you you should have known i d be here questioningly draco stared up at the professor from his seat on the bed waiting for the man to explain when he did the almost smile feel from his lips you dontunderstand where you are do you you little fool you ve stepped right into the middle of the order of the phoenix this ginny weasley house is the order headquarters draco asked that at least explained ginny lack of surprise of course not he snapped this is just where everyone spending their christmas holiday i warned them it was a stupid idea to leave headquarters deatheaters will have this house under constant surveillance and then so must we no one listened though even dumbledore sanctioned it the boy scoffed crazy old bugger again snape mouth twitched you have too little faith in your headmaster mr malfoy they sat in silence for a moment this is the last place your father will look at least you ll be safe and out of trouble here that is if you survive ms wealsey brothers snape said after a long pause standing up you re leaving my turn on guard he said shortly already at the door be careful draco you too professor then just as the man was about to leave draco called oh professor how should i reach you i cantuse my owl obviously the older man examined him for a moment i have one you can use i ll send him over he said finally and was out the door leaving draco staring in wonder snape hadntkilled him draco hadnttold him a thing about where he was going and then run off with the weasleys of all people and snape hadntkilled him he hadnteven seemed angry draco would have thought that after the shock of finding him at any place called the burrow had worn off that snape would have been livid with draco for running off without a word of his whereabouts to anyone instead the professor hadntyelled at all and draco realized with a start he hadntacted very surprised either was it possible his mother had told the potion master her son location draco didntthink so he had debated for a long time about telling his mother in the end he had simply because he knew that someone had to know where he was in case something happened but he had never even considered telling snape his mother was one thing as far as lucius was concerned she was a loyal wife snape on the other hand was under quite a bit of suspicion and scrutiny if his father found out that snape not only knew where draco was but had also helped him draco didnteven want to think about his father he couldnteven picture how enraged he must have been when draco simply didntcome home from king cross but then if his mother hadnttold snape which he knew she hadntfor the same reason he hadn t how had he known was it possible that ginny no he clearly remembered that night in the dungeon when he d been so convinced she d been listening to snape and himself discussing his father plan for the holiday but now he wasntso sure that she had if she did she was a much better liar then he gave he credit for besides he could hardly see the girl just marching down to snape office to tell the man that she had been eavesdropping which would have of course had to of been what she had done if she had told him draco was staying with her and even then the necklace wouldnthave allowed her to do anything of the sort he winced thinking about the necklace he hadntallowed his mind to wander there for several weeks now he hadntused it since that night draco forced an image of ginny unwrapping her scarf to reveal a hand shaped bruise around her neck where no bruise could possibly be out of his head honestly draco didntwant to use it again he was afraid of what he might find he fingered the golden ring the necklace counterpart that he d taken to keeping in his pocket at all times picturing her again there was a small knock on the door yeah he called the door opened very slightly and ginny poked her head in looking almost like a groundhog afraid of its shadow when she saw that snape had left she pushed the door the rest of the way open i thought i saw him leaving coming downstairs she d exchanged her bathrobe for the clothes he d taken from her earlier depends what d you have planned weasley he asked oh i dontknow maybe just a friendly game of quidditch she said smiling are you mad it s like ten degrees out there exactly malfoy that half the fun thanks so much to my reviewers i love you all so much you rock like seriously anyway swim team started up again so dontexpect an update too soon see i didntbreak my promise but i really excited because the climax oh my gosh a climax as in what concludes a plot there a plot i missed it is coming up soon so i really want to get the next few chappies out anyway go and hit the pretty little review button and make me happy mad love ugg i actually wanted to get all the way to the trips to diagon alley in this chapter but i ve had no time at all so you ll have to wait until next chapter sorry oh and just a quick note in the last chapter i said 10 degrees that was in fahrenheit not celcius yup i live in the states not metric standard for us anyway 10 degrees f figures out to about negitive 12 degrees c just thought i d clarify that disclaimer harry potter is the property of j k rowling no money is being made from this fanfiction weasley i dontknow how you talked me into this but if it didntinvolve a lot of chocolate sauce and some sort of exotic dance i must have been out of my mind he said as he pulled up into position opposite her they were well above the other players so he didnthave to worry about one of her brothers hearing she smiled sweetly of course it did it took crabbe a lot of convincing he said you werenthis type but he ll be here in an hour with the chocolate and strawberries he gagged oh that just not fair i ll never be able to watch the snitch for all my throwing up she shrugged just thought i d spare you the embarrassment of being beaten by a weasley awfully confident arentwe well she said with a grin when you re perfect it is awfully hard to stay modest about it finally someone understands he answered smiling back was it just the cold making her cheeks so pink or was she blushing he decided for his ego sake he decided she was blushing are you two ready up there someone redheaded called ginny looked down at whichever of her brothers had spoken and gave him a thumbs up sign her indication that they were indeed ready with a shrill whistle the boy charlie he was pretty sure released the snitch and the bludger and the game began ginny took off immediately circling what passed for the pitch lazily searching for a golden glint draco taking a more leisurely approach surveyed from his spot well above the rest of the action they d made him a seeker simply because he refused to play any other position the twins idea to warp the game by switching around positions had lead to a rather laughable discussion of who should play on what team and what part they would play harry it was immediately decided could not be allowed to be a seeker instead they stuck him in front of one of the goals three old tires hanging from a tree on either end of the field fred and george also quite reluctantly gave away their bats and were forced to separate to make the teams more even their only consolation being that as chasers they would be able to try and beam each other with the quaffle ron and charlie were made beaters charlie quite purposefully in draco opinion made sure not only that ron stayed a safe distance away from draco before the game but also that they were on the same team so that ron would have no excuse to accidentally knock him off his broom bill that was the name of the one with the earring right was the other keeper the position they had tried to talk draco into playing he had refused outright because while he was a superb seeker he was somewhat lacking when it came to catching and throwing a fact that he felt no need to advertise ginny was the only one who got put in a familiar position a fact that she was only mildly put out by he could tell as he watched her now that she was at least a fair seeker though she continued almost sluggishly drifting above the pitch he could see that she was actually keeping a sharp eye on everything around her she was a good flier too the way she sat surely on the broom and rose and fell casually with the air currents demonstrated a level of familiarity that came only with practice and skill she was however nowhere near as good as him and he intended to prove it the only problem with was that it was snowing making it impossible to see the snitch ginny seemed to be having the same problem she would dive down several feet in search of the ball only to pull quickly out of her descent with a baffled look on her face she was still having better luck than him however he hadntcaught sight of the snitch at all finally he resigned himself to following after her flying lazy circles around her hoping that she would be able to pick it out ginny made absolutely no response to him except to occasionally look up from her search and smile several times on purpose he suspected she would plunge down in pursuit of something only to pull up when he followed he inevitably found himself in ron path heads up malfoy fred jeered on one such occasion wouldntwant any accidents would we draco had responded with a rude hand gesture which only made the twins taunt more ginny flew right in front of him a mocking grin on her face he returned her smile before breaking into a dive of his own which she startled imitated he pulled up and she followed just in time to impact with the quaffle that george had thrown the boys all paused to watch as she shook herself when they were assured she was unharmed harry retrieved the fallen quaffle and they resumed play once she was level with him she smiled this one a smile of true amusement now that wasntvery nice she admonished playfully i could have been seriously injured then where would you have been an unmarked grave somewhere i guessing he called i just hope you realize what you ve done she said somewhat more seriously i a horror when i want to win which differs from you normally how she smiled again and pushed off to circle the pitch again true to her word ginny made things very difficult for him after that there were no more feigned dives or smiles and he took that as a sign to mean that the real game had begun her movements were no longer languid but instead sharp and meaningful taking her example he followed circling the pitch watching for any hint of the snitch the events below had little meaning it was something completely detached from where he was it was no longer simply a competition between his team and hers instead he it had become a contest exclusively between the two of them the ultimate outcome irrelevant hey someone from below called startling ginny she paused and looked down then automatically checked to make sure that draco too had stopped his search one she was assured he had also paused she looked back down at the redhead addressing her are you two ready to head in we re freezing our bums off draco and ginny locked eyes for a moment she quirked an eyebrow and smirked daring him to give up give up he asked not breaking eye contact with her never have it your way charlie called up laughingly just dontexpect us to save any hot chocolate for you keep you re knickers on we ll be finished soon ginny called before taking off again in search of her golden adversary hey mione ron said successfully shoving a whole pastry in his mouth as he plopped down on the couch once he had swallowed he leaned over to kiss the girl dontyou dare ron weasley she said batting him away with her book you re all gross and sweaty how can i be sweaty i was outside in the snow snow or no snow you smell like a boys locker room ron frowned at her before looking at her book isntthat the book i got you for your birthday she nodded it was a massive volume entitled advanced arithmancy as it relates to the basic functions of time travel fine then he said and snatched it out of her hands no kiss no book ron honestly dontbe ridiculous give me she made another attempt to snatch the book back from him and he planted a lopsided kiss on her lips oh that enough ron your nose is freezing harry smiled as his best friends antics get a room you two hermione blushed you know i had that exact idea myself ronald hermione snapped still bright red honestly boys they sat in comfortable silence for a moment before hermione said you were out there for ages i d thought you d all frozen to death nope harry answered though malfoy seems dead set on it hermione gave him a questioning look and he nodded towards the window from which the field they had been using as a pitch only moments before was barely visible the little twit still out there with ginny ron said hermione looked alarmed why dunno the two of them were battling it out like crazy had me half convince it was a reenactment of the goblin wars would ve said it was some type of struggle for male dominance or something except that doesntreally apply to ginny harry answered oh harry you know that we didntuse brooms in the goblin wars charms she trailed off at the expressions on the two boys faces malfoy refused to come in until he d caught the little bugger ron said guess he really wanted to beat her or impress her hermione said frowning what both boys asked it just i saw him looking at her earlier and it didntseem like he had any sort of painful revenge plan in mind are you saying that gin and malfoy are involved ron asked sounding shocked and disgusted well not necessarily just that maybe he wishes they were harry and ron burst out laughing really hermione the day a malfoy pines over a weasley i ll eat my broom he was probably just picturing something really nasty like beating her over the head with a candle stick ron said i dontthink so ron looked just a little less sure of himself well if he does try anything i ll kill him now i didntmean to get you to go and bash his head open i was probably just imagining things she said biting her lip yeah ron i sure that it harry said but still all three were quite for a moment as they watched the two figures in the air through the window just then there was a streak of green diving straight toward the ground their eyes followed it downward until it was just meters off the ground and dropped out of view ginny heard the dive rather than saw it she felt the rush of moving air behind her and the sound of wind and responded long before she even thought about what it was draco in his quidditch robes and wrapped in a huge warm cloak dropped through the air in front of her with reckless speed his lunge resembled a freefall he spiraled with the currents looking for all the world like a leaf being carried down to the ground with the wind she paused just long enough to assure herself that he really wasnt falling but then after only a second she saw it the golden snitch glistening just inches away from his outstretched hand she leaned down and urged her broom straight down allowing gravity to assist her but even as she approached him she knew that he would catch it before she even came close just as she finished that thought his hand closed around the small ball and he pulled up just in time to keep himself from colliding with the ground she slowed her descent and waited until she was even with him before pulling out he was smirking as he held the snitch up for her to see i told you i always win get stuffed she said glaring really weasley i dontblame you he said not many people even last that long against me harry seems to do a bang up job of it draco expression soured yeah well we cantall be like potty now can we suddenly she grinned you re jealous of pot head why would i possibly be jealous of him i ve got money brains women and and i m blond but you ve never beaten him have you he was fuming silently and you ve never had a pillow fight or a homemade christmas gift she said looking at him with keen interest i never understood what was so great about those things who wants to get hit in the face with a pillow ginny examined him for a moment snowball fights no and personally just then in one stupendous bound ginny leapt from her broom on to his knocking them both to the snow covered ground ahh he groaned pathetically weasley what was that for she didntrespond instead she stood up and gathered as much snow in her arms as she could and dumped it on him he sat up glaring what the bloody it called a snowball fight and i hate to tell you but you re losing she dashed out of his reach gathered up another pile of snow and began packing it into a tight ball are you crazy weasley i not having a sno he broke off to wipe the snow from his face ginny was grinning brandishing another snowball menacingly okay that it this is ridiculous i not going inside you can stay out here acting like a two year old but i ve had enough thanks he stood brushed himself off and stomped past her ginny sighed for a moment she forgot she who she had been talking to she d been hanging out with a normal guy and then bang he was back to being draco i m way too good to even look in your general direction malfoy she growled and went over to the two abandoned brooms she bent down hand closing on the handle of her comet 166 and thawmp oaah she shrieked turning to face her assailant draco was standing behind her grinning like a madman hey she cried outraged wiping snow from her cold and now rather wet backside when are you ever going to learn weasley malfoys dontlose my bum cold she said reproachfully i just aimed for the biggest target he said innocently if you d been facing me it would have been your she glared mouth i just had to settle for second best that it you re dead something strange was going on molly weasley couldntquite figure out what but she hadntraised six sons without being able to perceive when something was wrong she d gone to visit arthur at the office that morning with some cake he deserved at least something a little special what with the bloody ministry making him work through most of the holidays and she was quite sure she d heard someone following her she had gone straight to kingsley shaklebolt desk and chatted politely for a few minutes and offered him a bit of cake seeming to realize something was wrong which he almost always did clever man kingsley he offered to show her up to arthur office but by the time she d been safely escorted to her husband without she or kingsley hearing anything at all suspicious she was feeling rather foolish molly everything alright love he had asked when she arrived i thought i heard someone following me nerves i sure everything been so stressful lately he had become very wary as he always did when she was worried and made her promise to apparate straight home that was why she loved him so much even if he did collect plugs and had a tendency to charm things particularly muggle things that werentmeant to be charmed he was the single kindest and most caring person she had ever known she had kept her promise apparating home right in front of him not only to appease him but also because she was having a horrid time not being there to watch over the children true tonks and sirius and lupin were there but the former two were just as likely to get in trouble as any of her children and she wasntsure if lupin could handle all of them there were probably at least a half dozen other order members there at any given moment but still there was no such thing as too careful she felt even more foolish when she arrived home and everyone was safe and sound the kids were out playing a game of quidditch hermione was reading in the living room the two remaining marauders were with tonks and moody discussing safety precautions reassured she had settled down with a good book she hardly ever got to read when the kids were around but soon found that with everyone outside the house was far too quite for her liking besides the cupboard was looking rather bare so she gather up her cloak and shopping list and went out for supplies the second indication that something was wrong was the fact that moody insisted upon coming with her aww right then molly he d said gruffly grabbing his own cloak i ll just be coming along with you then she had tried to explain that she really didntneed a guard which of course seeing as it was moody got her nowhere she then explicated that she would feel much better if he stayed at home protecting the children but he remained adamant near the whole bloody order here if voldemort tries anything the kids ll be fine so finally she d resigned and let him come along but the whole time he had periodically rolled his magical eye back in his head and swiveled it around behind them as if he was keeping watch for something it was quite unnerving as soon as they d arrived home moody had shuffled back to his meeting with lupin she put away the groceries and went to lie down she had learned long ago from the twins that when something was up the best way to find out what was to simply wait it out she could do that she had always been an extremely patient person with seven kids she had to be this was always exactly how he d pictured gryffindors spending all their free time frolicking in the snow except he couldntremember at that vary moment what about it had seemed so unappealing ginny and he had been tossing snowballs at each other for nearly twenty minutes she had built up a tiny wall behind which she could safely hide while she bombarded him he likewise had found a place behind a tree where even her best aimed attacks couldntreach him he knew however that his shelter was only temporary large spots of brown grass surrounded him where he d used up all the snow on the ground around him ginny seemed to be having the exact same difficulty because at that exact moment he saw her roll out from behind her shelter like any good soldier at war she was down on her knees pulling herself with her elbows she was headed towards a hedge behind which not only would she be safe but there would be a fresh supply of ammunition feeling greatly annoyed at the prospect of being pelted by any more of her rather vindictive attacks he jumped from behind his tree and charged seeing him she jumped to her feet running for the shelter of the bushes but he was too quick for her he tackled her knocking her clear into the snow she squealed and he smirked down at her ha i win he said triumphantly he found he was panting and out of breath he couldntremember why exactly he should be she looked up at him and he smiled noticing delicate snowflakes lacing her eyelashes her hair spilled around her like a red bloom fallen on the snow that what you think she was smiling grinning raucously she then rolled over so she was pinning him onto the snowy ground it was the second time in as many days that he had found ginny weasley sitting on his chest the only problem with that it was getting him nothing well he could fix that easily enough so looks like malfoys dontalways win no doesntit she asked who says i didn t he said moving his face just a little closer to hers she blushed suddenly looking for the first time as though she realized what she was doing she was sitting on draco malfoy she was sitting on draco malfoy ginny jumped to her feet right then i d better go see if the boys left us any hot chocolate she said and then hurried off at a near run draco sighed every time he got close something got in the way he sighed standing up if he were anyone else he would have just resigned himself to the fact that he was just going to have to be bored this holiday but he was a malfoy and as he d reminded her enough times malfoys didntlose or give up at least not when it was something they really wanted or couldntget someone else to do for them he made the quick walk back to the house house being a word used quite generously in his opinion he stomped his snow covered shoes before entering what do you mean ron voice greeted him from the next room over he could always tell when it was ron talking he was just so bloody whiney all the time draco froze immediately and listened he didntknow what the trio was discussing but he had learned it was never wise to pass up a good opportunity to eavesdrop especially with those three they were just so careless about what they said now dontgo biting my head off ronald you knew i cantbelieve seamus was dating my baby sister bloody wanker never even had the balls to tell a bloke about it ron hermione admonished shrilly draco smirked he couldntsee her but he was fairly sure she was blushing stop being crude besides they never officially went out still he sholda at least told me about it because he knew you d take it so well harry deadpanned aww shut up harry this is serious i just find out that not only did seamus date my sister he broke her heart i ll kill him when i see him oh quit being so dramatic i didntsay he broke her heart i just said she was a little upset about it besides i could be completely wrong maybe she was just tired merlin hold on a minute why she still going to diagon alley with him he doesntthink he ll get her back does he well i rather hope not considering she just going to help him pick out a christmas present for hannah hannah ron cried hannah abbot he wants her to pick out a present for his girlfriend draco could understand ron outrage every guy in the world except apparently seamus knew that you didntask your ex to help you shop for your current fling if you wanted to keep all of your body parts he heard even harry wince harry who at least according to draco knew less about wooing women then a big furry spider draco felt himself go cold for a reason he couldntquite place it probably had to do with all the snow that had somehow made it down his shirt outside yes i admit it does seem a bit inconsiderate of him but ginny could have said no ginny doesntsay no to anyone hermione you know that harry said except of course me draco couldnthelp but think somewhat bitterly just dontgo and make ginny out to be the damsel in distress she wouldnttake very well with that ron snorted i serious ron promise me you wontdo anything stupid you know me mione that is exactly why i worried okay hope i didntconfuse you all too much with the back and forthness which i just made a word so there anyway thanks all for reading i ll try and have another chapter out soon but swim season makes things crazy school gets out in exactly a month for us and i promise i ll update

you all so much i started this story thinking i d be happy if i broke twenty so thanks again disclaimer i poor dontsue me ginny sat on her bed with her knees pulled tight against her chest trying to figure out exactly what had just happened almost woodenly she d changed from her wet clothes into her warm flannel pajama pants and a t shirt she couldntcount the times she d been in that exact same position with boys harry colin dean not to mention all of her brothers but they really didntcount but never had she felt the rust of pure exhilaration she d felt looking down at draco in that one moment there was nothing quite like draco when he smiled she decided the picture of him poking his head out from behind his tree snowball in hand was so far detached from the likeness of his angelic face curled into a cruel sneer that it was almost impossible to associate the two her mind had effectively split in two one part holding images of draco as she knew him the other much smaller part squirreling away the brief glimpses of draco as she was coming to know him one how he looked when he talked to blaise calm relaxed occasionally grinning another the contentment she d seen on his face when she d caught him sleeping also the pride and concern she could see in his eyes when he spoke about his mother and now a new one draco laughing and playing in the snow with the exuberance of a child she couldntthink of a time even when he was with blaise that she had seen him look so untroubled she wondered sadly if it was perhaps the first time he had been with a frustrated sigh she stood and crossed the room stopping in front of her mirror you re far too nice for your own good ginny weasley she scolded herself she d been saying that same thing for years and nothing seemed to have changed self criticism was obviously not her forte she picked dejectedly at a misplaced strand of hair she d always had a soft spot for it unfortunately it gave her away far too easily redheads blushed more than anyone else in the mirror she could see her cheeks were still flushed she stared at her reflection for several moments until it blurred and faded away and she was left sitting in quiet contemplation a quiet tapping brought her back from her pondering her eyes snapping back into focus for a moment she had to search for the source of the noise and finally identified it as coming from the window she pushed aside her curtains and found herself facing a large black owl she opened the window and the bird jumped over the jam and looked up at her from where it now sat on her window seal she recognized it immediately the owl from that night in the owlery snape she hesitated a second unsure of what to do but finally she smiled down at the thing she hadntsaid anything to anyone about snape yet and she didntplan to if there was one thing she could gather about her potions master was that he cared about malfoy and she trusted him mostly she stuck out her arm for the bird to step on you ll be wanting the next window up then the large eyes scrutinized her for a long moment and ginny was quite sure snape was trying to figure out if she recognized it was him or not you must be looking for draco you re far too pretty to be from anyone we know she said which was true snape made for a lovely owl i ll go tell him to unlock his window the bird finally turned away from her and hopped back out of the window she quickly turned and ran up the stairs stopping when she reached his door after a short pause she knocked on his door he answered and she thought for a second she saw surprise register in his eyes he smirked cantbe without me even ten minutes can you weasley remind me to never do you a favor again she said remembering at that moment that her cheeks had still been red several minutes ago and wondering if they still were unlock you re window you ve made a poor owl wait outside in the cold for you he leaving the door unlocked the window and immediately the owl entered in a flurry of wings and feathers making draco duck to get out of its way the raptor landed easily on the boy trunk the blonde reached out and took a letter from the birds foot that ginny was quite sure had not been there a second ago it was probably enchanted to appear only to draco he unrolled it and began to read ginny stood awkwardly at the door that he had left ajar she didntknow if she was supposed to leave or just stay there he hadntindicated that she should go but then again he wasntexactly throwing the door open for her you can come in you know he said without looking up startling ginny excuse me i said you could come in this time he looked up at her over the parchment he was reading he was obviously amused by her unease which was annoying to no end with a huff she entered the room and glared at him but he had returned to his reading after only another second he tossed the letter aside she didntfeel any less awkward standing there in the middle of his room than she had felt standing outside it she waited silently while he went to his trunk the bird moving aside obligingly and fished out another length of parchment tying it to the birds outstretched leg with its load secure the owl flew silently back out into the cold afternoon she touched her cheek quite sure that by now it had to be back to its normal color lovely owl draco made a noise which could have either been an agreement or a sneeze i donthave one she said shifting from foot to foot always wanted one actually i though for sure mum would get me one for making prefect but she sent me a new dress robe instead didnthave the heart to tell her it was absolutely dreadful she was prattling on but she couldntseem to stop herself it was pink and kind of lacy kind of like ron dress robes actually do you remember those he was mortified she bit down on the inside of her cheek not only had she now thoroughly embarrassed herself she had brought up a memory so horrifying for ron that it was likely he d kill her if he found out draco was facing her now and didntseem like he was going to say or do anything to assuage her discomfort she couldntsee it but she knew that he was immensely enjoying it she was about to make up some reason why she would have to leave when he very casually asked how about a game of wizard chess then she shrugged but it didntmatter because he was already at his truck digging through his belongings he took a seat on the bed and began setting up the board without looking at her when he was done he glanced up at her expectantly as though he couldntfigure out why she hadntsat down yet she sat on a broom she flew recklessly it was something she d learned from harry but when she played chess she sat examined her pieces calculated each move in her head tried to guess where her opponent would move and finally after much deliberation would make her move draco on the other hand seemed to make moves at random examining the board only a second before moving his piece she lost horribly ginny glared at him i really dontlike you sometimes draco grinned back at her obviously pleased with himself all part of my charm love he set the board up without asking whether she wanted to play again she doubted he d even thought about it it was comfortable quiet other than ginny occasional outbreaks when he made a particularly frustrating move but nice after two more games she stood and stretched her legs i canttake anymore of this if i wanted to get beaten this badly i would have played ron weaselbee he asked the expression on his face something akin to what it would have been if she had told him that mcgonagall had suddenly given up teaching to become an exotic dancer one of almost equal disgust and surprise she cocked an eyebrow in a superior manner ron she said putting emphasis on his name happens to be a fantastic chess player she was suddenly very proud of her brother she made a mental note to get him something especially nice for christmas after a moment draco shrugged well statistically he had to be good at something she frowned stop being so horrible i fabulous he the one that makes small children cry she snorted you re loosing you edge malfoy that was only vaguely insulting and not very clever yeah well it an off day get back to me tomorrow she frowned at him again i hungry she said suddenly and walked out he couldnttell whether she was being abrupt because she was angry or not he doubted it she hadntseemed upset at least not anymore than her everyday frustration with him after a second her bright red head appeared in the doorway arentyou coming being alone with a room full of weasleys was not high up on the list of things draco had ever wanted to do in fact it landed somewhere between eating a live bug and poking an annoyed hippogriff it even beat out going a day without his hair gel so far they had been fairly civil which he was now convinced was all a clever ruse to lure him into a false sense of security ginny her mother and hermione had spent almost half an hour in the kitchen cooking lunch ginny hadntlooked very pleased about she wasn t she informed him exactly the domestic type a fact that the loud shrill shrieking alarm had confirmed hermione came out of the kitchen waving the smoke away with a cookie sheet to inform them everything was all right as for the men in the house they sat around in the living room staring at each other or more accurately glaring charlie seemed rather exasperated with all of them and struck up a game of exploding slaps with william who was too young and too detached to have much stake in the rivalry but the rest of them sat glaring the coffee table a clear line of demarcation draco on one side the weasleys on the other he looked over at harry loyally glaring with the rest of them and noticed he looked rather faint all right there potter you re looking a bit peaky ron glared what next malfoy gonna insult his mum too but harry didntanswer draco said dontbe stupid weasley look at him i fine harry said but he wasntglaring anymore and his hand had gone to his forehead maybe we should go upstairs ron said helping harry to his feet and then up the stairs charlie stopped playing with william hey will why dontyou go on in the kitchen and see if the girls need any help william frowned i dontwant to i hate cooking he said because to a ten year old boy being forced to cook with a bunch of girls was the equivalent of dying a long painful death well then charlie said patiently you can put out ginny fires with feigned reluctance the boy got up and ran to the kitchen even if cooking was feminine playing with fire was enough to outweigh it draco didntlike the sound of this it seemed that the boys had moved forward on the couch out of seemingly nowhere the speccy one appeared or maybe he had been there the whole time draco had a hard time noticing that one even charlie the only one draco trusted not to kill him in his sleep looked solemn see malfoy there was something we wanted to talk to you about we just haventhad the right opportunity until now because we didntreally want harry or ron actually mostly just ron really here we wanted to know what i mean to say is charlie seemed to falter too many words tumbling off his tongue at once forming an unintelligible burble he was blushing brilliantly and the rest of the weasley brothers had moved even further towards him starting at draco with positively predatory gazes are you shagging ginny fred or possibly george asked draco nearly choked they couldnthave found a more tactless way to put that if they had tried or maybe that was the point i i mean what you heard me the other twin said draco paused to wonder at this rather loose use of pronouns before even trying to formulate a response i don t i dontknow what you re talking about shove it malfoy you just show up out of nowhere asking to spend the holiday with her who up until like a week ago you couldntstand and you expect us not to be a little suspicious no draco answered shaking himself from his stupor no do you think we re complete idi he stood up fred i think he meant no to the first question charlie said oh fred said sitting back down you and ginny you re not then george asked no he said he was desperately groping his mind for a clever response but he couldntthink of any err no you draco was feeling very unpopular at the moment charlie was smiling encouragingly at him but the others had closed in on him until he was completely cornered i d i d never lower myself to that level he managed the twins emitted two identical scoffs percy sniffed his disappointment charlie looked rather crestfallen and bill glowered an expression that combined with his fang earring was rather intimidating donteven try that malfoy dontthink we haventseen you looking at her even if ron and harry are too blind to see fred said hermione saw it though spot on that girl never would have noticed it myself if she hadntsaid something george added draco glared wondering if the girl had nothing better to talk about than him actually he rather understood her predicament there was nothing better to talk about other than him if you really think i d do that then you have then mental capacity of a squid he cursed himself he sounded like a ten year old do that merlin why couldnthe even say the word sex that was ron department not him at least it helped out his story not that it was a story he really wasntwith ginny or maybe because he was being such a royal wanker about the whole thing they would just assume he was lying draco was quite sure he didntwant to be around if the weasley brothers decided he was lying merlin he thought again he was babbling and he wasnteven talking out loud you know i ve been called a lot of things especially when it comes to ginny but i pretty sure squid is a new one bill said thoughtfully the point is malfoy you dontwant us angry at you we can be like an angry cat when we re angry charlie said threats were not his area of expertise angry cats fred scoffed c mon charlie cantyou do better than that we re more like an angry lion george said like two angry lions fred agreed two really hungry really mean angry lions hungry lions george asked thoughtfully really i dontthink that quite impressive enough you were the one who said lions in the first place bill said only because he said angry cats now what self respecting man would be afraid of a cat well charlie said defensively maybe if the cat had rabies ahh see charlie you have to clarify these things an angry cat with rabies george said trying it out nope still not quite terrifying enough mcgonagall bill said mcgonagall is a cat and she bloody well scary enough thanks bill said charlie looking pleased dragons fred said suddenly what the three other boys asked in union dragons are scary fred pointed out charlie stiffened i kind of resent that actually that after all these years you still fit dragons into that stereotype i ve told you they re simply misunderstood didntyou read those pamphlets i brought back from romania right charlie because that really sounds like something we d do fred said i didnteven do school work when i was in school george agreed ahem draco said maybe we should get back to the matter at hand i ll just pretend you came up with some stunningly clever threat and that i properly intimidated how does that sound you know malfoy percy said suddenly breaking his silence i dontappreciate that cheeky tone of yours draco grinned i ve always been told i had very lovely cheeks actually but mostly by females however if that how you get your jollies far be it from me to stop you from looking percy flushed horribly and straightened his glasses you re not funny really draco asked because i thought it was extremely funny i mean the delivery might need a bit of work but i thought it was pretty good for improvising this is ridiculous percy snapped he looked for his brothers for help but they all were hiding behinds their hands trying not to snicker percy screamed in frustration i didntcome here to take this abuse from a bunch of of ruffians mr malfoy stay away from ginny she the only one in this house with the potential to be redeemed although after spending all that time with these hooligans you hear that gred we re hooligans i did indeed forge and ruffians too percy stomped his foot i ve said my piece i hope you take my advice mr malfoy i wouldntusually abuse my power at the ministry but i might make an exception if you harm my little sister i could make things very difficult for you indeed he said in a huff and stormed of to his room yeah george said darkly it would be kind of hard to get around with a speccy little git running around behind you threatening you with his stapler good thing percy hates you fred said or there d be nothing good about you at all george finished i wouldntsay nothing i ve been told i have lovely eyes stow it malfoy we still dontlike you bill said well that good or otherwise i d have to spend a great deal of time examining my life choices and trying to figure out what i ve done wrong malfoy if you re not here for ginny then why draco was suddenly on edge i canttell you and it none of your business we dontcare if you re here because you and snape are secretly lovers and have just had a bit of a spat draco blanched we just need to know that ginny not in any harm bill said ginny always in danger we all are draco said especially potty and his little friends that not what i meant look you re sister fine with all of you swarming around her i dontknow how she couldntbe just then ginny burst into the room grinning and covered in flour i finally burned enough stuff she let me out she stared at them all it got awfully quiet all of the sudden were you all talking about me merlin beard weasley and you call me vain draco drawled she smiled look what ever vague threats they ve come up with just ignore it i ve hidden all the sharp objects i so comforted he said with a snort i have to go change she said trying to wipe some of the flour from her clothes cooking hard after she had been gone a second hermione appeared is she gone the girl asked with a quick inspection of the room merlin that girl is terrifying with a spatula mrs weasley says everything ready if you boys want to go ahead and eat thanks bill said you might want to go in and check on harry and ron harry was looking a little green hermione stared at them in wonder she had mentioned food and not a single one of the weasley boys had jumped up and ran in the direction of the kitchen she stared at them skeptically what are you all planning should i be concerned why hermione fred said aghast why would you ever say such a thing have we ever given you reason to mistrust us she stared back and forth between the couch full of redheaded boys and draco who was coolly examining his nails well come on then boys hermione giving us that look like she about to deduct house points i think we were just about finished here anyway bill said and stood reluctantly the other weasleys stood and walked off to the dining room with one last baffled look hermione went upstairs presumably to check on potter draco sighed closed his eyes and allowed himself to sink back into the chair malfoy charlie said he had reappeared at the door draco didntmove malfoy you d tell me if ginny was in any kind of trouble wouldntyou ginny a big girl he said draco eyes were still closed and he could hear charlie shuffle his feet he paused waiting to hear the sound of footsteps but they didntcome keep an eye on her malfoy charlie said finally and returned to the kitchen a moment later ginny descended the stairs awake malfoy he lazily opened one eye to look at her dontsuppose you d just bring my food in here would you she laughed i draco malfoy am not a house elf yes forgive me i sometimes forget the resemblance is uncanny just then the trio came down the stairs ron arm around harry shoulder and hermione fluttering about behind the two boys like a mother hen ron ginny noticed was glaring with particular ferocity the small group disappeared into the dining room and draco turned and smirked at her and she could tell he was gloating fine then but dontget used to it she said and followed the rest of her family into the kitchen reemerging a moment later with two plates of food she handed him one and took a seat on the floor leaning back comfortably against the sofa he for the first time righted himself in the chair what no drink he asked grinning she stuck her tongue out at him he picked cautiously at the food for a moment before taking a hesitant bite she smiled dontworry mum made that bit completely safe to eat from the dining room mrs weasley voice sounded oh good you re father home and a second later the front door opened and mr weasley came in dropping his cloak on the rack how was work dad ginny asked oh the same people just dontunderstand how serious a crime it is to go messing about with the poor muggles fifteen cases of nose biting tea cups that just happened to end up in muggle shops mr weasley said crossing the room and kissing his daughter on the forehead dinner time already he asked noticing the plates why are you two out here your mum didntkick you out again did she ginny smiled no just a bit quieter out here oh he said more company tonight then just the usual crowd she answered and kingsley here too his turn on guard her father nodded the kitchen door opened and william was peeking out hiya uncle arthur he said grinning a nearly toothless grin which his uncle happily returned mr weasley gave his daughter a wink before following his nephew ginny smiled i really glad they came my family i mean i know mum and dad have missed having the house full of kids at least they ll always have the weasel to take care of them merlin knows he ll never find himself a girl and move out and you wonder why he doesntlike you oh no i know exactly why he doesntlike me i ve worked very hard at insuring that very fact and will an absolute doll she said apparently deciding to ignore him it been really good for sirius too sirius draco said trying to place the name he d only heard of one other sirius and that was sirius black and she certainly wasnttalking about him the big dark kind of scruffy man who hangs around with lupin yes he did look rather familiar ginny snorted he should he your cousin not that he d admit to it he was blasted of the black family tree ages ago draco choked on his roast beef black that sirius black the murderer ginny looked startled i thought you would have figured it out by now then as an afterthought she added and he didntmurder them i would have thought you would have known that too it was the death eaters who set him up and i know exactly what the death eaters are planning then he said coldly and his eyes were filled with a quiet kind of rage that she didntquite understand but she did know she had said something horribly wrong malfoy i didntmean it like that she said yes you did but dontworry if i was you i d hate me too then he paused no actually i d be positively taken with myself but that just me ginny smiled no really draco i didntmean it i sorry i just assumed your father would have said something he didn t draco answered so harshly that she was again taken aback they sat in a long silence then hesitantly she reached forward and put her hand on his lightly at first as if afraid he would pull back then more assured he was much higher than her he still seated on the chair and her on the floor and the position looked unnatural he looked at his hand with an emotion she couldntplace there was some amusement in it but also something almost like sadness and at the same time there was a detached quality as though he wasntlooking at his hand at all i said i didntwant your pity weasley good because i not giving it too you she smiled i was asking your forgiveness suddenly his eyes focused and he leaned down towards her with a raucous grin really and what would you do for it her breath caught and she found herself staring into his gray eyes knowing that she should say something but also incapable of saying anything and his eyes were laughing and she hated that hated the fact that he once again had the upper hand but she couldntmove i dontcare what you say the gargoyles are rubbish someone said as the door that adjoined the living room to the dinning room swung open within a second ginny had retracted her hand and draco barely managed to keep himself from sprouting several loud and extremely rude words once again he d had the perfect opportunity and it had been ruined charlie and bill were walking amicably towards the stairs but their last match was bloody brilliant charlie insisted anyone who chooses to be called after a great ugly hunk of stone is an unbelievably prat bill said and then he noticed ginny and draco gin mind if i tag along with you to diagon alley tomorrow i promise i wontsay anything embarrassing to your boyfriend seamus is not my boyfriend she said and you can come along on the condition you dontcall him that night gin charlie called and then the two boys headed upstairs well ginny said standing up i d better go do some homework homework draco asked you ve still got ages to finish it i just like to get things done early guess i ve been hanging out a bit too much with hermione then she scurried off towards the stairs trying to escape as quickly as possible and she would never really be able to say what had compelled her to but she stopped you re coming tomorrow right to diagon alley i hadntthought about it he said with a shrug you should i ll have to help seamus in the morning and i know you ll hate that but we could meet up later i guess he said oh okay then she turned and began her ascension up the stairs she had just reached the foot of the second landing when she heard him call goodnight weasley and she smiled to herself draco downstairs was still sulking over his lost opportunity every single bloody time he got close something got in his way he d fix that somehow he had too it was like some kind of cosmic joke and as far as he was concerned it wasntfunny this was turning from amusement into obsession last night he d dreamt about her she d been in his bedroom the one back in the slytherin dorms just sitting on his bed staring up at him and just as he moved in to kiss her he d woken up he d had conquests like this before girls he d been determined to date but it had never been this hard before they d always simply given into his charm and he d never been so distracted with it before he found himself picturing what it would be like to kiss her he could almost smell the vanilla on her taste her lips on his he could still feel the warmth of her hand where it had been on his and he pictured her small warm hands on his neck in his hair he frowned this was getting ridiculous he sounded like some lovesick nancy and he didnteven like the girl he couldntquite categorize the way he felt about her he would have called it lust but he d experienced lust and he knew that that wasntwhat he was feeling now intoxication maybe whatever it was he wasntentirely sure he liked it in fact he was quite sure he didn t draco sighed and closed his eyes he wasntsure what had made him recall it but at that moment he remembered ron words from earlier that day not only did seamus date my sister he broke her heart he stood and made his way up the stairs to his room maybe he decided he d have a little talk with seamus ugg i really meant to get all the way through the diagon alley scenes in this chapter yes i know i said that last time too but like i said i a horrible liar i thinking about going to someone about it but it was just so long anyway i swear it in the next chapter in fact that how the next chapter starts out and a huge part of the plot comes up just so you dontgive up in actually thinking that there is one again thanks so much for your reviewing it what makes me keep writing now go hit the pretty little button that says review so i know you all haventforgotten about me wow a reasonably quick update amazing isntit anyway this chapter is incredibly long 34 pages a new record for me and bit of it were really hard to write so constructive criticism and comments are especially encouraged for this chapter please oh and just a quick note about the timeline of this story which is kind of odd the order of the phoenix is there so obviously at least the first part of the fifth book took place but a certain charecter is still alive i trying to avoid spoilers but really if you haventread the fifth book yet put down this fanfiction immeadiatly and go read it so the end didn t so basically its as if the end of the book never happened and harry and the gang actually got a little rest and of course i started this long before the sixth book came out so all information from hbp is basically fully ignored the first sensation he felt that morning was one of extreme cold at first he dismissed it as the drafts of the cold damp dungeon but then he was aware that it was more than moist it was soaking wet and not only that but he could hear muffled snickers he sat up remembering he wasntin the dungeon at all and intent on murdering whoever had woken him from his comfortable sleep he opened his eyes almost expecting to see ginny but instead he saw ron and harry a few drops of water dripping from the tip of the redhead wand i am going to kill you both he said slowly up and at em sunshine harry said with malicious cheer ron snickered nice pajama malfoy you re whiter than the sheets draco glanced down at his pale bare chest and green and satin pajama pants then at ron right back at ya he said ron flushed looking down at his own pajamas a white t shirt and a pair of long flannel pants with fire engines on them hermione bought them he mumbled draco smirked really if you two wanted to see me all roughed up in bed ron flushed even worse and harry looked disgusted actually we ve got better things to do thanks draco sneered moaning myrtle doesntcount potter he said and neither do mudbloods mudbloods he was about to say but he had stopped himself just in time if he said that ron would punch him then ginny would have found out and then she d hate him and there d be no possibility of having any fun at all that holiday ron was red again his face rivaling the shade of a tomato what were you about to say malfoy it wasntvery nice i afraid draco slapped his hand bad draco malfoy ron said advancing very quickly you d better hope what going on in here ginny demanded pushing the door open yeah draco said thanks for the knock weasley i could go back outside and let ron have his way with you she snapped then at the disgusted look of all three boys she added that didntcome out right no no dontlet him touch me draco said with mock desperation and a sneer really what is your family sick fascination with my body weasley the better question is why are you still in bed i came to wake you up forty five minutes ago she said we re going to be late draco tried to think back forty five minutes but was quite sure he had no memories of her trying to wake him up whatsoever he glanced at his watch it was only nine o clock nearly an hour earlier when she claimed she had tried to wake him up it would have only been eight that was just criminal the day didntofficially start until noon it still early he said lying back down and closing his eyes with the intention of sleeping another hour or two go sleep oh no you don t draco malfoy said ginny as she snatched his blanket away from him he screamed like a banshee oh you great baby get up she said sounding exasperated diagon alley will still be there in an hour but seamus won t just one of the many advantages of going back to sleep he said rolling over and pulling the pillow over his head she promptly snatched that away as well so help me you will get up she said better do as your mum says malfoy ron said snickering and would you two get out of here and go get ready ginny barked and threw the pillow at them narrowly missing ron head the two boys hurried out having on more than one occasion incurred the wrath of ginny if you are not out of that bed and headed for the shower in forty seconds you ll find out what if feels like to spend the day as a parakeet fine fine he said and slowly slipped on leg over the edge of the bed five six seven i waiting malfoy eleven twelve he got out of the bed she followed him down the stairs and to the bathroom door do you need to follow me in there too draco asked no i think you can take it from here ginny replied smiling sweetly just donttake too long and then she disappeared down the stairs normally he took short showers but just for the fun of it he added nearly twenty minutes of bathing time simply to annoy her then in addition to his already extensive morning ritual of getting ready he took extra care to insure that his hair was flawlessly brushed and jelled once he was sure he was not only groomed to perfection but also late enough that ginny would be suitably annoyed he sauntered down the stairs not at all to his surprise the entire weasley family with the exception of arthur who was still at work and percy who had chosen not to participate in the family outing was standing at the fireplace waiting for him but mother really why cantwe just stay here with percy one of ginny cousins asked it was one of the small bookish looking twins because jack this is a family vacation and the woman ginny had pointed out as her aunt may answered she was holding a crying baby and looked incredibly worn percy our family the other twin pointed out reasonably yes well percy is also an adult and your not now you re coming said the woman and behind her fred and george were sticking their tongues out at the smaller set of twins bit of a disappointment to them really ginny who had appeared at draco side said quietly they were thrilled when they heard may was having twins thought they had two little prodigies on their hands til jack and jim came out like two mini percys that not fair one said sounding rather whiney if he had to guess draco would have said the boys were about seven eight maybe get stuffed william muttered to his brothers and fred and george both patted him on the shoulder william however ginny informed draco still talking in hushed tones is their absolute greatest accomplishment he only ten and he already almost as bad as they ve ever been would you boys stop you are going and that final fine they both said sullenly okay then you three go first stay there to meet the children mrs weasley said addressing harry ron and hermione they each took a small handful of floo powder and disappeared into the flame after them the weasleys departed one by one the youngest first with draco going along last by the time he arrived may was already in a panic and the others were trying to calm her what wrong he asked william ginny answered william never showed up and you re sure that you three didntsee him ginny uncle was asking harry ron and hermione no ron answered he never came well now dontworry mrs weasley said he probably just didntspeak clearly enough he couldnthave gotten too far away we ll just split up and look for him we ll go this way fred and george both said and headed off to the left draco was thrilled watching the weasleys head off he hadntknown how he was going to sneak away and get to seamus before ginny did this made for the perfect excuse i ll go this way draco said pointing off in the direction of the leaky cauldron do you want me to come with you ginny asked i a big boy weasley she frowned but red hair freckles about this tall he paused and indicated somewhere towards the middle of his torso and answers to the name of william she was still frowning but he didntreally mind he turned and hurried off hoping he wouldntactually find the boy how inconvenient that would be it was a particularly crowded day what with christmas less than two weeks away draco had to fight his way through the horde to get to the doors of the pub and once there he had to search for several minutes before he actually found seamus he was seated in a booth in the back looking about casually draco really hadntknown if this was where ginny and him were supposed to be meeting but he had gone on a hunch and he was right gryffindors really were pathetically predictable he crossed the room with a purposeful elegant stride and sat down across from seamus who was looking shocked and none to pleased too see him lo finnigan draco said nonchalantly as if they had lunch together everyday ginny ll be a little late malfoy seamus answered almost but not quite maliciously now what kind of manners did your mum teach you is that the all the greeting i get you re lucky your greeting didntinvolve me hitting you across the head with that chair the other boy said glaring draco winced can we just cut past this pathetic attempt at witty repartee because really that just sad i mean seriously expecting you to come up with anything clever is kind of like expecting a movie like things you would never have thought to do with a broomstick to have intelligent dialogue and a well thought plotline so did you just come here to insult me or was there something you wanted to say seamus asked through grit teeth he really wanted to hit him draco could tell in a way draco almost wished he would at least then he could have some respect for the irish boy but no like a good little gryffindor seamus stayed seated across from him ginny weasley draco said there was a long pause finally against his better judgment seamus asked so what about her if you hurt her in any way i ll kill you draco said simply gaping seamus tried to say something but draco cut him off if you break her heart or upset her i ll kill you i could come up with some stunningly clever threat of how i d kill you but really it would be wasted on you just suffice it to say it would be painful and would probably involve a pair of dull hedge clippers you re insane seamus said looking at him incredulously yes well so i ve been told and i also suggest that you donttell her about this he stood and dusted of his robes well then it good that we ve had this chat he hurried out of the building and wondered if he should at least glance about for ginny cousin he scanned the crowd of people and stopped when he caught a glimpse of bright red the crowd covered it now but he had been sure he had seen it then as the throng parted again he saw ginny moving in his direction oy draco she called we found him draco quickened his pace and met her where was he gambol and japes joke shop not quite as impressive as zonko s but fred and george have still told him enough about that he flooed there instead his mum was furious she said and she was grinning ginny grabbed his wrist and checked his watch i d best go meet seamus i twenty minutes late already i sure he ll understand i should be done by noon or so she said hesitantly fine he said i ll be at flourish and blotts ginny couldnttell if it was an invitation or not it was one of the most amazing annoying things about him that no matter what he said it could have a thousand meanings sensing her ambivalence he smirked at her i ll meet you there he said deliberately she smiled brightly and then rushed off in the direction of the inn the hostess smiled graciously can i help you sir ms moreau should be expecting me draco said smiling engagingly the girl smile faltered slightly i sorry sir but ms moreau did not mention any appointments and she paused looking down at the page of her open reservation book you are not on the list not surprising considering i didnttell her i was coming but trust me she ll be expecting me i sorry but let him come in a girl said she was standing at the top of a flight of stairs directly behind the reception desk the stairway was dark but the light from the room behind her made her figure a stunning silhouette looking mystic and enigmatic in loose flowing robes she turned and reentered the room leaving the door behind her slightly ajar draco slowly climbed up the stairs and pushed the door open the room was huge and lavish extravagantly but not garishly decorated in sheer hangings and soft cushions and smelled of incense on one wall there was a single painting it was a sunset brightly lit with reds and oranges in the middle of the room lying like a queen awaiting homage the girl was reclined her robes and hair fell over the side with a seductive air and he was quite sure she had arranged it like that on purpose he grinned at her always have to make an entrance you ve probably known for days i was coming and you couldnteven put me on the guest list well i didntmake any other reservations now come here the room was the one she used for special clients ones who wanted a private room for whatever reason they might choose she didntask questions he swiftly crossed the room and stopped before her slowly lazily she lifted herself into a sitting position dutifully he leaned down and accepted her kiss like always kissing him was like something distant not cold but instead like kissing an idol something too detached and revered to be intimate he didntwant her affection instead he tolerated it he managed to give the air that he was bestowing a great gift to allow her to kiss him like that you re looking well sylvia he said and you know you re beautiful she said with a smile you dontneed me to tell you that of course but it still nice to hear sometimes she wrapped her legs under her making room for him to sit by her and laughed a musical little laugh vanity thy name is malfoy you werentfollowed no my father cronies lost track of me at kings cross and haventfound me since she sighed serenely so tell me about her then about who the redheaded girl the girl you re in love with oh seamus i so sorry i late my cousin got lost and i had to help look for him and oh no ginny it fine seamus said but he was looking rather fidgety is something wrong she asked concerned no no nothing wrong so where do you want to start i not in love with her draco protested hmm was all sylvia said i not fine then you re not but tell me about her anyway sylvia said and she seemed to be searching him for something and then he did he told her everything from the first day in knockturn alley where he had saved her and then given her the necklace about ginny dreams and all he knew regarding tom riddle and then staying the holiday with her he was glad to tell her he had considered many times telling blaise but after all was said and done blaise was really much too moral to be in slytherin and being ginny friend he would have disapproved and he had wanted to tell someone for a long time not just so he would be able to talk to someone about it but also because in a very dark and slytherin place in his heart he was proud of himself but sylvia was like him she would understand his pride without him having to explain it and she would have answers even though he really had no specific questions to ask she said nothing while he recounted the past few months he finished and still she sat in perfect brooding silence finally she said so you could have done anything you wanted with her and really she had no choice you have the means to find her wherever she is and bring her to you and you never use it you two have classes alone together and yet you ve never tried anything you control her dreams and all you ve done is sit back and observe so basically you have complete and absolute control over this girl and what have you done i you draco malfoy are in love and with a weasley of all people i cantdecide whether it too pathetic to be funny or not really i think it probably is but i still canthelp laughing at the irony of it all her tone had a brittle tone to it and he knew what she was thinking about how about this one he asked holding up a purple imitation leather purse with a large flower print on it oh seamus ginny said frowning it ghastly oh he said and then looked at it as if he were seeing it for the first time oh it is isntit he dropped it back on the shelf they had been shopping for about half and hour and seamus seemed horribly distracted he kept picking up such awful appalling things that ginny began to wonder if perhaps he actually hated hannah maybe we should try another store ginny said steering him towards the door hmm oh yeah another store that d be good seamus are you alright right as rain he said and held open the door for her he followed after her but missed the step and fell on the street oh dear ginny said looking at the small scrape on his arm you were saying i fine he said standing up and brushing himself off it just you know we re not dating right ginny stopped abruptly and stared at him in utter disbelief well yes i know that otherwise shopping for your other girlfriend would have been a bit awkward really seamus what gotten into you the immense relief on his face was almost comical oh nothing ginny now where to next it wasntthat he didntkiss back he always did and draco malfoy was quite skilled merlin knew he d had enough practice but it was always an automatic bodily compulsion that he should react to her lips on his always he had a distracted air that wasntso much that he didntcare that she was kissing him but rather that he was barely aware of it as if her presence was barely a blip on his radar she had known from the vary beginning that she was nothing to him he had almost said as much and at first that was what she wanted he was gorgeous and confident and perhaps a little younger but skilled enough to make up for it and it was simply amusement to them both nothing more and nothing less blaise was ecstatic about the pairing he was convinced they would fall in love and slowly she did but he hadn t and she knew he never would but that didntstop her she began to spend time with him apart from simple physical contact she would help him with his homework and eat dinner with him and sometimes just sit in his room and watch him read he read a lot and she had loved observing him then because he was too engrossed to notice she could for hours at a time study the sharp lines and angles of his face sometimes he would catch her watching him and smirk as if it was simply his due that she should love him and then he would kiss her but she knew he did care about her even if it was never in the way she wanted when she had been younger and not able to control her visions she had often had fits he was always first at her side holding her hand when she had one of those episodes and sometimes very rarely he talked to her openly without his shield of sarcasm one day during the summer after his sixth year and he had come home particularly upset she was there waiting for him as she often was what wrong she had asked noticing the anger in his eyes nothing he had snapped and then he had kissed her there was a hunger and a need in that kiss that had never been there before she was just another out a way of avoiding what was bothering him a drug to numb the pain she knew it and she didntcare because for once she could feel something in him he grasped at her so hard it almost hurt slipped his hands under her shirt sliding them up and down her back and it shocked her because in the five months they had been dating he had never gone farther than to kiss her draco she couldnthelp herself from saying it she had said it so many times in her head draco i love you he had stopped pulled back and was if only for a second shocked then his face had grown cold again and emotionless and distant sylvia i dontthink we should do this anymore i know draco and she had turned right then and left because she knew if she hadntshe would have lost him forever two days later she found a bouquet of roses on her doorstep they were yellow the color of friendship she cried for three days straight and then she had gone to see him and they just talked when she left he had caught her by the arm i do i do sylvia if not in that way and that one sentence had made her so immeasurably sad that even now she couldntbring herself to think about it listen sylvia i need to ask something really important of you i need to know what you ve seen he asked leaning forward and taking her hand nothing she said quietly there must be something anything you ve told him everything i need to know draco said he sounded pleading even to his own ears but he knew there was something wrong there was no reason the dark lord should have taken such an interest in ginny weasley and having grown up in his father house he knew dark magic when he felt it the dark energy of those dreams was almost tangible he didntknow what it meant but he knew it meant something besides that there was still whatever his father was planning to consider if it was important enough that snape had wanted him a safe distance away from even the school it had to be something major i dontknow what do you mean you dontknow you know i only remember parts of what i see the girl said looking horribly was it ashamed but your scrying mirrors you must no she said quietly and this time he was positive that the emotion in her beautiful blue eyes was guilt i dontunderstand he said bluntly i block it draco i block it all my mirrors the crystal balls i dontuse them anymore i ve even stopped drinking tea she said suddenly sounding desperate i dontwant to see it draco i dontwant any of it i dontwant to know when the dark lord when he needs me i tell him what i know and then and then i obliviate myself she had a wistful almost dreamy expression as she said the last part you you what he sounded incredulous bordering on disgusted you dontunderstand what it like she said savagely you dontknow what i see but if you used your visions you could change things you could go to the order i would take you hanging around with the gryffindors is no picnic but it better than working for the dark lord they could no i cantbetray him you know what he d do to me to my family she grasped at him in sudden desperation and besides she added after a moment i cantchange the things i see that not how it works what i see it will happen it must but there must be some way no draco there not you dontknow what it like what i see i see horrible things draco why why do you think i had those fits when i was a child it like living in a nightmare only i know its real draco you have to understand she broke down unable to say anything further she looked up at him with pleading eyes needing him to understand what she was doing coward he spat and she could see the disappointment in his face he was cruel at times and he stepped over lines but that had always been in anger never in this disgust it made her angry he had no right to accuse her of anything you re running away sylvia you shut up draco you have no right no right she could feel hot tears streaming down her face and she couldnttell if they were of anger or sadness or self loathing she had gotten to her feet at some point dont dare stand there and think you re better than me what have you ever fought for you re me you re just like me you can think whatever you like but at the end of the day we both know it she stood panting waiting for some response draco looked like he d been slapped he sat in silence for a moment and then finally he stood i guess that it then he was halfway to the door before she stopped him draco she crossed the room and grabbed at the frame of the painting and after a brief struggle the painting swung forward on old hinges with a creak inside was a single item a shallow stone basin with a single string of runes inscribed around the brim carefully the girl pulled it from its hiding space and like a child carrying a bucket too full of water slowly brought it too him it it not a very clear vision but i thought you should have it it got your girl in it i would have just told you myself but draco it so heavy thank you he said and carefully preformed a shrinking charm and wrapped it gingerly in a silk handkerchief and draco once you see it if you want to forget i won t he said firmly take this then sylvia said and took from under her couch a bottle firewhiskey 1845 firewhiskey not nearly as permanent as obliviate but trust me you ll forget he nodded and then left closing the door behind him she sunk down on the floor and silent tears began to flow down her beautiful impassive face she sat there for a moment before she finally collected herself and stood smoothing out the wrinkles in her robe she took a deep breath and then another fighting down another wave of tears there was a small knock at her door yes she called her voice perfectly unaffected the door slid open only a slight bit miss yes sarah you can come in the receptionist from downstairs opened the door and offered sylvia something the young man from just a moment ago left it he said to bring it up to you sylvia smiled it was a single yellow rose ginny smiled to herself after its initial awkwardness seamus had gotten very pleasant and the outing had been extremely enjoyable they had ended up deciding upon a simple pretty necklace for hannah which she was sure she would love they had parted around twelve thirty and she was now making her way through the crowd the flourish and blotts she hurried inside welcoming the warmth it was not hard to find draco he was seated in a large armchair on the second landing of the store a large pile of books at his side i wouldnthave taken you for much of a reader she said breezily reading the page over his shoulder it was a very dull history book an in depth examination of the events that lead up to the goblin wars what you think just because i could get by with just my devastating good looks that i neglect my intellectual side he asked acquiring a look of mock offense actually i rather thought you d have better things to do than spend you re saturday nights reading about goblins then i remembered who i was talking to well it does get awfully busy between torturing the innocents kicking orphans and coming up with the eleventh plague he said smirking slightly i take it you re not much of a reader then she shrugged not really i do what i need to get by in school and i like romance novels dontlook at me like that nothing trashy but aside from that not really well if romance is what you want there a horribly romantic scene in here between eargit and urg but it might get just a bit too graphic for you he said very solemnly biting back a smile she asked and how that well they dontcall urg the unclean for nothing ginny laughed i going to look around a bit you can keep reading if you like i ll get you when i done he nodded and returned to his book ginny who was miserably behind on her christmas shopping searched the shelves for something appropriate for hermione she picked out a book on the twenty most influential wizards of the era it was enormous and ginny couldnthave read it in five lifetimes she also got two books on quidditch that had just come out one an in depth biography of any player of any team from the year 1100 and on the other a rather horrifying but hilarious book that play by played the world greatest quidditch accidents ginny would wrap them up together and simply address it to harry and ron because she knew within a month the two would have passed them both back and forth so much between them that they wouldntremember which had been whose in the first place she also picked up the latest book in the romance series that her mother had recently become addicted to it was a trilogy entitled the wrong side of the wand mrs weasley had read the first book point me and blushingly forbidden ginny to go near them done she asked coming back to draco chair he had made surprisingly good progress with his book and again ginny was surprised she had never thought of his a dumb but she had also never pictured him sitting around reading for pleasure he closed his book and gathered the three or four others he d picked out and stood i though you said you didntread much he said quirking an eyebrow at the books she carried they re gifts she said and hoped he wouldntnotice the title wands arise of her mother book once they d paid he and ginny simply wandered around ginny really had nothing in mind to get for anyone so she simply went from store to store looking around and buying whatever interested her draco was pleasant or at least as pleasant as he always was but after two hours he began to get impatient he kept touching his pocket as if assuring himself that whatever was in there hadntbeen lost what are you doing she d asked nothing really weasley how much longer do you expect to be just get everyone some nice candy and maybe some contraceptives for your parents and be done with it she slapped him gently on the shoulder i will not give me just ten more minutes oh and dontlook so pleased about it i not saying that for you i just promised mum we d meet her at four to go home ginny was very pleased with herself she d managed to cross everyone off her list in just on day she was carrying at least seven bags full of christmas presents waiting to be wrapped and then opened and she couldnthelp but grin thinking about christmas morning it was by far her favorite holiday ginny glanced over at draco who was walking along facing the ground looking rather distracted he was swinging his flourish and blotts bag back and forth on his arm and it struck ginny as an oddly childish gesture she smiled what are you so happy about he asked catching her off guard oh nothing you could help me carry my bags you know glancing down at her burdens then at the single bag he held in his own hand he looked as if the thought had never occurred to him which ginny was quite sure it hadn t yes i suppose i could he said it wasntsarcasm but he didntmove to take her bags as they approached the leaky cauldron ginny could already see the large mass of red that was her family standing out against the crowd her mother rushed forward to meet them finally let go you two ron what are you waiting for help your sister with those bags mrs weasley called obligingly ron came and took several packages from under his sister arm now dontlook in those ginny snapped what got mum knickers in a knot going barmy i d say she met up with us about an hour ago and wouldntleave she kept saying she thought someone was following us ron said looking annoyed ginny pitied her brother she d had enough shopping trips with her mother to know it was not always a pleasant experience especially when he wanted as she was sure he did to say things he would prefer his mother didntknow come on what in merlin name are you kids doing back there ginny had never been very good at wrapping presents but it was a fun way to pass the time her room was beginning to resemble the north pole for all the presents and wrapping paper she had in there of course her floor was impossible to navigate and her bed was so covered she d probably have to sleep on the couch but still it was nice she d already gone over her mental checklist twice before she d left diagon alley to make sure she hadntforgotten anyone but just to be on the safe side she thought it all through again she gotten presents for ron harry and hermione all her brothers all her cousins and even some sweets for other order members remus and tonks had been easy because of their upcoming marriage sirius had been a bit more of a challenge because really what was there to get for a middle aged ex convict but she d found something eventually and that she was quite sure was everybody and even if it hadntbeen between her mother and malfoy she would have had to leave anyway immediately ginny paused draco she hadnteven thought about malfoy was she supposed to be getting him something there were as far as she knew no rules of decorum that would cover this particular situation they werentexactly friends but they werentreally enemies anymore either there was really no word for her relationship with draco a week ago she would have called it mutual tolerance but it had moved apart from that somehow in a way she could quite describe she d been studying him trying to figure him out and found that she couldn t every time she thought she had him pinned down he did something completely out of character she d basically just resigned herself to the fact that she would never quite understand him ginny there was a soft knock on the door right before her mother started to open it no mum i ve got presents out ginny yelled rushing to the door and knocking it closed she heard her mother aggravated sigh well then come out here ginny slipped out the door and closed it behind her seamus is in the kitchen fireplace he wanted to know if you could talk seamus but i only just saw him a few hours ago ginny said puzzled mrs weasley smiled and winked i know maybe he just wanted to thank you for such a pleasant time mum seamus and i are not dating she frowned and then her face lit up with a glimmer of hope does that mean that you and harry uggg i more likely to date snape than i am to date harry we ve been over this before but you two would be so love i have to go seamus is waiting for me downstairs ginny said and hurried away through the fire seamus smiled when he saw her lo ginny hey seamus he looked around nervously err ginny malfoy not around is he no i haventseen him she replied baffled good look i know it none of my business but are you and malfoy dating ginny couldnthave been more shocked if he had announced his undying devotion to ron and asked for her assistance in wooing him what i sorry i know i shouldntget involved but really ginny i just think you deserve better seamus said i i mean we are not dating you re not he asked looking relieved of course not really seamus what gotten into you today you re behaving so bizarrely it just that this morning when you were out looking for your cousin there arentany hedge clippers at your house are there what hedge clippers he said solemnly have you gone mad he sighed this morning malfoy came over and basically threatened to kill me if i hurt you ginny felt as if she d been struck he what ginny i dontknow what going on between you two but thank you seamus but i think i have to go have a word or two with malfoy there was a bit of a panic in seamus voice but ginny but ginny was standing up and headed in the direction of the door thanks seamus have a happy christmas seamus was about to try and stop her but she didntlook like she was in any mood to listen and besides what were the odds that draco malfoy could really find him all the way in ireland where he was staying with relatives it was only a slightly reassuring thought ginny was on her way out of the kitchen when her mother came bustling in done already what did seamus have to say ginny smiled oh you were right he just wanted to thank me for helping him again oh wonderful here help me carry all this food out mrs weasley said handing ginny several platters dinner ready the weasley boys came rushing down the stairs after a moment ginny aunt and uncle appeared too and then last ambling down the steps came malfoy as ginny set the food down on the table draco came up beside her what the likelihood we can get out of dinner two nights in a row he asked quietly ginny glared but didntsay anything yeah that what i was afraid of he said and took a seat next to her and she didnteven look at him in fact the only time she responded to him at all throughout the whole dinner was to pass the salt and even then she remained silent after about twenty minutes she looked up from her plate and asked can i be excused mum i d really like to head up to bed her mother looked slightly startled already are you feeling well fine just a bit tired she said and then stood and disappeared up the stairs draco waited for a while before he too excused himself and followed her he stopped at her door and knocked there was no answer weasley it me let me in there was a long pause and just as he was about to give up she threw the door open what on earth gives you the right to just go about threatening my friends what i seamus said you threatened him she said sharply is that true bloody awful gryffindors cantkeep their mouths closed too bloody courageous for death threats he mumbled so you did then she turned around like she was about to close the door in his face and then thought better of it and wheeled around for a second wind how dare you it bad enough having six ruddy brothers to ward off every boy i come within six feet of me but now apparently i have you too to get rid of everyone who doesntmeasure up to your pompous standards i can pick my own friends thank you very much and if seamus and i want to i dunno run off to bermuda together you ll just have to accept that well he thinks we re dating what did you tell him she demanded draco sneered oh so that what this is all about your precious reputation ginny called him a name that he was quite sure she would have never said in front of her mother with a hand gesture to match well forgive me for not wanting people to think i ve invited my boyfriend to spend the holiday with me i dontcare what you do or say just make sure that next time it doesntinvolve me she slammed the door he stood in shock for a moment then just as he turned around and began to leave she threw the door open again and it more than that where are you going i not through sorry but impassioned door slamming usually tends to indicate the end of a discussion she called him another rude word and this time he smirked no despite popular belief my parents were married i have my birth certificate if you d why is it you are incapable of having a serious conversation it not so much that i incapable of it oh just shut up see here what i dontget we re not friends are we because really i didntthink we were in fact i think last time i said anything along those lines you laughed in my face so why exactly do you care who i spend time with the way i see it are you dating him what she said stunned it seemed people were asking her that question a lot that day seamus are you dating him taken aback she stared open mouthed for a second no no i not good he said finally then turned around and walked away draco sat down on his bed and carefully pulled his handkerchief from his front pocket he d waiting until he was sure everyone else would be asleep he restored the pensieve to its normal size and stared at it rippling surface for a moment he didntwant to use it sylvia was the most stable fearless person he knew and whatever had caused the pain and terror he d seen in her eyes today he was about to see too he thought back almost regretting his words it had not been an easy life for her while blaise whose mother had at one point been blasted off their family tree and was only re added when her net worth totaled over seventeen million galleons had been brought up in a fairly kind household sylvia upbringing was much like his own she was seven and at a dinner party when she d had her first vision draco liked to think that had she not discovered her abilities in a room full of death eater and their associates that her parents would not have brought her to voldemort but he doubted it the next morning they d taken her for an audience with the dark lord and she d been giving him predictions ever since she had like many of the death eater children he knew no desire to serve voldemort they had decided what their parents could not see he would ultimately fail and the pureblood family names which had once been so revered would have been dragged through the mud in the process he hated lucius because no matter how he evaded punishment everyone knew what he really was the malfoy name was blighted and it was entirely his father fault sylvia hosted much the same resentment for her parents but she loved them and she knew what voldemort would do to them should she ever stop serving him without a moment more hesitation draco dipped his fingertips in the silver liquid for a second he felt as if he was falling it would have been fine after that had the vision not been so garbled and broken it was something like watching a slideshow from a conveyor belt the images jumped past him in a morbid procession a dark foreboding castle on a hill a tall hooded figure ginny in strange green robes snape and his mother looking down at something he heard a harsh muffled laughter that chilled him and then intermingled with it a horrible dry scream then he saw harry and he was holding ginny tightly whispering something into her ear and then he just saw ginny lying motionless looking battered and beaten on a hard stone floor then with an almost painful pulling sensation the images smeared and moved away and within a moment he was sitting on his bed at the burrow he was covered in sweat and he could still hear the laughter ringing in his ears he didntnormally drink with the exception of the occasional wine with a meal but the firewhiskey he d stashed under his pillow was at the moment extremely appealing with a deep sigh he pulled the bottle from its hiding place and took a deep swallow an hour later the firewhiskey gone and feeling as if he werentnearly sloshed enough draco made his way down to the stairs to the kitchen looking for something else to drink he found three bottles of butterbeer and drained them the actual alcoholic content of butterbeer was approximately the same as a piece of butterscotch but either way he didntreally care he began ransacking the cupboards looking for something else malfoy he wheeled around to find ginny standing in the doorway staring at him holding an empty bottle what are you doing up so late he asked impressed by the clarity of his speech the baby was hungry and i told aunt may i d feed him she said gesturing weakly to the bottle in her hands what are you doing sneering he answered running away what it look like weasley isntthat what i always do what are you yup just sit back look pretty and make snarky comments really it all i good for ginny gave him a long hard look you re drunk he shrugged maybe does it really matter yes it matters she snapped you re down here staring at the bottom of your bottle pitying yourself for merlin knows what reason because i a coward he interjected helpfully oh quit being so melodramatic she snapped melodramatic he asked the faint ghost of a smile playing on his lips there was no hint of amusement in that expression i being entirely serious a complete coward i am what have i ever fought for and all of that oh do stop i mean for merlin sake i ve been here three days and i haventeven done anything with you he said and she opened her mouth to say something when he grabbed her tightly by the arms and pulled her up against him pushing his lips on hers with a fierce intensity that was almost painful she could taste the remnants of alcohol on his hot breath and his skin was moist with feverish warmth for a moment ginny was too shocked to react it was as if she had forgotten to move and then suddenly remembering herself she wrenched away she pulled out her wand sobriest she snapped and immediately draco felt his drunkenness fading away the spell purging the alcohol from his body in its place came the crashing headache and nausea that he normally would have had at least another few hours to look forward to you re not supposed to use magic outside of school he said reproachfully yes well it was better than listening to you wallow about in self pity she said coldly honestly i a bit disappointed i always thought i could hold my liquor better than that she didntsmile and he didntsay anything you kissed me you were drunk she said after a long pause as if maybe he didntremember he was struck by how callous and remote she sounded obviously he said rubbing his temples really what was the point of coming up with a spell that made you sober if there was still the hangover to deal with she stiffened and for a moment draco didntsee why and then of course he understood and barely restrained himself from sprouting out several rude words ginny he touched her wrist ginny that not what i meant she said shaking and pulling her hand away sharply the barely controlled anger in her eyes was startling don t was all she said i didntmean it like that i just meant i wouldnthave done it like that if i had been not that i wouldnthave done it it could have been sweet but instead he sounded weary as if the fact that he had to explain it to her was vexing i ve wanted to do that for days now it it wasntjust because i was drunk ginny he stopped and very softly he put his hands on her shoulders and drew her to him slowly he closed the space between them and kissed her gently she didntmove under his touch i sorry he whispered brushing his lips against her ear just because you re sorry doesntmake it alright she said turning and leaving him standing there in wonder when someone apologized didntthe other person have to accept wasntthere some sort of rule about that maybe not necessarily an official one but he was quite sure it was one of those unwritten things he stood looking at where she had been for a long while finally he went upstairs his most pressing need that of a bathroom in which he could vomit in peace so yup there chapter 34 for you please review or i ll cry really well probably not literally but i ll be crying on the inside oh and err i forgot to disclaim earlier so here that too i own nothing you recognize for jkr works or wb movies and now an added note which is if you get another chapter update thingy the reason for that someone hyper bee pointed out to me the similarity of the end of this chapter andoneof the chapters from draco sinister by cassandra claire i actually had read that story before but well over a year ago so i really dontremember itthat well any similarities were completely unintentionaland the intent was not to copy or steal any of her work i just wanted to clarify that a bit and thanks for pointing it out i do own sylvia who origianlly had a much larger role in the story and just sort of disappeared i have several deleted scenes of her you know talking to voldemort and what not but i never found a place to fit them in really though she a lovely charecter so you can steal her if you like also the poor weasleys the unknown ones likewilliam and may had a much larger role in the original plot which has changed so much from my first ideas that it basically not even the same story anymore but they ve sort of gotten cut out and neglected and here i am begging you yet again to forgive me for taking an almost inhuman amount of time to update i sooo sorry i ve been on vacation for the past two and a half weeks and before that i was swimming so i didnthave much time and not only that but school starts in two days for us but i will nonetheless try and get a new chappie up as soon as possible disclaimer how many times must i say it i dontown it blah blah blah no money blah blah blah dontsue me ginny threw the door closed behind her and flung herself onto the bed then almost as suddenly she stood up she was far too angry to stay still draco malfoy was the world biggest something she wasntentirely sure what he was but it was bad and he was most definitively it the problem with her room she decided pacing was that there was nothing to tear at school she had loads of old rolls of parchment filled with notes and papers and old exams that she didntneed anymore that would be wonderful to simply rip into shreds at a moment like this however here at the burrow her room was vary bare and there was nothing here she could destroy without later regretting she settled on a pillow it was old and flat and lumpy and she didntuse it anyway and slashed it open with a letter opener in large angry fistfuls she relieved the pillow of its feathery contents which was not nearly as satisfying as she might have hoped by the time she had finished it looked as though she d left her window open during a particularly heavy snowstorm she then went to work on the case itself which was much more gratifying the resistance of the cloth and then the lovely rip as it finally gave in was a better way of allaying her anger the very idea she d shredded the pillow into bits too small to be ripped any more and she was still livid where did he get the right to come up out of nowhere and kiss her like that what could have possibly possibly make him think that it was his prerogative to just honestly she didnteven know him well not to say she didntknow him she knew him she but she didnt know him she wasntentirely sure what the difference was but it was certainly there and if he thought he could just go about threatening half her friends and insulting the others or more likely threatening and insulting them at the same time in that annoying patronizing sarcastic way of his and then run off a few clever one linners and then everything would be okay between them he certainly had another thing coming she was still trying to decide whether or not she trusted him not to murder them all in their sleep let alone kiss her but of course none of this mattered because the only reason he d kissed her at all was because he was drunk ginny had never thought of herself as beautiful or anything but she certainly hadntthought a guy would have to get good and wasted just to give her the time of day she kicked the wall something she d seen ron do countless times when he wanted to beat malfoy to a bloody pulp and immediately regretted it ron she thought biting her lip and nursing her foot was a bleeding idiot unable to think of anything else to do she pulled her broom from where it sat in the corner propped up against the wall and began polishing it scrubbing until the wooden handle was hot with friction she stopped and admired her own reflecting on its glossy spotless surface it was perhaps the cleanest her broom had ever been she then walked upstairs into ron room he and harry were outside with hermione and began polishing there too starting with harry already immaculately kept firebolt and then moving on to ron dingy and somewhat mud caked cleansweep by the time she d removed the last bit of dirt from her brother broom she d worked off some of her anger she turned about to go to back to her room and maybe find a book or something when she saw him standing in the doorway ginny i he started but ginny interrupted with a loud half screaming half growling sound that for a moment made him forget that he was half a foot taller than her she reminded him very much of an incredibly angry cat about to pounce upon a particularly annoying mouse and he decided quite wisely to very quickly back out of the room with all of her anger completely returned ginny stormed up to her room slammed the door and spent the next hour destroying another pillow he d had never really taken ginny to be the type to hold grudges for one of the few times in his life draco was beginning to believe he d been wrong the first day of silence had not shocked him in fact had she not been upset with him he would have been astounded the second day he was slightly aggravated but not stunned the third day he was more than a little irritated and just a bit surprised he d really expected she d have been over it by then by the fourth day he was just annoyed honestly how long did it take her to work through her anger or talk it out or whatever other nonsense gryffindors tried when they were angry count to ten and breath deep maybe she was just an extremely slow counter one thing he knew for sure if she was waiting for him to apologize she could bloody well just up and die already because it wasntgoing to happen at least not in that lifetime with the sole exception of his father she was the only person in the world he had ever sincerely apologized to and she had dismissed it and it wasntas if he hadntbeen trying honestly draco thought he d been very patient with her not once had he lost his temper he d tried to be considerate of her it wasntas if he d dragged her off into some dark corner and tried to force himself on her he d even been trying to be nice to her brothers which was as far as he was concerned the equivalent of being continually forced to listen to bad folk music the kind with banjos and singers who had no comprehension of the phrase on key but even that she had seemed completely unappreciative of her absolute lack of gratitude for his sacrifices was almost sickening and boring the worst part of her unexpectedly enduring silence was the boredom that had inevitably set in without her company the house was surprisingly quiet and uneventful the entire weasley clan was scattered about the house but they didntseek him out nor did he approach them if they noticed the rift between the slytherin and their sister they didntsay anything in four days alone he had finished all three of his new books and was now left with absolutely nothing to entertain himself with he could he supposed go and bother the weasel and co but that could hardly be expected to improve his situation with ginny with an irritated sigh he sat and began composing a letter to his mother he d already written her twice that week something that he really shouldnthave been doing considering how suspicious his father probably was already draco had written him the morning holiday began to tell him that he d changed his mind and thought he d stay at hogwarts for christmas if his father rage had calmed enough that he could think clearly draco was probably under a huge amount of scrutiny scrutiny that no doubt would end with his father having someone go and visit him on school grounds only to find he wasntthere draco supposed he d have to tell his father he d spent christmas with a girlfriend or something but in the mean time he d have to trust snape to ensure his mother safety he hated that dependence but he knew the potion master would be much more effective than he could ever dream to be so taking a small bit of impish pleasure at the thought of annoying snape with yet another letter to occupy his owl time he finished and sealed the note he cautiously crossed the room to where the black and white owl sat perched contentedly on his trunk he reached out hesitantly to attach the parchment to the creature leg earlier he had tried to put the bird into a cage and it had nearly taken his fingers off almost murderously annoyed he had referred back to the note that snape had sent with the owl and found scribbled on the back of it an advisory against putting the bird in a cage and instructions to simply leave the window open so the bird might come and go as he pleased he d made a rude hand gesture at the thing and it had tried to bite him again this time however it stuck its leg out and waited obligingly for draco to attach his letter and departed frustrated bored he d pulled out his copy of a diviner companion the dictionary of symbolism it was one of the books he d bought four days previously at flourish and blotts he was immeasurably glad that ginny had not seen it if she had and inquired after the book he probably could have explained it away as a class project except of course draco wasnttaking divination and she probably knew that still he would have been able to come up with some plausible reason as to why he needed it despite that he was still glad she hadntnoticed he didntneed to read it he had read and reread the passages so many times that he could basically recite it by heart but nonetheless he flipped open the book the stiff new spine had creased opening immediately to the page he d been looking for visions he knew as opposed to dreams were normally more literal than figurative and while there were parts he suspected that were completely literal there were other parts that he could find no other justification for except that they had some symbolic meaning in his boredom he d had plenty of time to review the contents of the pensieve watching it through several more times he d noticed several more details he hadntseen the first time a stewing cauldron behind the hooded figure the woman standing behind snape and his mother in a nurse attire that he had no explanation for but none of those things seemed to lend themselves to any greater symbolically significant deeper meaning the only thing that he was sure must have been figurative was the castle and it had been the first thing he d looked up his results however were not as beneficial as he might have hoped sylvia foretelling seemed to hold conflicting meanings according to the book castles often symbolized feelings of protection or security neither of which seemed to apply the book went on to say that dark castles usually represented failure or distress while light castles most often signified success the location of the fortress was also significant forests or valleys implied feelings of entrapment while castles on hills or clearings showed enlightenment or sovereignty the castle he d seen in the pensieve had been dark and on a hill the only bit there that seemed to fit with the overall mood of the vision was distress but if ginny was currently in any distress draco couldntsee how he couldntfind anything else that seemed symbolic in something of a last attempt he d even looked up the color green but the most common meaning behind that was good luck life and prosperity none of which seemed very relevant having found nothing else in the vision he tried to recall every detail of the dreams to his mind to see if perhaps he could find something useful there he looked up hood then finding nothing on that he tried mask but that yielded no useful results he looked up books which was pointless and lilacs which turned out to be equally unconstructive after nearly an hour of fruitless research he closed the book and pushed it to the side he closed his eyes with the intention of taking a short nap but found he couldntbanish thoughts of her dreams from his mind for the first time in a long while he allowed himself to focus on the dreams really they were pathetically gryffindor like potter her brother and every other gryffindor before them ginny had inherited a deep rooted ability to say the wrong thing at the wrong time the gryffindor motto might as well have been when in the face of danger call it ugly to ensure that it really mad before it kills you things like i ll never join you and i never want to see you again and ever other equally overused trite ending in an exclamation point phrases had been peppered throughout the dreams really how clich d could you get but the fact that both ginny and tom spoke like characters from a poorly written romance novel didntlessen the seriousness of the dreams there was always the possibility that they were just nightmares the feverish remembrance of bad memories after all she d been a child when she d first encountered tom riddle but draco couldntbring himself to believe that especially now there was just something so wrong about the way it felt something so very un dreamlike about it all any doubts that perhaps he was simply overreacting had been diminished though not entirely eradicated with his trip to sylvia something bad was going on and he was willing to bet that those dreams had something to do with it with something closely akin to guilt he pulled the small gold ring out of his pocket the ring and the necklace were connected and he knew that simply refusing to use either of them was perhaps not the best course of action but he hadntbeen able to bring himself to use it again for just a moment he paused sickened with himself sylvia had been right he was a coward and he admitted it self preservation was the backbone of slytherin philosophy and it had never failed him before but now he was beginning to think something more might be required in this particular situation he fingered the ring knowing that eventually he d have to force himself to use the necklace again but not today he put the band back in his pocket and laid down on the bed still fully dressed and closed his eyes he d been doing a lot of sleeping lately it was better than the boredom but even as he lie there with his eyes closed he felt a pressure he hadntfelt before as if some large hulking creature sat on its haunches somewhere stalking him waiting to make its move there was a dark ominous feeling of certainty that came with that image somewhere draco malfoy felt there was an hourglass and for him time was running out when draco woke again the last red and gold traces of sunlight were dancing on the curtains covering his window it had been early afternoon when he d gone to sleep and he d missed lunch and probably dinner only vaguely annoyed he wondered if anyone had tried to come and get him ginny wouldnthave and she was the only one besides perhaps mrs weasley who would have thought to wake him up he felt fairly sure that the middle aged witch would have noticed his absence at two meals which meant she had probably seen him and thought it was better to let him sleep really he was relieved the less meals he had to spend with the weasleys the better he d woken up with the type of headache that followed too much sleep groggily he rubbed his eyes and got out of the bed trying to smooth his clothes before heading down stairs from the kitchen he grabbed two rolls and something to drink and started back up to his room he paused when he heard hermione talking to ron and harry in a dreamy almost wistful fashion it marvelous i really admire cassandra hermione said enthusiastically waving a book in front of the boys faces ron face screwed up in concentration cassandra but isntshe trelawney great great grandmother or something i thought you said divination was bollocks hermione sighed like she d said something that she now rather wished she hadn t draco leaned on the doorframe so he could now see the conversation as well i did and it is but there a difference between true seeing and divination anyone can use divination or at least that half baked bit of it trelawney teaches but real seers diviners they actually have visions and see into the future simply using divination even muggle fortune tellers can do it to a degree hermione explained harry looked confused but trelawney she had real prophesies yes hermione agreed but she had a bit of cassandra blood in her and she cantreally see anything she didnteven know she d made a prediction ron grinned finally got something right and she missed it kind of pathetic really as usual granger you left out one important detail draco said and for the first time the three looked up at him startled real seers are purebloods ginny liked babies she always had it was regrettable considering that fact that she was the youngest in her family it was one of the many good things about having her family come to visit that she got to play with the baby babies she found had a sort of soothing effect on a person they were soft and sweet and had that fresh baby smell to them and it was impossible to stay mad when they were around which was good because lately ginny found there werentmany other people in the house she could keep her temper with in the past four days alone she rowed three times with ron twice with her mother and at least once with harry hermione percy and the twins her mother and her got into minor but nearly constant arguments basically since she had hit puberty and her brothers happily wrote it off as part of her time of the month but still she had to do a better job at not losing her temper or people would begin to suspect something was wrong and then they d assume it was draco which of course it was and then she d have to go through all those questions again and she was horrible at keeping up pretenses when she was angry so inevitably her brothers would find out something was going on and then it was just so much simpler to sit in the rocking chair and avoid all those things the only problem was draco he wasntcontent to just let her be he kept showing up everywhere not saying anything just waiting there like he expected her at any moment to start speaking to him again and when he wasntdoing that he was reading or sleeping he d given all attempts to reconcile with her which was disappointing because pointless and ineffective as they may be they had at least given her something to do now she had just fallen into the quiet boring pattern of quiet uneventful days but more than that it was odd simply because she d grown so accustomed to the slytherin presence that the lack of it was strangely disconcerting ginny laid her cousin down in the crib and extinguished the lights opening the door she was very nearly knocked to the ground as she and charlie collided merlin charlie ginny cried over charlie use of several more colorful words alright gin he asked helping steady her fine she answered as she straightened out and brushed herself off what are you doing mum says dinner ready oh thanks charlie she said and started down the stairs he grabbed her arm halting her before she d even finished her step listen ginny can we talk ginny frowned and gestured downstairs but dinner malfoy down there charlie said shortly you ve been doing such a good job avoiding him i d hate to see you quit now ginny bit her lip so you noticed of course i noticed charlie said i am the oldest after all you re not the oldest she pointed out yes well i should be he replied ginny went up the stairs leading to her room wordlessly and charlie followed once she had firmly shut the door she sat down on the bed and looked up at him not knowing what to say charlie was twiddling his thumbs and staring at the ground so he said after a long pause ginny stared at him and he let out a long deep sigh what going on ginny she made a face and he hastened to add i know you said you canttell me but is it because you canttell me or because you canttell me i cant tell you charlie i rather thought so and you canttell me why you canttell me can you he asked hopefully ginny shook her head listen ginny i know you can take care of yourself but i your brother and it my job to worry you d let me know if you gotten in over your head wouldntyou gin she laughed at the earnest serious expression on his face charlie nothing wrong i promise everyone making such a big deal out of this but i promise after christmas everything will go back to normal in the mean time malfoy and i he was just being himself arrogant conceited and stubborn charlie said with a grin yeah you forgot inconsiderate sarcastic and smug i ll add those to the list you re sure you re okay i sure he stood patted her shoulder in a reassuring manner and turned to leave hey charlie he paused and turned back to her do you think it possible for someone to change you mean malfoy her brother studied her a moment i suppose it possible i think you re good for him gin just be careful okay they hadntmet at their normal restaurant because of the holiday snape was only sporadically at the school and to travel all the way to hogsmeade simply to meet was ridiculous he had suggested the leaky cauldron but honestly the day narcissa black malfoy stepped foot into a common pub was the day voldemort played cricket with the queen so it was settled that they would meet an italian restaurant in london muggle london it was classy and clean and neither of them had ever been there before despite that narcissa had preformed he usual glamour charms her hair now a deep chestnut brown hung in tight curls around her shoulders honestly it clashed horribly with her completion but she didntreally care she d had a particularly hard time finding anything to wear but had finally settled on a pretty blue dress which she hoped wouldntmake her stand out too much amongst the muggles she d been waiting only a few minutes when severus entered the host hesitantly asked him how many would be in his party and snape glared and then proceeded to walk past the man and after a brief search caught narcissa eye the host did nothing to stop him intimidating under the best of circumstances snape seemed positively murderous he nearly knocked his chair over as he pulled it out and then threw himself into still looking irate the whole ministry is in lucius pocket kingsley was put on suspension today and all the ministry would say as to why was something about missing paper work he hissed narcissa gasped quietly kingsley kingsley was an auror with considerable seniority and a not insignificant amount of pull within the ministry if lucius had truly gotten rid of him the order had lost a huge asset has he filed for an appeal of course not snape said in the same low voice if he files for an appeal the ministry will start poking around and no doubt find something even more incriminating you know lucius never leaves loose ends he probably had something placed in shacklebolt files or desk for weeks just in case anyone started asking around the waiter had arrived at their table carrying a platter of food which he unloaded at their table before taking the bottle of champagne he d been holding and pouring it carefully into the two ornate wineglasses he replaced each glass with a flourish is there anything i can get you no thank you narcissa said the waiter left and she gracefully placed the cloth napkin in her lap i took the liberty of ordering for you i hope you dontmind of course not how is he severus draco is fine she let out a deep sigh of relief i sorry to be so bothersome to you but i get so worried about him i havent gotten a single letter from him this month i just hate not knowing where he is i ll be so glad when this whole holiday is over and i can be sure he back and safe at hogwarts he ll be fine narcissa snape said he never bothered to try and sound comforting instead he settled for a very assured matter of fact tone of course he will she said sounding very distant he a malfoy after all there was a long pause which she interrupted a moment later with the rather unexpected remark of he wasntalways like this lucius when we first got married he we all make mistakes there was no way you could have known what lucius would turn out like how consoling you sound severus she was intently studying her napkin dontlie of course i should have known and then i should have left as soon as i realized but draco was so small then who knows what lucius would have done she looked up at him suddenly i thought i was protecting him snape nodded i know dontthink i any better than i am i dontdisagree with what their doing i could care less about the muggleborns and their families i just wanted to protect him hesitantly snape touched her hand you have narcissa draco is fine and molly molly weasley she fine too but the waiter approached their table again do you need anything he asked dessert perhaps no thank you narcissa said and then once he d gone severus i just dontunderstand why they d go after her of all people snape shifted uncomfortably perhaps they are simply trying to bait potter she has been a mother figure to him for the past several years or they know that being his best friends mother potter will feel obligated to go after her or are you what i mean is can you be absolutely sure they said molly weasley of course narcissa said you you actually heard them say that name yes narcissa narrowed her eyes what going on nothing he said standing and brushing himself off i have to be going dontworry about draco sorry about any errors but like i said i a really really really bad proofreader thanks so much to my reviewers i you which is so much better than just loving you because it has capital letters please review they make me write faster and by the way just because i dontwant anyone thinking it a continuity err i cantspell dontstone me error of which there are many this just doesnthappen to be one of them if something narcissa said to snape doesntdoesntline up with something earlier in the chapter there a reason for that p s armadillos will someday conquer the world uggg because i tired and in desperate need of sleep ff decided to be a pain in the butt and not upload right i think i finally got it all sorted but man was it a nightmare trying to post this chapter and then i couldntget the default line to work either so you ll have to deal with hyphens sorry but at least i updated fairly quickly woot pats back anyway thanks for yet again wasting your time on me and thanks to all of my darling reviewers you re all absolute dolls disclaimer no profit is being made from this fanfiction everything you recognize belongs to the wonderful j k rowling and not to me must you on crushing my dreams would someone please pass me the jam he asked politely and ginny glared there wasnta single thing on his plate that could possibly require jam so the only reason he could be asking was to get on her nerves and he d succeeded idiots draco thought looking around at the other occupants at the table the golden trio was happily chatting away with bill and percy sat sulkily at one end of the table glaring at his doubles and the rest of what draco had begun to term the other weasleys were talking to mrs weasley about boring mundane things not a single one of them had noticed how upset ginny was typical he thought that she should get so ignored typical gryffindor behavior to ignore the only other semi interesting one in the room they were probably just intimidated by the fact that she seemed to have all her chromosomes very politely and in a slightly elevated voice he asked again for the jam she would have continued to happily ignore him except her mother had now heard ginny weasley where are your manners she demanded and with a frustrated sigh ginny passed the jam draco smiled very pleasantly at her and she glared in response may i be excused without waiting for a response she stood and left the table you ll have to excuse her dear mrs weasley said kindly ginny not much of a morning person what were we talking about may harry are you okay hermione asked looking concerned i fine he said but he didntlook fine she could tell from the dark rings around his eyes that he hadntbeen sleeping well and this was the third time that day alone that she d caught him rubbing his head are you sure is it your scar he nodded harry i really think you should tell someone about this you ve been getting headaches an awful lot lately she said putting a hand on his shoulder and biting her lip leave his alone hermione ron said he already got my mum coddling him he doesntneed you as well but harry what if oh come off it hermione it not as if you know who is just going to storm into the burrow with the whole order surrounding him the girl bit her lip again well maybe but do promise me you ll tell me if anything new happens wontyou didntyou have a question for snape about your potions homework ron asked oh is he leaving hermione asked rushing out of the room she may have a point harry ron said once she was safely out of earshot but you just oh of course she right he said waving a hand dismissively she always right but she doesntneed to know that now does she harry smiled and conceded yes i know i just dontwant to upset anyone christmas ron sat down on the bed frowned and pulled something from out beneath him i hate to say it but you should probably talk to someone before then dumbledore maybe no harry said fervently dumbledore got enough on his plate sirius then ron suggested examining the something he d sat on it was a chocolate frog which he unwrapped and popped in his mouth listen he said in what he no doubt thought was a conspirator whisper the effect was somewhat lessened however by the bits of chocolate in his mouth there a reason malfoy here it no coincidence that he magically shows up and then your scar just starts hurting all of the sudden but ginny ginny a bit like hagrid he said sounding weary she take in the foulest most vile horrible creatures and say they re just misunderstood hermione had returned holding a roll of parchment and looking crestfallen he already gone i haventgot a clue how he disappeared so quickly oh well you ve still got loads of time to do it hermione shook her head nervously i haventgot loads of time ronald i d like to have it all done before christmas so i can enjoy the rest of my holiday without worrying potions is the last subject i ve to do christmas that five days away yet ron cried hermione frowned four ronald and that counting today really i cantsee how you pass any of your classes my charm i suppose oh ron she reprimanded slapping him gently on the shoulder she sounded annoyed and tired and she was biting her lip in the way she did when she had something very important to say and was avoiding saying it just spit it out hermione ron said it just harry have you given any thought to what exactly you re going to do when you encounter you know who hermione ron cried well honestly dontget angry with me it a perfectly reasonable question i i dontknow harry said whenever he d come face to face with voldemort in the past he d never had to think about what he was going to do he didntplan these things it not just something i can study up on hermione it not an exam oh i know harry she said quickly biting her lip again and harry felt bad for snapping at her i just mean it never hurts to be prepared does it hermione harry is prepared he stopped you know who four times already ron said but that time with quirrell that was just luck harry said filling with dread really hermione was right the only assurance he had that should voldemort attack he would be able to defeat him was the fact that he had before and he hadntreally done anything those times and the night my parents died that wasntme either as for the graveyard if it hadntbeen for my wand and now that voldemort can touch me dontsay his name ron hissed looking around as if to make sure no one had heard i ve really got no protection harry i didntmean it like that hermione said horrified i just meant maybe we should practice some stuff over the holiday or or get the d a running again the d a was great and all but there no way that stuff going to help defeat voldemort ron made a strangled sound and harry ignored him i wontbe able to face him with a patronus and expelliarmus harry hermione said slowly what do you mean if i going to face him i might as well level the playing field if he can use un harry she cried sharply you cantuse unforgivables voldemort not going to hold back and if i can t hermione very sorry she d brought the topic up looked at ron for support but he was very carefully studying his shoes i not talking about the morality of it she said although it is wrong i just mean you cant use them unforgivables are very powerful advanced dark magic the killing curse must be at least twelve times as hard as a patronus and it took you weeks to master that and besides harry for dark arts to work you have to really want to hurt who you re cursing and you dontwant that the last part had come out sounding a bit more like a question than hermione would have liked harry didntreply but he didntneed to they all knew what he was thinking i do his eyes said i do if it will make this all just end ginny sat staring out the window one hand absently playing with her hair he felt almost ashamed watching her and he couldntreally explain why he wasntdoing anything wrong once he d cleared his throat half hoping she would turn around and notice him but she was either too deep in thought to notice or hadntheard him at all the cold breeze rushed in through the open window tousling her hair and draco was almost overcome by the mad urge to rake his fingers through her long mane he let out a low moan and turned around and headed back up the stairs he lay down on the bed and tried to occupy his mind with very dull non redheaded things flobberworms came to mind but really who wanted to spend their evening thinking about great ugly worms from his spot on the bed he could just barely see the bit of ground outside the treeline where he and ginny had had a snowball fight just days before he rolled over and closed his eyes it was only seven o clock but really what else was there to do ginny was standing in what looked like a girl lavatory she wasntfacing him but there was no mistaking her long vibrant hair for a moment nothing seemed amiss but then he noticed that her shoulders were heaving up and down in great dry sobs he took a step forward and felt the awkward resistance of water around his ankles and looked down to see that the floor had been flooded nearly a foot high it all poured from the sink in front of her an unbelievable amount of water for a single faucet ginny he asked putting a hand on her shoulder and spinning her around she looked up at him startled holding both hands out in front of her there were wet trails across her cheeks where she had been crying it wontcome off she said in a low dead sort of voice the kind of voice that came once the point of despair had been pasted and there was nothing left but acceptance i ve tried and i ve tried and i cantwash it off ginny there nothing there he said looking at her small pale hands he reached around her and turned the sink handle but the water continued to flow freely he told me it wouldntcome off i didntunderstand though she abruptly looked up at him horrified as if she was realizing something for the very first time i ve done something awful and it wontcome off and then suddenly she turned back around and plunged her hands into the water rubbing them together so forcefully it looked painful draco grabbed her wrists forcing her hands out of the sink even after they d left the water she continued scrubbing look at me ginny he said making her turn around to face him ginny there nothing there but instead of being comforted fresh tears streamed down her face and she thrust her hands out in front of her to show him the small arms before him were stained almost to the elbow in thick black ink it wontcome off she said sobbing now and suddenly there was a faint bitter metallic smell and a deep bloom of red blossomed at the center of each palm running down her arms he cringed as the warm liquid touched his fingers whose blood is this he demanded but she was crying to heavily now to hear him ginny whose blood is this i ve done something terrible tom and now it wontcome off draco woke in a cold sweat and he knew that a floor below ginny was now awake too he tried to stand but his sheets were so twisted around his legs that he found it difficult once he d untangled himself he went directly to the window throwing it open and letting the cold air clear his mind he was both comforted and annoyed which he decided was probably an inappropriate reaction to have at the time but this dream had lacked the distinct wrongness of the others and that was reassuring it was just a nightmare and nightmares he could deal with everyone after all had nightmares the fact that worried him however was that this time he hadntmeant to enter her dreams when mr borgin sold draco the necklace and ring he d of course warned that this might happen the fact that both items were run partially through spells but mostly through emotions well he didntthink it would be a problem but now he was concerned if her dreams had leaked into his it was definitely possible this worked in reverse how many times had she been audience to his own dreams draco took the ring from where it sat on the bed stand and stared at it as though it might answer his question staring at it sylvia words came rushing back you have complete and absolute control over this girl and what have you done his fist tightened around the ring and he took a deep fortifying breath to strengthen his resolve he stepped through the door and made it carefully down the first flight of stairs in the dark he paused a moment at the bottom in front of ginny room and light flooded out through the crack beneath the door he turned still clutching the ring and headed downstairs ginny sat on her bed breathing heavily she d wanted to go and soak in the cold water for a while but that required crossing the hall even from where she sat she could see the inky blackness slinking under the door jam in here in the light she was safe but should wander out into the darkness she knew it would rip at her tear her apart consume her dontbe stupid ginny there nothing out there she forced her legs to uncoil and venture over the edge of the bed get on with it she ordered her self and she forced her feet down to meet the floor and stood she took one slow step toward the door and then another suddenly she stopped there was a noise like footsteps almost inhumanly still she stood holding her breath because she knew that even moving so much as to exhale would unravel her the footsteps stopped right in front of her door and ginny shut her eyes tightly willing the thing to go away an eternity passed and when it was over the footsteps resumed growing more distant as they moved away once she could hear nothing she hazarded a breath the blood pounded in her ears and her heart heaved in convulsed sporadic beats there nothing out there ginny she said aloud there never was you imagined it and she knew she had imagined it the burrow was very old and host to all the creaks and twangs of an old house she had probably just heard the wind knocking at the shutters or the dishes downstairs settling in the sink or any number of other things even so it was another ten minutes before she could force herself to move all courage abandoned she planned only to return to her bed she wouldntsleep but there at least she would feel safe she turned hesitantly around and took a cautious step toward the bed she could still feel her heart pounding only now the feeling was painful as if each time it expanded it beat against her chest fighting to break it way through her ribs she gasped in pain as the feeling suddenly became hot instinctively she threw her hand to her breast and then only then did she realize the source of her pain was not her own beating heart but the necklace it had been dormant for so long she had almost forgotten it presence expect in a vague formless kind of way it frequently grew warm especially at night but that too had blurred into normality and she d almost forgotten this as well but this this was a new pain on a level even higher than that she had felt the day draco had called her to the restaurant she focused on this new pain not resisting letting it drive her through the door and into the darkness that lay beyond an invisible hook dug itself deeply into her chest pulling at her tugging her down the stairs she allowed herself to be towed through the living room and to the kitchen where she could see had been illuminated the hook pulled her into the door and the vanished and the pain was immediately swept away as if it had not been there at all and there stoop draco malfoy clad in silk pajamas and holding two mugs hot chocolate he offered er not entirely too fond of this chapter because harry really emo and kinda random and er yeah but still there were a few important bits thrown in throughout this chapter that i couldntwork in any other way so forgive me my emoness and besides that this is really the second chapter in a row with basically no draco ginny interaction at all but again i needed it to lead into the next chapter which will be incredible fun to write and that all the information you ll get from me i do however really love the dream i wrote it in like the dead of night and kinda freaked myself out a lot as always thanks soooooooo much to everyone who reviewed last chapter and a special thanks to my armodillo friends who sit on thrones in my head eat pie and make snarky comments deathly pale hand bursts through the dirt mawhahaha i ve returned from the dead and here you thought you d gotten rid of me for good alas my dear friends that is not the case swim team is finally over and i ll be getting home a whole three hours earlier so hopefully no more freakishly long hiatuses between chappies er is that the plural of hiatus does hiatus even have a plural did adam and eve have belly buttons these are the questions that keep me awake at night i really would have gotten this chapter out more quickly even despite swimming except that i just couldntbe happy with it i ve like nine versions of this and i still not entirely happy with it but oh well thanks you all for your patience and reviews reviews are yummy disclaimer i own nothing except a collector eddition of a gumby and pokey lunch box no you may not have it then she did the last thing he would have expected her to do with a look of set determination she put her small hands on his chest and kissed him such was his surprise that he only vaguely noticed when the two mugs he d been holding crashed to the ground before he had even begun to comprehend what was happening she had moved away and was wiping her mouth with the sleeve of her flannel nightshirt what do you thing you re doing are you out of bloody mind evening the score what he blinked what see i ve been thinking it over malfoy and you re not that nice to anyone you have to have some reason for trying to get in my good graces you re trying to trick me or blackmail me or blackmail you he choked out caught between absolute surprise and amusement and now you can t she added with a note of triumph pretending she hadntheard him i took away your advantage ginny was the picture of righteous anger her chin held high and defiant her chest heaving draco stared for a long time studying her and tried for to follow the logic she had used to arrive at this insanely absurd conclusion well if that the way you figure i believe i kissed you twice he finally said allowing the trace of a smirk onto his face dontyou dare try to be funny right now dontyou dare she hissed furiously well honestly since the conversation had been so serious up until now he snapped you thought i was going to blackmail you that the most irrational thing i ve ever heard in my life i mean how does that even make sense she slapped him have you gone bloody mad he demanded one hand nursing his stinging cheek that hurt you know what else hurts your ruddy necklace dragging me down here in the middle of the night she half screamed it and with one hand she had grasped its chain and was waving it about wildly in front of her it hurts he asked with the kind of casual interest you might use when inquiring about the weather yes it hurts she hissed have you even been on the rack no well me neither however any curiosity i might have had yeah gone i think i can pretty well imagine it now thanks well guess what i think hurts you ignoring me for a week he said sounding irritated are you serious she demanded are you seriously comparing my pain to being ignored for a few days yes he answered defensively and did it cause you severe physical harm well no he admitted grudgingly running a hand through his hair but it was incredibly annoying well i sorry i ve been such an inconvenience she cried this wasntgoing as well as he might have hoped or rather it was going exactly as he might have expected which was precisely why it was so horrible she turned to leave and draco saw this was his last chance he caught her hand would you stop that why did you kiss me malfoy she half yelled other than my evil plot to blackmail you you mean he smirked then sobering slightly and smiling he added merlin weasley do i have to spell it out for you i lik but he didntget a chance to finish are you going to date me she asked sharply what he asked and again was shocked you dontget to kiss me unless you are going to date me and for a moment the absurdity of it was so great he wanted to scream you dontknow anything he almost yelled but in that moment she was cold and hard and looking at her then he knew she did she understood exactly what she was doing she was very consciously asking him to give up everything his father would disown him if not worse and no slytherin would dare openly cross a malfoy even a disgraced one but it would be an uphill battle of subtly cutting remarks and undermining a slow war of attrition to be fought on his territory that she thought she was in any position to demand anything of him was ridiculous infuriating or that she would even think to do it to order him to give up what he cared for was so unlike her but at the same time it was a very slytherin thing of her to do and he found himself grudgingly respecting her for it i dontknow ginny he said assuming what he hoped was a pained expression he shook his head and ran a hand through his platinum locks this too wasnttrue he knew he would never date her there was simply too much at stake to throw it all away for a silly gryffindor bint but he couldntjust say no and lose any remnant of a chance he had at her and he wouldntjust flat out lie to her so he said i would have to risk a lot if i were to date you oh i couldntdate you she said simply as if she had said something so obvious that even the most remedial first yeah should have figured it out what he demanded and was sure for an instant he would be unable to keep himself from throttling her i couldnt date you i donteven know you she exclaimed for a moment he could do nothing but silently gnash his teeth together then get to know me he finally ground out and at once the anger in her expression melted away and was replaced by pure shock what get to know me he said very slowly she asked how every inch of her incredulous ask me anything what fine he said shrugging it was just a suggestion if you dontwant to no she nearly yelled no it just just ask you just like that or we could play a drinking game i think you ve done enough of that already actually she said sharply but he could see she was no longer angry with him she probably would be later but for now it was forgotten in favor of her curiosity thinking she sunk to the floor and began gathering the shattered pieces of the glasses he had dropped i really did want that hot chocolate he said reproachfully and she didntrespond best case scenario really then after a pause he added stop that you ll cut yourself but if i dontpick it up they ll wonder who did it she said crossly in a tone that went on to suggest that the task would be much easier were he to help you have twelve brothers blame one of them he said and brushed past her and disappeared through the door malfoy she called exasperated but there was no response with a frustrated moan she stood wiped her hands up and followed i have six brothers actually well that kind of irrelevant isntit he asked casually no she coldly replied she sat opposite him looking distant it was obvious she was considering his proposal which was not what he wanted at all nothing good could come of her over thinking this for just a moment he was aware of what absurd lengths he was going to to make this girl like him but then again he reminded himself malfoy never lose it not as though anyone could tell them apart anyway your parents really only needed one after that the rest just redundant he was very conscious of the line he was trodding all over he gulped and with one great vindictive step he crossed it and i use the word need very loosely besides it not as if they could afford it oh right malfoy like you have any room to talk because your family is so perfect she snarled with a viciousness he d never heard her use before why dontyou tell me about that if you re so keen on sharing he almost smiled this was what he needed all he had to do now was make up a few lines make her think he d had such a poor deprived childhood and he d be home free she d want to help to fix him my family is perfect he said flawlessly imitating a tone of haughty defensiveness my father is the most respected man in the wizarding world and mother is wonderful who do you think sends me all those sweets when i at school and the constant letters embarrassing really but i think she always wanted more children she gets lonely i d imagine all alone in the manner with father always away on business he was balancing on a very thin line she had by now absorbed that he couldntstand lucius and if he played it up too much she would realize he was lying however ginny was soft and what she really needed wanted to hear was that he was really a sweet upstanding kind of bloke who d simply not been hugged enough it was easiest that way he was always away when i was young he was very involved though he kept in constant communication with snape to make sure i was keeping up on my school work and running with the right crowd he had let a touch of bitterness lace his voice and he paused now for dramatic effect i really hated granger then you wouldntbelieve the crap my father gave me about a mudblood being ahead of me in classes he saw her cringe slightly and suddenly he too was on edge that was just a bit too close to the truth for his liking he paused not quite sure how to continue tell me more about you re mother she ordered surprising him she very pretty of course clever as well she was head girl when she was at hogwarts she noted with surprise the pride in his tone she actually younger than my father snape age how d they meet then at a party or function i suppose they got married very quickly mother parents were thrilled with the match he said casually quite a few blacks have married muggles through the years i think they would have married her off to hagrid if he were a pure blood ginny frowned but didntsay anything tell me about you re family me ginny asked surprised draco smirked communication is a two way road ginny darling what do you want to know she asked raising one eyebrow suspiciously tell me about you re brothers do you get along most of the time we bicker quite a bit but mostly that just to drive mum mad and it impossible to do anything just by your own anyway you turn there another one but they take care of me it nice i always wanted a brother he said really she asked she wouldnthave thought that at all there too much pressure being an only child you have to live up to all the expectations of both parents at least with brothers there someone to help bear the burden yes but you donthave anyone to be compared to she answered by the time i was even born bill had graduated head boy and charlie was the best seeker hogwarts had seen in years and the twins get in trouble sure but they still had great marks in school and their business is doing excellent everyone expects something great of me i d still trade with you any road he said then frowned and revised well not you specifically because honestly i cantstand you re brothers she frowned back at him i do seem to recall you saying something about having so many children being unseemly i never said that he objected no that was me paraphrasing i believe you re actual words were i know weasels are known for having large litters but at least nature kills some of those off ahh yes back when i was young and an absolute wanker ginny supplied well i was going to say and didntunderstand how meaningful understating can be when it comes to the subtle art of sarcasm but as you re answer is less likely to get me hit we ll go with that yes an absolute wanker he tried to gauge her reaction but couldnttell whether she was amused or not and what about you would you trade no ginny said confidently i thought not he agreed malfoy she said after a moment of silence that day we met at the restaurant you said that you were being followed yes he said i remember who was following you crabbe and goyle i think i dontreally recall frustrated she was about to tell him that wasntwhat she meant when something occurred to her senior crabbe and goyle senior he nodded why why would they be following you see if there one thing the dark lord got it a healthy sense of paranoia death eater children have been fed you know who secrets since the cradle nothing important you understand just enough propaganda to win them over but it enough that he nervous he just suddenly realized there a good possibility one of them will turn coats so he has you followed not regularly not at school just around sometimes to make sure we re not joining up the wrong sort of people he said and grinned me ginny said sounding pleased he nodded i just glad they didntrecognize you she gave him a questioning look trust me i d have heard about it by now if they had i willing to bet they werenteven looking for me that day they were probably checking up on sylvia she a death eater then ginny said not particularly caring that she sounded harsh no draco answered firmly what is she to you she really couldntkeep the question from escaping her lips something like my second cousin several times removed ginny glared that not exactly what i meant what did you mean then you have two pictures by your bed one of your mother and one of her there has to be a reason her and blaise he corrected did you date her yes he answered for a while his tone made it very clear he was through discussing that particular topic she wanted to ask more but she had so many other questions and she knew if she pushed now he d not say anymore instead she switched tactics tell me about snape she commanded what about him you two seem she struggled for the right word close draco smiled he my godfather actually he and my mother went to school together they were good friends really ginny asked shocked it seemed so oddly human i cantpicture snape as a boy in fact i really cantpicture him anywhere but school and seeing him here is incredibly unnerving i donteven think snape can picture himself anywhere else i stayed with him this summer and every morning he woke up with this kind of dazed look like he couldntquite figure out where he was or what he was doing there you stayed at his house she sounded appalled nodding draco said he was teaching me potions that how i ended up in magical healing he thought it would be good extra practice you ve no interest in healing then i wouldntsay that it very useful to know but i d not make a career of it which she should have known because really draco malfoy as a healer not only would he be required to be nice to people he d be expected to handle various bodily fluids she almost laughed at the thought and you he asked you re going to be a healer ginny nodded that the plan anyways then quite against her will she did something horrible she yawned draco looked at his wristwatch expensive gold and new it late you should go to bed no she said firmly yes he said equally firm not until i through she stated bluntly arms crossed if she went to bed now she d never get the rest of her questions answered slyly draco slipped his hand in his pocket and grasped the ring ow ginny cried grabbing the necklace around her neck now that not fair he smirked life rarely is then he grew more serious and had she not known any better she would have said his tone was almost one of concern as he asked does that really hurt not that really the other thing the pull y thing does but that still doesntchange the fact that i not going upstairs how about this if you go sleep now i promise you twenty more answers twenty he nodded about anything he seemed to consider this for a moment and then shrugging said within reason and all i have to do is be a good little girl now and go to bed she said skeptically and answer twenty of my questions en eye for an eye love she stuck out her hand dontdare shake unless you mean it he grinned white teeth shining in the dim light and took her hand hesitantly she smiled back and allowed him to help pull her off the couch she followed him quietly up the stairs he stopped in front of her door good night weasley good night malfoy twenty questions remember wouldntdream of forgetting he waited outside a moment until the light under the door vanished and then with a yawn went upstairs ginny didntthink she d be able to sleep but she did and when she woke the next morning she felt much more relaxed than she had the whole past week for a moment she simply lied there enjoying the morning it was bright and clear and the sunlight streaming through her window promised a pretty day the house was warm and smelled of cinnamon it was a nice day to sleep in slowly she got out of bed not bothering to change out of her pajamas and went downstairs draco wasntthere she sat down amidst the clamor of breakfast and ate quickly really she thought with a sinking heart she should have known as much he was a malfoy after all he would obviously find some way to wriggle out of their agreement no doubt he d say her questions were unreasonable or maybe just talk around them possibly he d ignore her all together cursing herself for being so na ve ginny finished eating quickly and with much undeserved hostility toward her eggs and stood where are you headed off to in such a hurry no where mum dontyou dare go wake him up mrs weasley warned looking up from her dish washing she was waving a sponge threatening in ginny direction who you know very well who if our guest wants to sleep in i certainly wonthave you up there disturbing him but mum i i mean it ginny yes ma am she said defeated ginny retreated to her bedroom and sat curled up the bed entirely ready to pounce upon him the first moment she heard any noise from upstairs there was a knock at her door and for a moment her heart skipped a beat then ginny it was hermione come in she called hey gin do you mind if we talk sure ginny said feeling vaguely guilty she hadntbeen spending more time with hermione because of all the extra bodies her parent had bought a temporary enlargement charm which created rooms to accommodate their guests they d never bought one before they cost more than an entire set of school books but with so many people crammed into one space there d have been no amount of sharing that would have allowed them all to fit it was the first holiday in years ginny had had a room to herself hermione looking distracted took a seat on the bed next to ginny for a long time she didntsay anything ginny who was despite her best efforts having a difficult time focusing on the older gryffindor returned to listening for malfoy so how have you and ron been doing ginny asked politely when she could no longer stand the silence she thought she heard a door open upstairs ron and you hermione corrected absentmindedly twirling a bit of hair around her finger then realizing she hadntanswered the question added fine so ginny said there werentany footsteps coming down the stairs but she was sure the creak had come from the upstairs bedroom he told me he loved me hermione said suddenly for a moment the thought didntregister then after only a moment hesitation the redhead forgot about the door and beamed at the girl sitting next to her that great hermione he actually sort of yelled it at me we were fighting and what did you say hermione remained suspiciously silent she looked up at ginny and bit her lip oh no hermione what did you say well i didntsay anything oh merlin hermione you didntsay anything you just stood there hermione nodded i feel awful poor ron looked crushed but i didntknow what to say i how about i dontknow gee thanks ron i love you too but you cantjust say it ginny you have to mean it hermione have you gone spare you ve loved ron since third year maybe even before it not that easy you dontjust fall in love with a person it takes time and commitment i dontwant to be that type of girl the one who falls in love with every other boy she meets it been four years coming i doubt anyone going to accuse you of being flighty but what if something happens and it doesntwork out saying you love a person isntsomething you can just take back when i tell someone i love them i want to know it true i certainly care about ron but i haventeven considered loving him i haventmade a thought about any of the repercussions why i haventeven made a pro and con list i just not ready you cant analyze it hermione do you love him hermione hesitated and bit her lip yes then tell him the older girl beamed and nodded i will thank you ginny there was one other thing yes she paused as if she were groping for the right words are you and malfoy i mean to say do you like him no not particularly ginny said sourly oh well it just seemed like you two i dontknow maybe you were friends well we re not ginny insisted stiffly but then her face furrowed i dontknow she admitted sometimes he just malfoy and i could kill him and then he does something and it like he two completely different people admittedly i terribly fond of either one of them right now be careful ginny people like malfoy they dontjust change overnight i know that ginny snapped i sick of everyone telling me that i am careful poor ginny she so fragile watch out for ginny she doesntknow what good for her well i fine thank you and i dontneed you or harry or even malfoy for that matter telling me to be careful hermione looked affronted well yes i know i just meant no hermione ginny said running a hand through her hair tiredly her good mood from that morning had completely dissolved i sorry that was out of line i didntsleep very well last night is all hermione still looked unsure really everything okay and i sorry hesitantly the older girl smiled okay gin i ll see you later hermione stood and started out stopped at the door and turned as if she were going to say something and then thought better of it she opened the door only to find malfoy was standing on the other side he looked around her to where ginny was seated on the bed hey he said casually ginny silently glared bye ginny hermione said and threw a threatening look in draco direction before brushing past him and into the hall the little weasley looked up at him wordlessly she was so incredible readable her entire face revealed her internal struggle as she tried to decide how to respond draco smirked i believe you owe me twenty questions whoot 37 chapters down 27 to go er just kidding really this story will end eventually no really it will stop looking at me like that it will anyway you brave souls who ve stuck with me this long thanks for your dedication it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside and guess what else makes me feel all warm and fuzzy reviews bats eyelashes while shamelessly pandering for reviews besides i write faster when people review kinda a short chapter but i felt bad for not updating in so long sorry anyway my school is on a four by four schedule which means that i finish half my classes before christmas break and finish the second half before summer break so i ve been working on projects studying for finals the past few weeks luckily that also means that the next few weeks will be really easy and i ll hopefully be able to write a lot more disclaimer every charecter setting plot you recognize belongs to j k rowling and warmer bros and not me ginny face was an almost comical mixture of surprise and relief as he entered but she recovered quickly i didntexpect to be seeing you she said coolly a malfoy never breaks a promise love he said in a tone of mock offense she stared at him or wait he amended maybe it a malfoy never breaks a nail yes ginny said a bit distractedly that does sound a bit closer i quite sure that what it is so what it we say about promises then probably something along the lines of a good way to get the ministry in your pocket and girls in you pants he opened his mouth to retort and then shrugged no actually that sounds about right he turned and closed the door locking it behind him and then pulled a chair up next to her bed so he could face her ginny looked horrified at the door unlock it and have your brothers find me in here he asked shaking his head right and it will be so much better when they find you in here with the door locked she muttered but he heard her and grinned ginny was suddenly feeling very anxious you know you really are quite good at being mad draco said and he had not only managed to make it sound as though it were a compliment but also to make her feel as though any response besides modesty would be rude well not really you just make it very easy she said very humbly and cursed the words as she said them he grinned and then suddenly the previous night dream came rushing back to her are you still mad he asked grinning playfully at her she didntreply it wasntthat she didnthave the words it was that everything felt so very immaterial so very unreal that she wasntquite sure she was even there she tried to talk but the words fell uselessly on her lips before they ever made a noise she shook her head and was surprised that the gesture had even worked she seemed to be floating aimlessly once or twice she moved to grab something and anchor herself but it would slip through her fingers like smoke as always i just glad i could assist you draco said grinning ginny made a noise it wasntquite a gurgle and it was less articulate than a gasp she wasntentirely what the sound had set out to be but certainly it had lost its way somewhere in her throat so draco said slowly studying her shall i start or will you ginny made another noise this one however seemed a bit more certain of itself and came out as something rather resembling a noncommittal hmmm he touched her arm and for a moment she couldntdo anything but stare at it because it was so solid he sat down pulled her down with him she landed awkwardly in his lap and knew she was blushing but he smiled at her inelegance very very gently as if her were afraid his lightest touch would break her he turned and let her fall against the ground and put one thin arm around her so that he was cradling her against his chest in the back of her mind something was telling her this was not normal but he was still so very real and nothing else was she couldntleave his solidity everything else was so confusing are you okay draco asked leaning forward he raised one eyebrow and her heart raced stop it right now ginny ordered herself her heart was fluttering wildly in her chest she hadntlet herself get this worked up about a boy she liked since third year and she didnteven like draco malfoy very successfully she felt she managed a nod he was looking down at her and she let herself examine him carefully unabashed his chin was pointed but that suited him the long thin planes of his checks were perfect pale and smooth and almost translucent she wondered vaguely if he d ever even needed to shave and then almost timidly she met his eyes wonderful eyes slanted eyes she realized and not nearly so narrow as she had imaged and they were gray but the word gray alone could never give justice to the eyes in front of her and he was looking at her there was a beautiful unnamable emotion churning in his eyes and she knew that it was there solely and explicitly for her ginny he said and that same emotion enveloped every syllable one slender hand brushed against her face stroked her cheek paused over her lips he turned abruptly and now instead of beside her he was poised over her and very slowly never taking his eyes from hers he leaned down and kissed her pleasant tingles ran down her spine he was warm and solid and smelled wonderful when he pulled away he was breathing heavily and still staring down at her before she had caught her breath his lips met hers again and when he wasntkissing her he was saying her name ginny ginny ginny each time he said it the word tumbled from his lips like music he savored it as if the very taste of it was sweet she liked the sound of it she made a happy little noise which made him laugh and she liked the sound of that too ginny turned slightly so that her back was curled up flush against him are you happy he asked propped up on one elbow running the other hand through her hair she nodded looking over her shoulder at him good he said and she could see her was very clearly smug i knew you couldntstay mad at me forever very lightly he kissed her shoulder and then a smirk playing on his lips she woke up that was all a dream had her this worked up it was ridiculous she was just lucky she d woken up when she had if she was this absurd now she couldntimagine how she d be reacting if they d gone any farther than kissing she d kissed boys before and remained perfectly capable of forming whole sentences and here she hadnteven actually kissed him and she could barely form a single word well she had but once he had been drunk and once he had been trying to bail himself out so neither of those she felt really counted and now he was still smirking at her she was probably blushing she realized feeling incredibly foolish and rightfully so she reminded herself there was absolutely no reason she should be this flustered yeah i fine she said but realized afterwards she d probably already exceeded the acceptable response time right i getting that he said and she wanted to smack the grin off his face should we maybe do this another time no she said forcefully it was some strange fluke that he was there at all if she delayed any longer the universe would rebalance itself no you promised you arentferreting you re way out of this first of all please choose a different verb ferreting is degrading and i not even entirely sure you used it correctly secondly if i were planning on weaseling out of it i wouldnthave come looking for you now would i ginny had to admit that was true but still it was entirely possible this was some sort of cunning plot plot to do what she wasntentirely sure but this scenario made no sense unless he had something diabolical planned i still donttrust you draco malfoy she informed him tartly he leaned forward conspiratorially good i not a very trustworthy bloke ginny frowned at him you sound so proud well if there one thing i pride myself on it my honesty she snorted one thing you are the single most proud person i ve ever met he laughed you re not exactly a doormat yourself weasley why do you still call me weasley she asked suddenly reddening that accursed dream had resurfaced he raised an eyebrow and didntrespond oh come on you can consider it my first question she prompted why dontyou call me draco he fired back well i dontgo about calling you by you re last name all the time she retorted no you simply avoid calling me anything what would you prefer i do she snapped feeling foolish i was perfectly happy with the previous arrangement well i wasn t ginny said stubbornly well i donthave any more of an answer for you you dontuse my first name and i dontuse yours so if i started calling you draco you won t he said confidently i ve called you draco before she protested only when you were feeling particularly guilty can we please move on he said dryly what about augh augh augh he said waggling a finger at her my turn i didntsay i was through you are incredibly stubborn i am ginny agreed good thing i am too draco said challenging her ginny backed down fine then she said you re turn why d you ask about sylvia last night what last night you asked if i d dated her why curiosity she offered shifting uncomfortably really he said smirking anything else yes actually ginny said i there something strange about her i dontknow her do i for a moment his eyes darkened and he looked vaguely disturbed but then the look vanished and he haughtily replied i doubt it what exactly did you mean by that she demanded you donttravel in the same circles he said confidently and then added she not as nice as blaise i can believe that she said thinking back to the girl at the restaurant there was a pause while she thought but it was the kind of thinking that a moment later you couldntremember draco cocked his head to the side and studied her while she thought she didntnotice him for a moment and then blushed when she did remembering her dream again what are you thinking about he asked i thought it was my turn i wasntmaking an official inquiry i was just curious why is blaise so nice that not about me he said miffed well not everything is i ve tried telling you before i just sorry you had to find out like this you re tetchy today did i keep poor ickle weasley out too late last night i didntsleep very well she said mostly honestly he seemed strangely amused by that oh too bad he said in mock pity you didntanswer my question she said not to be distracted blaise mum wasnta death eater i dontactually know if any of them were but they certainly werentagainst the dark lord but she put up with all sorts of muggles and blood traitors did found them fascinating and her parents hated it blasted her off the family tree then only a few years later she got bloody filthy rich modeling and her parents quite suddenly forgave her what a loving and dedicated family she said sarcastically but still that explains a lot i didnttell my father i was friends with him until the end of fourth year if i had i sure he d have told me i couldntbe friends with blood traitors why do you hate him ginny asked curiously draco didntsay anything if agreed he d be betraying his father and if he didnthe d be lying ginny was looking hard at him for the first fifteen years of your life you worshipped the man and now you cringe every time you talk about him what changed and donttry to sell me any crap this time i just realized he didntknow quite as much as i thought he did which was an understatement really he longed to curse lucius with every word he knew ginny stared at him demanding a better answer with her silence i dontthink i ever actually listened to what he said i just trusted it because he was my father and then suddenly i started paying attention and i realized how mad it all was the dark lord will fail and when he does he ll take all his followers down with him he d never been more honest with her and if it werentfor the fact that he d been dying to say those very words out loud for the past year he never would have said it he was afraid she d ruin it by saying something stupid but she said nothing she just sat waiting as if she knew there were more and he told her because now that he d started he couldntstop all of them are blind for not seeing it fools the dark lord isnteven a man anymore he an ancient crumbling mad fragment it the madness that kept him alive all this time but the old fool doesntsee it oh he slippery old lucius but when the dark lord falls really falls there no way he ll slither out of that he d have been in azkaban ages ago if the ministry wasntin his pocket you shouldntcall him that ginny said lucius not lucius you know who you shouldntcall him the dark lord only death eaters do that and you re not a death eater are you no and you dontwant to be a death eater so then dontcall him that call him you know who or he who must not be named or call him voldemort just dontcall him that she ordered vehemently she was surprised be her own reaction and it was obvious so was he he was looking at her with an emotion she couldntplace and she wanted to know what he was thinking ron i dontthink ginny in there i swear i saw her go outside earlier hermione voice carried loudly over the silence ginny motioned at draco to be quiet and turned taking a step towards the door straining her ears she heard one pair of heavy footsteps clomping up the stairs then she heard what was probably was her brother response but it was too muffled to make out hide she ordered draco frantically but he was already on the ground pulling himself underneath her bed i telling you ron i dontthink she in there came hermione voice again but now that they were closer ginny could tell that the older girl must have been very nearly yelling there were two other pairs of footsteps almost drowned out by hermione stomping i thought i heard her talking ron said right outside her room now he rapped loudly on the door gin can i come in hold on i changing ginny called watching as with one final squirm draco pulled his legs under the bed she quickly checked to make sure he couldntbe seen satisfied she quickly unlocked the door hey ron you need something she asked pleasantly we re going out for a bit could you cover for us he asked where are you going ginny asked the three looked at each other but no one answered fine fine i dontcare is anyone from the order on guard lupin and sirius are both here but neither one of them will miss us too much harry said it really mum we re worried about ron said she been absolutely barmy the past few days yeah i ll take care of it ginny said eager to get the three to leave any moment now she could just see draco crawling out from under the bed smirking and making some sort of snarky comment thanks ginny ron said just be careful ginny warned whatever they were planning probably wasnta good idea if it required her covering for them but hermione was going along and didntlook too concerned except for the fact that she kept looking over ginny shoulder she was too no doubt expecting malfoy to pop out any second and as long as hermione was okay with whatever was happening ginny was okay too yeah yeah we will ron called already heading down the stairs i ll be right down hermione called at the retreating figures of harry and ron where is he hermione whispered when they were gone under the bed ginny answered turning her head to look draco stuck a hand out and waved thanks for the warning hermione nodded i talked to ron everything okay that great hermione tell me everything later okay hermione shot one last concerned looked towards the bed and then vanished down the stairs by the time she turned back to face him draco had already crawled out and was brushing himself off looks as if someone had a bit of practice at that she commented looking vaguely surprised draco grinned so i d better be going i ve got to make sure mum keeping busy for a while ginny said and he shrugged but hey dontthink we re through we had a deal and i fully intend to enforce it as soon as i get back hmm enforce it i like the sound of that he said smirking and you should really clean under your bed you ve got like nine bras down there ginny blushed just get out severus snape sat confused which was not a usual state for him he d been pouring over the latest batch of letters and was now both thoroughly bemused and slightly disgusted the little weasley girl indeed seemed a bit less foolish than the rest of her brood and certainly not so hotheaded as potter friend nor did she share the galling arrogance of the boy who lived she was competent without being overbearing and officious like granger and even he would admit that she had a head for potions and while he did have a grudging respect for her she was not by any means likable and in fact barely even tolerable draco however seemed to be taking some sort of interest in her which explained why snape was sitting in his living room yet again poring over the letters looking for something he was missing what he really wanted to know was how draco had gotten the girl to agree to let him come to her house in the first place that the malfoys and the weasleys hated each other was something snape knew just as well as anyone and though draco had never seemed any more offensive to her than he d been to all her brothers the littlest weasley had always seemed particularly impassioned in her animosity her dislike of the malfoys was outweighed only by that of her idiotic brother s but she had for some reason agreed snape was inclined to believe that reason wasntentirely legal he d found out a week or so after his meeting with narcissa at hogsmeade well over a month ago where draco intended to stay and when he d first read the letter he d thought it was a joke but the boy had sent at least two other owls to his mother trying to come up with conceivable excuses they could give to lucius as to why he wouldntbe coming home for christmas when he realized that the boy was serious severus had racked his brain trying to come up with another option but slowly the idea had warmed on him after all with the ridiculous scheme to have the order stationed at the weasley house for the holiday draco would be fuller protected besides it meant that he himself would be able to keep a close watch on the boy really it was almost ideal but still snape couldnthelp but wonder what draco had done to get the girl to agree sighing because he was no closer now to an answer than he had been months ago when he d first pondered the question snape took out his quill and parchment imator he told the quill causally and at his command the thing jumped to life hovering patiently over the paper as he began to dictate the quill scrawled his words across the paper in draco elegant script within moments he had a short entirely weasley free letter in draco hand addressed to narcissa assuring her he was safe and comfortable so yeah like i said short chappie thank you guys so much for all of your wonderful reviews especially your criticisms i obsessive about checking my email it kinda sad actually p s jk announce the new title of the new book it harry potter and the deathly hollows i hugged the reserve your copy now sign in the middle of books a million people stared first of all i soooooooooooo sorry it took so long for the update i really thought i d have this done all the way back at thanksgiving but that just didnthappen i know i a horrible to those of you who e mailed me and told me to update soon cat it so nice to see that people are actually enjoying it yes i know i a sentimental old fool disclaimer i own nothing you recognize from the books no money is being made from this or any exploitation of the characters or plots belonging to j k rowling so please dontsue me because i have no money p s i couldntget the default line thing to work so anywhere you see an a with a bunch of exclamtion points it means the scene is changing a draco walked into the common room and slowly eased himself into one of the soft black couches he couldntimagine where blaise could be what good was it to be fashionably late if the other person didnthave the common courtesy to be on time hey draco blaise said walking into the common room as if on cue you re late i sorry i was just finishing up some homework he said gesturing to an essay he had set down on the table in front of them draco took it and began to read the properties of the iris petal as a key component in many healing potions are not amazing in themselves it is the vastness of its uses that are truly phenomenal the petal is used in every thing from concoctions to relieve headaches to restoring broken bones the exceptionally amazing property of the petal you got to be kidding me what it actually looks like you researched this so blaise said defensively grabbing back his parchment and affectionately smoothing it you mean to tell me you actually went to the library researched your topic and wrote a one thousand word essay in he paused and looked at his watch forty five minutes ginny helped what d you do to her anyhow she was pretty peeved weasley weasley helped you with your homework uncertainly he replied yes so you spent the last hour in the library doing homework with the weasel little sister well we didntjust do homework and dontlook at me like that we didntsnog we just talked you talked what could you possible have spent an hour talking about different things you know classes quidditch relationships wait are you saying you talked to weasley about girls well yeah she really relationships really blaise what next you gonna have a sleepover paint your toenails and share your feelings geez i dontknow why i put up with you because you know you secretly love me just like everybody else in the world yeah that it draco well it true so are you ever going to tell me what you did to ginny i dontknow what you re talking about he said innocently then standing he said so are we going or not blaise grabbed his broom and followed his companion out to the pitch a it had to be at least midnight she was going to kill snape for making her write this stupid essay and then maybe she d use his body to beat malfoy she smiled to herself there was always a bright side unfortunately it didntcontain the five more inches of information on memory charms she needed she drifted off to sleep with images of painful ways to torture malfoy dancing in her head a ouch ron shut up i sorry but this thing is too small for the two of us shhhhh huh ginny asked sitting up and rubbing her eyes sleepily who there suddenly two familiar heads materialized apparently levitating in midair oh good it only you gin her brother said the rest of his body emerging the remaining parts of harry appeared beside him at least they both had the decency to look shamefaced it was nearly 3 a m and they were just now returning from some midnight excursion that was almost certainly against the rules not to mention they had woken her up from her nap sorry for waking you what are you doing it 3 in the morning you know i donteven want to know and that why i love you so darn much ron said leaning over and kissing her on the cheek what are you doing out here harry inquired she groaned stupid potions essay due tomorrow and i still need another five inches sitting down and examining her essay ron asked you need some help i ve read all these stupid books twice and i still donthave enough that what you get for waiting until the night before it due to get it done arrrggg you re really starting to sound like hermione you know she said somewhat bitterly considering she had gotten the same lecture from hermione already at the same time harry coughed something that sounded suspiciously like whipped it really wasntfair to blame her for procrastinating she would have done it sooner except she had spent every afternoon that week in the infirmary and could she really be blamed she had to be there well at least three of the days she had to be there admittedly the other had been of her own accord but still she found it new and thrilling madame pomfrey had even allowed her to heal minor afflictions such as headaches and sprains by herself for more major problems she had been permitted to assist and observe the nurse on slow nights ginny busied herself with small tasks such as organizing the supple cabinet and re labeling the potions ingredients the only down side was that she had bear spending two of those nights with malfoy nights that had been silently endured on both parts she threw her hands up in exasperation thanks for the offer but i really just need more research harry grinned how about a trip to the library she looked doubtful it late the library is closed his grin widened as he held up the invisibility cloak the two boys had previously been wearing ginny ginny ginny have the twins taught you nothing rules are meant to be broken oh harry your cloak you dontmind no course not he replied handing her the glinting material of the cloak just so long as you dontget caught i won t i promise quickly she gathered her quill and parchment and shoved them into her knapsack she slipped under the cloak making sure no part of her was visible do you want to come along she asked peeking her head out in response ron yawned too tired good luck harry said and followed his friend sleepily up the stairs a she sneaked quietly up the steps careful to avoid the ones that creaked lumos she paused listening for any noise hearing none she gingerly slipped the cloak off and searched the shelves for an appropriate title once she found one she sat down at one of the deserted tables and unrolled her parchment trying to ignore how eerie the vacant library seemed in the dim lighting she glanced once again at her watch 3 15 before setting to work memory charm is the generic term for the many spells and potions used to modify a person memory she read from the old yellow pages of the book for a moment she considered just copying her report straight out of the huge volume it was so old surely no one would recognize it but then again knowing her luck snape probably had every potions book in existence memorized with a moan she continued reading the ancient book many times they are used to strip a person of only one memory but can successfully block weeks or even years worth of memories a recent patent of st mungo one mr gilderoy lockhart had twenty five years of his memory erased in a freak accident the strength of spell varies directly with the length of time needing to be erased the charm is weaker when applied to eradicate memories of greater lengths and therefore will not last as long as spells that span a lesser duration three basic types of memory charms are reverie incantations dazing charms and memory draughts reverie incantations are perhaps the most complex and rare the spell creates or replaces a memory with one that never actually occurred but appears completely authentic to the individual affected dazing charms are placed upon one a specific item as opposed to a person they also frequently act as a binding charm and disable the recipient from being able to discuss the given object the individual who comes into contact with the item in question often experiences confusion dizziness or suddenly remembers a pressing previous appointment in rare cases if the person continues to resist the spell it can lead to nausea and even loss of consciousness clutching the chain around her neck the redhead managed oh crap this is bad this is very very bad she lay asleep her red hair spilling in disarray over the books that lay open on the desk and her quill lay abandoned in a puddle of ink it was the sound of a door closing that woke her rubbing her eyes she sat up and attempted to smooth her hair ah heck she said realizing for the first time where she was the library and not just the library oh no in the restricted section ah heck she repeated grabbing her essay and quill along with the cloak she turned to leave it was the sight of the numerous books lying open upon the table that stopped her if she didntput them away madame pince would know someone had been there crap oh please dontcome in she begged quietly as she moved to replace them she threw them haphazardly on the shelves and prayed madame pince wouldntnotice slipping on the cloak she carefully opened the door enough that she could see out of it the librarian was checking the shelves on the opposite side of the library assured that the coast was clear she opened the door enough to slip her slim frame through it to her horror it creaked and she saw the older woman turn towards the noise ginny ran the rest of the way out of the library and into the hall she stopped to catch her breath only when she was sure it was safe well that was close leaning against the castle wall for support she quickly removed the cloak and threw it into her pack well well well what do we have here a familiar voice from behind her drawled of course of course of all the people to see me it had to be him i should ve seen this coming long night weasley she blanched realizing how horrible she probably looked with her day old robes wrinkled and her telltale red hair sticking up you know i really think i should take points from your house for your roaming around in an out of bounds area i not in an out of bounds area well i know that and you know that but i dontknow how keen professor snape would be to believe it shut up malfoy i hate you she spat vehemently i hate you more then i ve ever hated anyone in my life she watched in horror of what she had just said as his eyes darkened he smiled ahh you figured out my little secret did you that right and i going to tell dumbledore you cant tell dumbledore he said waving his hand in dismissal and rolling his eyes you canttell anyone i thought you d figure that out the first time you tried to tell that sniveling creevy kid about it as soon as you take this thing off i going to tell everyone all the more reason not to take it off then what good would it do you you d just lose your bargaining chip you really believe that all the necklace is good for no no love it has all kinds of fun tricks about it from somewhere in the distance she heard a door shut and footsteps approaching before she could reply he leaned forward close enough that the smell of his cologne drifted to her nose he whispered almost inaudibly remember our little secret and in a billow of black robes he was gone leaving ginny to fume and hope he was bluffing somehow she doubted he was a i gonna try to update again before christmas thanks to all my reviewers i love you guys please review it makes me happy i leave you with the words of the infamous al capone you get more with a kind word and a big gun then with just a kind word grins evilly while holding a gun to a draco plushy hehehehe hehehe i baaacccckkkk i know this

ya ll are awesone yes yes i know i southern yeah they fixed the line thingey it used to take me like an hour to post becausei couldntfigure it out i not technologically inclined disclaimer checks mirror darn nope still not j k rowling i onw nothing thoughi wishi did draco honey what wrong sod off parkinson the girl tossed her blond locks and allowed her lower lip to quaver slightly drake what wrong you ve been so moody lately i said sod off he said slamming his dormitory door in her face and in fury kicked it awww did wittle drakie poo have a bad day out now what your time of the month already blaise leave now if you value your life his dorm mate looked indignant but he got up and gathered his cloak nonetheless mumbling it my room too you know he smiled sweetly in reply not if i murder you in your sleep grumbling something along the lines of stuck up egotistical hair obsessed twit blaise closed the door narrowly missing the shoe draco hurled at him in a very un malfoy like display of rage he tore the sheets off his bed and threw them across the dorm pitched his lamp upon the floor and dumped the remaining contents of his trunk around the room felling satisfied with the degree of chaos he had provoked he dropped heavily down upon his now bare bed to fume what right did the weasley brat have to threaten him to say that she hated him she had never experienced hate experienced pain the way he had get control he ordered himself malfoys do not lose control dontget mad they get even malfoy another part of him spat like your father flashback it was the summer before his seventh year and draco couldntbe happier it was warm and bright outside promising to be a good day his father had already agreed to take him to knockturn alley and let him pick out anything he liked as a reward for becoming head boy he was approaching his father study when he heard the distinct high tones of his mother voice he paused and listened to what the two were discussing lucius it too soon he just a boy draco bristled he was not just a boy he seventeen a year older then i was draco felt assured by his father confidence too young for what he didntknow but if his father said he was ready he was his father was always right you fool he paused he had never heard his mother insult his father the two argued nearly constantly but she had never blatantly insulted him it irked him after all narcissa had been quiet and subservient all her life what right did she now have to insult her husband you idiot you ll kill him you ll kill our son curiosity got the best of him and he opened the door enough that he could peek through and see his parents as he did he saw his father hand strike narcissa cheek leaving a deep red mark across her pale face draco almost betrayed himself by crying out but caught himself just in time he had never seen him strike his mother before she had tears running down her face as she cried out i dontwant this for my son he not just your son he my heir and the dark lord wishes it screw the dark lord let him rot in she stopped abruptly and screeched in pain as he once again brought his hand sharply across her face you wretched impudent wench he could have heard you good i hope he did he can kill me and you for all i care just as long as he doesnthurt draco you poor misguided fool cruciatus his mother shrieked and from his hiding place he could see her fall to the floor she writhed in pain and as she did his father bent down lucius grabbed his wife shoulders and forced her flailing body into a sitting position you know this is hurting me more then it hurts you love buts it really just for your own good he said smiling indulgently as though he was scolding a naughty child his face then became hard dontcross me narcissa i wouldntwant to see you get hurt something went cold in draco as he watched his mother body go still he panicked for a moment before he saw her chest moving shallowly up and down his fear turned to rage as he watched his father examine narcissa battered form with cold impartial indifference lucius stood and turned to leave draco dashed behind a large marble statue as his father emerged from the door he had been hiding behind only a second before he waited there until the echo of his father footsteps on the stone floor had disappeared he ran into the room mother mother mother when she spoke her voice was a croak here darling she was lying on the floor panting heavily she had a bruise on her cheek that was much to dark to have been caused by being slapped she must have hit the desk while she fell she reached out and grabbed his hand fervently i love you draco i love you too mother his mother had loved him without restraint and though she hardly told him he always knew it draco you mustnt shhh rest mother he said pausing before pulling her head into his lap you always were better then him you must promise me you wontdo it do what mother mother but when he looked down at her he found she had already drifted off to sleep end flashback feeling a renewed wave of anger he clenched his fist the day was burned vividly in his mind a permanent reminder of the pain his mother had experienced it was the first time he had ever seen his father physically harm narcissa though from what his mother told him not the first time he had standing there seeing the serene smile his father had had upon casting the spell was the first time he had ever really seen his father for what he really was was he so uncaring that he could torture his wife without a second thought or was it just he was so used to torturing people he had had major qualms with the thought of leaving his mother alone with lucius for the school year it worried him with a slight twinge of uneasiness he realized he hadntheard from his mother in nearly two weeks the boy set about looking through the destruction that was his room for a piece of parchment once he had found a sheet he took out a quill and scribbled a quick note mother how are you doing well i hope i was just writing to see how things were back home things here are terribly boring as usual dumbledore has once again refused my petition to can mcgonagall and make snape deputy headmaster he the only fair teacher here i hope to see you soon with all my love your dearest son draco it was a pathetic letter really it hardly took up two lines on the parchment but he wanted to make sure she was okay he sighed slowly before standing up and trudging off to the owlrey what up gin here she said hurling her pack at him he pulled the invisibility cloak out of it are you just now getting back harry asked eyeing her with concern yes you might want to er wash up before class she resisted the urge to say duh after all it wasntharry fault she was having a horrible day thanks hey gin are you just getting back she rolled her eyes ron had never had great timing yes well you look like one of crookshanks fur balls she cringed thank you for that lovely imagery ron dontget all snippy i not the one who didntdo their potions essay ginny glowered ahh ron mate i think you should quite while you re ahead ron i really feel the need to hit something and if you dontwant it to be your face i would suggest you shut up i was only kidding look at me does it really look like i in a funny sort of mood right now err point taken she addressed harry i have to go get ready see ya later okay yeah see you gin she climbed the stairs up to her dorm and threw the door open she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror that hung on the wall her red hair was knotted and untidy her robes just as disheveled her face was flushed which only proved to make the ink satin on her cheek seem more distinct how had that gotten there she swore realizing malfoy had seen her like this he was the only person she had ever known who could make her so mad not even her brothers with their annoying and slightly life threatening antics had ever managed to get her so riled she grabbed at the necklace and futilely tried to remove it she sighed knowing it was no use and at the same time not wanting to surrender what your secret she wondered staring dejectedly at the placid surface of the stone she would find out if she had to spend every moment for the next year in the library yeah you managed to make it through yet another chapter as always feel free to reveiw or email me with any suggestion and or comments flames will be laughed at speaking of which thank you to queen thayet my knight in shining armor my gallent defender against the evil of the counter you are so wonderful happy christmas enjoy your holidays and eat lots of cake please review it makes me happy a n ok so i lied this one not longer sorry read it anyway and sorry about the dely like i said i ve been on vacation hope you guys had an awesome christmas holiday whatever umm mostly draco in this chapter and snape hehehe the plot thickens disclaimer nope sorry still dontown it professor severus snape could feel the painful aching in his arm permeating his entire body one of his headaches was coming on again he rubbed his temples in annoyance how had any of these kids get into advanced potions none of them had any aptitude for it well that wasntcompletely true all his slytherins did and unwillingly he admitted that the youngest weasley also seemed to have a talent for it while he hated to admit it he had a grudging respect for the girl he after all knew better then anyone the pain of being a servant to the dark lord felt like yet she handled herself with a certain grace behind her emerald eyes was a determination he rarely saw in his students anymore clearly she hadntlet the experience impair her she had found closure in a way he never had even while working for the order he felt the guilt the repercussions of what he had done even now the nightmares plagued him but still he wondered deep cuts may heal but they always left scars where were hers he hated to admit it but she didntannoy him nearly as much as she should have he sighed and turned his gaze to his prized student draco who met his eyes a moment before returning to his potion he smiled to himself draco who reminded him so of narcissa he may have inherited his father face but somewhere lurking just below the surface he could sense the true draco narcissa son dying to get out finally the bell rang pulling him out of his musings and the students filed out in a mad dash to reach their next class he walked into his office closing the door behind him and sunk heavily into a chair behind him the door opened and draco entered unabashed he walked to the professor private store closet and took out several bottles before returning to the classroom he followed the boy more in amusement then annoyance what are you doing the blond handed him a ladle filled with a thick purple potion drink he commanded in reply snape frowned down at the vile substance you ve been having one of you headaches again now drink he obliged and was thankful he had for the relief that flooded his throbbing head was cool and immediate he nodded his thanks opening a desk drawer and removing a jar fill with an amber liquid and a spoon he raised the spoon offering some to his pupil draco wrinkled his nose what is it his professor smiled something between a true smile and a smirk honey he explained that stuff tastes horrible draco couldnthelp but laugh even after getting to know the potions master sitting in the same room and having a conversation with the mad still seemed ludicrous declining the sweet sticky substance he shook his head another wave of pain caused snape to wince does it hurt draco asked a question the professor had heard many times that summer yet somehow it had changed taken on a new meaning there was something in his voice that had not been there before pity yes but that was not new there was more fear for him for even the boy himself the boy searched his eyes and finding the silent approval and understanding there he sought reached for the sleeve of the teacher robe slowly as if afraid of what he might find he took the material in his hands and began rolling the cuff further up his arm exposing the pale white of his sun deprived skin there dark and foreboding was the appeared the dark mark he touched it softly the pressure of his cold fingers there causing it to burn the older man skin draco he said softly drawing the boy attention though his eyes never left the mark you have to find a place to stay he looked up startled here he gestured around him at the castle of course here you fool the professor snapped though his words were not nearly as harsh as they could have been i mean for the holidays draco looked confused why not here boy can you not see the signs it coming they want you to join them this christmas if you do you ll never be able to escape you mustntgo home draco head whirled at the unexpected news the initiation so soon he knew his father had been thinking about it but hadntthey decided instead to wait until his summer apprenticeship with snape was over of course that had been the sole reason he had escaped the mark this summer his mother had convinced lucius to allow him to spend the last half of summer of his seventh year and the summer afterwards with the potions master to learn the art of brewing wasntthe initiation supposed to be postponed until then why not here he asked again think boy if lucius is desperate enough or stupid enough to rush the initiation it means something big is coming and i dontwant you anywhere near the walls of this school when it happens the school you re worried about the school we dontknow that but voldermort is no fool he will hit where it hurt dumbledore the hardest and if he does i dontwant you anywhere near it the boy looked up almost hopefully with you then he shook his head i must stay here besides my house will be the first place lucius looks he has never trusted me your father and if he gets on suspicion even an inkling anything is wrong and he didntneed to go on draco knew well the punishment a traitor would get if they found out snape was a spy he didnteven want to think about the possibility he straightened the look of childish expectancy gone from his face replaced with his usual mask of indifference fine i well taken care of snape pause you have a place more of a plan but dontworry draco this isntillegal is it this plan of yours he shrugged probably then smirked his usual smirk leaving the professor to wonder if he was kidding or not i a slight sound followed by a crash both men paused and looked toward the door where ginny weasley laid on the ground holy muffins she grumbled getting to her feet stopping immediately when she felt the two pairs of suspicious eyes upon her err sorry professor i malfoy was already upon her snatching at her wrists what did you hear weasley nothing then why were you eavesdropping outside the door eh just out for a nice stroll along the dungeons tell me what you heard he said forcibly cornering her against one of the desks i already told you i didnthear anything she said almost exasperatedly waving her hand in dismissal then in a tone that suggested boredom she added could you let go now this kind of hurts i warning you weasley tell me or so help you i ll mister malfoy the professor cut in sharply please release her she heard nothing but professor she you forget what house your little friend is in mister malfoy eavesdropping and lying are below a gryffindor his grip loosened slightly then what are you doing down here weaselette i left my wand and i ve come back to get it now kindly release me so i may do so malfoy you may get it and go then the professor said coolly she up to something the other insisted you re forgetting she a weasley you re giving her way too much credit the professor said sarcastically the girl rolled her eyes fine draco said throwing down her arms and leaving draco he said trying to stop the blond i taken care of he said not turning as he walked through the door the man eyes fell back on the girl in front of him well he snapped oh yes sorry she rushed to her desk and pulled her wand from it i always do that she said awkwardly and turned to leave weasley she met his eyes and there he thought he save a deep understanding though he could have just imagined it she gave a slight almost imperceptible nod an answer to his silent question she d heard everything she spoke softly looking him in the eyes her gaze showing none of the meekness her voice portrayed i heard nothing professor he nodded let keep it that way armadillos inside joke nevermind please please please review i ll love you forever i ll give you cookies hey guys heheh i broke the chain this chapter is long well longer hope you enjoy disclaimer i own nothing every thing here except the plot belongs to j k rowling need i say more ginny sighed as she mumbled the password to the portrait she was tired and nothing was going to feel better then a nice long nap in her own bed before she had to go down to the infirmary ginny here ginny here ron sung happily while jumping up and down someone had a little to much pepper up potion this morning she said would anyone care to tell me what going on we would if we could hermione said not looking up from her book he refused to tell us until you got here ron turned bright pink with happiness and looked as if he was about to burst when he finally spoke it was in an excited squeal weasley family christmas really he nodded as ginny grabbed his hand and began jumping up and down in sync with him apparently we re all supposed to jump around like idiots harry said happily as he too started dancing around the common room do you even know what they re talking about hermione asked glancing up for a second not a clue he said as he commenced to do cartwheels well someone please explain everyone staring at you by the way they stopped for people were indeed staring at them ginny looked unsure for a moment but i thought mum and dad had to stay at headquarters mum threw a fit and started crying and murmuring something about a midlife crisis she laughed picturing he mother throwing things around like a spoiled toddler they finally agreed is anyone else still confused harry asked hermione raised her hand harry we re going to the burrow for christmas exclaimed ron harry and hermione both brightened everyone gonna be there all your brothers even charlie percy hermione asked momentarily forgetting her book all together he nodded not looking very happy about the latter and my uncle dave family but not uncle arnold ginny asked looking slightly crestfallen ron shook his head he couldntmake it this time scowling harry said just what the world needs more weasleys in a manner so much resembling malfoy that the whole group burst out laughing earning more wary stares from their housemates what about guards hermione asked glancing worriedly in harry direction harry going to need protection hermione it true harry you may not realize it but we prefer you much better alive and we intent on keeping you that way mum got that all arranged too the whole order invited cept dung of course harry seemed to get over his annoyance when he heard this even snuffles ron nodded ginny with a few words of parting went upstairs for her nap feeling happier then she had in a long while so far it had been a slow night only one patient had come in complaining of a simple headache he had been given a concoction and sent on his way she was trying her best not to look at malfoy who was seated on a hospital cot so that he might glare more comfortably at her ginny looked around for something else to do she needed to keep her hands busy she had already organized the supply cabinet put new linens on the cots and brewed enough clear all acne removing cream to keep the infirmary stocked for a week defeated she finally sat down too as soon as she did malfoy stood and began pacing this is pointless there nothing to do then leave i dontcare if you fail this class or is that just what you want me to think malfoy you are so paranoid i may be paranoid but that doesntmead you re not out to get me get a life get some manners i donthave to i only talking to you after all better yet get a book of better comebacks that was just pathetic she stuck out her tongue oh that mature she didntreply instead she pulled out her herbology book and began on her homework draco snorted impatiently i didntthink it was possible but you ve just become slightly more boring it not my fault you didntthink to bring your homework with you do forgive me my thoughtlessness she returned to her work completely ignoring him resigned he sat back down reclined his head and closed his eyes try as she might ginny just wasntable to muster the same complete loathing of him as she had before this is what you get she scolded herself this is why you donteavesdrop you hear things you dontwant to here she glanced cautiously over her book to look at the blond he looked peaceful it was almost impossible to imagine that this angel was the same ferret that had tormented her the past six years his face showed no malice no sarcasm and it was unnerving yes weasley he said not opening his eyes i know i hot but could you please stop staring at me it irritating she blushed slightly mostly because it was true he had grown into his features over the past few years for a long time she had always thought he had looked slightly feminine with his angular features but his face had rounded out giving his countenance much more depth his features were still sharp but now there was nothing feminine about them or any other part of him for that matter you are the most debonair handsome charming man you ve ever laid your eyes on i was going to say the most arrogant self centered conceited prat i ve ever had the misfortune of meeting weasley you re a very negative person you know you should probably see someone about that just remind me not to go to whoever it is your seeing because he obviously not doing his job no i just a hopeless case he said proudly smiling why doesntthat surprise me see there you go again always with the insults no wonder you cantkeep a man she stiffened my personal life is no concern of yours that why it surprised me when blaise told me he went to you on advice on relationships he continued as though she hadntspoke i mean i knew he was desperate but to go to the girl who couldntever get a second glance from harry scarhead potter he must be worst off then i thought shut up shut up you great unbearable twit you hit a sore spot have i still pining over potter weasel he smirked dontthink i dontsee the way you are around him harry is like a brother to me and i wonthave you speaking poorly of him her small fists were clenched knuckles white all he had to do was push her a little more second choice you were always his second choice first there was cho and then only when he was desperate did he notice poor little ginny weasley there it was the same familiar spark of rage in her eyes how he loved seeing her anger and knowing he d caused it he gave her a smug smirk waiting for her reaction what she did shocked him she smiled i dontlike harry do you know why because he not the right one for me but eventually the right guy will come along and we ll get married and have lots of kids and live in a house in the country you on the other hand will always be sad and alone did you know that your face turns this really odd reddish color when you re angry he asked seemingly oblivious to her lecture arrgg you are the most insufferable git in the entire world well now that not really fair have you met everyone in the world see thank you for just proving my point trust me i didntdo it on purpose she shook her head this is pointless i leaving like i said feel free to fail this class look at the time moron it nine we re free to go he said and left without another word she sighed he made it hard for people to pity him she gathered her stuff and walked slowly back to the tower lost in thought she didnteven notice the other person in the corridor until she had knocked into him holy muffins on the floor surrounding her laid all her books and parchment darn oy ginny sorry about that are you okay asked seamus peering down at her concern evident in his face yeah seamus i fine what about you i not the one of the floor this is true she said smiling as he helped her sit up here let me help you with this he began gathering her schoolwork what are you doing out so late anyway i was at the infirmary just my luck that malfoy decided to show up tonight too harsh but it couldnthave gone too badly considering you re still in one piece well it certainly didntgo well either it malfoy what do you expect she laughed so what has you out he held up what remained of a muffin and a glass of butterbeer i just made a stop at the kitchen she laughed again arentyou lucky no one in gryffindor can keep a secret he nodded i ahh i actually glad to see you i have something to ask you he said blushing to the tips of his blond hair well you know a hogsmeade weekend is coming up and i was wondering if ifyouwannagowithme ahh sorry i didntquite catch that he turned an even deeper shade of red and took a deep breath i just wanted to know if you would like to go you know with me ginny imagined her face must be at least as red as his was i oh i um that really sweet of you seamus but if ron put you up to this are you kidding ron doesntknow anything about this if he did i doubt i d be in one piece her face brightened really then well sure i d love to go great i guess i ll see you there then well bye seamus we re going the same way he laughed nervously oh yeah that right hey thanks to all my reveiwers from the last chapter i love you all i ate a cookie in honor of all of you like always please review with comments or helpful critisim keyword here helpful love ya hehehe fun with the necklace hehehehe enjoy disclaimer i own nothing you reconize from the harry potter books no money is being made from this flying always helped clear her mind practice wasntfor another half an hour and until then the pitch was all her s she flew upwards loving the way the wind felt in her unbound hair she gained speed and then very suddenly she turned downward in a mad dive toward the ground weasley sees the snitch she whispered trying to do her best lee jordan impression and keep her head tucked at the same time she gaining speed five feet from the snitch and only twenty feet from the ground go ginny go she extended her arm to grab the imaginary ball she was only ten feet from the ground now still rapidly gaining speed closer she propelled herself forward in a final burst of speed bringing her only a foot from the ground at the last second she pulled her broom skyward and began her slow ascent holding the invisible ball in her hands and waving it in triumph and weasley done it she caught the snitch from below her she heard clapping the noise almost knocked her off her broom in surprise she caught the handle sliding into an uncomfortable sideways poison in the seat of her broom beneath her she heard a few of her fans snicker she looked down to see the whole slytherin team loudly clapping and cheering in a show of mock support at the front of the pack was malfoy thanks for that little performance weasley i really enjoyed it however i was a little disappointed by the ending i was so hopping you d fall would ve been much more realistic but i guess you were just saving that for the game sod off malfoy his team stopped their mock cheering love to weasley but we have practice gryffindor booked the field for the day so bugger off well they re not here now are they they ll be here soon well you re welcome to stay around and wait for them but we re using the pitch until they show up fine they ll be here any minute whatever half an hour later found ginny sitting in the stands the slytherins had been practicing for nearly forty minutes she allowed a self satisfied smirk to grace her face realizing that apart from a few players the team stunk where the heck was her team fuming she stood up grabbed her broom and flew out towards the pitch a few members of the team gave her odd looks the majority of them however ignored her completely and continued as if they didntsee her they accomplished this so well that for a minute draco had to wonder if they really didnt see her with that hair not likely he thought allowing the shadow of a smirk to light his face malfoy she called out he was perched on his broom observing nearly fifty feet above the rest of the team his keen eyes darting around looking for the snitch ginny was reminded of a huge bird of prey hunting its ignorant victim for a second she was sure he saw her but he was still nearly thirty feet above her and she couldntbe sure if he did he chose to ignore her flying even higher malfoy he looked down at her briefly the picture of irritation are you still here weasley he taunted i d thought you d have given up by now malfoy what do you know that i don t well a lot of things would you like a list she glared how about the fact that you must be failing all your classes and how did you ever come to that completely misguided conclusion simply the fact that you must never go to the library because if you did you would have seen the notice that been up for two days that gryffindor practice has been canceled she felt her face burning in a mixture of humiliation and anger and you didntfeel the need to tell me that forty minutes ago no it was much more fun to watch you sit there like a well trained puppy for an hour maybe if you re good potter will give you a treat later he said raising an eyebrow suggestively bugger off she snapped and flew hastily back down to the ground one thing was for sure when she got back to the tower ron and harry were going to have some explaining to do harry just back away slowly at least one of us deserves to live and considering you re the one who has to save the world i think it should be you ron i not leaving you harry replied rolling his eyes just run for goodness sakes i ll hold her off ron it is only ginny but you dontknow her like i know her you see the normal sweet innocent ginny i know her for what she is evil demented psychopath ginny the person in question smiled sweetly you have no idea how much that means coming from you brother dearest she said it almost makes me regret that i about to kill you hermione entered the room looking startled err as head girl i really dontthink i allowed to let you kill anyone she said observing the two panicked boys and ginny cantyou let it slid just this once ginny pleaded what did they do practice was canceled and you didntforget did you hermione scolded the boys looked down i told to tell her we forgot and you hung me out to dry malfoy was there malfoy for goodness sakes i sat there like an idiot for almost an hour before he finally said something i embarrassed myself in front of the whole slytherin team you shouldntcare so much of what other think ron informed her smartly her glare intensified but i errr now not the best time for that is it harry nodded sadly sorry gin we didntmean to forget you she didntmove ron shuffled his feet sorry ginny forgive us harry asked jutting out his lower lip in the most pathetic puppy dog face she had ever seen not a chance harry grinned you cantstay mad at me forever wanna bet sure he said his eyes glinting mischievously he held his hands up threateningly you wouldn t oh yes i really would with that he lunged towards her she tried to dodge but he grabbed her wrist and pulled her back then laughing insanely he began tickling her stomach stop that i m i m she couldntrestrain her laughter what was that couldntquite hear you no fair ginny jumped over the couch away from him no fair harry drew closer to her while ron cut her off from the rear his grin a mirror image of harry s widened what do you think potter i hold her and you tickle i dontthink so she said brandishing a pillow laughing wickedly she dove at harry swinging the pillow wildly from behind her she heard ron groan hermione dissolved into a fit of giggles as ginny raised her eyebrow to the older girl who had also grabbed a pillow indignant ron asked what was that for for forgetting me ginny informed him we girls have to stick together right herms she nodded as she continued to whack ron across the head with her pillow harry taking advantage of ginny distraction was once again beside her tickling potterlaughing if you don tlaughing stoplaughing what was that dontstop okay then stop truce never truce i d rather die considering how red your face is i d say you re not far from it that not funny then why are you laughing he said smiling but never stopping because you re tickling me you freaking moron ahem am i interrupting something the four teens stopped immediately and turned red faced to see a very disgruntled professor mcgonagall er no professor hermione said face burning while trying to smooth her hair nothing at all his plan had been to corner her in the hall so they could talk but she seemed to always be surrounded mostly by males right now was no exception her normal crowd luna colin and neville was there along with the unexpected addition of finnigan she was only about five feet away from draco just enough to make it look like an accident besides even if it did look like he had done it on purpose people would just assume it was due to the old weasley malfoy animosity he quickened his pace slightly catching up with her almost immediately she was in the center of the group colin arm slung lazily around her shoulders he noticed seamus on the weaselette other side looked slightly perturbed he kept glancing irritably in colin direction draco cut right into the middle of their group purposely knocking the girls shoulder as he walked by caught off guard she fell he didntturn didntappear to have even noticed that he had hit her watch were i going weasley hey ferret boy if you re looking for a fight you re barking up the wrong tree seamus said oh now i understand you ve got yourself a girlfriend have you you must be getting pretty desperate back off malfoy or so help me oh boy i scared now malfoy seamus ginny said soothingly colin had helped her up from her place on the floor she now had placed a placating if not restraining hand on his shoulder her voice was silky smooth but behind its velvety front he heard a slight edge she was issuing a command and she expected it to be followed don t she said softly and began to lead him away draco sneered that it finnigan run away i sure that ll impress her seamus started to turn but ginny restraining hand kept pushing him forward i hate homework a horrid affair really you see all the teachers are plotting our demise i can see it now death by overexertion really ginny you re so dramatic hermione said her nose fixed in a rather large book no really it true why do you think they invented the o w l s they want us all to die hey what this a white envelope drifted noiselessly to the floor curious she picked it up she gasped the seal was of green wax a great m entangled with two serpents malfoy hmmm hermione asked still engrossed in her book oh ah nothing she glanced quickly at her friend to reassure herself that she was too enthralled with her book to notice ginny action assured she hastily broke the seal malfoy small neat script sprawled across the page in green ink meet me at c est la vie this hogsmeade weekend we need to discuss our little secret involuntarily her hand went to her neck where the necklace hung malfoy expected her to really meet him well she d show him she simply wouldntshow up ginny what wrong you look white nothing hermione a book small black and seemingly meaningless so weasley dreamed about books he expected this from granger but weasley he didntknow that she was that boring suddenly the girl emerged seemingly out of nothing dressed in a white dressing gown she appeared even paler then normal her freckles glaringly obvious against her snowy complexion her gaze darted from him to the book her eyes glazed with fear the girl backed away slowly then her pace quickening she turned and ran so weasley was afraid of books no that didntmake sense either he sighed he hadntbeen expecting this to be work he ran after her a wall she couldntget past couldntescape she appeared to him as caged animal her eyes burned with the need to escape to flee to freedom the emotion or perhaps maybe it was simply the spell that bonded them was so intense that he himself could feel the panic burning in his heart her need to survive pushed her into a final desperate attempt she beat the wall with her fists kicking desperately her inner reservoirs of strength exhausted the spell pasted she sunk to the ground against the wall pulling her knees close to her body her body shaking in bouts of uncontrollable and unconcealed silent sobs he was struck what in the weasley sheltered life could possibly bring her such unbridled fear what could possibly cause her such terror before his eyes she seemed to grow younger her hair brightened to the bright apple red of her past her freckles grew in number if it was even possible when she looked up at him through tear filled eyes they too had changed manifesting before him as the eyes of a very young girl most disturbing of all was the vacancy they had acquired as if she was looking through him perhaps he realized she was perhaps she couldnt see him after all he d never tried this before and the details of the enchantment eluded him startled at the thought he looked behind him to see what the girl was looking at nothing perhaps then he was wrong again he here she whispered her eyes suddenly fixed upon him he saw something there he had never seen in waking fear her eyes were haunted he always here hello ginny love i told you i d return an unknown voice hissed the effect was like being struck by lightning the pain that streamed through his body was hot and intense the girl screeched in pain and fear accompanied by another voice it wasntuntil the scene had faded that he realized it was his own when he awoke the scream sounded strange and foreign to his ears he saw a flash of red and gold his whole body felt warm much warmer then could normally be achieved in the drafty dungeons draco it was blaise voice distant and groggy oddly enough he couldntsee blaise the dorm room looked strange and new to his eyes even ill adjusted to the light as they were he blinked suddenly he felt very cold he was not in his bed but in the wooden chair just as he had been when he had gone to sleep he looked around nothing red nothing gold only the same familiar green and silver shaking his head he decided he must have been seeing things as people were keen to do in the first moments of waking draco he saw blaise now he was out of bed and walking towards him he must have woken him up draco are you okay yeah fine another nightmare he let an ironic smirk touch his face even when he escaped his dreams he couldntescape the nightmares something like that forgive me if there are spelling errors i reread it like ten times but i so tired that i sure i missed some sorry now go down to that pretty little button that says submit reveiw and click it hey guys i back with chapter nine hope you enjoy disclaimer i own nothing from harry potter world p s j k rowling just gave birth woohoo congrats ginny what this the girl rolled her eyes the worst part of skipping a grade was that she now had to share a dorm room with lavender and parvati no one could keep a secret very secret for long what lavender she asked trying to keep the boredom and exasperation out of her voice this she squealed a very girlish screech she was waving a bit of parchment in the air it was on the floor parvati said it wasnthers and it certainly not mine and hermione well we know it not hers give me that for a minute she stared transfixed in horror it was malfoy note how could she have been so careless ohhh she squealed again it is yours spill who wrote it how

blurted the first name she could think of is he the one with the dragons no he the one at gringotts oh the dreamy one with the long hair she wasntaccustomed to her brothers being described as dreamy i er i guess lavender raised an eyebrow and examined the girl ginny weasley i think you re lying to me so maybe she wasntas much of a twit as ginny had thought lavender you really must cut back on the romance novels not everything has a wonderfully romantic reason behind well if he doesntgo to hogwarts how did he know when you re hogsmeade weekend would be and what exactly is this little secret of

to the infirmary hmm horses would be nice i bet we could get horses oh and roses lots and lots of roses professor snape was in a foul mood stubborn boy draco adamantly refused to disclose where he intended on staying over christmas the boy became flustered each time they spoke of it but insisted that he was already taken care of plans he said have already been made plans indeed he sighed draco was certainly lucius son he sat quill in hand in his private office dipping the long feather in ink he slowly ever so slowly began to write he placed each word carefully on the parchment making a silent prayer with each letter that it wouldntarouse suspicion writing the note took much longer then it should have dear narcissa i hope this finds you in good heath dearest draco sends his warmest regards here at the castle it is quite cool unseasonable for this month however draco seems taken with it he enjoys all his classes save his care of magical creatures horrid as it is he head of all his classes next to granger he seems to meet every challenge thrown at him which very much reminds me of someone else i know like his parents he at the top of the slytherin hierarchy his first official hogsmeade weekend is coming i expect he ll ask pansy parkinson tomorrow to go with him i dontenvy him the night he ll have to spend with her i must go fondest regards severus snape the owl chirped its impatience as severus attacked the letter to its leg godspeed he muttered as the thing flew gracefully out of the window goodness knows we ll need it soon enough another slow night at the infirmary he smirked she was trying very hard to appear interested in her homework she hadnteven looked up at him when he had walked in something she had never before done even in the height of their arguments she was or pretending to be though he couldntquite tell which completely engrossed in an enormous volume for a minute he stared she didntseem to notice indicating she was genuinely enthralled with whatever it was she was reading he had taken her suggestion and brought homework but in the stuffy room it was hard to concentrate and his attention kept drifting back to the night before over his own book he sneaked a look at her throughout the day he had been watching her carefully she showed no indication of the exhaustion she must have been feeling she had been as vivacious and animated as ever however now closer he could see dim shadows under her eyes shaking his head he returned to his reading when he looked back up at her her book had dropped slightly revealing half of her face her eyes were closed and her breathing was shallow and even she was very obviously asleep so she had felt the effects of the sleepless night after all weasley she didntstir nor did she look at all comfortable in the hard hospital chair weasley she turned in her sleep dropping the book father down into her lap he hesitated a moment before reaching into his pocket and extracting a small leather pouch he reached inside it and felt for the cool stone he left it in his hand a moment it was reassuring after a moment he pulled the stone out of the small bag a ring entrar r ve he closed his eyes and suddenly the crisp white atmosphere of the hospital burst into a kaleidoscope of hazy colors and unfocused shapes he blinked rapidly though he realized that he was now asleep and wasntcapable of blinking and slowly the shapes focused the weasley girl was there and with her was a boy no older then himself they turned to face him seemingly oblivious to draco presence for a moment he was almost overcome with rage to see who the boys was harry then almost immediately he realized he was wrong while the boy shared potter dark hair and pale complexion he didntpossess the impossibly green eyes and though he was approximately the same height and build as the boy wonder his face lacked the telltale scar i leaving now tom weasley said looking slightly flustered she walked away no virginia stay he grabbed her wrist keeping her from leaving him and turned her towards him he studied her for a moment and wrapped his arms around her in what appeared to be an almost protective embrace you ve changed since i last saw you you re not at all how i remember that what happens in four years tom not to me she didntreply how old are you fifteen almost sixteen she cringed even as she spoke as if some unknown force was pulling the answers from her against her will we re almost the same age then and what year he spoke like a schoolmaster asking arithmetic of a student each time she delayed her answers he ever the practical teacher shot a stern look at his student expecting her to know the answers he required of her seventh and only fifteen dumbledore i i skipped a grade please tom i have to go i shouldntbe speaking with you he continued on as if he hadntheard the last part skipped a grade did you that my little bird for you i always knew you were clever but clearly not clever enough i feel for your trick didnti she was just as he remembered even as a girl she had been strong had even tried to resist him with her little trick of throwing the book away hush my little bird dontspeak of such things you know me i speak only the truth he gave her a disapproving look let not fight love that not what i came back for she was getting more agitated by the
