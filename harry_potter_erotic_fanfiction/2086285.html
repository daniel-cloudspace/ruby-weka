at all i highly suggest that you people go read her stuff she will in fact be putting up a tania fic shortly and some scenes you ll recognize and some you won t also my new favorite character blaise shows up woot he hysterical thanks so much for reviewing i averaging one per chapter read on m dears the chatter of children of all ages and the general noise of trains combined with a couple hundred people running everywhere and extensive amounts of baggage to create the purest form of chaos known to man her levitated luggage following her like a lost puppy alex moved carefully through the insanity that was platform 9 and 3 4 it was the work of moments to secure her trunk and find an empty compartment few people got on the train until just before it left so there were no lack of seating areas totally devoid of people firmly settling herself into her chosen area alex sat at the window seat to the right of the door and placed her owl striker cage on the seat next to her the noise from the platform was muffled and alex opened her transfigurations textbook determined to have the first three chapters memorized by the time she had her first class a quiet knock sounded against the glass she looked up into the lowered gaze of tania dethart hello tania are these seats taken tania asked tentatively no go ahead and sit do you need help stowing your things no thank you i fine tania quickly swung her luggage into the rack above their heads before alex could do more than offer that finished she took the other window seat directly across from alex taking out a textbook similar to alex s tania hesitated oh good you re going to read too i wanted to finish this before class started suiting actions to words alex disappeared behind her book within seconds she heard the rustle of pages as tania did the same a silence fell punctuated only by the occasional noise of students passing by in the hall a scathing glare over the top of her textbook was all that was required to keep anyone else from trying to sit in their compartment not that anyone else was too inclined to sit with two slytherin girls but it didnthurt to be extra forbidding the sound of students had faded and the platform had nearly cleared when alex closing her book and setting it aside with slow precision alex looked over into the face of her slytherin year mates milli blaise looking for a seat alex milli ignored the tania with the ease of long practice as she slid into the seat next to her how was your summer same old stuff alex responded with just a hint of yawn in her voice she smiled suddenly i know your grandmother is old fashion like that blaise but all the girls are seated you donthave to keep standing he grinned and dropped down beside her as the train started moving i ve been hearing weird stuff about you lately lex rumors about me alex flipped her hair over her shoulder and rolled her eyes why that never happened to me before i not talking about rumors alexandria oh use of full name are you worried about me blaise she dropped a hand delicately onto his shoulder i touched lex what happened between you and darius at that stupid flint party milli leaned forward concern warring with glee in her eyes tania eyes never left the page before her the same one she d been reading since blaise and milli had entered what makes you think that any of your business zabini alex eyes and voice battled for the title of most vicious goyle said you did his brother marcus says darius did you darius himself has either no comment or mutters something about you screwing draco malfoy who wontcomment one way of the other as far as i ve heard what milli exclaimed in delighted shock what alex growled in an unknowing echo gripping blaise arm what pansy stood just outside their compartment a surprised smile on her face our very own alex is a sl with a sharp wave of her wand which had appeared instantly in her hand alex sent the door slamming shut barely missing the end of pansy nose laughter turned to rage when pansy failed in her attempts to yank the door back open i d cast a silencing spell but i think there no point this seems to be wide spread amongst the men and now that pansy knows will there be anyone who wontfind out somehow i doubt it you re entirely too correct milli said sighing lightly alex sent her a look which stated in no uncertain terms that she knew that milli would ve spread the word even without the cover of pansy knowing the secret milli smile was all mercenary she shrugged what your plan lex simple do nothing alex thought she caught the subtle nodding of a certain dark haired head hiding behind a book i am a bellmonte i am above such obvious stupidity i do not acknowledge it and it cannot touch me i dontcare after a second blaise nodded slowly if there no reaction then what the point elegant and practical as ever alex alex filed away the realization that tania dethart had figured out the elegant practicality of her plan before blaise one of the smartest slytherins in her own year interesting as for the rumors themselves your sources are goyle and marcus flint who believes marcus and goyle about anything draco she shrugged he draco malfoy it all complicated aintthat the truth milli muttered alex and blaise jerked up and stared at her alex started to grin milli that was hilarious milli laughed aintit just this time her voice held disgusted mockery oh gosh alex started to laugh as well i never thought i d hear millicent bulstrode using low born common language countryside passed rapidly outside the window as the group laughed together they gathered themselves when a knock came from outside the compartment door seeing only the nice old woman who sold candy and treats off her cart alex spelled the door back open one of everything and two of anything new alex ordered with the air of one who didntcare about prices or depriving someone else of a supply the same blaise said in a scornful monotone his public voice one of everything and two of anything chocolate milli put in creatively and for you my dear the old lady leaned in and looked at tania i i nothing for me thanks i fine milli let out an airily cruel laugh oh just order something even if you dontwant it now alex pays for everything and her purse has no known bottom tania looked positively bloodless alex took pity on her no pure blood liked someone else paying for something they couldn t oh please do buy one of everything at least my parents get suspicious if they dontthink i spending my money on normal things alex didntlook at tania as she said it one of everything then tania voice was almost unhearable but she didntfalter over the words at all as soon as she d spoken the appropriate treats flew to the laps of those who d ordered them and alex pulled out her belt purse when a handful of galleons had found their way into the pocket of the woman robe she left and alex shut the door again but refrained from locking it so who are you exactly milli said ignoring the bounty of junk food covering her lap her words prevented tania from retreating behind her book again not that she d moved beyond the one page as far as alex could tell must be somebody interesting to earn a spot in alex compartment blaise commented as he opened a chocolate frog millicent bulstrode blaise zabini this tania dethart i sure you ve met her older brothers hunter and falon falon milli jumped right in smirking not the hated imbecile falon what she means to say blaise interjected smoothly is that you are far too beautiful to be related to a specimen such as falon dethart tania paled brilliantly but couldntstop a blush at blaise comment red stained her cheekbones alex chuckled and tapped blaise nose with her wand she is quite lovely but she too young for you blaise dontyou prefer them tall blonde and at least seventh year if you cantget a professor blaise leaned back in his seat and grinned smugly not that that happens often the only time you ever did without was when your grandfather put that age limit spell on you limited you to girls within six months of your age if i remember rightly alex smirked at his horrified expression hit on everything vaguely feminine in our year you did including me and alex milli was laughing again it was not exactly my fault abstinence has never been my thing and it was second year too i not sure who was more relieved when your grandfather took it off you or the girls your age as the landscape continued to rush past and the conversation dissolved into debating blaise conquests and preferences tania slipped back into hiding behind her textbook a n yup that it so how did you like my friendly gallant lech blaise more to come soon of course review a n okay you ll probably recognize some bits in this chapter those would be dumbledor speech etc which i copied straight from gof i own nothing donthurt me i just striving for accuracy by the time alex had finished gathering her stuff and appropriating a carriage tania had vanished into the rain alex shrugged using the motion to free herself from her book bag which blaise was attempting to carry for her when the three slytherins stepped into the great hall they found that they were much dryer than most of the students you d think they d be intelligent enough to remember a simple water shedding spell milli scoffed as they passed the gryffindor table its occupants looking distinctly damp either the gryffindors didnthear her or they were trying to practice the fine art of ignoring either way milli swept onward to the slytherin table without so much as slowing her stride juvenile blaise muttered causing alex to chuckle an ominous roll of thunder casually announced the trio as they sank into their accustom seats at their table the same heavy sound punctuated the entrance of hagrid and the to be sorted first years one miniscule boy was a walking rainstorm himself within the gamekeeper huge coat blaise raised one cultured eyebrow me thinks i spy a future gryffindor milli sent her gaze heavenward and alex smirked professor mcgonagall cleared her throat and began the sorting aaranthis leanna there was a short tense silence and then slytherin alex clapped politely as the girl swept down off the stool and sat at the end of the slytherin table without hesitation so alex i ve been hearing some interesting things about you jenna montague leaned across her twin jonathan and smiled evilly the quidditch chaser pushed his sister off him and swept his gaze over all the parts of alex that were visible so have i baddock malcolm slytherin really i haven t milli smirked as the twins exchanged a confused look alex sighed inwardly but pansy jenna feigned a confused pause shifting the blame form herself to pansy arentyou engaged to draco alex stiffened and tried not to stare at jenna engaged to draco that was she mentally flinched at the picture of herself under his control blaise started to laugh covering her silence alex en engaged alex got her footing back really i engaged that news to me draco where my ring draco paused in his conversation with goyle and looked over at her in query it would seem pansy is telling people that we re engaged yet my hand is bare and i think i blame you alex lifted her left hand to underscore her words draco smirked i ll buy you jewelry if you want it alex but i fear your hand will have to stay lonely pritchard graham slytherin we re only acquaintances alex explained amused perhaps even friends draco put in dryly perhaps she shrugged but then pansy is always the most knowledgeable and truthful source of information about draco malfoy her irony was forming puddles on the table the twins smirked remembering pansy downfall last year when she d tried something like this after draco had broken up with her there was a sudden silence at the front of the room announcing the beginning of dumbledore start of term speech i have only two words to say to you the elderly headmaster said energetically tuck in there was a collective scoff and rolling of the eyes from most of the slytherin table but none of them were any less eager than their fellow schoolmates as the food appeared before them as blaise had said once in their first year you could always tell the true pure bloods from the lesser and buy ins by the manners displayed as this table alex carefully piled her plate with properly small sized portions of the least common foods until she had a balanced meal milli followed suit emphasizing fruits and vegetables with the smallest amount of meat she could get away with how lady like of you both draco commented his own plate piled high with food despite that slight regression alex couldnthelp but noticing that he was still using the same exact manners that she and milli were as blaise had said from far down the table pansy sent alex a venomous glare well if i didntjust alex whispered what blaise asked after he finished swallowing his bite of chicken and laid his fork back on his plate alex glanced at him and smiled oh nothing i just realized something but it not important inwardly thought patterns were doing some rapid shifting pansy merlin was it possible pansy was jealous over draco it was all too ludicrous to comprehend why did he suddenly seem to be the root of all her problems well if pansy couldntkeep draco then that was her problem alex didnteven want him so then if you arentdraco who are you with jon asked gesturing with a fork oh please jenna exclaimed following the eternal rule that one twin had to answer the other twin no matter what she tapped jon on the nose with her spoon dontyou know anything brother dear bellmontes are never with anyone the occasional one night stand is accepted but they remain nearly celibate until marriage then how do they end up married jon shot back logically i think i can answer that one alex put in before yet another of the twin wars so famous in slytherin house broke out they might seem like they should be in hufflepuff in general but one did not anger a montague we bellmontes that is choose mates of acceptable social and political standing with the help of our parents siblings and the members of any allied families once we choose a contract is offered to said person family negotiations take place and lastly marriage really i find it amazing that you have to ask surely your parents have dis alex clapped her hand over her mouth in mocking dismay oh perhaps you dontget married that way i so sorry i only assumed because all of the truly powerful pure blooded families follow that time honored tradition you really must forgive me beside her blaise snickered there was no way the twins could take offense at that not with the way she d phrased it and so alex got away with her insult clean so the sound of dumbledore voice cut throw the chatter that filled the huge room now that we are all fed and watered i must once more ask for your attention while i give out a few notices mr filch the caretaker has asked me to tell you that the list of objects forbidden inside the castle has this year been extended to include screaming yo yo s fanged frisbees and ever bashing boomerangs the full list comprises some 437 items i believe and can be viewed in mr filch office if anyone would like to check it a snicker came from nearby but alex couldnttell who it had come from as ever i would like to remind you all that the forest on the grounds is out of bounds to students as is the village of hogsmeade to all below third year it is also my painful duty to inform you that the inter house quidditch cup will not take place this year this is due to an event that will be starting in october and continuing throughout the school year taking up much of the teachers time and energy but i am sure you will all enjoy it immensely i have great pleasure in announcing that this year at hogwarts a huge crash of thunder punctuated by the main doors of the hall slamming open interrupted the headmaster every eye in the room turned to face the newcomer a tall man wrapped in a dripping black traveling cloak limped his ways towards the head table leaning heavily on a wooden staff the rain in his long mane of grizzled hair caught firelight as he moved when he reached the head table he spoke quietly to dumbledore the utter silence that had followed his entrance was so profound that even the students at the far ends of the hall could faintly hear the sounds of the two men voices shaking the headmaster hand the man sat may i introduce our new defense against the dark arts teacher professor moody dumbledore spoke into the silence together he and hagrid began to clap who the bloody hell alex silenced blaise with a wave of her hand the headmaster was speaking again and with the silence there was far too great a chance of being overheard as i was saying we are to have the honor of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months an event that has not be held for over a century it is my very great pleasure to inform you that the triwizard will be taking place at hogwarts this year from across the room one of the innumerable weasleys yelled you re joking somehow that was what finally broke the deep silence most of the occupants of the hall laughed even alex had to crack a smile as she exchanged looks with blaise i am not joking mr weasley though now that you mention it i did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll a hag and a leprechaun who all go into a bar professor mcgonagall cleared her throat er but maybe this is not the time no where was i ah yes the triwizard tournament well some of you will not know what this tournament involves so i hope those who do know will forgive me for giving a short explanation and allow their attention to wander freely doesntneed to tell me twice blaise muttered who doesnt know what the triwizard is uh the mudbloods and gryffindors alex said dryly this will be interesting to be sure oh and blaise yes alex light of my life tormentor of my dreams my endless money pouch alex grabbed blaise goblet and sniffed its contents suspiciously alright who slipped what to lord lech no one met her glare blaise snorted i not drugged alex darling i much more fun than this when i drugged what was it you needed of me i need you to remind me to send my parents an owl before bed she rolled her eyes at her friend i dontknow if we have any feuds or alliances with outlying purebloods it not like i keep track and i d hate to misrepresent our family name to the newcomers what forget to ask before you left home blaise asked why would i remember it not like i knew i d be running into people from beauxbatons or durmstrang do i hear correctly draco sneered the high lady bellmonte didntknow about this event beforehand the malfoys buy knowledge we bellmontes create our own alex responded icily touchy blaise muttered turning away from her so planning on entering draco uphold the malfoy name and all that wow zabini draco said laughter underscoring his tone when you let your brain take a break you really go all out excuse me blaise bit out imperiously the headmaster just said that they changed the rules this year apparently you have to be of age legally pity the ministry changed the old laws alex put in otherwise you d both be considered of age being fourteen and heirs and then i d get to watch you both battle nearly impossible foes and probably get yourselves killed why alex draco drawled innocently what has you so riled up alex snorted in a rather unladylike way draco malfoy you have seen me almost riled up once this is not riled up the room and its occupants would not still be in one piece if i were blaise stared at draco his eyes wide in admiration that the other boy was still alive you saw alex nearly lose her temper what happened i drew blood alex said quickly before draco could answer he seemed to make the connection with which event she was talking about because his silver eyes darkened to stormy grey alex you draw blood when you re happy what happened to actually make you angry i have to know mainly so i can avoid doing it draco stepped in his eyes never leaving alex s never stop treating her like the ice queen she doesntlike it when people treat her like a woman alex half rose from her seat murder in her eyes draco lucius malfoy alex blaise hissed pulling her back into her seat dumbledore the headmaster words found her ears and alex regained some control over her temper the delegations from beauxbatons and durmstrang will be arriving in october and remaining with us for the greater part of this year i know that you will all extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they are with us and will give your whole hearted support to the hogwarts champion when he or she is selected and now it is late and i know how important it is to you all to be alert and rested as you enter your lessons tomorrow morning bed time chop chop blaise half lifted alex to her feet along with the rest of the students i dontknow what is going on between you and malfoy and i frankly dontwant to know i a mere zabini and your feuds are to dangerous for the likes of me however you shouldntact the fool for his sake i dontcare what he did he hissed the words in her ear as the two swept their way towards the slytherin common room you re right about one thing blaise you dontwant to get caught in the middle of this opprimo alex added the password onto the end of her comment the portrait swung open and she turned to face her friend i going to bed hey alex blaise called from behind her she paused halfway up the stairs to the girls dorm yes blaise dontforget to write your parents a n the password is latin literally translated by my helpful online latin english dictionary it means to overpower fitting isntit once again i need to get out of my alex mode and do something she would never dream of beg pleeeeeeease review sniffle sob please a n okay okay i know the title of the chapter is oh so creative leave me alone i still own nothing hp related except for everything i do own anyway i reuse some bits hargid words some of draco comments etc straight from the books it all jk rowling and i give all credit to her i striving for accuracy is all read on everyone draco yawned around a piece of toast a loud flutter of wings filled the great hall draco crabbe interrupted his conversation to say in a low voice causing draco to glance up an eagle owl circled above his head he nodded sharply and it landed next to his plate a letter and a package were quickly detached from his talons draco pushed the rest of his bacon at his mother owl while opening the letter it was as he d expected in his mother handwriting my dearest son i trust that you find the class list we assigned to you to your liking draco could almost hear his mother cold sarcasm his parents didntcare if he enjoyed his classes as long as he excelled in them the package contains the usual goodies from home make sure to share them with your friends and as always write me if you require more lovingly yours narcissa black malfoy he refolded the letter and stuck it in his pocket when draco reached for the package he didnthave to fake a grin he knew that inside hidden beneath a layer of sweets he would find a selection of illegal potions ingredients his parents considered too dangerous to send with him on the train pulling it open he tossed a small cake to each crabbe and goyle the usual goodies goyle asked unwrapping his draco nodded who up for some potions homework later we have care of magical creatures first crabbe reminded him well after that then draco snapped not enjoying the reminder of a class with the gryffindors his cronies exchanged a look and shrugged whatever draco look lively gentlemen draco cautioned pulling his wand a wave of it sent his package up to his dorm the ladies approach and at that moment milli and pansy found seats near them at the table with blaise and alex just entering the hall blaise is not a lady pansy said i can vouch pansy draco drawled annoyed i think i ll take your word for it after all no one knows the men of this castle as thoroughly as you pansy glare was murder draco made his way towards professor hagrid s hut despite the steepness of the slope his stride hadntchanged since they d left the castle they of course being crabbe goyle and himself his worst set of robes flowed around him as he walked though he noticed smugly they were still better quality than those on most of the gryffindors who gathered around a cluster of boxes a set of robes the equal of his own caught his eye and he allowed himself a few seconds of purely male enjoyment while admiring alex from the back oh yes he wanted her and draco had never found anything he d ever wanted that he couldntown on y jus hatch the gamekeeper coarse words invaded draco thought so yeh ll be able ter raise em yerselves thought we d make a bit of a project of it and why would we want to raise them draco demanded coldly there was a pause as draco waited for a response hagrid just stared at him stumped from behind him he heard crabbe and goyle chuckle i mean what do they do he sneered trying again what is the point of them the silence only lasted a few seconds this time before hagrid said roughly tha next lesson malfoy yer jus feedin em today now yeh ll wan ter try em on a few diff rent things draco tuned out the rest of the oaf lecture as he moved over to where alex and the rest of the slytherins were standing she sent him a withering glare you do realize this is why you keep getting in trouble in this class alex said acidly her voice low what is he responded in feigned confusion not listening cretin draco decided to practice those very skills on her he affected an inattentive attitude towards her it a bad habit and a deadly one she continued forcefully you re very lucky that hippogriff let you off with just a slashed arm last year this time it was draco who did the glaring while alex affected unconcern that beast was wild out of control i was attacked it was your fault draco malfoy and you know it ouch one of the gryffindors draco didntparticularly know yelled as hagrid hurried over to him it got me it end exploded ah yeah that can happen when they blast off hagrid explained casually eurgh a gryffindor girl exclaimed it seemed the gryffindors were actually trying to feed the things which one is that draco asked his cronies as the girl continued eurgh hagrid what that pointy thing on it lavender brown goyle supplied easily and the first boy was dean thomas draco saw alex shoot a confused look at his body guard ah some of em have got stings their teacher explained sounding far too enthusiastic about it i reckon they re the males the females ve got sorta sucker things on their bellies i think they might be ter suck blood well draco put in sarcastically i can certainly see why we re trying to keep them alive who wouldntwant pets that can burn sting and bite all at once just because they re not very pretty it doesntmean they re not useful hermione granger snapped dragon blood amazingly magical but you wouldntwant a dragon for a pet would you draco caught the look potter sent hagrid and glared as he remembered the trouble he d gotten in because of the two of them and a pet dragon now see draco alex commented smugly that what happens when you pay attention your arrogant comments are informed arrogant comments oh stuff it bellmonte you dontenjoy taking this class any more than i do draco snapped fully fed up with female superiority at the moment for your information draco and note if you d ever paid attention you d already know this but this class was very interesting until hagrid took over occasionally we still do cover something worth learning and the textbooks assigned are very informative even if we dontuse them in class she sniffed what exactly are you doing here if you dontlike the class those two i assuming are just here in case you get lonely actually draco whirled to stare at crabbe we re here because it an easy o draco here because pansy isn t alex blinked at crabbe for a second before she burst out laughing several of the gryffindors sent them a glance declaring that they thought the slytherins had lost it vincent crabbe gregory goyle alex put a hand on each boys shoulder i have sorely misjudged you both and you have my most profound apologies of course you did greg said smirking that what you were supposed to do a n okay okay i know no wait i don t i liked that chapter maybe it was a little short leave me alone honestly though am i the only one who ever wondered why vince and greg as i will be calling them now were sorted into slytherin the house of cunning and guile if they were as dull and useless as they re made out to be if people can make neville a closet genius then i can make draco cronies into semi intelligent beings deal with it oh and just in case anyone was wondering there is a voldie including plotline in here the big problem is that a i needed to give everyone a good handle on how i playing all the characters and b the timeline is against me lucius cantget involved with his evilness until year end and bella doesntget sprung from azkaban until next summer okay i probably said waaaay too much right there oh well at least i didnttell you about the bellmonte family secrets tries to look innocent oh well i ll probably put in a chapter that includes plot every 15 chapters or so it all depends mainly on reviews waves cheerfully bye all ttfn a n well this is going be slightly long cause i ve got lots to say 1 so sorry for the long wait on updates i didntthink anyone was still reading veil which brings us to 2 i really need you people to review as much has i and every other author i ve read joke about it i cannot know if anyone is reading my stuff if i dontget reviews and it doesnthave to be long or anything just a quick that was a great chapter update to let me know you read the thing is fine otherwise if no one reviews i ll maybe keep writing for my own amusement but i wontgo through the trouble of posting it up here 3 the overall plot i know but if there anything specific you want to see from anyone review or email me with it i can always use help coming up with little sub ploty scenes to use to open big plot moments with below is the funny and pointless a n that i had already typed up with this document before i stopped posting i ve had this and several other chapters written or mostly written for a long time we should see a chapter a week or so for a little while if i get reviews i think that all a n hey look another scene from draco pov what a pity smiles gleefully you know there a reason i always play slytherin characters on my online rpgs i enjoy this too much disclaimer same as last time a lot of actual dialog from this scene is straight from jk beautiful book goblet of fire i am merely reusing some bits but putting them from a different pov nobody freak most of this fic is 100 my writing i just striving for complete accuracy draco pulled open his mail packet as he walked towards the great hall it had arrived in his dorm room thanks to his personal owl at the same time that his mother had arrived in the great hall that morning letter from home father writing of course various invites social gossip daily prophet oh poor weasley his voice went from bored to falsely sympathetic as he read the paper headline and then as if a gift from the gods before him appeared the golden trio weasley hey weasley he called what ron snapped as they all turned around your dad in the paper weasley draco said brandishing his daily prophet and making sure everyone in the packed entrance hall could hear him listen further mistakes at the ministry of magic it seems as though the ministry of magic troubles are not yet at an end writes rita skeeter special correspondent recently under fire for its poor crowd control at the quidditch world cup and still unable to account for the disappearance of one of its witches the ministry was plunged into fresh embarrassment yesterday by the antics of arnold weasley of the misuse of muggle artifacts office imagine them not even getting his name right weasley he commented pleased finally getting some of his own back against the loud mouthed whiney muggle lover who was always pestering him straightening the paper with a flourish he continued to read arnold weasley who was charged with possession of a flying car two years ago was yesterday involved in a tussle with several muggle law keepers policemen over a number of highly aggressive dustbins mr weasley appears to have rushed to the aid of mad eye moody the aged ex auror who retired from the ministry when no longer able to tell the difference between a handshake and attempted murder unsurprisingly mr weasley found upon arrival at mr moody heavily guarded house that mr moody had once again raised a false alarm mr weasley was forced to modify several memories before he could escape from the policemen but refused to answer daily prophet questions about why he had involved the ministry in such an undignified and potentially embarrassing scene and there a picture weasley draco added the next piece to his current petty revenge oh he knew it was petty he also knew it was fun and not something he could get in trouble for he shoved the image at the golden trio a picture of your parents outside their house if you can call it a house the insult didntseem to be enough for the reaction he wanted so draco thought quickly and added your mother could do with losing a bit of weight couldntshe ron paled brilliantly and then flushed a bright red he was practically shaking with fury get stuffed malfoy harry spat grabbing ron arm come on ron oh yeah you were staying with him this summer werentyou potter draco sneered at his rival maybe he was sadistic or a masochist or whatever but he always found these debates exhilarating fun even so tell me is his mother really that porky or is it just the picture you know your mother malfoy harry shot back unaware of what he was doing that expression she got like she got dung under her nose has she always looked like that or was it just because you were with her draco felt his face go slightly pink that disgusting little brat dontyou dare insult my mother potter he growled trying to control his fury keep your fat mouth shut then harry said with finality beginning to turn away draco slammed his hand into his robes yanking his wand free reducto 1 he yelled the blast nearly covered his words with a loud bang before shooting off towards harry head it wouldntdo much damage just shove him out of the way draco wasnttrying to hurt him just warn him not to mess with narcissa malfoy no one talked about his mother there was second loud bang and suddenly draco felt as though he was twisting melting still clinging to the rules of being a malfoy draco only screamed in his mind as he fought the rolling pain alex pushed through the crowd angrily draco was dueling someone the moron by the time she reached crabbe and goyle though he was nowhere to be seen vince she put a hand on crabbe shoulder trying to get him to look at her vince where the hell is draco oh no you dontladdie an unfamiliar voice yelled all three slytherin jumped and stared at professor moody as he made his way towards them his wand was pointed at alex traced the line of sight and found a small white ferret on the stone floor for a long moment her mind refused to believe what she was seeing did he get you the professor asked potter no the other boy said missed leave it moody yelled causing vince to freeze as he tried to pick up what used to be draco the professor took a few limping steps towards them the ferret squeaked in fear and took off towards the dungeons draco no wait alex yelled at the same moment moody cried i dontthink so he pointed his wand at draco again and the ferret flew straight up about ten feet before slamming back into the ground once there he proceeded to continue bouncing i dontlike people who attack when their opponents back turned stinking cowardly scummy thing to do he growled as the ferret bounced higher and higher screaming in pain never do that again alex exchanged furious glances with vince and greg all three grabbed for their wands at the same moment professor moody a shocked voice exclaimed stalling their action hello professor mcgonagall moody said calmly bouncing the ferret higher still what what are you doing she asked her gaze following draco bounces teaching teach moody is that a student professor mcgonagall shrieked her books falling to the floor yep no she yelled racing down the stairs and pulling her wand there was a loud snapping noise and draco reappeared as himself he got to his feet covering his pain with only a minor wince moody we never use transfiguration as a punishment surely professor dumbledore told you that mcgonagall said weakly alex turned to her companions vince he nodded already moving he almost seemed to appear behind draco and discretely supported some of his friend weight we give detentions moody or speak to the offender head of house i ll do that then moody said staring at draco with intense dislike draco glared back as well as he was able considering his eyes were watering with pain gods my father cantfind out about this 2 he muttered to vince obviously moody heard only part of the sentence oh yeah well i know your father of old boy you tell him moody keeping a close eye on his son you tell him that from me now head of house ll be snape will it yes draco ground out resentfully another old friend moody growled i ve been looking forward to a chat with old snape come on you he grabbed draco by the arm and marched him off to the dungeons vince returned to alex looking at a loss her grip on her wand was white knuckled that that i ll see him demented she ground out striding in the direction moody had disappeared with draco how dare that old washed up low born mudblood auror even think of doing more than kissing draco boots he isntintelligent enough to breathe if his body didntdo it automatically by this time she realized that vince and greg had followed her both with their wands still out she stopped abruptly and turned to face them an insult like this is not acceptable start thinking now of everything possible within you power to destroy the life of that creature write to your parents and while we wait for a reply try and think of accidents he can have hopefully slow and painful ones alex greg trailed off and looked at vince what she demanded you donteven like draco vince put in almost as if he was afraid she d turn her anger on him i am allowed to dislike even hate draco malfoy because i am his equal and even i would think twice about actually doing something to draco even if i had a good reason which shooting a warning spell at potter most decidedly is not now come on whirling she once more began to head deeper into the dungeons they got to the door of professor snape office just in time to hear him say icily thank you for the enlightening information about my student i assure you he ll receive appropriate punishments even alex could tell he was lying and not even trying to hide the scorn he felt for moody from moody hmph moody snorted yanking the door opened he seemed somewhat surprised to see three slytherins waiting for him in the hall each glaring at him more hatefully than the other two put together i hear you re paranoid mr moody alex said softly purposefully dropping the respectful title of professor that a good trait for someone in your position to have turning sharply on her heel she strode into snape office 1 now in the books it never says what spell he used so i doing what i always do and well making it up 2 again all it said in the books was that he muttered something that included the words my father i am making this up which i believe is the entire point of fanfic from now on i will not be pointing out and explaining every time i choose to do something to this effect if you have issues with it then by all means review me and leave your email i d love to discuss my views with you all a n yes i know i made crabbe and goyle very friendly with alex here or rather she friendly with them but when alex likes a person she their best friend and when she dis likes someone so when she re met the two of them in comc i think you get the point a n well here it is another chapter just like i promised and just like i promised a loooong time ago i have put in a bit of plot by the 15th chapter there isnta whole lot but my timeline is

you there you go have fun the screams that echoed through the dank dungeon room were only recognizable as male if one listened hard and remembered that the screamer had been screaming that way for hours potion ingredients filled the shelves in every corner of the room and cold eyes watched the huddled figure in the room very center at that moment when the screamer fell temporarily silent the door burst open and a frantic figure observed the goings on with wand in hand enough the word was somewhere between a whisper and a squeak master please that is enough for now the figure in the center of the room the screamer rose to his feet with painful grace the potion he d been soaking in sloshing over the sides of the huge tub that had held it the room last occupant a large snake slithered forward a thick black robe in its fangs it would be enough wormtail the figure half hissed his voice nearly gone from screaming if you were not so useless he stepped onto the cold stone floor deep beneath riddle manor and pulled on his cloak the snake twined around his ankles and her now empty mouth opened to reveal her fangs to the useless servant of her master who cowered upon the stone before them both your spells are nearly pointless and your potions are worse b but master they a are all i c can find wormtail stammered red slitted eyes watched in silence while his only remaining servant squirmed then you will find better he finally murmured the softness in his voice worse by far than the harsh anger of a moment before i i will m my lord yes lord voldemort said calmly exiting his dungeon you will watch the door alex snapped the professor might decide he forgot something draco and professor snape exchanged bemused glances as vince and greg moved to do just that their wands out alex stalked over to the desk her wand in her left hand bastard mudblood she muttered angrily cupping draco bruised face gently with her free hand snape hand found it way over his mouth he ll be perfectly fine miss bellmonte that is for me to decide severus and in that moment alex could have been her mother a second after the words left her lips however time seemed to freeze in the room alex turned slowly to face the professor though her hand never left draco face lord snape i professor snape severus corrected coldly and i suggest you obtain a better leash for your tongue miss bellmonte you ll need it if you ever plan to be successful in your battle with someone like mad eye moody yes professor i apologize wincing at her blunder alex turned back to draco who seemed surprised that she wasnta pile of ashes at his feet the spell words were said all in one breath as if they were only one spell even though snape was sure he recognized the last word as a rather basic healing spell it seemed the girl wasntabout to trust his word on draco continuing health merlin draco yelped drawing snape gaze back to his charge every cut bruise or other injury on his person had vanished alex crossed her arms over her chest a smug smile on her face never had the chance to try that one on a human before pretty clean job for a first go of it she commented to the silent room you what draco yelled fury in his eyes you ve never tried that one on a human before he mocked her words are you out of your bloody mind me ha with the level of pureness you malfoys require in your mates however i wouldntbe surprised that such inbreeding has taken its toll on your mind draco lucius malfoy alex wand was still pointed at draco face from when she d healed him the fact that she left it there was suddenly much more menacing draco grabbed her wrist and yanked her wand away from his face why are you here alex he demanded because you were a ferret she spat back fighting for control of her wand hand and because that moody creature is a disgusting filthy mudblood hardly good enough to kiss your boot heels from his front row seat snape firmly suppressed a smile draco blinked at her the strangest expression on his face alex oh shut up it not what you think now give me that alex succeeded in pulling her hand free of his grip she turned to the potions master i would like to arrange a time to meet and discuss what you know about the so called professor moody sir i ll await an owl at your convenience very well miss bellmonte alex glanced at snape he had sounded amused surely not good evening boys she said softly as she passed vince and greg i ll see you in class alex wait she turned to see vince duck out the door behind her she raised an eyebrow shouldntsomeone go with you to watch your back in hogwarts vince it not likely that moody would attack me just for walking around she brushed off his concern even while she was touched by it besides even if somebody did i at full strength draco was literally shaking while he grabbed my hand and not in anger vince glanced over his shoulder clearly wanted to get back to his friend at the news but he stubbornly held his ground greg can take care of no he can t alex yelled before getting ahold of her temper again and if i do get attacked you d just be in my way i fight alone groaning and muttering something about arrogant idiots vince disappeared back into snape office a n alright i know that it short but you have to forgive me it hard to write for he whose name should be shorter and besides this chapter has plot now it will probably be some time until you all see where i going with this but you re more than welcome to review or email and try to guess a hint it ll involve drum roll please alex what a shock moving on update info i should have the next chapter up sometime on february 7th a n i giving all of you the same offer i gave to the readers of my other fic if i get 10 reviews by friday i ll post my next chapter early disclaimer if i owned hp we d see more of the emotional depths of characters besides harry and there would be fewer christians going around making idiots out of themselves by calling the books works of the devil oh and before you freak out on me i a strong christian myself i just think it stupid the way other christians behave over these stories i mean come on they re fiction but moving on you re not here to listen to me whine blaise raised an eyebrow as draco stepped into defense against the dark arts flanked by vince and greg didntdraco declare that he wasntgoing to attend a class given by that mudblood creature blaise asked quietly leaning over to alex side of the desk yes alex responded pulling her copy of the dark forces a guide to self protection from her bag then what he doing here what alex twisted around in her chair and accidentally met draco eyes his gaze was bitter angry and quickly shoved behind a mask of arrogance dontask me blaise the boy doesntconfide in me blaise rolled his eyes best guess then she wrinkled her nose and shrugged i d say his father ordered him to good guess greg confirmed from the seat behind her either ignorant of or simply ignoring draco glare so we re all here under orders blaise commented simply what a pity what a pity zabini a harsh voice asked professor moody stood in the doorway put those away my pretties you wontbe needing those books then what did he make us buy them for they heard pansy mutter to milli did it cut into your pocket money too badly milli responded nastily obviously annoyed according to professor lupin you are all very well acquainted with dark creatures good this year we ll be covering curses and how to deal with them i ll be bringing you up to scratch on what one wizard can do to another moody swept the slytherins in the class with both eyes i have a feeling that some of this class has the advantage over the rest of my students even though you arenteven supposed to learn anything on this topic until your sixth year a low level snicker ran through the slytherins so curses they come in many strengths and forms now i only supposed to show you a couple of counter curses and call you prepared i not going to do that after all how are you supposed to defend yourselves against something you ve never seen a wizard who about to put an illegal curse on you is not going to tell you what he about to do he not going to do it nice and polite to your face you need to be prepared constant vigilance he barked causing one of the hufflepuff girls to jump and almost fall out of her chair so can anyone tell me which curses are most heavily punished by the ministry i ll give you a hint there are three of them no one answered for a long moment moody fixed one eye on the group of slytherins seated in front of him the one that included alex draco and all of their respective friends if one of you lot do not answer me by the count of ten i will give detention to you all there was another brief pause 1 2 3 alex exchanged a glance with blaise it would seem they d be playing chicken with the professor 4 5 6 draco yawned 7 8 9 alex sighed and heard everyone else do the same the unforgivables are the cruciatus curse the imperius curse and the killing curse the entire group spoke as one somehow all adopting blaise trademark bored monotone i wonder which genius came up with the name for that last one the real blaise commented dryly then i take it i donthave to explain what it does now first you mentioned the cruciatus curse professor moody placed a jar of spiders on his desk this curse is a causer of pain when cast properly the victim will experience pain in its purest form the curse also leaves the victim completely unmarked except for any injuries sustained when he or she thrashes around in a vain attempt to relieve the pain however prolonged or repeated exposure within a short space of time can cause a person to go mad or even die if blood vessels in their brain burst due to the strain he pulled a spider from the jar and muttered engorgio it swelled to the size of tarantula pay attention crucio the spider legs snapped in on it body and it began to roll around twitching horribly alex grimaced moody didntremove his wand and it began to jerk even more violently one could almost hear the screams in the deadly silent classroom even though the spider made no noise as fascinating as this is professor draco snapped after a long moment moody pulled his wand away and the spider went limp a collective sigh of relief rose from the hufflepuffs alex twisted in her seat to look at draco his voice had sounded odd and his face was paler than normal vince leaned over and whispered something to him at once draco brought white knuckled fists up out of his lap and flattened them on the desk top with an act of will and that is the cruciatus curse what was next anyone the imperius professor one of the braver hufflepuffs spoke up exactly the imperius is a curse of control once cast it will allow the caster to wield the victim like a puppet there are ways to fight it but that next class right now all you re going to do it watch moody pulled a second spider from the jar and said imperio the spider did a swan dive off moody hand and upon landing on the desk started to cartwheel in a slow circle the class began to snicker oh think that funny do you would you still find it funny if it happened to you i wonder all laughter died from behind her alex distinctly heard a snort of disgust last is the curse i dontneed to describe the killing curse quite obviously it kills you no marks no proof you are just completely and totally dead where you were alive a second ago as he spoke the professor reached in and grabbed one last spider placing it on his desk he pointed his wand at it solemnly avada kedavra he yelled there was a blinding flare of green light and a loud rushing noise as if something huge was flying directly overhead then it all stopped and the spider was curled up on its back unmistakably dead without a single mark on it a gasp of horror and fear slipped out of most of the mouths in the room including quite a few slytherins they re cruel and nasty moody finally spoke into the unbroken silence there arentmany ways to escape an unforgivable your best bet is constant vigilence the whole class jumped keep your wits about you and you have a better chance of living to tell the tale class dismissed that said moody turned and strode from the room alex stood and slowly collected her things there was no reason for that she snapped to the absent professor but shoved her anger at him away as blaise coughed clearing his throat i well it one thing to read about them even to learn how to perform them he trailed off the ever present twinkle in his eyes dim i know draco voice was unexpectedly sympathetic the first time i saw my parents use them well i very nearly did something the house elves wouldnthave approved of blaise was staring at draco you ve seen your parents use the unforgivables he hissed draco shot a glance at the retreating forms of the last few hufflepuffs watching them until the last one passed through the doorway all three he said vaguely avada kedavra only once and it was on a house elf alex resisted the urge to ask him who the other two had been practiced on she had the feeling she knew the answer and she doubted he d tell her anyway instead she said i ve seen the imperius before then you know what i mean draco commented wryly i always know what you mean draco you re easy to understand greg smirked at her the typical banter helping them all regain their footing um i hate to say this milli commented coming over to join them but dontwe have another class a n honestly people i wonttype it again so read the one at the top of the page and review a n new chapter a little jump to the next dada class just assume nothing else intertesting happens between then and now cause it doesn t i would know disclaimer i still own well not harry potter but i was thinking of approaching jk with the idea that she let someone who can actually write do a series about the marauder days by the time the second defense against the dark arts class ended alex was more than angry with professor moody she was on the warpath today class moody said a gleam in his eyes we ll be doing something a little different you ve all seen what the unforgivables look like but you dontknow what they feel like and you dontknow how to fight them in her seat near the front of the room alex froze he couldntpossibly mean what she thought he so today i ll be placing each of you under the imperious in turn to demonstrate its power and to see whether you can resist its effects but but alex felt all the blood drain from her face but that illegal he cantreally mean to but apparently he did for in the next second alex and the rest of the students were on their feet and moody cleared away the desks with a sweep of his wand leaving a large clear space in the middle of the room dumbledore wants you taught what it feels like said moody he seemed pleased that no one objected after a second moody began to beckon students forward in turn and put the imperious curse upon them alex watched as one by one her classmates did the most extraordinary things under its influence a hufflepuff his first victim danced wildly in circles pansy sang a nonsensical children song a tiny hufflepuff girl and greg who were both under it at the same time arm wrestled and the girl won not one of them really seemed to fight the curse after a second or two and each of them recovered only when moody had removed it bellmonte moody growled you re up alex stepped slowly into the space that moody had cleared of desks the professor raised his wand pointed it at her and alex had the sudden desire to run a quiet voice said imperio a vague bliss wrapped itself around her taking away her worries and cares but leaving her terror because alex knew exactly what was happening to her and then she heard a voice echoing in some distant chamber of his brain gentle and appealing take down your hair unbraid it and let it loose well that wasnttoo bad just unbraid it and you re home free girl what wrong with that because your will is being subverted another part of her yelled dimly take down your hair dontdo it don t i not going to alex assured the yelling voice take it no alex felt the voice in the back of her mind swell with fury and braced herself for what she knew would come next now was the pain and the punishment for disobedience and just as she d predicted just as it had happened before a wave of pain almost like heated claws raked through her head alex yelled and dropped to her knees the bruising force reminding her that she was once again a part of a world outside her own head she pressed her hands to the cold stone and hid from the rest of the class by the curtain of her hair unbound alex blaise whispered crouching next to her donttouch her zabini you re next blaise head jerked up and he moved as if to pull his wand no alex whispered grabbing his arm dontbe an idiot growling under his breath blaise lifted her gently to her feet good she didntwin but she resisted longer than any of the rest of you for a first try that way very impressive now you zabini dontfight him blaise alex begged as she fought not to cry there something wrong with him i could tell he enjoyed that alex blaise called catching up with her as she turned towards common room you have ancient runes next bite me alex snapped continuing down her path he let her go without another word as she stalked through the castle and threw herself on one of the black leather couches a second later the portrait hole opened again and draco malfoy stepped through he looked surprised to find someone else there blowing off your classes he asked taking a seat near her you know you can bite me too i dontneed lectures alex snarled back shivering who was lecturing i was asking there a difference you know alex didntrespond draco shrugged i skipping mine too and moody a bastard she jerked what you heard me maybe you didntnotice it but he wasntputting us under an unforgivable for purely academic reasons he enjoyed it alex spat i fought him he broke me to his will and he enjoyed it draco frowned you got that too he asked quietly yeah i mean what was he punishing us because he thinks we re going to go evil on him or is it just that we re slytherins or does he really feel that way with everyone but we re the only ones who noticed it because we knew what to expect i dontknow it certainly wasntany gentler than my other experiences draco said tactically admitting that he d been under the imperious before the action required was different but that all in short it might as well have been either of our fathers in that classroom alex said shivering again draco started and his eyes flew to hers so she knew her guess had been right draco i building a group of people who all hate moody as much as i do what for he asked raising an eyebrow in a pale imitation of his usual arrogance what for alex echoed we re going to take his life apart then we re going to kill him draco smiled from across the gap between their couches count me in a n review etc okay you probably got two emails about this chapter that cause i had to take it down and fix one thing this is my original a n a n i donthave anything to say oh yes i do tania dethartis in this chapter even better my sister also known on here as jaylyngilferbustinex is the creator of tania and she with my help is writing out tania story parallel to this fic she has few chapters up right now and i highly recommend reading it if you want to know more about the detharts she on my favorite authors list if you want to find her but this is important she has used the name tania dethart for two different characters in two different fics the one you want to read is under the surface you do not want slytherin army death eaters reborn at least if you re looking for the companion fic sorry about the mix up blaise cut through the other slytherins heading for common room after dinner and drew even with alex you wanna tell me what going on going on is something going on blaise alex flashed him a bright smile and kept walking yes there is whatever you re up to up to she sniffed disdainfully i alex bellmonte i never up to anything i plot but that is all blaise cut her down dryly with a simple you re going to have a snitch fly up your nose if you keep it that high in the air for much longer well alex stalled alex it not like i gonna blab to milli or like milli for that matter alex sighed i haventasked vince or greg yet but i dontthink they ll mind vince and greg you re conspiring with draco muscle without me well first off i ll remind you that the crabbe and goyle lines are at least as old as zabini and that from what i can remember off the top of my head the goyles are in fact an older house than yours uh huh blaise did not look inspired to care and you annoying git i just said i haventasked them yet meaning they arentpart of the plot yet but i will be asking them i going to need everyone i can get for this one well everyone i can get whom i trust you trust them blaise asked seriously as he stepped into common room not with my life alex temporized but certainly with yours she added grinning oh thanks he drawled donti feel loved if you wanted to be loved you should ve been a gryffindor true true let grab a table and you can tell me all about it about being loved alex shot her friend an incredulous look how would i know about that any more than you do no silly about your plottings here blaise pulled out a chair for her oh that alex smiled as she dropped onto the seat her friend chuckled and found his own chair he then proceeded to watch her with seemingly infinite patience alex knew better but wasntgoing to annoy the boy further by making him wait well you know of our problem with moody correct i know about the ferret incident i know that a quiet petition was passed around to ask our parents for leave to skip his class in protest that was you i assuming and you saw how well that worked alex confirmed bitterly not one slytherin missed defense against the dark arts either by choice or by parental command any way you turn it that failure not your fault though i mean i never expected that protest to work it too public a display i know but hang on a second blaise tania alex called spotting the other girl across the room she froze at the bottom of the dorm stairs and slowly turned towards them her books clutched to her chest come join us alex called again quieter tania didntrespond for a second i was just going to get a book from my room she finally said well bring it back down and read here alex said smiling wryly even if we re that boring you should be able to read tania proceeded to pale brilliantly i i wasnttrying to imply you were lady bellmonte alex sighed and rolled her eyes cutting the other girl off i not offended but i will be if you keep calling me lady bellmonte that my mother alright alex tania agreed quickly i ll be right back she threw a glance at blaise who was currently twirling a quill him his fingers and yawning before fleeing upstairs what was that blaise asked as soon as tania was out of sight do you realize that she doesnttalk to anyone she practically a ghost the only times i ve managed to catch sight of her since we got off the train she been floating on the fringes of the fifth years hiding behind hunter i haventmanaged a word with her and i ve been trying i canttell if she the best actress in the world or if she really is that fragile but either way alex abruptly cut herself off what afraid you ll show that the ice queen has a heart after all blaise teased gently you ve noticed the same thing i have falon dethart is a nasty little bugger who also seems to be a budding sadist not to mention he annoying as hell but you re right too if she is as fragile as she seems well i like hunter and he seems to be trying his best to protect her stop trying to excuse away your decision bellmonte and if it makes you feel better i ll keep an eye out for her alex smiled go ahead but dontgo over board you wouldntwant another girl accusing you of stalking her now would you i guessing we ll be covering your little plots later then cantdistract you with anything ah there you are blaise jumped to his feet as tania appeared once more on the scene a heavy text under one arm and note supplies clutched in her hand she froze for the barest second as he pulled out a chair for her then gingerly sat down once she was safely at the table blaise returned to his seat what are you reading he asked kindly potions of the 13th century tania responded in a low voice making a show of laying out her parchment and quills to avoid looking at him really alex leaned in towards tania a little i ve heard of that one but i haventgotten around to reading it yet will you let me know if it any good once you finish i d love to borrow it off you if it is of of course tania agreed sending alex a look out of the corner of her eye that alex would have expected off of blaise not her it clearly read how the bloody hell haventyou read this book what have you been doing with your life instead alex grinned and raised an eyebrow anyway she changed the subject we were talking about moody i must say the bloody man bugs me he not even one of those professors the ones that condescend us because we re slytherin blaise explained to tania tania nodded but from the look on her face she was only acknowledging the explanation you disagree alex asked tania paled but answered yes well i mean maybe he nicer to you older students he not alex said flatly thoughts of their lesson earlier filling her mind what i meant blaise broke in lightening the mood just by being there is that while he does condescend and poke at us he seems to to understand us i guess for once blaise actually looked like he was at a loss for words from across the table tania was nodding slowly those professors act out of a fear of an unknown but assumed evil while moody knows what we are and what he dealing with and acts according to that so it different even if the result is the same she murmured to herself exactly blaise exclaimed causing tania to jump out of her skin that it exactly ha beauty and brains i do believe she the perfect woman alex he reached over and took tania hands in his my dear would you do me the honor of marry ow alex alex waved her wand at him put the girl hands down and i wonthave to hit yours again tania he was joking alex assured the bright red girl never and i repeat never believe a proposal from him unless it comes in the form of a letter from his grandmother with your parent signature on the bottom as well i would know from experience she sent a pointed glare at the smirking blaise he rearranged his face for a moment and managed to look a little bit contrite it didntlast long though besides i think we ve covered that she was too young for you what about your familial duties blaise grinned oh i believe i could work myself up to the task blaise alex yelled pointing her wand at his nose talk about moody she ordered threateningly fine fine just put your wand away once she d complied blaise smiled i didntknow you were this into old men though alex m dear alex hand dove back into her pocket okay okay tania say something insulting about professor moody blaise yelped quickly girl i seeing my life flash before my eyes i i tania stuttered frantically before spitting out what could only have been the first thing to pop into her mind p professor moody is an immature idiot of a scum bag his mother was an owl and his father was a triverian maggot he fornicates with his dust bins alex froze w what she asked in a strained voice oh i think you heard her alex a n mwahahahahahahaha blaise just brings out the worst in everyone doesnthe he is so my favorite character review and dontforget to check out the tania fic remember under the surface a n now i know what you re all thinking it not monday or tuesday depending on timezones there shouldntbe an update well that because this is a celebratory update i have finished figuring out a list outline of every single scene i will need to write to finish alex and draco 4th year at hogwarts woohoo anyway what it comes down to is this please please read this part to get them on the train going home requires somewhere around 35 40 chapters which means this story will be at chapter 55 60 what i want to know is this do you think i should stop at the end of the year as it seems a natural ending place and then write a sequal covering the summer before and all of their 5th year everything in said sequal will be written and posted either way but all of the plot from that time period will take up another 50 60 some odd chapters it just seems better to break them up even if the plot started in veil hasntbeen wrapped up yet by then review and let me know what you think thanks i dontown harry potter but if draco malfoy is up for sale i interested with his dust bins alex whispered for the seventh time tears slipping from her eyes as she laughed i ll never be able to look the man straight on again especially if i there to remind you of this little conversation blaise replied grinning after a second he sobered his gaze traveling to the stairs that led to the girls dorm she certainly has a set of legs on her he commented softly what tania she sure can run mmm yeah one step forward if she forced to then run away whether it was successful or not alex sighed and wiped her eyes so blaise said glancing around the room to make sure everyone else was out of earshot back to the moody problem the next person who tells me you re laid back and easy going is going to get an earful alex muttered blaise laughed as long as i get one first alright fine right now our plans are two prong recruitment and reconnaissance blaise started to smile and opened his mouth to tease alex about how seriously she was taking all this when he realized she really was being serious dead serious our plans yes mine and draco s draco malfoy your brought him in before me i wasntthe only person who didntfeel up to going to class after moody was done with us alex explained offhandedly before switching subjects now on the one hand we re trying to gather as many like minded people together so we know who we can count on if things get hairy well i certainly like minded and you know i with you alex she inclined her head towards him in acknowledgement on the other we re putting plans in motion to investigate our beloved professor what alex nodded seriously and ticked off on her fingers his house his office his classroom his suite here his ministry records what for starters from that we ll have a good idea who and what we re up against and where to continue looking alex are you out of your mind blaise exclaimed grabbing her arm he transfigured a malfoy for casting a spell at potter what more would he do to you if he caught you in any of those places alex met his gaze soberly then he wontcatch us simple as that alex blaise she yelled cutting through his panic blaise alex lowered her voice i not an idiot i not going to slip into his office between classes i ll wait until i know he somewhere else for a few hours holding detention with greg if he willing or something i haventput down specifics for my diversion yet blaise let out a shaky breath merlin alex now you know why i not spreading this around we have several other people who we ll bring in once we have all our information once we have it we donthave to say where we got it you know he nodded and the two continued to talk as the common room slowly emptied out and darkness fell outside finally blaise leaned back in his chair and gave a bone popping stretch so as for the timing of the first invasion well if he living here he wontbe at his home while school is in session i think we ll have to do it then while school is in session alex frowned thoughtfully but if he discovered his house was broken into and we were all absent from classes on a specific day what about hogsmeade weekends blaise asked suddenly what about them school is in session but we wontbe expected to be in the castle i dontknow blaise you and me are usually pretty obvious then front booth by the window for a while maybe some shopping together then back to the castle every time somebody is bound to notice we arentthere and if we are there then we wontbe in moody house what are you saying no no listen i will be in hogsmeade with a girl whom we will convince everyone is you who looks like me blaise alex asked gesturing to her face or at least who has my hair and is about my height it seemed she d hit the mark blaise fell silent for several minutes then grinned tania does hers is a little shorter and a little more reddish while yours is blue black but she about your height no alex said firmly no bloody way i am not going to get her involved in this who said anything about getting her involved blaise countered easily you ve stood me up for some research project of yours and would she mind filling the second seat i ve reserved at the restaurant you know her she ll keep her hood up and her face down and if we make sure someone overhears us talking about meeting up for hogsmeade alex trailed off and sighed i wish i could think of something else you could let draco crabbe and goyle do all the searching blaise suggested no alex said violently rejecting that idea this is my problem and my feud agreed now the next hogsmeade weekend is in three weeks right after halloween alex nodded we can be ready by then if you set up things with tania draco and i will talk to vince and greg and figure out a way to get from here to moody place and back you got it will you be going alone no if vince and greg agree to cover for him then draco can come with me to watch my back no one will doubt their word on where he is they re supposed to be too dumb to lie makes sense good alex stood and gathered her things hey alex she turned back to her best friend be safe i know you hate him but he isntworth your life alex scoffed he ll never be in a position to take it and try to trust draco while you re in there he ll be your only ally dontworry about me blaise i ll either die now or i ll die later but either way draco or no draco there no stopping it shrugging her bag onto her shoulder she headed silently up to her dorm after a moment blaise did the same a n remember review sequal or no sequal and go read under the surface that you may know tania a little better oh and dontworry you ll still get your regular update on time reposted 12 04 07 all chapters are subject to being reposted at some point the only changes will be minor grammar stupid writing bad sentences bad spelling and inconsistencies look her eyes keep changing color if there are any bigger changes added scenes etc i will mention them in bold also the original a ns will be deleted but i promise you that is no loss it was a cool night but not cold enough to cause a chill the twenty sets of french doors lining the long sides of the oval ballroom were thrown open to use the night breeze to disperse the heat of many bodies alexandria bellmonte slipped behind a potted tree and rolled her shoulders once to loosen tightened neck muscles receiving mild relief she stepped lightly from her concealment one of her classmates parents spotted her and moved to make their formal congratulations such a thing was required at a girl coming out ball amongst the upper crust of pure blood society so glad you could make it lady parkinson lord parkinson alex curtsied tilting her head in a way she knew would let one perfect black curl fall across her revealed throat and settle in the hollow at it base every time i go to one of these i wish i had a son or that i was a decade or two younger and unmarried lord parkinson commented in a way he seemed to assume was gallant both alex and lady parkinson laughed politely you flatter me your lordship you do look quite lovely this evening alexandria i am pleased to have been here on such an important night for you we hear nothing but good about you from pansy thank you lady parkinson pansy is especially close to me of all my housemates because she sleeps in my dorm the horrid little gossip alex smiled and curtsied again as they moved away at fourteen alex had already developed the acid wit covered by pure grace that was her mother legacy to her she d inherited her deadly drive from her father she was a perfect blend of them both in spirit the way she was physically jade eyes and thick curly hair from her father black hair and sharp aristocratic bones from her mother gathering the edge of her robes in her right hand in a way designed not to wrinkle the fabric alex wove expertly through the crowd she paused outside the discreet servants entrance and got a nod from the head house elf that all was well as this was her coming out ball alex was in charge of planning and playing hostess to the whole thing everything floor to ceiling was her responsibility and her creation the gown she wore tonight she d commissioned for just this occasion it was body hugging from hips to halfway to her elbows from there it flowed out alternately hugging her form and flaring out as she moved the whole thing from scoop neck to pearl weighted hem was made of thin white fabric shot through with silver threads the ballroom itself was made of gold and white marble emerald cloth draped from the ceiling white gauze curtained the open french doors and the tapestry of the bellmonte coat of arms hung about the massive doorway leading into the entry hall all in all it was perfect and if alex was anything other than the coldly cynical person she was she would surely be waiting anxiously for her prince charming to arrive just as that thought finished crossing her mind a most ironically amusing thing happened draco malfoy appeared in the entry hall doorway he paused there and casually scanned the room alex didntfrown outwardly where were his parents she would have known if lucius and narcissa malfoy were in her ballroom but there was no way draco would have shown up if his parents werentwith him forcing attendance she and he were passing acquaintances but not real friends they were both alphas in their social groups and neither shared well if at all possible alex avoided the other pureblood the only time she d ever done anything involving draco malfoy in any great amount had been a week long slytherin hunting spree last year after final exams when all the other houses had relaxed they d been assigned a pair of sixth year gryffindors to jinx they d pulled it off surprisingly easily considering they were both in third year at the time considering they hadntspoken ten sentences to each other the whole time narcissa appeared and then lucius joined her flanking draco her parents appeared next and the mystery was solved the malfoys must have been the last important guests to arrive and had stayed to talk with her parents in the hall while sending draco on ahead she moved towards them hoping to catch all three at once and get her duties over with to her disappointment draco was gone by the time she arrived she smiled up at lucius good evening my lord how pleasant of you to come she turned to narcissa lady aunt how are you truthfully narcissa wasnther aunt but her mother had been an old school friend of hers in hogwarts so somehow alex had ended calling her lady aunt quite well alexa you ve managed to pull this off wonderfully if alex calling her lady aunt was strange narcissa calling her alexa was just as off but of course such quirks were accepted in among the great families even if anyone wanted to object would they really risk complete destruction over something as small as this thank you both for the compliment and for coming the honor is ours lucius informed her with his always perfect civil aloofness go on alexandria her mother deana ordered without it seeming to be one surely our adult chatterings will be boring for you of course mother i shall be near at hand if you need to summon me she caught a dark glance from her mother as she left well perhaps that had been a little over the top whatever else she was alex was not known for her humble obedience she very nearly broke into a smile winding once more through the crowded ballroom alex stopped to exchange polite nothings with a few people before finally making it to the set of french doors that led to a balcony terrace the white curtains did much to block out the noise and light of the inside party alex leaned her arms on top of the railing and looked down on the shadow covered gardens she started to sigh but it came out as a yawn these things bore you as much as they bore me alex tensed fear flaring to life at the thought of being snuck up on while on her home ground she veiled her expression and turned toward the voice draco malfoy stood half concealed by the open door at the far end of the balcony everything about him seemed to scream refined boredom feeling somewhat less than charitable due to her fright alex rested an elbow on the rail and flashed a cold smile the only kind of excitement that could occur at one of these isntsomething i think i want to experience draco was it that last was pure vanity on her part after all who didntknow who draco malfoy was on sight are you trying to say draco shrugged off the wall he was leaning on and moved towards her out of the shadows the moonlight made his hair positively glow when he shifted into it that you dontknow who i am his smirk hovered between amused and angry an interesting combination considering the circumstance she noted cautiously i merely mean that our formal introduction was such a long time ago and that i ve spoken to you twice since then if you count this as one such an acquaintance is not conducive to a private conversation on the garden terrace without an escort or the sharing of a confidence mr malfoy oh draco continued his forward motion i doubt your family would raise any objections to us and i sure mine wouldntcare who else would dare object by the time he was done he was a little too close and whispering his words right in her face alex jerked up her chin and refused to allow him to force her to take a step back draco malfoy she kept her voice as low as his had been i look at you and i dontsee anything i might want there is no us and there never will be now if you dontmind alex glanced too nicely at him then twisted past him so that he ended up stumbling against the rail she paused one hand on the edge of the door and smiled i have guests to see to good evening draco draco malfoy paced the length of his suite plotting revenge that arrogant bitch he snarled stung by the memory of her words no one spoke to a malfoy that way he was never rejected by his own kind they all know what happens to those who oppose the malfoys when i tell my father about draco stopped short there was no way he would ever let his father find out about tonight s scene for starters lucius would probably laugh him out of his office alex was a bellmonte and draco had started it then even if he did do something about the situation it would just as likely be draco who would receive the brunt of his father anger as alex and lastly draco grinned lastly he wanted to be the one to bring this girl to heel that anyone would talk to him in such a manner frustrated him that she was a bellmonte and as such allowed to talk to anyone however she damn well pleased just made it worse oh she ll learn the error of her ways draco promised himself she will respect me i ll make her but teaching a bellmonte anything was and had always been a dangerous proposition for all involved if word ever reached her family that draco malfoy was harassing her he d be hearing from his father at the very least that just meant he d have to watch his step and cover his tracks better than with the gryffindors draco started to laugh and here he d been thinking this coming term would be boring a n aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh here i promised you an update on time and now it tuesday and i just realized i totally forgot to post one i blame the sat forgive me sobs and grovels the third door down on the right side of the boys dorm opened softly a waist length black braid bounced against her back as a girl made her way down the hall and skipped lightly down the stair leading to common room she paused on the landing and glanced over her shoulder a thoughtful smile flickered over her face as the door she d just left clicked shut so what do you think greg asked turning away from the door she absolutely serious vince replied slowly from his seat on his bed i got that she truly thinks she hates moody actually she really may but she also fears him probably why alex hates him she wouldnttake fear any better than draco does they re two of a breed highly powerful highly prideful high strung greg interrupted smirking vince shrugged that too the point it she views moody as a threat but apparently a threat she feels capable of handling not quite greg put in finding a seat near his friend if she truly thought she could handle him she would never have come to us even if she did confide her plans in somebody it would be zabini if alex is asking us for help he shook his head she not just afraid she terrified and she calling on anyone she thinks she can trust for help and she trusts us vince asked incredulously unknowingly copying blaise comment from earlier we only really met her ah a week ago maybe two but we ve earned her respect she said it herself draco her equal if he considers us worthy companions then she ll take his word on it now that she knows we re not just mindless cronies that is vince laughed we must have been doing a better job than we thought if we managed to fool her so completely i afraid i have to agree with that one greg allowed himself a smirk but back to the issue at hand the real issue as i see it is not moody at all it draco really the mentioned boy asked from the doorway how so vince shot his friend a level gaze you re messing with her draco chuckled really he asked again how so not sure entirely but i not an idiot i have spent more than a second around you you are up to something so why is that a problem i always up to something greg can be convincing when he wants to and in this case i happen to agree with him she terrified and desperate she would know better than to trust you otherwise greg snorted draco shot him a glare i d rather not let her think she has support and then find out later that you re going to make her problem worse awwww i think lil vincey is sweet on alex draco clasped his hands beneath his chin and sent vince his best come hither stare vince glared at him wordlessly come on draco you know the code 1 as well as we do prize honor above all else once lost it can never be regained if we agree to do this we re in all the way if you double cross her to prove your point whatever that may be then you ll be crossing us as well and probably getting us into the same mess you re getting her into and what mess is that draco asked a hard note edging his voice silence reigned for a moment as vince and greg exchanged looks finally vince spoke up turning her in to moody or to dumbledore draco eyes narrowed slowly and he was breathing through clenched teeth not going to happen he bit out at last why greg challenged draco hesitated as if considering his options try truth draco it easier to keep straight moody needs a lesson more than alex does right now the other two exchanged another glance and shrugged agreed so greg leaned forward interest gleaming in his eyes what are our plans draco smirked i think you re going to like this good evening gentlemen alex greeted approaching where greg and vince sat across from draco in the great hall draco turned and smirked in a way that was almost a smile extending his hand to help her over the bench she took it throwing draco a grateful look as she settled herself next to him from next to greg blaise raised an eyebrow good evening yourself draco responded once she d settled herself so she asked quietly ignoring the food spread out before her and leaning closer to draco they re on board and they know their part of the plan he smirked again we did get called bloody idiots and a few other unrepeatable things though alex laughed and glanced at the two boys under discussion i ve been called worse i promise you as long as they settled down after a while we re fine it was draco turn to laugh if they hadntsettled down i wouldnthave let them out of the dorm good finally alex turned to the lavish dinner before her and made herself a plate mmm potatoes draco he raised and eyebrow and shrugged what the hell so now all we have to do oh blaise i forgot she all but dropped the bowl of potatoes in draco lap as she whirled away to look at her friend did you talk to tania tania who dethart idiot you introduced us you know alex shot absently over her shoulder at the boy who d held her undivided attention until a second ago greg and vince snorted at the expression on draco face yeah it took some doing that girl is as shy as you aren t but i finally got her to promise me she d go i ll just have to find her before she has a chance to give me the slip on the day of and we ll be fine good now all we have to do once again alex was just inside draco personal space her entire being focused on only him is get down the details of our part draco blinked for a minute before he caught up when saturday night for starters alex smiled brilliantly and draco felt as if someone had walloped him over the head with a wand my dorm or yours she asked draco coughed and took a hasty swallow of his water common room he suggested one deal see you then alex stood up and left the hall briskly draco watched her go then glanced at her plate somewhere in the conversation she d eaten her dinner though he couldntremember seeing her do it the trio across the table burst out laughing i take it you ve never seen alex on a mission before draco blaise asked still snickering i guess not draco muttered belatedly remembering to glare at the three co conspirators it only set them off again care to share the joke pansy asked with feigned interest slipping up behind draco and placing a hand on his shoulder blaise smiled politely and shook his head pansy shrugged draco she asked leaning close a word he shrugged glared at the trio once more and shoved a last spoonful of potatoes into his mouth before following pansy from the hall well he demanded once they d passed through the doors she lifted on shoulder the corresponding corner of her mouth lifting slightly as well i bored draco arentyou not really he responded she seemed taken aback for a moment then recovered herself well i not doing anything tonight will you have a half hour free draco frowned slightly he needed to work late tonight and tomorrow if he was going to be free to meet alex on saturday sorry pansy i have homework without waiting for her response he walked farther down the hall heading for his dorm it was only as he spread his books out across his desk that he realized he d just turned down one girl for another something he d never done before and it wasn t he realized annoyed as if he was trading sex for sex he was trading sex for well alex wasntgoing to sleep with him that he was sure of aw to hell with it he had too much to do to worry about a stupid decision and this history of magic homework was killer a n there you go review 1 i found a pic when googling the word slytherin of a piece of parchment with sweeping red lettering across it it was a code of honor list of rules for slytherins supposedly handed down from salazar himself i ve always really liked it so that where the quote came from i ll probably include the entire thing in my next interlude a list of slytherin rules etc a n okay so i debated with myself a looong time about posting this chapter see there really no point to it except a tiny glimpse into blaise past and it doesntline up very well with the rest of the chapters around it but finally because i couldnthelp myself i settled on a compromise the first half of this is the questionable blaise stuff the second half is a little bit of plot woot woot that i put in so this chapter wouldntbe completely worthless you have permission to ignore the first half and yes yes i know there are some minor glitches in it please dontreview about a problem with it unless it just killing you or if you re really confused that all kiddies that all yer free t go just remember t come down ever other evenin and take notes on our lil beauties hagrid said as care of magical creatures ended one day near the end of october i will not draco said flatly i see enough of these foul things during lessons thanks yeh ll do wha yer told hagrid growled or i ll be takin a leaf outta professor moody book i hear yeh made a good ferret malfoy the gryffindors roared with laughter and vince and greg had to grab ahold of alex to keep her from drawing her wand on another teacher she struggled against their significant bulk briefly and settled for glaring slow murder at the professor draco ground his teeth the memory of his father orders still strong in his mind the effort of controlling his rage brought a faint pink flush to his face draco greg said in a low voice class is over it was all the reminder he needed draco whirled and stalked off the other boys kept a firm hold on alex as they followed when draco saw what they were doing he raised his eyebrow in surprise dontgive me that look malfoy alex snapped yanking herself free arriving in the slowly filling entrance hall alex had a clear view of the newly posted notice triwizard tournament the delegation from beaubatons and durmstrang will be arriving at six o clock on friday the 30 th of october lessons will end half an hour early students will return their bags and books to their dormitories and assemble in front of the castle to greet our guests before the welcoming feast spotting blaise alex made her way towards him he pushed towards her when he saw the look on her face bad lesson he asked sympathetically that oaf hagrid dared to bring up the ferret incident draco interrupted her with dry amusement in his voice i ve never seen anything else that can make alex lose her temper faster than that go away malfoy blaise ordered good naturedly draco just glared at him blaise sighed unless you want her to do something worse to you for tormenting her i suggest you leave until i remind her that she has a brain and should use it shrugging draco moved away vince and greg following remind me i have a brain alex asked dangerously lex blaise snapped taking ahold of her shoulders what the bloody hell is up with you and this ferret thing you take more offense at it than draco does have you ever been on the wrong side of a forced human transfiguration no have you alex grimaced yes it isntpleasant let me tell you when how blaise eyes narrowed who he growled not moody alex glanced around the now crowded hall my parents if you must know and this is hardly the time fine but you will tell me and you have got to stop leaping to draco defense over this it looks yes it looks bad alex think about it for more than a second and you ll see what i mean alex frowned and glared up at her friend not really no she snapped then you re being dense on purpose alexandria people are starting to call you draco watchdog and malfoy mistress not where i can hear them of course they know better aw blaise alex mocked are you playing my older brother how touching you are touched blaise yelled in the head grabbing her arm he dragged her into a side hallway empty of people do you really want people considering you draco plaything i dontcare what people think as long as it isntthe truth if i really was draco plaything alex stopped and shook her head chuckling bitterly look blaise i appreciate the concern really i do but this isntyour problem blaise just watched her his eyes darkening slightly draco isntsome kind of wounded animal he takes what he wants from whoever has it regardless of what it ll do to them he may even be a sadist from what i ve heard and he doesntcast a sound shield around his bed it very likely draco has power that why they come back not because it pleasurable for them keep that in mind he began to turn away but alex grabbed his arm i not an idiot she said bluntly neither is pansy milli and every other girl who ever had anything to do with draco sexual or otherwise they use him just as much as he uses them and i dontget my information through overheard sounds in the dark of night girls talk about this stuff face to face all the gory details blaise frowned and if you must know from what i ve gathered malfoy never did anything they didntask for a slow ripple that would have been a shudder in a girl raced up blaise the ice in alex gaze melted i he whispered i know it hard for you if i had your past i d see it everywhere too but i can promise you draco wasntabusing anyone a long shaking sigh escaped his lips you re sure i sure merlin blaise alex whispered wrapping her arms around his waist a fiercely protective light gleaming in her eyes how long has this been eating at you it seemed that he d been waiting for an invitation blaise grabbed her in a bear hug crushing her in his desperate clutches the memories the dreams have been bad lately i ll bet alex said sympathetically blaise past was different from her own in that his parents had been worse than hers bad enough to get themselves caught and convicted when she d first met him he d been massively different than he was now but with his parents gone he d eventually bounced back these days his bad days were less often than hers and he rarely would talk about them shall i ask draco to control himself blaise laughed weakly i think i d like to watch that conversation sure thing ya lecher i ll set it up she felt him relax beside her and he loosened his hold gods i have such a headache you working with him so closely when i had it in my head that he he sighed even if he isntsome kind of abusive animal in bed i still not going to prove the rumors true alex pushed off blaise and shot him a look you should know better than to listen to rumors about me okay so i a blind forgetful person you should still cool it with the ferret thing though lex alex sighed and rolled her eyes but the appearance of several ravenclaws kept her perfectly scathing response in her mouth instead an annoyed i ll try emerged you do that blaise trailed off as alex rubbed her nose you okay she paused in her attempt to pinch it pointy it a little squashed she complained easily changing the subject away from her and draco he winced sorry stop that she sighed you re such a moron you know you may squash me any day as long as it in private or the witnesses are people nobody would miss you re a bloody idiot yeah so what your point hey baby the rough female voice wove its way through the mid afternoon air wanna have a little fun the witch her hair obviously bleached to a straw blond twirled her wand suggestively her robes slipping from her left shoulder inside his own faded black robes wormtail shivered he had little experience with the various activities she was blatantly insinuating and while the idea terrified him it also made his mouth go dry in longing finally the fact that his funds couldntsustain any kind of detour kept him from turning aside wormtail shivered again as he walked what sunlight made it into knockturn alley was dim filtered and cold his mission was elegant in its simplicity but a headache in practice he needed to find something anything that could sustain the life of his lord or if by some miracle a spell or a potion that could bring him back to a body the inconspicuous store front on the infamous jackle s loomed up suddenly in his vision wormtail swallowed and tried to affect a casual unconcerned air as he pushed the door open the interior was not what he expected it wasntdark rather huge skylights brought sunlight into the interior shining on rows of black shelves and the books they contained the only smells that drifted to his nose were those reminiscent of a library books paper ink and dust starting to relax he d always liked libraries and the peace and quiet that came with them wormtail decided to start on the left working his way across the store went faster than he d expected probably because most of the books he came across were ones he d already searched through in his master library only a few were new and thus required that he actually crack the cover and all of these were completely useless wormtail frowned where were the books on deep magic illegal magic blood magic and sacrifice magic why was this place infamous if all they offered was this drivel that thought pulled him up short and wormtail almost laughed of course infamous it might be but that didntmean it was safe to have such illegal works displayed in the front room he turned a slightly manic gleam in his eye and walked up to the service counter when no one appeared to help him he knocked loudly on the wooden top jackle knew when the creature entered his shop it would have been impossible to miss even if he didnthave spells and wards up to inform him of such comings and goings this man smelled of death death and desperation as he prowled around in the front room jackle kept his seat when he walked up to the counter nervous excitement adding itself to his scent jackle ignored him but when he started knocking on the newly polished counter top jackle got annoyed heaving himself nimbly off his chair he stalked out into the store casting a baleful glare at the short wizard yes he barked the customer jumped just a tiny bit and jackle almost smiled i he leaned in over the counter as if sharing a secret i would like to see your private stock jackle scowled the wizard wasntone of the great families wasntone of his good customers wasntknown to jackle at all and he obviously wasnta friend of one of those who were or he would have known better than to ask like that worse for the man not jackle himself the creature smelled like a thief and while jackle would sell to almost anyone he drew the line at rude desperate death obsessed thieves i sorry he said coldly i have no idea what you re talking about this is the extent of my stock if you would like to special order a specific volume i sure something could be arranged the man face fell and for a second jackle watched as terror and fury chased themselves around it but then the little wizard pulled himself up and pulled his wand you will show me your private stock of dark books or leave jackle spat the word a trigger for one of his wards wormtail found himself flying through the air and slamming into the stones of knockturn alley glancing up as he scrambled to his feet he saw jackle stride to the door you are no longer welcome in my establishment if you attempt to visit again your next removal wontbe nearly as pleasant and the door was shut in wormtail face the crush of humanity was insane draco was willing himself to become more liquid as he tried to ride out the flow of the entire slytherin house trying to go from common room to the entrance hall all at once he was more than a little glad when greg and vince found him their solid glaring presence at his back gained him some breathing room he tossed them a grin and tugged his robes closer to perfection thanks i d hate for squashed malfoy to end up on the menu for the evening yet another way you re unique the trio turned alex grinned and waved minutely from her spot against the wall any of you seen blaise she called he was here ow and she was down a fast moving boy having slammed into her and disappeared bloody first year i ll see him hanged draco leaned back to his friends opinions she ll owe you if you help her out greg put in easily manipulating draco good enough for me he shrugged and together they forced their way over to the wall draco leaned down and offered her a hand perhaps you require a rescue m lady she wrinkled her nose and then giving up on her bad mood laughed you have perhaps ed correctly my thanks alex rested her hand in his and after a second his warm fingers closed over hers he lifted her to her feet with seeming ease my pleasure anything else i can do for you he asked feeling magnanimous i still need to find blaise alex replied any suggestions of course draco appeared to think hard then suddenly brightened i ve got it the perfect plan do tell she replied as the crowd continued to flow past well draco grinned and jerked a thumb at greg and vince we make them do it alex burst out laughing and vince rolled his eyes or greg said in all seriousness i could spell a big flashing neon sign above your head that reads zabini wanted apply here if qualified oh no alex choked out not a flashing neon sign they re so tacky he d never live it down very well greg agreed sweetly i promise it wontflash come on draco grouched i sure we ll find him when they line us up outside alex shrugged and followed after him the river of students now a thin trickle so i take it you dont want a neon sign floating above your beautiful hair i do not have beautiful hair draco mocked alex tone oh i so sorry she exclaimed in mock apology you re hot manly and seductive beautiful hair better draco nodded soberly much my thanks alex inclined her head and it seemed the double dose of pompousness was the proverbial straw from behind them both greg and vince burst out laughing delayed as they had been they were among the last students to arrive at the scene of barely controlled chaos that was the entrance hall from off to their left they heard professor mcgonagall voice tense but still calmly restoring order to her house a few shuffling moments after the gryffindors were lined up the hufflepuffs followed suit is this your best professor snape asked coldly appearing before the gathered slytherins somewhere around seventy pairs of eyes flew to glare furiously into his that instant the slytherins were in their lines snape smiled thinly better he paused and his gaze flicked over them remember this is your castle trade insult for insult and courtesy for polite disdain his students grinned and if anyone had been looking at slytherin house just then provided a show of slytherin ness unlike what the school had seen in years as they all proceeded into the cold evening air alex leaned forward mmm she murmured into draco ear fresh meat ten galleons the new students will sit with us at dinner he muttered back annoyance in his voice ick bloody leeches she grimaced then remembered herself and smoothed her features fine i ll take that bet the entire human population of hogwarts currently arranged to perfection on the steps leading into the school they settled back on their heels and waited the evening was clear and cold the sun and moon just beginning to exchange positions not a hint of anyone or anything arriving was evident after several long minutes of patient silence some of the other students began talking among themselves as they were lined up by year and since gryffindor was to their immediate right alex had little difficulty overhearing part of a one ronald weasley s comment she lifted and eyebrow what did he just say about portkeys a hand tapped her left shoulder she turned her head and found blaise he nodded towards the boy she d just been listening to can you imagine the logistics of setting up a portkey that could bring that many people that distance at once draco scoffed worse still they d be coming from under the magical protections of their school and landing underneath ours that makes it nearly impossible not everyone knows as much as we do alex tempered slightly just because we know that portkeys use a similar network as apparations and that they work almost exactly aha they all fell silent as the headmaster started to speak unless i am very much mistaken the delegation from beauxbatons approaches where a good portion of the student body asked in various level of volume including a few over excited slytherin first years no one else from that house showed anything more than polite interest in the proceedings there someone else shouted pointing out over the forbidden forest a huge shadow was hurtling across the deep blue sky toward the castle growing larger all the time it a dragon shrieked one of the first years a hufflepuff alex noted dontbe stupid a gryffindor boy said it a flying horse somehow alex doubted it was either but it appeared the gryffindors guess was closer as the gigantic black shape skimmed over the treetops of the forbidden forest and the lights shining from the castle windows hit it they saw a gigantic powder blue horse drawn carriage the size of a large house soaring toward them pulled through the air by a dozen winged horses all palominos and each the size of an elephant the first three years of students those in the very front drew backwards as the carriage hurtled lower coming in to land at a tremendous speed alex watched it amused at the frightened reactions of the younger students did they honestly think it would crash run them over an enormous crash announced the landing of the carriage ow am i destined to be abused by idiots alex spat drawing her flattened foot away from her gryffindor year mate watch yourself longbottom he glanced back at her with wide eyes and did not look away until alex lifted her own furious eyes to the arriving vehicle the large blue doors embossed with the school coat of arms slid open silently a boy in pale blue robes jumping down and unfolding a set of golden steps he sprang back and the largest woman to ever grace the halls of hogwarts made her appearance the size of the horses and the carriage was immediately explained a few people gasped draco snorted some people just make it easy to tell how pure their blood is he muttered any relation to hagrid d you suppose blaise replied his observation was never commented on because at that moment dumbledore started to clap the students following his lead broke into applause too many of them standing on tiptoe the better to look at this woman her face relaxed into a gracious smile and she walked forward toward dumbledore extending a glittering hand dumbledore though tall himself had barely to bend to kiss it my dear madame maxime he said welcome to hogwarts dumbly dorr said madame maxime in a deep voice i ope i find you well in excellent form i thank you said dumbledore my pupils said madame maxime waving one of her enormous hands carelessly behind her a dozen boys and girls all by the look of them in their late teens had emerged from the carriage and were now standing behind their headmistress they were shivering which was unsurprising given that their robes seemed to be made of fine silk and none of them were wearing cloaks they were all staring up at hogwarts with apprehensive looks on their faces alex felt the desire to smirk a few were from families that it would be better to leave alone but most were not she almost hoped draco would win their bet for if any of these or the students from durmstrang did try and suck up well all who annoyed her were free game and once this year was over she would never see them again thus no worries about long term rivalries her evil schemes were interrupted first by blaise tugging on her braid and then by madame maxime voice as karkaroff arrived yet she asked he should be here any moment said dumbledore would you like to wait here and greet him or would you prefer to step inside and warm up a trifle warm up i think said madame maxime but ze orses our care of magical creatures teacher will be delighted to take care of them said dumbledore the moment he has returned from dealing with a slight situation that has arisen with some of his other er charges my steeds require er forceful andling said madame maxime looking as though she doubted whether any care of magical creatures teacher at hogwarts could be up to the job zey are very strong i assure you the hagrid will be well up to the job said dumbledore smiling very well said madame maxime bowing slightly will you please inform zis agrid zat ze orses drink only single malt whiskey it will be attended to said dumbledore also bowing come said madame maxime imperiously to her students and the hogwarts crowd parted to allow her and her students to pass up the stone steps single malts draco drawled just loud enough to be heard by the departing students a heavy note of sarcasm in his voice how crude our stable is watered with nothing less than pure by that point the other school had gone completyely and so draco didnthave to finish his statement he grinned i do believe that i made some of them blush of course you did pansy said leaning in to join the conversation their french they ll be easy a loud and eerie noise was drifting toward them from out of the darkness a muffled rumbling and sucking sound as though an immense vacuum cleaner were moving along a riverbed the lake yelled lee jordan the gryffindor known for his highly biased commentary at the school quidditch games look at the lake from their position at the top of the lawns overlooking the grounds they had a clear view of the smooth black surface of the water except that the surface was suddenly not smooth at all some disturbance was taking place deep in the center great bubbles were forming on the surface waves were now washing over the muddy banks and then out in the very middle of the lake a whirlpool appeared as if a giant plug had just been pulled out of the lake floor what seemed to be a long black pole began to rise slowly out of the heart of the whirlpool it a mast harry potter proclaimed into the silence really potter draco sniped quietly it is slowly magnificently the ship rose out of the water gleaming in the moonlight finally with a great sloshing noise the ship emerged entirely bobbing on the turbulent water and began to glide toward the bank a few moments later they heard the splash of an anchor people were disembarking and slowly filing up to the castle steps as they drew nearer their uniforms became visible in the dark and alex raised an eyebrow they were wearing cloaks of some kind of shaggy matted fur but the man who was leading them up to the castle was wearing furs of a different sort sleek and silver like his hair dumbledore he called heartily as he walked up the slope how are you my dear fellow how are you blooming thank you professor karkaroff dumbledore replied when he reached dumbledore he shook his hand with both of his own dear old hogwarts he said looking up at the castle and smiling in a way that did not hide his cold and shrewd gaze how good it is to be here how good viktor come along into the warmth you dontmind do you dumbledore viktor has a slight head cold karkaroff beckoned forward one of his students alex eyed him as he passed but he was entirely unknown to her it would seem however that he was known to a good portion of the student body and that he was someone of some kind of importance she filed that bit of knowledge away for later for now dumbledore was leading the durmstrang arrivals into the castle finally blaise muttered as the students were allowed to enter their own school i bloody frozen a n a little warning while i dontexpect it to effect this fic too much i have in fact just gotten a job as a waitress thank you so while as i said i dontthink it ll mess up this fic it may force me to delay a week with an update or some such nonsense if that happens you ll get warningalong with my deepest apologies other than that yes i know this chapter wasntreally exciting or important i couldntjust skip over the arrivals of the schools this and the next two chapters will cover the arrivals and the champion choosing but after that number 25 i think will be the notorious hogsmeade weekend involving mody house so just hold on a little longer and review a n okay draco gonna be a moron in a good way kinda and okay there nothign to say about this only i ll be posting the next chapter on thursday so we can get to the good part as they entered the great hall alex sighed and rolled her eyes at the stupid antics of her fellow schoolmates who was this ugly creepy looking boy ha she said smugly as they made their way over to their table half of your chances have flown away what blaise asked glancing at her like she had lost her mind not you she scoffed so draco said glancing at the beauxbatons students all huddled together at the ravenclaw table for warmth apparently with complete unconcern i didntexpect them to try and join us the group which had expanded to include pansy and milli both of whom looked ready to take professor snape words to heart found seats at the end of the rest of the slytherins the durmstrang students were still gathering around the door apparently unsure about where they should sit the boys leaned in together as if having a conference one of them gestured towards the empty space at the end of the hufflepuff table but then draco reached out and pinched alex butt she whirled and shrieked malfoy he started laughing you ve just won my bet for me alex and sure enough the conference had ended and the durmstrang students were finding seats next to the slytherins now had over my money a pale hand appeared in her still red tinted vision and alex growled completely turning her back to the newcomers as she glared at draco he exchanged a smug grin with crabbe and goyle while she counted the money into his hand you re going to pay for that malfoy she bit out you re draco malfoy one of the newcomers interrupted while only the heads of his group actually turned to look down at the durmstrang boys alex knew most of the table was listening in on this conversation i am draco said coldly it an honor to meet you the boy continued interest awe and greed threading through his voice isntit viktor he leaned over the table towards the boy that everyone else seemed to know i think perhaps it is a toss up which is more of an honor to be graced with the presence of a malfoy or that of a bellmonte the supposedly famous but still ugly boy turned to alex with a slight smile she met his gaze coldly only polite disinterest lurking there you obviously know who i am as most do but i afraid i have absolutely no idea who you are or why i should allow you to sit at my table much less speak to me every durmstrang students gasped as did some of the slytherins from behind her alex felt draco amusement and approval my apologies lady he bowed over the table to her i am viktor krum why do you say your name like the mere mention of it should clear up everything alex asked a little less harshly due to his wonderful manners now some of viktor fellow students were smirking as if it pleased them to see him so spoken to they began to shed their cloaks and settle in i viktor looked at a loss for words i am a seeker in professional quidditch lady bellmonte do you not follow the sport i afraid it holds little interest for me alex placed the name now but she wasntabout to back down after all to excel requires no practical skills that can be used outside of the sport and the sport itself would not exist if everyone from my own class on down did not start acting like blind sheep whenever the subject is mentioned do you perhaps have anything else to recommend you i am afraid i do not viktor said sorrowfully as if this was a great failing of his i will endeavor to redeem myself to you you may do as you wish but i am not easily swayed i promise you i believe i can vouch for that draco said for i managed to give insult to her early last summer and i have yet to even earn the right to beg for my forgiveness when all the students had entered the hall and settled down at their house tables the staff entered filing up to the top table and taking their seats last in line were professor dumbledore professor karkaroff and madame maxime when their headmistress appeared the pupils from beauxbatons leapt to their feet a few of the hogwarts students laughed idiots blaise muttered just because someone else has manners you don t the beauxbatons party appeared quite unembarrassed however and did not resume their seats until madame maxime had sat down on dumbledore left hand side dumbledore remained standing and a silence fell over the great hall good evening ladies and gentlemen ghosts and most particularly guests said dumbledore beaming around at the foreign students i have the great pleasure in welcoming you all to hogwarts i hope and trust that your stay here will be both comfortable and enjoyable one of the beauxbatons girls still clutching a muffler around her head gave what was unmistakably a derisive laugh well i d certainly call that worthy of insult for insult pansy whispered maliciously the tournament will be officially opened at the end of the feast said dumbledore i now invite you all the eat drink and make yourselves at home he sat down and karkaroff leaned forward at once and to engage him in conversation the plates in front of them filled with food as usual the house elves in the kitchen seemed to have pulled out all the stops there was a greater variety of dishes in front of them than usual now this is more like it milli said with satisfaction in her voice as her gaze swept the food options alex nodded almost as sophisticated as home pass the bouillabaisse please pansy it was as their eyes met over the heavy bowl that pansy seemed to remember that she didntlike alex alex just sent her a look that dared her to do something about it but pansy being a true slytherin refused to stoop so low as to dump the soup into alex lap so the meal passed uneventfully viktor seemed to think himself unworthy of speaking with her and the rest of his schoolmates didntseem to have the courage to try their luck in fact the only interesting things that happened all night were the arrivals of ludo bagman who sat on professor karkaroff other side while mr crouch percy boss was next to madame maxime when the food had all been consumed and the golden plates had been wiped clean dumbledore stood up again the moment has come he said smiling around at the sea of upturned faces the triwizard tournament is about to start i would like to say a few words of explanation before we bring in the casket just to clarify the procedure that we will be following this year but first let me introduce for those of you who do not know them mr bartemius crouch head of the department of international magical cooperation there was a smattering of polite applause and mr ludo bagman head of the department of magical games and sports there was a much louder round of applause for bagman than for crouch perhaps because of his fame as a beater or simply because he looked so much more likeable he acknowledged it with a jovial wave of his hand mr bagman and mr crouch have worked tirelessly over the last few months on the arrangements for the triwizard tournament the headmaster continued and they will be joining myself professor karkaroff and madame maxime on the panel that will judge the champions efforts the casket then if you please mr filch filch approached dumbledore carrying a great wooden chest encrusted with jewels it looked extremely old a murmur of excited interest rose from the watching students alex was affected by it despite herself she exchanged animated glances with blaise the instructions for the tasks the champions will face this year have already been examined by mr crouch and mr bagman said dumbledore as filch placed the chest carefully on the table before him and they will test the champions in many different ways their magical prowess their daring their powers of deduction and of course their ability to cope with danger by now the hall was filled with a silence so absolute that nobody seemed to be breathing as you know three champions compete in the tournament dumbledore went on calmly one from each of the participating schools they will be marked on how well they perform each of the tournament tasks and the champion with the highest total after task three will win the triwizard cup the champions will be chosen by an impartial selector the goblet of fire dumbledore now took out his wand and tapped three times upon the top of the casket the lid creaked slowly open dumbledore reached inside it and pulled out a large roughly hewn wooden cup it would have been entirely unremarkable had it not been full to the brim with dancing blue white flames he closed the casket and placed the goblet carefully on top of it where it would be clearly visible to everyone in the hall anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write their name and school clearly upon a slip of parchment and drop it into the goblet said dumbledore aspiring champions have twenty four hours in which to put their names forward tomorrow night halloween the goblet will return the names of the three it has judged most worthy to represent their schools the goblet will be placed in the entrance hall tonight where it will be freely accessible to all those wishing to compete to ensure that no underage student yields to the temptation added the serious wizard i will be drawing an age line around the goblet of fire once it has been placed in the entrance hall nobody under the age of seventeen will be able to cross this line finally i wish to impress upon any of you wishing to compete that this tournament is not to be entered into lightly once a champion has been selected by the goblet of fire he or she is obliged to see the tournament through to the end the placing of your name in the goblet constitutes a binding magical contract there can be no change of heart once you have become champion please be very sure therefore that you are wholeheartedly prepared to play before you drop your name into the goblet now i think it is time for bed good night to you all an age line an interesting way to enforce the rules draco commented absently rising to his feet i wonder how many idiots are going to try and fool it oh i think at least two from each house but slytherin milli pointed across the room at a pair of matching red heads i think i spy the gryffindor pair right now i think you may be right mil care to wager again malfoy alex grinned and they began to make their way towards common room i bet you one hundred galleons that someone underage will make it across the line planning on doing it yourself draco asked giving her a strange look not a chance i ll be way too busy to do whatever little challenges they think up i accept your bet then bellmonte draco paused then smirked you do realize that the only way you can win is if the under aged person actually makes it as champion well we could do it that way or i could just set up a quick recording spell that ll tell me who steps over the age line in fact if you ll excuse me i need to hurry if i going to get that finished before anyone tries to put their names in the thing a n okay so i know a lot of that was stuff you should already know all that talking about the champions and the goblet blah blah blah it aintmy fault in fact here something to keep you amused so you wontyell at me the scene opens with a well dressed man apparently a reporter or some kind of professional something sitting with the authoress in the empty great hall so what you re saying is that this girl he consulted his notes alex bellmonte has an abusive relationship with her parents loathes anyone who is in the other three houses in the school detests anyone in her own house who is of a lower class than her and hates anyone who is from a different school from her the authoress nodded exactly though lower class is a relative term perhaps but my point is from where does this girl find her friends you have her hating everybody and when a cold voice asked did we decide that i required friends hey lex rainearilan grinned we were just talking about you so i gathered she swept her gaze over the reporter everyone needs friends he said firmly rainearilan grinned again you are brave my good sir very brave brave he looked confused how so oh i believe that she thinks you acted bravely by saying what you just said to me i think it was more ignorance than anything else alex grinned ferally her deadly furious eyes watching the man every move you really shouldntdisagree with me you know oh come on alex dontkill him the authoress put in if he dies i wontget any publicity and without that i wontget any reviews if i dontget reviews i wontkeep writing the story oh really alex raised an eyebrow at the authoress you won t eeep ne er mind carry on turning she mouthed sorry to the reporter before vanishing from the room you know alex said all casual conversation as she moved closer to the man that what i like about her she knows when to save her own skin the fire in the goblet had just turned red for a fourth an impossible fourth time a long flame shot into the air lifting a smoking piece of parchment with it with a dazed almost automatic gesture dumbledore caught and opened it he spoke only two words one name in all harry potter and then chaos of the most restrained sort the silence was so profound draco wondered if he dare breathe everyone in the hall from severus snape right down to the smallest hufflepuff first year seemed to be under the same impression staring about and trying to remember to blink in the right places but all in all the look on potter face was the worst he looked like someone had just dumped a bucket of icy water over his head while stabbing him in the back there were times and this was one of them that draco felt sorry for the other boy after all he was always in the limelight and from what draco knew of his past he had no training in how to handle that of course it was all his own fault this time at least why would he put his name in the goblet if he didntwant to be champion harry potter the same name this time spoken in command harry up here please the gryffindor moving as if he were dead and just hadntfigured it out yet walked limped moved to stand shakily before the headmaster well through the door harry it was spoken kindly but not happily as the door thudded shut behind the boy who lived alex cackled really she did there was no other word for it it was too evil to be a laugh and too loud to be a chuckle draco looked over at her in disbelief and she just grinned completely unrepentant he muttered what her blaise nodded at alex of course she is but draco said pitifully glancing up at her and widening his eyes sadly but that all the money i have how am i to feed my mother if you take it all from me we have only a small apartment over a bath house and all that dirty mist hey he ducked as alex blaise and even his own cronies proceeded to pelt him with their broccoli you dontunderstand oh he was a malfoy he couldntresist playing it up to a crowd she ill the the lung sickness i cantafford a medi witch and she sure to die in terrible agony if i do not steal from a rich and powerful lord who will surely kill me if he catches me how can you be so heartless the three boys let loose with pained groans as alex muttered shut up just shut up into her hands why should i do that the vegetable population in my vicinity has gone up considerably thanks to my little are you planning on paying me draco alex cut him off not wanting another little act he rolled his eyes at her do you really think i keep one hundred galleons on me i do she answered instantly and i d keep twice that on me if i was in danger of having to pay off a bet blaise laughed so he not as perfect as you who is did you honestly think i expected potter to somehow trick the cup into naming him the forth champion i have your money alex just not on me i ll pay up later fine alex grinned you do know what this means dontyou draco malfoy means he glanced warily at the smile she was offering it wasntentirely pleasant we re both of pure blood alex said trying to give him a hint you owe me a debt i ve called in oh no greg muttered and blaise groaned you re not gonna make him do it alex how can i affect the outcome here blaise it not something i have control over you know if he cantpay the debt when i asked for it damn draco groaned cutting her off debt of honor you got it you re going to make me pay through the nose for this one arentyou alex grinned evilly but then her expression soften a little i should i really should after what you pulled last night you bloody lech i dontknow though i dontwant you around me that much so you ll probably get off easier than you deserve i draco wrinkled his nose i think i both relieved and insulted sure you are dontyou find it even slightly amazing that one of the most powerful witches in our year having placed a great deal of money on the outcome surprisingly gets to watch as a young boy who for all his fame isntall that bright succeed where even the genius of the terrible twins has failed blaise pontificated solemnly alex looked over at him in surprise you re saying you think i put potter name in the goblet you do have the know how to beat something like an age line draco put in looking thoughtful instead of growing insulted alex just smiled pleased that quite the compliment i thank you for it but unfortunately and she did indeed look sad at the thought i did not cross the line nor did i show potter how to of course alex greg said agreeably we believe you you jerks she shot back lazily there a simple way to prove my innocence draco dabbed his mouth to cover a faux bored yawn which is meet me back in common room boys this ll only take a minute she stood abruptly and headed off there plain and simple i approached the line on two occasions but never crossed it the glittering silver ink that scrawled across the long roll of parchment appeared several times on it length but only twice with her name once at the very top of the list of names and once at the very bottom gold means they crossed it so i know who succeeded and those who only tried look for yourself obligingly the four boys leaned over the table reading well there all the frenchies blaise pointed at a long section of gold i not even going to try and pronounce some of those try these greg suggested gesturing to the equally long gold that spelled out the durmstrang entries thank you but no this is interesting draco said suddenly what is alex leaned in so close to the page her breath ruffled it you have all of the professors patrolling draco pointed out each name dumbledore snape mcgonagall snape again flitwick he snorted and trelawny but moody name doesntshow up on here once you d think him being the paranoid type he d camp out near the thing to guard it you re right strange here what even weirder vince said it seriously drawing all eyes to him harry potter name isnteven on here what several voices asked together i checked he never even approaches the goblet merlin blaise muttered i guess someone really did put his name in for him alex gaze viciously swept the parchment who would ve done it draco asked or could he have cast a spell to convince the line he was someone else someone older no i mean he could have and it might have tricked the line if he d done it right but not this list it writes down the true name of the person that why mine says alexandria bellmonte that is who i think of myself as not alexandria etc etc etc more middle names etc bellmonte greg nodded ludo bagman i can see doing it he seems to have something of a soft spot for boy wonder but his name isnton here either who else then draco mused all of the other adults are too much sticklers for the rules to help him pull this off the other official umm blaise trailed a finger down the list barty crouch he on here twice he doesntlook like the type to patrol though in fact he didntsleep over at the castle did he yeah he did he left by floo from the great hall late after the feast but he was back within the hour my question still stands draco frowned over the names who else then hmm enough alex sighed and stood back up what blaise looked at her like she d lost it she shrugged it good to have the information but it isntour problem weeeell we have our own problems to worry about she right something dark flashed across draco face as he spoke we only have until next saturday blaise pulled himself up and briskly rolled up the list handing it back to alex he said soberly dontlose that we might need it agreed now back to the business at hand did anyone come up with anything particularly strange in your ward research today vince raised a hand i did a n there you go now we ve covered all the necessary but still somewhat boring gof stuff next chapter to be posted on monday as usual will kick off the amazing adventures of draco alex and moody house tania pansy vince greg wormtail voldie and snape all show up to make things interesting but not all at once the next three or four chapters will be dedicated to this little sub plot but i ll try not to drag it out too badly see ya monday oh yeah i will explain debt of honor a little more later once i finish making it up myself grin severus glanced up from the parchment he was reading did a double take and glared i believe i stated in no uncertain terms that i was not going to do this from across the room one eyebrow was raised meaningfully drawling the words as if bored out of his mind severus began to speak it would seem that there has been some kind of misunderstanding for which the authoress humbly begs forgiveness while i so adore these little adventures proposed with ever increaing frequency i am a very busy man severus the authoress snapped keep to the script she tapped the top of the teleprompter box imperiously that why i wrote it for you if looks could kill well let just all be glad the authoress is imortall whilst i he inserted a pause of profound disgust severus snape will appear in this sub plot saga it will not occur in either this or the next chapter however i can assure youthat i will make a here he froze and graced the authoress with a look declaring her misinformed and quite insane severus she said a mix of annoyance nad deadly threat in her voice kindly remember who controls your choice of footwear if anything even greater disbelief filled the already incredulous eyes excuse me and if the authoress had been a timid person well i believe you can picture it instead she tapped the box again hopw imposing would you look in fluffy pink bunny slippers clearing his throat severus manfully continued however i can assure you that i will make an appearance fit to be drooled over no later than chapter 29 also to redeem herself the authoress offers up this never before spoken tid bit she is currently workign madly to get a good portion of a new fanfic finished it is at this moment titled bellmonte slush and is basically an alternate reality of this fic in which draco is less than he appears and i am the only refuge for a much besought alex eventually it will all culminate with a are you out of your mind no why do you ask me and miss bellmonte do you have a problem with that a n as you may or may not have figured out slush is a snape alex fic i have the first 5 or so chapters finished mainly because they dontdiffer greatly from the first chapters of this fic i probably wontbe posting it on here at least not for the time being but if you really want to read it and are willing to wait for a long time between updates then you can review or email me with your email address and i ll send you some of it as i write it blaise stretched slowly as his gaze swept the flow of people heading outside heading for hogsmeade now was the time this had to go right finally a small dark head came into view and blaise was glad he d decided to look for her rather than just wait for her to show up tania was heading towards common room sighing indulgently he set out across the room on an intercept course as he stepped into her path she froze her gaze settled somewhere in the center of his chest and she didntspeak ready to go blaise asked cheerfully as if he hadntjust caught her trying to ditch him she shifted from foot to foot for a second almost as if she was trying to figure out if running away was a viable escape plan sure tania said quietly good cloak naturally he was already wearing one but tania wasn t so a warm black cloak popped into existence it was just like a thousand other purely functional cloaks but blaise knew this one to belong to alex tania would never tell the difference but it would help the ruse if only a tiny bit she reached out a hand to take it and with a smoothly practiced motion blaise helped her into it again tania froze blaise frowned inwardly had no one ever helped her put on her cloak before or was it something else he gave a mental shrug and moved on bowing slightly he offered her his arm after a long minute she laid hesitant fingers on his wrist and he led the way out to the chill wintry day from over her head he saw greg and vince blaise tossed them a sober nod they returned it before moving into their assigned places here we go here we go alex tucked her scarf closer to her throat and pulled up her hood draco glanced dryly at her scoffing at her melodrama she shrugged and stepped down the stairs they were leaving out the supply door for what had originally been a second set of kitchens back at the beginning of the school illustrious career and these simple slightly neglected brick steps were of a different breed than those that grandly welcomed guests and residents alike mmph alex heard draco grunt behind her and turned to see him copying her motions he met her gaze then looked past her squinting in the wind i cannot believe i up this early draco grumbled alex rolled her eyes glad for something to take her mind off what they were doing hey i let you talk me into waiting til two hours after dawn i should ve held out for three we have to get out of sight of the castle not to mention out from under the magical field the thing produces that maybe an hour of walking unless you want to fly in that she gestured to the frozen mass of cloud cover point taken it was cold even for the first weekend of november and the wind had a bite to it though no snow covered the ground the slate grey clouds held a promise of it and the frost was so thick that the grass crunched underfoot so alex spoke into the lengthening silence after she felt the weight of it pulling at her self enforced good mood what if we come across a mig bellmonte draco shouted grey eyes flashing with silver we have gone over every conceivable spell potion and trap a dozen times now shut up she increased her pace and glared at him that that cretin we have not covered everything what about um damn he right note to self donttell him that re lax draco growled alex scowled over at him if you ll just calm down and try to work with me so we can maybe get out of this in one piece then you can yell curse and hex me into oblivion when we get back for a minute she appeared to be considering a violent response but something something draco doubted he d understand even if she explained it to him pulled her up short she just sighed and continued the chilly trudging good the silence that fell ate up minutes stretching into something that was both comfortable and tense as the castle began to fall out of sight stop draco pulled to a halt both mentally and physically alex stopped in front of him and briefly met his eyes before scanning the tree line i dontwant to trust you she stated flatly draco felt a surge of annoyance they were in the middle of a dangerous mission and she wanted to discuss their relationship well then we have common ground she dropped her gaze back to his face frowning draco her exasperation faded away after the one word i dont want to but i will i do he blinked knowing his surprise was all over his face wha why alex snorted do i have a choice when he didntrespond she shifted uneasily and pulled out a heavy gold coin let s get going we passed out from under the magical field a few minutes ago draco nodded and stepped closer to her her hand shot out and took his there was a sharp yank then the rushing stopped and his heels slammed into the earth he stumbled a bit and the warm pull on his left hand kept him upright so she said almost inaudibly draco looked down at the slim fingers threaded through his and it suddenly occurred to him that hew wasntthe only one who was afraid trying to find a way to get them both back on track or at least the next step so they could get the mission over with as soon as possible draco scanned their target it was a small almost tiny house seated in the middle of a truly tiny yard so neglected it appeared to have never held grass or any other plant on it surface the only break in the flat stretch of brownish grey were the blasted scraps of metal and trash that appeared to have been at one time dustbins and their contents walking over to the corner of the house where it had all been piled by the wind and necessarily pulling along alex who still refused to let go of his hand not that he altogether minded draco knelt lightly next to the heap a simple blasting spell he suggested holding up one of the twisted metal fragments for her observation alex leaned closer it certainly looks like it not that i ve tried one on a muggle style dustbin a thought seemed to come over her and she chuckled something amusing he queried with his own dry amusement alex flashed him a grin ask tania dethart about moody dustbins i sure she d be happy to explain sure i ll do that draco shrugged and dropped the piece of metal standing he dusted his hand off on his robes now back door turning alex looked over the barren yard yeah there nothing to find out here and i bet there as many protections on the front as the back my thoughts exactly neither teen made a move finally gritting his teeth and squeezing alex hand tight enough to hear bones creak draco stepped up to the unassuming back door the chipped black paint suddenly loomed high above them but only in a mental not magical way swallowing and after a reassuring hand squeeze from alex draco pulled out his wand and tapped lightly on the door instantly his detection spell informed him of the terrible wrongness not that there were wards on the door the detection spell liked whole spells no there had been spells on this door wards which had been horribly mangled blasted apart what alex asked worried what wrong draco i he frowned the wards we donthave to worry about them someone has been here first they re in shambles really releasing his hand so she could draw her wand alex cast her own detection on the door whoever did this she said at last did it a long time ago two months at the very least probably longer that was before he came to hogwarts agreed draco said quietly well that one problem down before she could stop him draco reached out and grabbed the door handle pushing it open the icy daylight spilled into the dark kitchen he bowed with a flourish lady first a n la la la all finished terrible arenti well if i get ten count em 10 reviews

quietly almost gently wormtail shuddered what do you intend to do about it i i th thought to g go back tonight his wards lead me to believe he lives above his store master it could only be in such a place where he would hide the books we search for for the first time since wormtail had reentered his service voldemort smiled it was a cruel twisted thing more akin to anguish than joy but it was a smile nonetheless wormtail felt the light go out of the world and wondered not for the first time if his master was kin to the dementors a thought worthy of being called such has just come from you wormtail i applaud your continued evolution towards sentience th thank you milord i think so tonight we will go pay this jackle a visit in his strange half body voldemort appeared to be stretching perhaps the exercise will do me good yes milord of course alex muttered to herself taking the first terrifying step into the darkened room once she was safely in draco moved in behind her shutting the door with a hard thunk though dim light filtered in from the tiny window to their right it was far less than enough for them to see by alex felt a motion behind her and turned just in time to see draco point his wand at her lumos complexo instead of the blinding light she d expected a steady sunlight type brilliance filled the entire house well alex tried to joke arentyou useful to have around so i ve been told between them they eyed the room it was a rectangle with the back door situated about a quarter of the way along one of the long sides to their left sat a worn wooden table capable of seating six at a crunch only one chair sat next to it and a bench ran along the wall behind to their right ran waist high counters and the one window practically every other inch was covered with cabinets i ll start left alex volunteered draco shrugged alright with me stepping closer to the much marked wooden surface and resolutely ignoring the bad pun alex scanned the scars and stains first nothing appeared to be a spell matrix in any of the languages or codes she knew so she took a chance and ran her fingers over the wood as she d expected nothing happened it was just a table and after a few seconds she could confidently say that the chair was only a chair and the bench likewise harmless kneeling down to make sure there werentany cabinets or anything stored under the bench alex got a look at the bottom of the table weird she muttered crawling in further what is she heard draco ask his voice muffled by the cabinet he had his head in there a scorch mark on the bottom of the table top looks like a blasting spell or no maybe a disarming charm hmph draco pulled himself back out of the cabinet nothing well he glanced over at alex before moving on all he could see of her were her shoes and socks her legs sticking out from under the kitchen table the crawling having pulled up her robes a smirk graced his features you know moody he probably thought the table was an intruder when he came down for a midnight snack hmm maybe or someone could have actually broken in the person who shattered the door wards alex scooted back out blinking slightly and shaking dust out of her hair draco hurriedly wiped the smirk from his face and turned his back on her before she looked over at him possible makes some sense but then who set it back up like normal umm moody himself if it was a long time ago with a rustle of robes alex started searching the other cabinets a light tapping told him she was doing detection on every one before opening it draco rolled his eyes so far there had been exactly nothing in all five cabinets he d looked into and certainly no spells wondering if this was going to be a really long and boring day draco fought a yawn before pulling open number eight something like a cold wind rushed around his hand and up his arm as he reached into it depths an ache settled into his brain his bones and time ended for one draco malfoy boys a slightly shrill female voice called greg and vince by previous mutual agreement ignored it crabbe goyle still the hulking figures lumbered on down the hallway appearing not to recognize their own names oh for the love of wait putting on a burst of speed pansy caught up with the two boys and grabbed an arm of each they actually dragged her a few steps before they realized she was there and stopped walking looking down at the smaller though in reality most people were smaller girl greg blinked slowly and vince just stared didntyou hear me pansy demanded releasing their sleeves after a long silence vince replied no pansy sighed and looked at them both with something like compassion well at least with less annoyance well that alright i just wanted to know where draco was greg frowned why he wasntin the group heading for hogsmeade so i thought maybe he wasntfeeling well inwardly vince winced well duh people were going to worry if the draco didntshow his face at hogsmeade they should have put together a cover story or something so people wouldntdwell on him so much well he heaved a sigh at least between them he and greg could divert some of the suspicion then inspiration hit yeah vince said mournfully he not feeling too good he in bed greg shot him a glance but played along nodding his agreement oh poor thing you men are all absolute babies when you get sick do you think he d be up to a visitor bad uh oh red alert run away vince licked his lips trying to come up with an excuse no greg supplied madam pomfrey said it ll be really contagious for the next six hours til the potions all kick in we arenteven allowed in our own dorm pansy shrugged oh well i ll pass the word make sure people leave him alone it wouldntdo for the whole house to get sick they both nodded at her tell draco when you see him that he to come to us if he needs anything to help his recovery the collection of cures in the girl dorm is rather impressive will do vince said courteously gotta run stay out of trouble with a brisk wave pansy headed off the way she d come a n complexo latin for emcompass a n again yeah pansy a little ooc for the way i was playing her yes well no not really see all we ve seen is her trying to well pick things up where they left off last year but things have changed and like all good slytherins she adapting it not like she evil she d just not part of the group yet oh bugger did i say yet good grief the next i ll be doing is spilling the beans about the poker night innocent look review a n lalalala stuff anyway i in a funky mood see waaaaay back in march i took the sat and today the scores got pre posted online which means i finally know how i did woot math610 critical reading700 the other english section700 and best of all out of 12 points i could possibly get for my essay i got brace yourselves twelve points woo hoo i am not officially and legally smart dance with me a spell quiet and unassuming echoed back to her across the slowly vibrating wand it was a first at least for this venture and alex had to pause a moment before she could catalog it it wasnta spell she specifically knew but there were parts of it she recognized as confident as she was that she could solve the problem without him and without scorching her eyebrows off alex turned around to where draco should have been he wasntthere throwing herself to her feet she spun til she spotted him he was exactly where she d left him fifteen minutes ago reaching into his eighth cabinet a thin strand of hair falling into his eyes and now fifteen minutes later that strand had yet to complete it surrender to gravity a cold chasm opening in the pit of her stomach alex crossed the distance between them draco making sure not to touch him she waved a hand in front of his eyes no response damn her eyes falling half shut alex recast for the thirteenth time today the detection spell it arced slowly invisibly across the inches separating them gentle lighting like fingers twisted themselves into the shape of the spell and vanished wh what feeling her fears all come crashing in on her head alex sank to the floor beside the unmoving body of her only ally pulling her knees up to her chin she frantically chewed on the inside of her cheek okay okay girl think he not gone he just i dontknow what he is but whatever has him can dispel my detection she frowned and shivered no no wait that not right it still there you fool you know what a broken spell feels like it still there it just been her eyes flew open and she knew she had it stopped lurching to her feet she conjured a handful of dust with a hopeful grin she tossed it into the air above draco it twisted and swirled falling until it got within half an inch of him there it did as his hair was it stopped in mid air blowing at it didnteffect it okay okay draco been stopped umm alex paced a half circle around him twirling her wand between her fingers umm so the the time has been constrained within about half an inch around him it probably a surface following thing well the one good thing about all of this is that time does not like to be confined in any way it ll help the process along if i give it a place to start oh merlin malfoy learn not stick you hand into small dark places bracing her feet and pointing her wand at the back of his head alex muttered might as well try the basics finite inca she cut herself off mid word damn what if by ending the spell i end time for draco feeling a migraine coming on she sank back to the floor to think dontbe doing something stupid lex blaise attention was pulled from his own dark worries by the tiny almost unnoticed shiver of his companion are you cold he asked tania kindly smiling at her she nodded yes but said quietly n no i fine knowing that once some of his worry was freed up from alex he d be very concerned about the small girl next to him blaise decided that what she said was entirely what she wanted him to hear and that her stuttering wasntfrom fear but cold lightly slowly and very gently he slid an arm around her shoulders let go get warm we re both frozen in out steps and i at least am starving no okay then fine the spot inside her cheek that she d been chewing on had begun to bleed sometime during the last half hour three spells and no effect later alex was getting a little desperate and what does a bellmonte do when desperate sticking her thumb into her mouth it came out covered in her blood get a move on malfoy she yelled jamming her thumb onto the middle of his forehead it wasntuntil after her skin made contact with his after he blinked at her in confusion and after he said bellmonte if you re going for a wet willie then you missed that she realized she d done it and so of course she started yelling at him are you out of your mind what were you thinking sticking your hand into an unchecked cabinet do you know what you did you stopped bloody time draco blinked slowly i what 45 minutes almost an hour you were in that same position i ve been working on getting you free for a half hour damn understanding and concern flashed over his face as he absently wiped his forehead the bloody he pulled away with his fingers brought some of the confusion back blood alex blood i came up with twenty seven spells that might break the spell only three were safe to try none of them worked why only three all the rest well i wasntabout to do something with even a chance of messing up or ending time for you forever anyway i was a little desperate but she tilted her head and looked thoughtful completely missing the touched slightly surprised look that covered draco face at her words what he prompted after a minute i sent a detection spell at you first it got caught in your time but since your time is the same as mine again it finally reported back i guess i know mostly how the spell works and definitely how my counter spell works good but i promise you i wontbe doing that again i should hope not now come over here and help me with this spell i found we ve wasted enough time already i want to get this done is that better blaise began to feel as if he was running a monologue while pulling teeth or something like that he never was one to remember muggle phrases correctly tania slid silently into the seat he pulled out for her and nodded silently not removing his own cloak after all they were seated next to the window and the door which was nearly always open as someone entered or left he was glad when tania decided to do the same so do you have anything in particular you wanted to try he asked picking up and browsing his menu everything here is good i can vouch as i ve eaten it all at least once he thought he saw a glimmer of interest from a pair of dark eyes that only appeared briefly above her menu it was enough of an invitation oh yeah first off the dragon steak it isntreal dragon i know i ve had real dragon it is a really good try though so if you arentsure you want to try actual dragon it a good place to start the house sauce is a little spicy but you can always ask for regular barbeque if you want it a little milder spicy is fine it was spoken exactly like everything else she d said but not quite blaise clear heard the what you think i not up to spicy that ran through it he grinned sometimes he forgot this girl was a slytherin just like the rest of them it good either way just dontdrink butterbeer right after you take a bite it ll cool your mouth like adding pure alcohol to a campfire will put it out he grinned ruefully i know i ve tried it tania snickered blaise sniffed dramatically yes yes do go on and laugh at my pain how i enjoy it so the laughter that emerged from behind the menu was as startling to the giver as the hearer yes you poor boy so abused really blaise insisted pitifully i am will you be the one to save me from this cruel world and the women in it and if i do who will save the women from you tania asked it was quiet without the brashness that would have infected alex voice were she to have made the comment but the effect was much the same and blaise was beside himself for having gotten through to the girl alas he clutched his heart you have wounded my soul but i cannot deny your claims come dearest make an honest man of me marry me there was a long silence and blaise was suddenly realizing he shouldn t ve said it when tania spoke again the amusement was a little strained but obviously she was making the effort make an honest man of yourself then ask me you might like the results better uh retreating to safer ground blaise said i recommend the griddle ribs they come however you like them with half a dozen sides and he reached over and tapped a picture with one finger this lovely awesome chocolate dessert thingy fifteen cabinets and two spells later alex first one had done what she d expected and blasted flames all over the place and the second one had tried to wrap them both in steel ropes they ducked briefly into the large pantry it was large yes but empty there were stains powders and sticky spots amid the glass covering the floor there was a fight here i thinking right before he left for hogwarts else why wouldnthe have bought more food alex glanced at draco as they exited the kitchen my thoughts exactly there was only one more room on the bottom floor forcing them to officially declare this a tiny house it was a sitting living room with a strip of tile stretching from the front door to join with the matching tile in the kitchen obviously the foyer per say two dusty faded loveseats and a table fulfilled the sitting part with a large bookcase and a matching corner cabinet holding the only interesting parts a second door did sit next to the stairs on the left probably the hall closet let eliminate the harmless looking furniture and all of the foyer stuff before tackling the bookcase and cabinet she suggested good idea draco agreed glancing longingly at the cabinet it went much as alex investigation of the kitchen table had all of the furniture was clean completely normal and spell less i ll get the closet you check on the front wards sure striding up to the unassuming door draco cast his spell it came back there were no spells of attack on this door reaching out he tugged on the handle for a second it didntwant to move just as it began to he heard an annoyed dragon shite he looked over and dove for alex who was at that moment up to her waist in what looked like the welcome mat behind him barely missing his feet as he lay stretched out on the floor the completely muggle steel door did as designed and slammed to the floor crushing the draco that was no longer there dragon shite he echoed umm draco alex said pointedly just a hint of fear in her voice as her slytherin crest disappeared into the floor sorry sitting back he pulled until he could see her waist re gripped with one arm wrapped around her and finished heaving her from the mat with a final sucking sound it released her feet and they both tumbled back draco cracked his head on the metal door and alex cracked her head on him ow it was a mutual sound grumbled by both as they sat up well arentwe the brilliant little sleuths alex muttered from somewhere below his chin draco chuckled and realized his nose was buried in her hair come on bellmonte up we go once on their feet the couple levitated the door back into place and turned to the interesting parts of the room bookcase alex claimed just as draco said cabinet they exchanged looks and grinned a n okay i getting fed up i pretty much plan on having all of the rest of the inside moody house stuff in the next chapter it may be kinda long snape will definitely be in the one after that as will voldemort review a n i but you cantblame me the site wouldntlet me sign in last night and i had to work all day this is longer than usual and i was really uninspired wheni wrote it so it probably wontbe that good but it does cover a lot of ground unfortunately i trying but i ve suddenly hit a wall with this story i know what happens next sorta but i cantwrite it so i will hopefully have a chapter ready on time next week but i may have to start updating only every other week in fact expect that unless told otherwise again sorry if anyone has any ideas for anything how to un block writers block absolutely anything you want to see happen in the story i would massively appreciate you reviewing or emailing me and explaining see one of my big inspirations is input from other people so input grin it figures what the bookcase it real enough but it spelled so that unless i moody it does this alex ran her hands through the row of texts as if it were a cheap illusion any suggestions draco only silence greeted her find something turning as she spoke alex was met with a sight that was familiar of course this time his hair wasntin mid fall she started to laugh it would seem that the time stopper spell was something of a favorite of moody s i am not going to feel guilty about it i am not going to feel guilty about it i am not blaise tried to console himself for his deception as he watched tania enjoy her meal just because what he d talked her into getting was one of alex favorites so he interrupted his own thoughts what do you think they were the first words spoken since their food had come mostly because blaise was still the person carrying the conversation and like all things male had found his food more important than pointless chatter unfortunately for them both tania had just taken a slightly larger bite of meat as the words left his mouth fear flashed over her face and she began to chew frantically as if she would get in trouble if she didntanswer right away something that could only be called kinship filled blaise the need to answer when spoken to was something he d had to work very hard to overcome after his parents had gone sometimes he still fell into the pattern but never with the emotions behind it that she was obviously feeling it was just a habit for him stop he ordered i am making conversation rather stupidly i might add i am more than content to sit here and blink slowly with much concentration whilst you finish chewing dontdie just because i have bad timing tania hesitated but in the end obeyed i she coughed out the word as she finished swallowing it very good good i was hoping you d like it i do tania hastened to assure him good he repeated so what your favorite subject and or professor oh yes laugh why dontyou draco snarled as he wiped blood from his forehead again i did a detection spell this time the bloody thing doesnt show up in fact you just might want to show me how to break the spell in case you get caught couldnthappen alex answered turning back to frown at her previous problem you say that now well is there at least something interesting in there there was a muffled frustrated sigh no there are old marks on the wood like there was something stored in here but it gone now took it to hogwarts with him alex said dismissively poking her wand into the illusion not illusion bookcase or draco stressed the word to get her attention whoever was here the person who blew up the dustbins and the pantry and under the table wanted what we want but the physical stuff not just the knowledge well if so then they went through a ton of trouble to put everything back to normal oh for the love of she snapped in frustration if i could just read the bloody titles but every time i try to focus on one it kinda fuzzes out weeell draco looked thoughtful yes no no dontmind me you re the all powerful one draco if you re gonna be helpful be helpful if not shut up he sighed and rolled his eyes try a librarian list they re good for inventories in general but books in specific now see you can be helpful without dying it seems my entire day is going to be fraught with awkwardness blaise grumbled to himself as he surveyed his current difficulty he had more than enough money to cover a couple dozen meals like this on him but it was more than obvious to him at least that tania didn t unfortunately it was also obvious that she was going to try and pay anyway and so as the check was laid down on the table he did the only thing he could think of and hoped he d be able to talk himself out of tania bad side eventually here he slapped a handful of coins onto the table and smiled nicely at the waitress ignoring tania with her hand halfway into her belt pouch keep the change well thank you sir the girl grinned and winked at him before walking away good luck and have a good day oh i think we will rising with his usual grace he offer tania his arm she took it eventually outside it had warmed up a little but after a second it got positively hot for poor blaise why did you do that tania demanded blaise glanced down at his companion and winced there were spots of red in her cheeks that screamed anger and humiliation and a look of wounded pride that oh so sore spot of all pure bloods was in her furious eyes he decided that trying it innocent was the way to go after all he would have paid for her food even if she d been richer than alex she was with him what did i do tania you the bill she frowned there didntseem to be a good way to phrase it fortunately blaise seemed to catch on his worried look faded slightly tania i was raised properly meaning i have good manners when i am out with a lady it is my job my duty to take care of her in every way that includes paying for things i didntmean to insult you and he let out a soft breath i am very sorry if i hurt you by my actions if i have please tell me that i may begin to make my amends tania shrugged brushing the issue aside i it fine no it not if i hurt you then i owe you far more than a simple apology you owe me nothing she said quickly yes i do he replied matching her tone i owe you my respect i owe you courtesy i owe you protection i owe you my care i owe you an experience free of worry and concern i owe you a time where you needntfear insult or injury of any kind and as of right now i owe you an apology that goes beyond mere words because i have failed you he was breathing a little hard when he finished and tania had the sudden image of him kissing his sword before an altar as he proclaimed those self same words i think perhaps i ve just heard a reiteration of your code she said with a weak smile unable to think of any other response the moment was getting very thick and she wondered that the air was still breathable blaise grimaced comically what i wouldntgive for alex to show up for two minutes just long enough for her to hit me about the head and proclaim that i being a pompous ass i think it would help tania obligingly smiled at his attempted joke but alas she deeply entrenched in her project whatever that may be oh yes her and bloody m yes tania prodded suddenly curious it hadntoccurred to her before that this so called project of alex might be something that involved several people in fact nothing really it just annoying when she gets on one of these little crusades of hers you know of course i do gone on a few yourself have you tania replaced her hand on his arm and did not answer paranoid paranoid paranoid alex sighed and rubbed her neck nothing in here worth reading draco come look at this list frowning draco returned from where he d been doing one last circuit of the room to make sure they didntmiss anything or so he said alex merely wanted to know if he was looking for traps they hadnt set off yet glancing at the list of protection and detection books he snorted have you ever read any of these alex a few why dark witches and wizards the way they think the path not so straight when your death is desired for the love of power evil magic and those who use it he snickered i have oh they re terrible it all a bunch of drivel as if everyone who uses forbidden magics all have the same motivations and thought patterns she moved away from the glowing list and eyed the stairs contemplatively you know i think we should write a book you and i really he sounded amused as he casually banished the list what about us our kind and what would we call it hmm she chuckled either something really pathetic like beyond the grey inside the mind of evil draco suggested alex laughed exactly that brilliant or we give it no title and put no author name on it either nothing to distinguish it he said slowly something akin to a smile forming you either have to own a copy or be shown one by someone who does to even know it exists it would be accurate though she whirled dramatically and grinned framed by the staircase we d make millions my dear darling draco smirked i already do you have millions you dont make millions and the returns on your investments dontcount semantics whatever you say are we finished down here draco i d rather get this all done yes it all clear the only thing i haven t good she cut him off and stepped backwards onto the first stair dammit accio alex draco yelled the spell yanking her across the room he used the momentum of her slamming into his chest to drop them both to the floor a glittering light flickered in his vision roaring overhead well that was deadly looking draco tried to joke shifting slightly alex took the hint and rolled off him lying there side by side on the floor in front of the bookcase her gaze flickered between the stairs the far wall and draco face merlin she breathed as if she were really entreating him to save her all of the self assurance and bravado that she d recovered since entering the house vanished suggestion draco heaved himself up onto his elbows when you ask a question try listening to the answer alex shut her eyes and nodded silently as i was trying to say it all clear except i haventcleared out the spells on the staircase yet good she replied her eyes still shut oh for the love of you re still not listening to me sitting up he reached over to assist her willing or not into a similar position it was then draco discovered she was shaking bloody hell you are not going to go to pieces on me right now bellmonte come on he grabbed her shoulders and pulled albeit slowly up i do not want to die thank you it came out clipped and precise with an edge of hauteur she still wasntlooking at him neither do i and that is why you need to sit up and join me if you donti ll be forced to take on the upstairs on my own and as i sure you ve noticed i tend to get into scrapes can you imagine having to face my parents and explain why i dead or worse he paused and shuddered professor snape that definitely got through to her alex twitched and stopped resisting his gentle pull once she was upright and looked like she was going to stay that way he stood with a practiced flourish draco pocketed his wand and offered her his hand she took it immediately and kept it after she was on her feet but she wasntshaking anymore so he let it go shall we perhaps try that one again i ll not play bait for you a second time draco the declaration lacked the heat necessary to make it effective oh but you will blaise he paused and looked around what blaise stretching up on her tiptoes milli waved at him from across the street come here sighing at the interruption blaise smiled apologetically at tania wait here i ll be right back with barely a glance he dashed across the crowded street to the group of slytherins though she didntreally mean to tania began to guess what they were all saying it was mostly impossible milli talked too fast to try and lip read and blaise had his back to her but slytherin though he was blaise was true to his word and only a few moments had passed before he was once again risking his life in a speedy road crossing unwilling to openly pry into his business tania couldnthelp but give him one very small inquiring look the boy was good with subtle he grimaced it looks like i may be spending the night in common room oh she encouraged politely it would seem that malfoy is ill so ill everyone has been banned from his room which consequently is also my room i sorry it okay blaise said just a hint too quickly tania caught a flicker of movement at the corners of his mouth and noted it either he ll be better by tonight or they ll move him to the hospital wing professor snape will take care of it i sure i sure she echoed in a low voice not as vocal in her support of their head of house but more emphatic blaise yawned and stretched glancing upwards at the smooth grey sky so anyway we ve covered zonko s honeyduke s the post office the theater the museum of hogsmeade stuff and lunch or as i dis like to call it mistress monocarp munchies all that left is the shrieking shack madame pudifoots if you make me and all of supply street we ve got maybe one more stop before curfew where do you wanna go wherever it up to you well we arent going to the great black hole of lace if i have anything to say about it and it ll be cold up by the shack by now so let jog down supply street on our way back to the castle and you can tell me if anything inspires drool nodding decisively like she d just been handed a mission statement tania headed for supply street as if both of their lives depended on it i see my plan agrees with you blaise muttered to the no longer present girl both taking off after her gods and magic she confusing supply street was as austere as the rest of hogsmeade was flamboyant it also suited it name or perhaps it had been named after it purpose had been established either way it was a double row of dull square buildings all nestled up to one another and all with only minor decoration on their fronts namely simple signs with the name of the store but that was the point this was not the place one went to window shop or buy random trinkets no you went to supply street when you d broken all of your everyday quills or were down to your last few potion vials all the things you had such fun picking out in diagon alley before term began the things that were now vital necessities to your everyday existence were purchased often in great haste and desperation from somewhere on this street as a whole it probably did better business than the rest of the town combined for who cares the least the amount he is spending but the frantic student fearing the wrath of a teacher it was just a little thing a fumbling of feet a switching of the steady rhythm that was tania stride but in the silence it was enough not caring what he looked like blaise hurried swung his head around as he took in the shop they passed he almost grinned in a way he felt like he should have known the apothecary liar whiney sneaky little just because i played your favorite game for a little while and beat you at it doesntmean i a liar i never said an untruth draco paused in his speech to re cast a shield around the two of them somehow frowning around a sigh alex conjured yet another handful of stones and tossed them onto stair 19 this argument had been raging since 2 well she flinched as a magical fire flared against their bubble of protection since it is my game i feel i have the right to state the rules and i know that i a liar so i promise you are yeah but you called me not just a liar step 20 passed without incident or spell but a whiney sneaky liar you can not say you dontthink i sneaky alex whiney spectacularly of course not but if we re talking about you i think we should add cruel to the list there was a silence during which the faint sound of pebbles falling could be heard the 21st and last stair produced a billowing cloud of poisonous looking mist i believe mr malfoy alex said barely audible under the hiss of mist vs shield that you have mistaken me for my mother draco dispersed his spell as alex turned and banished all of her stones not that miss bellmonte never that alex changed the subject is it just me or is it smaller up here it is draco agreed they were standing in the hall but really it was just a landing leading to a single door the only thing reminiscent of a hallway was a short five or six foot long stretch that over looked the foyer but i dontthink this house was ever supposed to have an upstairs this probably used to be the attic he made it into a bedroom and opened up the rest to make his foyer and front room seem larger an interesting stylistic choice we re not here to discuss his decorating themes alex draco auterius malfoy draco stopped with his fingers mere hairs away from the doorknob alex glared if you touch that door without testing it then so help me now i confusing you with my mother he grumbled while testing the door it was clean he opened it a moment later as he looked into a pair of green eyes and felt a wet trickle between his eyebrows he heard an irritated i am not your mother draco grinned of course not mother next time i leaving you stopped she turned her back on him and entered the sparsely furnished and very tiny room but then you d have to do my arithmancy homework merlin a fate worse than death i can barely do mine how about this you do my arithmancy homework and i ll do your ancient runes i donttake ancient runes she shot him a dry look over her shoulder that the point wow you re stupid gosh again she my mother alex ignored him saying instead i almost feel bad for the sadistic bastard a bed a nightstand and an armoire not even a closet hell he doesnteven have a picture on the walls diseased mind draco intoned pompously moving around the bed to tap at the bedstand talking about yourself again alex carefully cast her spell on the armoire and frowned when it came back empty you know with the paranoia of the rest of this place you d think he d put something on his armoire but the spell came up clean she shrugged pulled open the door and reached into the first shelf it was like a rippling wave of ice and then literally between one second and the next a burning searing feeling filled her along with it came the knowledge that someone had just dared to mingle their blood with hers blood magic she snarled preparing to hunt torture and eviscerate the culprit of course it was spoken in a tone of barely controlled hilarity you told me yourself it was the only way to break the spell safely i wasntabout to risk ending you after all even if you did make me do this a bloody thumb entered her field of vision bite marks scoring the pale skin alex glared at draco noticing the stress he was burying along with the amusement pulling at his mouth i she reached up and wiped off her forehead the crimson liquid staining her fingertips forgot that the time stopper doesntshow up on normal testing spells yes draco was definitely laughing at her but alex gave a mental shrug she d laughed at him too aparently well there nothing much in the bedstand just a scrap of parchment that looks to be an old list of attacks copy it alex said instantly i already did you never know what might be useful she opened her mouth and shut it again when she realized he d already said what she d been about to since you ve already nicely cleared out the spell protections let look in here it the last place so the two teens buried their heads in the dark wood shelves nothing not even a sock draco said pulling himself free me either except wait hmm come here you i right here alex not you she snapped this this got it alex reappeared holding a very thin book she and draco exchanged matching grins jackpot a n first if i ve already given draco a middle name i dontremember it so review and let me know second i know i said i d finish moody house this chapter but due to things beyond my control mostly my beta demanded i not post certain things without her approval and she hasntread that tiny bit yet the end of it will be a very short first scene in the next chapter third snape is absolutely and 100 in the next chapter heck he in half the scenes i think woot a n hiya gentle folks i back and as you may notice this chapter is nice and long too i plan on trying to put more stuff in each chapter so i donthave to write as many of them anyway me and my beat jaylyn gilfer bustinex who you may know as the creator of tania sat down and talked about it and we ve decided this story plot thiong is very complicated and we will eventually be explaining it in a series of fics all entitled behind a veil of silver and green whoever like the title of this will change to behind alex bellmonte each one based off a different pure blood story but that far in the future read on but they re all just potion ingredients that is weird beyond belief i believe it knowing moody though i really don t i d say he d hide the directions to the potions somewhere else alex sighed well that it then a whole bunch of nothing but make a copy of it he shrugged duplicate a spell in english she shook her head as he replaced the original book to it spot never mind i dontwant to think that much right now i wouldntanswer your questions anyway draco replied leading the way down the stairs that why i dontwant to talk about it now i donthave the energy for a drawn out torture session she pulled open the back door and bowed mockingly ladies and those who scream like girls first scoffing draco preceded her outside the sun had already begun to disappear but there was still light in the sky what done is done alex said deeply in a tongue that was right where ancient french and latin blended return it to what it was beside her draco said the same thing first in pure french then pure latin it was a different kind of spell making than taught at hogwarts it was both more powerful and more dangerous for it tapped directly from the magical gift of the person and could be shaped into anything the witch or wizard wanted so long as they could focus only on the outcome and provided they had the power but a wizard magic is tied to his life done and done good weariness crept into alex tone let get out of here like a cat with a new mouse like alex with a new toy like oh never mind blaise put the metal jar back on the shelf and glanced over his shoulder at tania prowling among the shelves of the apothecary like a kid in a candy store like oh never mind it was almost painfully cute to watch she had a sureness of being a purpose a fire about her that betrayed her this was her element give alex a puzzle or problem and she lit up the same way heck give blaise himself a new language or new runes and he did the same they all had their muses and all obeyed these powerful ladies with their souls perhaps that was another part of what it was to be slytherin shaking himself free of his too deep thoughts blaise selected another jar and glanced at the label featherfern he d never heard of it carefully unscrewing the cap blaise peered at the grayish green powder and then gingerly sniffed interesting it s it just like unfortunately blaise never finished his sentence a blasting sneeze obliterated it from the knowledge of mankind unfortunately again the blast blew more of the ingredient which still hovered before blaise nose up into his face so he sneezed again but blaise was smart enough to remove the jar from around his face before these set in however the fit did not abate and so he let loose a third time and a forth it was after the fourth train wreck of a sneeze that tania looked over sharp brown eyes took in the entire predicament and she frowned quickly crossing to stand in front and a little to the side of him tania absently offered him a handkerchief with one hand while plucking the jar from him with the other featherfern it was a gentle scoff that blended seamlessly with her exasperated sigh retrieving the lid tania screwed it on and replaced the jar on the shelf before turning her back to blaise and walking to the far wall once there she spent several long sneeze filled moments studying the contents of the shelves before selecting a small vial a second later the small glass round was very nearly shoved up blaise left nostril and blaise frantically trying to breathe in and around his sneezing inhaled some quite by accident his fit ended as suddenly as it began he smiled gratefully as he wiped his streaming nose and eyes with her handkerchief tania merely went about the business of re corking the vial about to offer her the cloth back blaise stopped in mid motion and shrugged sheepishly i ll have that cleaned for you he said as he pocketed the white square you should be profoundly grateful that miss dethart pays attention when i teach her something mister zabini and that she knows that downis counteracts the severe allergic reaction humans have to powdered featherfern from his place beside the counter obviously in the act of paying for a purchase professor snape eyed his two students quite nearly amused you however should know after three years in my class not to stick your nose in any random potion ingredient you come across blaise grinned endearingly at his head of house yes sir but you know i ve always been the dull sort only when it suits you mister zabini turning his gaze from his adorably errant student to his silent one snape lifted one hand in beckon mistress deliney i would like to introduce to you miss tania dethart the thin woman behind the counter eyed the small girl who obeyed her professor and came to join their group a pleasure miss dethart likewise tania responded automatically dipping a polite curtsey she will likely be as good a customer for you as i snape said shattering the feminine courtesy of the moment belatedly blaise walked over and joined then leaning casually on the counter deliney raised an eyebrow at snape comment and gave tania a much more thorough look the girl was small fragile looking but she was smart she could listen and recall direction and she could keep her head under strange and unusual circumstances as the experience just now had shown and on top of that she was self contained entirely within her skin unlike the boy who currently seemed to be oozing over the countertop perhaps she would do severus tended to know what he was talking about she ll also be coming to pick up packages for me from time to time alanna snape continued catching the shopkeeper eye as you never tell me how much you ll be getting in kindly let her have it even if i haventgive her enough to cover the full price of the ingredient i ll take care of the difference when i visit you next it took alanna a moment a moment she was somewhat ashamed of to figure out what he meant but eventually it dawned on her the girl was poor sell her whatever she needed at as low a price as she d accept and snape would cover the difference of course i wouldntimagine doing anything different she snapped as if offended while inwardly she sighed that man was the biggest softie on the planet wizard or muggle it was a good thing the girl already had a boyfriend otherwise she would start crushing on her professor and poor severus had no clue how to handle those when they came his way blaise glanced out the windows at the sky you dontneed to rush or anything but we only have maybe another forty five minutes until curfew tania quite snape added as tania looked longingly around the store you ll see more than enough of this place doing my errands miss dethart i assure you but i do believe miss bellmonte will be finished with her project by now this last was pointed significantly at blaise who shot his head of house a startled look sighing but agreeing tania began to head for the door blaise hovering just behind after they left snape collected his purchase i afraid i must be going as well of course see you soon severus alanna said to his back as he departed ya big softie and if he heard her additive he never said bath alex moaned for the sixth time since they d come into sight of the castle clean socks draco supplied he seemed to have more energy than her and so was able to come up with different and more bizarre replies to her plea for a bath merlin i so want a bloody bath and i want a new hair color oh look the door they slipped back into the castle by the same door they d exited from taking care as they skirted corners and slipped down hallways to avoid being seen by the first and second years still here luckily most of the student body was still in hogsmeade they made it to the dungeons unseen they were home free they mister malfoy miss bellmonte i afraid i missed you both in hogsmeade today alex winced and froze as draco turned around to face their newest problem professor yes and then i got to thinking what could possibly draw the two of you away from the delights of the place well it was obvious with you miss bellmonte you had a puzzle to solve but draco what could have taken you from hogsmeade it made quite a question alex sighed too tired to be stung by the insinuation that she was predictable professor snape please is there a point snape looked down at the pair a forbidding something radiating from him then i thought he continued in a much softer much more terrifying voice what project could alex have that would draw draco away from the fun there really are only a few goals the two of you share only one worth missing a trip to hogsmeade so that makes me wonder what exactly you two were doing about your moody problem professor draco said again but snape waved him silent but as you are both alive and as long as you promise me you did nothing you will be caught for what i do not know will not hurt you alex paused unwilling to make a promise that she couldntkeep especially to snape apparently draco felt the same way after a few minutes of soul searching and memory combing and glancing at each other they nodded yes sir we wontbe caught good i suggest you both get cleaned up the rest of your classmates should be returning in the next forty minutes yessir thank you sir together the turned and began to finish their trek to common room one thing snape called after them i wontbe available for a period of time next monday afternoon i afraid i have to meet with professor moody right after classes to discuss the detentions of hunter dethart and his gang unfortunately the man is so paranoid he has a silence spell around his office nothing can get in or out i will be entirely unavailable for half an hour at least with a silent sweep of his robe snape moved away d did you hear him alex whispered as they dashed down the last hall towards the portrait i did he just told us when to search moody classroom i know tania blaise began after they crossed the threshold to the castle tania eyed him discretely he was practically twitching but of course she thought just a little bitterly alex should be done with her project by now may i see myself back to common room she heard herself ask quietly and then followed it with the quick cover up if you dontmind blaise nearly melted with relief of course not i would never impose tania offered him a tiny smile and walked away towards the dungeons pausing at one of the corners she looked back and saw greg and vince had joined her companion their heads bent close together so she d been right draco was in on this in fact he was probably with alex at this moment tania once again found herself getting caught up in what this project could possibly entail it must be something big to include that many of her housemates her mind working furiously tania paced rapidly into common room she didntstop as she crossed the empty space after all no one would be in here now the first and second years would all be out running around and everyone else was still in hogsmeade her thoughts and her body were brought to an unexpected stop as she ran into a pair of legs a quick glance followed the thin stocking clad extremities from were they sat propped on the low table up to where the rest of one alex bellmonte lay collapsed on the couch hello tania m dear she drawled tiredly how was hogsmeade interesting tania answered safely dying to add how was your secret project with blaise i imagine she paused and let loose a jaw splitting yawn imagine it would be come sit gingerly taking the seat alex was patting tania tried to figure out what to say did blaise splurge at honeyduke s the older girl asked neatly solving her problem tania laughed silently and humorlessly i wouldntknow he certainly spent more money than i she paused and rephrased than most of my year mates have ever seen good old blaise and let me guess he insisted on buying everything you wanted because you are with him tania nodded flushing again at the memory merlin his bloody code thingy gets annoying doesntit alex yawned again taking advantage of the momentary break in questions tania decided to get the focus off herself and asked so how was your day boring yet somehow hard i blame alex draco commented dryly plodding his way down the stairs from the boys dorm his hair wet you do that alex replied without a hint of a fight tania made a mental note but she wasntabout to keep up her chatter in front of draco malfoy everyone knows everyone yes alex asked waving a hand between the two of them tania dethart draco vice versa etc so forth i introduced her to you alex draco put in leaning against the wall at the bottom of the stairs oh so very long ago it suddenly struck tania that he didnt look massively ill which meant it was a cover story probably but if it was why was he calling his own bluff had someone else started the rumor should she tell them before she could work up her nerve the faint sound of voices from the hallway outside decided her before she could think looooooong before she could think tania dashed across the room and slipped her arms around draco waist so she was supporting him on one side please mister malfoy she said urgently you shouldntbe up you ve been very sick all day that why you werentin hogsmeade draco froze and stared at her for a minute while tania listened to the voices coming closer she didntknow why it was a secret but it was important to people people she wasntadmitting might be important to her blaise and alex at least understanding flashed across two faces at once and alex scrambled up bed go she hissed even as draco started back up the stairs at top speeds tania gratefully let him go allowing herself a grin of triumph when he disappeared from sight as the returning crowd from hogsmeade poured into the room tania saw alex mouth a silent thank you and disappear up to her own dorm the stillness of night was shattered silently and unnoticed as an even heavier blackness descended on the place overhead stars winked to each other in their normal dance but this too went unnoticed in the putrid pit that was knockturn alley after dark on the left master an insignificant squeak informed turning as directed the shadowy face of wizarding terror eyed the building before him tall enough to hold three stories though it only housed two it was something of an abnormality on this row all around it storefronts leaned in over the thin strip of pavement but the seemingly eternal bookstore leaned back and away separate from its neighbors the storefront would have been respectable in diagon alley or even hogsmeade yet it was this place only that held the darkest of knowledge that the dark lord himself sought gliding silently to the right of the building voldemort found the back stairs they were amusingly enough invisible as if such a spell would stop him chuckling softly anticipation rolling through him like adrenaline voldemort stepped forward and walked casually up the stairs no one could see down below he heard wormtail scramble to follow he chuckled again if the little creature could manage it he would be much surprised at the top of the twisted metal steps lay the only door to the second level of this place it too was invisible looking at it like it were an erring child and he it compassionate parent voldemort walked through the entrance the pressure of the wood was a fleeting pain added to all the other agonies he lived with continually he ignored it so this is where you live little foe he asked by this point thoroughly enjoying himself jackle twisted in his dreams nightmares of a kind that never came to the old wizard he had seen so much that he could not survive the memories of it like normal people could and his mind knew this safely locking away all of his dark dreams hello it was spoken softly almost kindly lifting the old man from his tortured dreams jackle looked up with a half smile at the shadow shrouded man leaning over him for a moment he thought it was the crawling thief from earlier the smell was much the same but the eyes of his visitor told him different they were swirling irises of black green and blood red alight just now with anticipation and pure desire who are you he demanded tucking his hand beneath his blanket for his wand someone who is very interested in obtaining your collection the man replied casually oh are you feeling around for this i found it earlier and am quiet adept at using it would you like me to show you lifting a translucent hand that grasped jackle wand firmly the man creature thing smiled waiting huddled against the corner of the building for his master to reappear wormtail shivered with cold above him barely noticed but as a light to see his dark surroundings by the stars passed night crept ever onward despite his fear the cold and the awkwardness of his position wormtail felt himself pulled once and again towards sleep then all of a sudden the building at his back seemed to shiver with him one big massive heave like a breath held too long being loosed and beside him appeared a heavy iron stair leading up to a door high above his head lurching to his feet his legs complaining as they had at least succumbed to sleep the small man moved up onto the first step from above him the door slammed silently open and a far too familiar face peered out come voldemort demanded angrily as if wormtail had failed him in some way is he dead milord wormtail asked dashing up to his master dealt with came the cold reply now that i have fixed your blundering find me what i want y yes master a n icky nasty yuck i hate writing for voldie moving on review reposted 12 04 07 fixing bad spelling bad grammar and other typos etc etc lady bellmonte draco flashed her a charming smile is alex in of course draco darling deana bellmonte then proceeded to do the thing she d been doing to draco since before he could walk she patted him gently on the top of his head she out back follow me draco followed her out to the balcony he d met alex on a few nights ago and then down some steps at the far end of it the bellmonte vast gardens lay before him alex walking among the flowering trees her unbound hair glinting faintly blue in the sunlight alex her mother called beckoning her over alex glanced up and obediently moved towards them draco has come to pay you a visit draco smirked to himself when he noticed alex step had faltered at the use of his name he offered alex a charming smile and a mocking wave when she met his eyes good afternoon draco alex offered him a smile but nothing else she turned to her mother if you dontmind we ll hang out in the garden mother that fine just stay within view of the manor i ll talk to you again before you leave mr malfoy deana disappeared back into the house acting for all the world like this wasnta hell freezing over type event two conversations with draco malfoy in three days and you seeking me out to what do i owe this pleasure alex led the way confidently through a maze of plant lined pathways extending her stride to keep a little a ahead of him at all times your comment the other night brought to light a gaping hole in the relationships between our two families and you decided to fix that alex glanced over at him dryly what kind of relationship do you think we re supposed to be having come now alex draco was acting quite superior and enjoying every minute of it the malfoys and the bellmontes have been allies since the dark ages surely the heirs to our two houses should at least be on speaking terms what this alex mimed astonishment have you suddenly grown a social conscience is that so shocking draco raised an eyebrow i d as soon say you ve developed a heart draco moved ahead of her a few feet and plucked a pink rose from one of the bushes like it or not alex he turned and offered her the flower i ve made it my mission to learn everything i can about you alex smiled and accepted the rose while his fingers were still caught in hers she reached up with her other hand and grabbed hold of his ear yanking it down on level with her mouth the more you know the shorter your life will be i may be a girl and i may be your age but i am a bellmonte why dontyou start by learning that she released him and he laughed oh i ve never forgotten what you are alex it the only reason you re not in chains alex smirked and jerked her head towards the house kinky we should head back before mother comes looking for you draco matched her smirk as a beautiful lady once said kinky he bowed after you you ll have to choose draco she commented airily no man in history has ever been able to handle two bellmonte women and my father the jealous type alex paused on the grass ahead of him of course it would be funny to watch him blow you up in fact i highly recommend you develop a taste for older women draco glared at her retreating back before running to catch up how was it that she always managed to turn his perfect comebacks against him they burst from the gardens near the front of the house as opposed to the back where they d entered deana bellmonte came out the front door is everything alright she drawled without any real concern we re fine mother truly draco has an appointment he needs to get to he just wanted to stop by and make sure we d all recovered from the ball alex glared at draco from over her mother shoulder daring him to call her liar draco smirked not caring her lie only supported his casting him in a better light to her parents i am afraid i donthave the time i d like to spend with you today i will make it up to you both if you ll forgive me for dashing off draco wasntsure when the last time was that he d had this much fun he hadntplayed society boy for years and the fact that there was revenge at the end of this game only made it better of course we forgive you how could we help but not stop by any time draco you re always welcome here deana waved at draco retreating form there was a pile of galleons at the guard booth for the front gate all you had to do was say the name of your destination while picturing it and the pre made port key would calibrate to your chosen destination never let it be said that the bellmonte did not accommodate their guests the instant he disappeared from view deana turned to her daughter all niceness gone from her being why are you getting visits from draco malfoy that last just long enough for threats to be exchanged and no longer you needntfear mother we merely exchanged pleasantries he seems to think that we he and i should be friends in order to continue the family tradition of alliance see that you become nothing more than friends we are allies with malfoys we do not trust malfoys and we do not marry malfoys again mother alex voice took on an edge you need not fear i could never trust draco malfoy and i have no intention of marrying him blondes arentmy type alex flashed a cold smile and disappeared into the house deana watched her go i think i d better have a talk with her father the first thing i ever thought about franklin was red heads arentmy type disturbed deana went to find her red haired husband a n la la i have nothing to say arentyou all happy about it too just a little time line update somewhere within the next 5 8 chapters we ll get to the yule ball lots of tania fun in that little party too anyway the point is yes we are making some progress if you could see my list of scenes to be written you d know that oh yeah a quick question does anyone want to know what i think alex and blaise look like cause if so i ll go through the trouble of uploading the pics i ve found and posting the urls for you all there were no mixed reactions to go with their mixed success instead a quiet grim determination to get on with it infected the conspirators but of course none of this could be talked about at table monday morning for breakfast and of course there was little that hadntbeen talked to death on sunday the day dawned with a bright warmth that heralded a break in the chill for which the entire student body was thankful and little other fanfare getting up a little later than usual alex trooped to the required breakfast as obediently as she did anything waiting for her was the usual people the usual chatter and the usual food she ignored a yawn that threatened her social face and chose a seat then a pear morning lex blaise alex draco oh and good morning tania very quietly morning alex anyway alex couldntthink of anything to add and so left her sentence as it was silent as ever greg and vince joined their merry band of not so morning people the overall mood wasntdisturbed in the least by the pale flutter of a couple dozen wings the daily prophet had begun to deliver at off times from the rest of the mail alex glanced up long enough to see draco owl swoop in gracefully before returning to her pear after all as a bellmonte she certainly didntget her information from a newspaper she grinned at her own conceit a brown barn owl completely ordinary in everyway so that it was impossible to find any defining marks on it flew in unnoticed with the rest of the birds it paused only a second over alex and dropped it thick envelope onto the empty plate next to hers before exiting with the rest of the small flock she didnthave time to do more than split the heavy wax seal before draco caught her attention with the hint of strain in his voice listen it was command and request but it pulled in the attention of every slytherin in earshot unexplained and unsolvable these are the words on everyone lips at least those who know for those of you who don t i ll explain on the quiet end of knockturn alley is a small unassuming shop known as jackle s but as unassuming as the establishment is it list of clientele is filled with the famous infamous or both among them some of the most known names of our time and everyone who shopped there knew the owner a small unassuming man in his own right was meleris jackle was an unidentifiable voice asked speaking the discrepancy they all recognized instantly read hunter dethart ordered silencing any other comments with a stern look late sunday afternoon a long time friend of jackle came by to pick up an order of books his daughter had placed and after ringing the bell several times with no response went around the back of the building once there he saw several set of footprints in the mud knowing that jackle never used the back set of stairs to reach his apartment as there was another more convenient set inside lord bellmonte raced in to find the body of his childhood friend sprawled across his bedroom floor it was a tragic scene to behold the infamous reclusive lord being supported by his wife as the ministry investigators questioned him before a backdrop of the body being removed from the apartment what killed him is unknown says coroner wizard giri legunus as far as i can tell he was either tortured to death without the tiniest trace left upon him body of mind or he was frightened to death the ministry refuses to give a statement other than saying that the investigation is underway and as usual no one can reach either of the bellmontes for comment several of his best customers had this to say about the man untimely death draco looked up from the paper the rest is absolute drivel all quotes from idiots who actually admit to being good customers worse this is a minor commentary on the 12th page a frown passed its way around the table most of them had been to jackle at least once no one had ever disliked the man which was saying something i was wondering how they managed to get all that past the ministry truth it might be but it isntexactly the ministry line a pretty seventh year tara cromwell commented softly alex had a sudden desire to know what was in the large unmarked envelope but she was too well trained to open it now the name bellmonte had been brought up twice already if her parents hadntcome forward with the family line yet then she wasntgoing to get involved she carefully slid the package onto her lap and out of sight as around her the table fell into a lively discussion of ways to kill without leaving a mark the day went by normally enough first was a brief stint in care of magical creatures there was confusingly homework handed out at the end of the class this was an event that had yet to occur this year and as such certainly surprised quite a few people alex spent her short lunch break pouring over the monster book of monsters and all other magical creature texts as she ate homework always coming before personal study unfortunately after that came a rather stressful transfigurations lesson the class made stressful merely because there were gryffindors and cactuses involved but it was nothing out of the ordinary and if the unopened envelope in her book back burned in her mind every second of it well alex was too well trained to reveal it the time between transfigurations and dinner was absolutely consumed by a frantically methodical scribbling indeed most of her professors would have been amazed at how quickly she turned out her usual o level papers unfortunately she had several as the planning for a certain weekend fieldtrip had forced her to procrastinate ancient runes care of magical creatures and history of magic flew from her ink stained fingers she condensed her notes and wrote up a comprehensive outline for her potions paper but professor snape knew her work far too well to rush and as for arithmancy well it was mostly impossible to rush through arithmancy anything but the work wasntdue for another three days anyway dontbe late for dinner if you please pansy said over her shoulder as she straightened her hair back to utterly perfect proportions alex straightened up and carefully placed her quill back in it stand she picked up a book as she stood here pansy turned and took back her book with a tiny frown thank you for the loan alex said blithely aware that pansy had merely left it out not loaned it to her that she was getting it back was a thank you for her reminder of the time and pansy knew it it wasntwhy she d spoken though the surprise in her eyes said as much which brought up the why had she said anything question a shrug and a walk later alex was in the great hall dying to race back to her dorm and pull a certain envelope out from under her bed but pansy whispered to herself staring at the copy of magical mis uses of money alex bellmonte didntreply to her half spoken question alexandra bellmonte was gone to dinner where pansy should be damn it why had she said anything if miss bellmonte was late to dinner what did it matter to pansy she was new money she was new blood she wasntin alex echelon she wasnton her level alex had made that much clear on the day she d walked into the dorm for the very first time after sorting pansy had been the only one who d arrived having known no one to chat with in common room she d taken the bed all the way to the right alex took one look at her and chose the bed all the way on the left damn it she snarled hurling the book onto her bed i hate this i want to go home but home was no refuge for pansy and she knew her own stupidity even as she said it dammit pansy went down to dinner one two three alex rapped three times on the door and settled her hands on her hips waiting impatiently one two three four the door opened faint light spilled into the pitch dark hallway and she snapped blaise i need t oh vince absently scratched his bare chest as he looked down at her stifling a yawn he stepped back and ushered her inside alex fell to blinking rapidly and absolutely refusing to let herself blush it would seem arithmancy had taken her longer than she d thought all four boys were sleeping or trying to it would also seem that at least the fourth year boys didntwear shirts to bed from what she could see of greg and draco as they both sat up and blinked sleepily they might be wearing even less as alex was taking in that set of visuals vince crossed to yet another bed and reaching into the mass of blankets grabbed a handful of blaise hair he then used said hair to lever blaise to a sitting position from the lack of protest alex was forced to come to the strange conclusion that it wasntan unusual occurrence talk vince grunted eloquently jerking a thumb in blaise direction while seeking his own mattress crap so much for subtleness pulling herself up and calling on her best dimple alex flashed a brilliant smile hi boys there was a chorus of groans and someone unknown alex would ve put money on draco muttered a few interesting words about her a pillow and a confrontation at high speeds blaise answered her smile with one of his own and climbed out of bed with a groan of alright lex i coming alex had to blink again blaise definitely didntwear anything to bed between that and the sleepy grin she d just seen alex began to pray that tania had a strong heart to her a few minutes and some clothes later they were in the dimly lit hallway outside the boys dorms so blaise demanded grumpily hmph alex crossed her arms if you re going to be like that about it then i think i ll wait til morning woman blaise growled warningly you just woke me up at whatever ungodly hour this is i am standing here barefoot on this blisteringly cold stone floor for you talk merlin but you re cute when you re grumpy grumpy clever lex he fought and lost to a yawn ge on with it she sighed and proffered a thick brown envelope he vaguely remembered her getting at breakfast what this he demanded suspiciously even as he took and pulled out a sheaf of papers it would seem that my parents decided to include me in family business again alex wrinkled her nose it would seem the death of jackle is now family business if the ministry doesntsolve it we will and blaise trailed off his question answered as he flipped through the papers which included copies of the coroner report all the notes from all aspects of the investigation and several pages written in lady bellmonte familiar hand detailing a list of possible suspects motives and means see anything you like alex teased lex what you said this was family business yes i did what your point she settled back on her heels and frowned at him why are you showing this to me a glare joined the frown you re family she stated ferociously your parent gave you permission to include me the flash in her green eyes answered his question quite adequately even as alex repeated you re family so blaise suddenly felt very tired gods the girl was exhausting do you want to go over this now no alex looked profoundly disappointed we re going to have to dance our way out of this one anyway we ll talk later when your room mates arentcounting the minutes gotcha blaise covered another yawn what should we tell them i had a nightmare you dontlook like you ve been asleep and if you really had a nightmare we d lie to cover it up fine umm alex yawned and glared at blaise again he sighed of course it was his fault she d yawned he carefully replaced the papers into the envelope and handed it back to her you had a question about your ancient runes homework that due tomorrow so i behind in my schoolwork sure why not she shook her head and hugged him night lex he whispered holding her close night blaisey boy he dropped a quick kiss on her hair and disappeared back into his dorm a n there it is isntit pretty now please excuse me mybox set of all of the gundam wing episodes just arrived in today mail i need ot go watch them a n okay then i ve never gotten around ot doing this so i figured it was about time to thank all of my wonderful reviewin type people i adore you all seriously that said i have also decided to speak to answer any questions or comments i found especially important in various reviews and yes some of this is quite old you ll have to for give me so a huge thanks to fire sprite 14 fireblade k chona sheepdawg jamesismysweetheart severiona black wanamaker lala the panda hidden relevance ozalan chaotic reign bubbles jadzania linthilde carbonmonoxide smidgens katie flamingamulet mz malfoy evilstrawberry ehlonna now then here them question things when this set since everyone except the detharts are harry age this is during goblet of fire oh poor draco lucius is a stupid bastard agreed just one question what was alex motivation for telling draco that she trusted him was it cuz she a little scared or is she trying to convince herself or something else that i missed cuz i silly like that well i dontknow 100 myself it just came out of her mouth and to be honest it felt like it needed saying she doesntlike him mostly barely knows him but when it comes down to him or the rest of the world she d pick him cause he a slytherin and they understand each other poker night please tell more well let me put it this way at some point this spring nad by that i mean the spring i nthe story the slytherin girls will be having a sleepover poker night thingy in common room no boys allowed enter at your own peril at some point blaise may try and crash it we ll all just have to wait and see if he survives the experience i think you made draco middle name lucious entirely possible and thanks so much for the help many most fanfics do give him his father name as a middle name so i might have taken the easy way out as it is a friend of mine is just starting to read my stuff so if she comes across me actually giving him that as a middle name i ll fix it if not i ll just stick with the one i have the only reason you donthave a million zillion lotsa lotsa reviews is beacuse your story is not on any of the popular pairings you know i really want to say thanks for saying that i was wondering about my lack of reviews and was blaming several other things but now that you say it that really does make sense when i go looking for fics to read i search for pairings i like makes sense everyone else would too by the way i would love to know how you picture alex and blaise you donthappen to have a visual of tania too do you oh yeah lots of pics of everybody no one that was in the movies though they re all under my profile at the very bottom it was easier than trying to post all those links in my ans if i left out someone then please let me know and i ll do my best to find post a pic of them thanx for the update and also thanx for being so regular with your updates my pleasure it kinda a head rush this is the longest thing i ve ever written and that includes the work i ve doen on any one of my novels or even my trilogies put together i was also wondering if there is some sort of secret romance between blaise and alex no really emphatically no they are and will remain brother and sister when i get around to writing blaise story which i will eventually you ll understand that better draco n alex have got 2 get 2getha i know i know i working on it but the two of them are just so stubborn i can promise you some good stuff in hmm five chapters or rather four plus this one i going with you this time blaise leaned across the bed alex was once more inside the boys dorm ready to do battle alex shrugged sure and dontyou give me tha he pulled himself up sharply and looked like he was going to hit her she grinned why do you do that to me because i cant help myself alex flopped across the bed next to blaise with a small oof it an ingrown urge at this point agreed draco said his back to them both as he selected a shirt from his wardrobe now did you really have strategy to discuss or was that just an excuse to get past the door guard are you implying that i merely wanted to see if i could catch another glimpse of your drool worthy flesh before breakfast she sighed and shook her head sorrowfully sorry to have to be the one to tell you this draco but you re a dandy and dandies look best in their clothes not out of them the door guard smirked vince right along with him though no one could see his face the tensing of draco back gave away his annoyance the way his expression never would have alex almost felt sorry for her remark almost male egos were so fragile seriously lex it early blaise groaned not so early you all werentup and out of the shower when i got here you cant blame me for waking you up girl has a point why thank you vince he sketched her a bow my pleasure i really just wanted to stop by and see if any of you thought we needed a better plan then you three go right and we ll go left that sounds fine with me draco voice was briefly muffled by a crisp white shirt though i suggest we include a donttouch that and shut up clause she nodded and stood good then i can go eat my morning fruit i pairing up with you though lex blaise stated firmly seeming yet again to expect a fight again she shrugged makes sense i already trained draco so he should know what to look for hey i off to eat my fruit alex said in a sing song voice speaking over and ignoring draco indignation see you down there boys with a wave and a grin she slipped out the door draco gave up his sputtering and sank onto his bed with a sigh you think she ll ever get tired of getting that reaction out of me he asked almost rhetorically pulling a sock naw blaise replied grinning not as long as you keep playing it up like that draco matched his dorm mate grin with one of his own oh good she so much fun to mess with especially when she thinks she winning vince snorted i dontthink she d be any fun at all if she didntthink she was winning please and blaise was all in earnest dont make her lose greg and vince exchanged looks as draco lifted an eyebrow at their last dorm mate blaise usually wasntso quiet protective she blaise seemed to be debating with himself over what to say and not say she doesnthandle it well and it not just her personality that was all they d get out of him on the matter draco knew that and left it well he said instead if she keeps it up i wonthave to fake losing very often at all she got you there greg put in digging for his shoes and most everywhere else i dare say your faith in your fellow men is somewhat lacking zabini draco drawled indolently i dontdoubt your prowess in any way malfoy i just know lex too well how did that come about vince was curious the zabinis and the bellmontes have no historical connections like they do with the malfoys blaise voice seemed to drop though in reality it didntchange a bit maybe it was his eyes i didntget out a lot when i was little my parents werentbig on handling a toddler and their peers so when i did go to my first party well let just say lex rescued me from who or what he d been rescued from went unsaid though draco had a good idea the bellmontes werentthe only one with connections boys an annoying an all too familiar female voice sounded from the exact top of the stairs uphold the house honor or i ll uphold you grinning the four finished their morning preparation and turned out into the hallway to spot tara cromwell in her usual spot exactly four inches from the top of the staircase hustling and hassling lazy slytherin boys out to breakfast there hadntbeen a single slytherin missing at the morning meal since that incident in tara second year she d made it her mission and done a good job at it draco had been on her bad side only once and had made a point of rising early since then she was just that kind of scary umm professor henrietta laurence lifted her hand above her head in an unconsciously graceful movement this group of hufflepuffs shared several of the core classes with the slytherins and had learned as the gryffindors hadn t that if you left the slytherins alone they would return the favor it was no longer a thing of terror to speak up in a class filled with them and so the question moody turned amazingly enough both eyes on the girl in inquiry sir may i ask why are there only three unforgivables there are a ton of really evil nasty spells so she trailed off moody looked thoughtful sir if i may draco drawled lifting his own hand slightly and though he nodded agreement the professor frowned as if to warn draco away from something whatever it was draco couldnttell so he just started talking i completely agree with you henrietta the number of truly evil curses is appalling what really sets the three apart is ability ability the hufflepuff asked it without thinking but she was drinking in his every word as were most of the class and so didntseem to notice yes when it comes right down to it anyone can perform an unforgivable really this from moody challenging of course professor blaise leaned back in his chair and picked up the thread of conversation we were so interested in the subject that we did a whole ton of research on them it would seem according to the transcripts from the original council meeting where they decided what to include on the list that all you need to use an unforgivable effectively is to want it badly enough well that and the spell word you have to really desire the other person pain or death or whatever alex waited until he nodded at her on his last word before adding her own two bits most other curses however nasty the effects are are much harder to perform and control it would take a great deal of time and training to learn even a few and even then if you dontdo it exactly right you might just get caught up in it yourself oh moody tried not to sound condescending and failed his sharp tones were noticed by the whole class and even the hufflepuffs looked at him in surprise and annoyance i find it hard to believe that the lot of you arentmerely making this up off the top of your heads and lastly pansy of all people spoke up her eyes flashing with dislike would examples satisfy you professor because some of the spells in far distant fourth and beyond are known at least in theory to me tied for forth were the sock spell and the heartbreaker penitus externus which quite literally turns the victim inside out and viscus intorqueo which literally translated means twisted heart it twists squeezes the victims heart until it explodes within them but the only reported uses of those two were in 1816 during the domburian murders and in 1876 when the great grandfather of i see you really have done your homework moody cut in sharply well aware that she was going to bring his own ancestors into this very well we ll continue this discussion next class you re all dismissed standing with the rest of the students draco waded his way through his own kind to the others lady henrietta he started gallantly that was a good question she froze along with all of her friends to stare at him th thank you malfoy her voice drained of all color when his eyebrows twitched at the use of his last name surely not all the school had taken up that annoying little habit of harry potter s i rather enjoyed an intelligent discussion during class when one studies with gryffindors one is often left to fend for one self i i thank you she stammered again excuse me then without another word or glance the whole group swept off leaving him alone draco began to feel that ache in his chest again but the next instant greg and vince had found him again and zabini shot him a sympathetic look from his seat draco swallowed the agony of isolation and rejoined his group his very small group inflammo tergum a nice choice pansy but dontyou think that it would be a little obvious i mean human torches tend to light up quite a bit of space pansy smiled frostily at alex statement well there is always tergum emoveo tergum emoveo draco put in never heard of it oh alex wasnt paying him any attention at all as she answered that one skins the victim alive i must say out all of the top ten though decerpo renovo has got to be my favorite it tricky but the effect is both subtle and spectacular if you cast it correctly it will undo any magical healing the victim has ever had done if he broke his arm when he was three then it ll rebreak it really snape stopped beside their group who were all very aware that moody was eavesdropping on them and lifted an eyebrow interesting the last person i knew who tried to learn it ended up not only resistant to healing magic but actually reversed it he cut himself and when he tried to heal he cut himself again pansy asked having grasped his meaning only a second before the rest so i was told but i believe class is over yes sir professor they all replied meekly standing and gathering their books as one the slytherins trooped out into the hallway an interesting class pansy commented i know alex agreed i was happily surprised i so proud of our hufflepuffs they re learning well with us around so much they d kind of have to wow the two of you are actually agreeing on something draco looked from one girl to the other and smiled they didn t instead both stiffened as if only just now realizing what they d been doing and with whom exchanging heated glares that almost hissed pansy whirled on her heel and stalked off alex turned her glare on draco you bloody bastard come on let get this over with blaise held the classroom door open for her careful to stay out of reach of her claws which were at the moment fully extended both professors had disappeared and the office was shut we donthave much time draco muttered to his two friends ya think greg drawled you donthave much time to live either if that look bellmonte gave you was any indication oh shut up i ll deal with alex later you do that alex whispered her mouth just behind his left ear draco just about jumped out of his skin where did you learn to move so silently he hissed she laughed not nicely either you d like to know come on blaise the boy was right about one thing we dont have a lot of time they split off to the left side of the room their actions and spells had to be a great deal more subtle this time as they were only feet from the man himself but with three more competent searchers they still managed good speed low two shelf bookcases ran the length of the room and these along with the students desks were quickly cleared but then he would ve been stupid to hide something there almost every book was moved or looked at every week by various classes in the natural course of things draco and his group ended up with the wardrobe the one that had once held a boggart in professor lupin era alex wrinkled her nose she d liked lupin in many ways he d reminded her of snape but she had no time herself she and blaise had gotten moody desk oh joy papers papers homework more homework well what did you expect blaise alex muttered sighing admissions of guilt to a dozen murders anything worth copying yeah just those i got it almost before the spell word was out of her mouth snape voice filled her ears very well i will inform my students shit shit shit draco she threw a balled scrap of parchment at him it hit in the back of his head and he whirled eyes blazing the spell she mouthed gesturing at the office door it was still closed we have to go clutching her copies in one hand alex other arm was grabbed by blaise who hauled her out of the room i was coming anyway blaise she snapped in the relative safety of a hallway two away from the classroom and what about the desk i had already put everything back and draco if he gets caught now why would i do that alex fumed at being cut off twice in two sentences but the sight of all three other boys lifted a weight of worry draco oh by the way i have another reason why we should do this not that we need one really alex curiosity killed her anger for the moment after you left as we moved to the door we heard moody say and i quote one of these days severus we ll finish what we started when i gave you that scar on your arm moody is after snape you were wrong draco we need this one with this if we need we can get any other slytherin to help and besides it gives me the right to say this and with that alex proceeded to give lie to the idea that ladies had clean mouths calling moody the longest foulest string of insults she could think of well blaise said blinking after she d finished that was informative tell me alex can you really do some of that how would i know i a lady yeah you keep thinking that lex meanwhile standing frozen draco was cracking up hysterically might i suggest he gasped around breaths that we continue this in common room boy has a point onward to count the spoils alex marched off dragging blaise as he had dragged her only moments before i have got to know where she learned some of that vince said in awe following her from me draco flashed his friends a grin at their surprise oh come now what else do you think we talked about on the long walk back from moody house as it turned out the spoils werentmuch a few more lists each as useless as the one found in moody bedroom a couple of other random papers and a letter from an unknown potion emporium telling him that they couldnthave his order ready until next month the stuff draco had gotten was both better and worse better because they didntknow that it was mostly worthless but worse because to be blunt they didnthave a clue what it was it was a strange machine device thing draco had only gotten a passing look at it and while he did manage to cast a copy spell only got a three dimensional picture of the thing it looked mysterious and possibly important but for all they knew it made his morning coffee dammit damn it i want him here alex jabbed a finger at her own palm her hands clenching unconsciously into fists but we have nothing less than nothing because if we re caught with this stuff we re done for damn it all draco sighed rubbing his eyes how your contact doing with his ministry records no go yet moody was an auror i cantjust ask for them plus i going about this without my parents influence or permission for that matter what about yours same same and exactly right without my parents pushing on them well they arent nearly as inspired to help me cantyou just ask you parents greg asked unknown to his friends his home was normal esque no they both shouted at once drawling the attention of their housemates no alex repeated softly i hate to say it like this but if you can even ask that question then you couldntbegin to imagine we can t it was all they d get out of draco the clock on the wall calmly informed the masses that it was dinner time they all stood but alex moved away from the group i not hungry plus i have a carriage load of homework alex vince looked concerned at her come on blaise said softly let go i ll bring you something back lex thanks de nada show off gathering up the evidence alex went up to her room she decided that she had a headache and shut all the blinds sitting on her bed in the dark she sank into dark thoughts of past wrong and future revenge a n i dontknow why i ended it so dark heck i dontknow why i do half of what i do when i writing it all instinct and yeah that should go that way i also dontkno why balise can speak a little spanish maybe it because half the chefs at the restaurant do shrug anyways you all know the drill i ll see you next monday and dontforget to go check out the pics in my profile a n hello folks i have officially fixed my picture links in my profile i seems the old links had percentage signs or somethign in them that the format automatically deletes yuck but i moved the pictures and renamed some thing so as long as your computer is okay with it they should all work i tested them myself also a thought for the day would any of you believe that i procrastinate all week and then sit down every sunday afternoon and pump out the next bellmotne chapter in one sitting cause i do i am massively lazy and that enough thinking for today disclaimer i should put these in more often harry potter owns himself i do not condone slavery and as for draco and everyone else well they dontbelong to me either more the pity i not in the mood franklin we are not discussing it she eight you of all people know what she ll have to try and live up to we should have a backup plan we should have another you re right i know what she has to prove but i am the true bellmonte here franklin we have only one line no secondary branches of the family if alexandria doesntsurvive the tests then you may speak to me about another child his deep green eyes narrowed and the tall strong man that was her father turned his back to his wife with powerful strides he crossed to the door and slammed it open alex who d had her face pressed to the wood peering through the thin crack between the double doors skidded across the marble floor she gasped in pain and clutched at her nose which was now streaming blood alexandria there was as much exasperation as fury in her father voice how many times have we told you not to spy on us alex tried to breath around the taste of blood in her mouth what happening franklin deana had appeared in the doorway alexandria has a bloody nose franklin covered the space between them and took her face in his hands his fingers cautiously probed the offending attribute alex whimpered it isntbroken but he yanked her chin up and forced her mouth open it would seem she also bitten her tongue you re becoming quite a nuisance alexandria you ve gotten blood all over my floor come with me deana grabbed alex wrist pulling her to her feet and out of her father grip the older woman strode off impatiently go think about what you ve done a door was opened and deana yanked alex in front of her so that she stumbled through the heavy downpour immediately began the simple process of soaking her you ll be fetched when you may come back in her mother said seriously alex nodded her father shut the door with a quiet thud alex flipped over spitting hair out of her mouth alexandria it is time you had a pet alex glanced up from her potion wondering how much time this would take she had only a few minutes until she needed to add her mother words sank in a pet two in fact deana stepped forward and held up her hands alex shrank back her gaze flickering between the asp gracing her mother left hand and the tarantula gracing her right i i they will remain on your person for the next two weeks you ve got charge of them i see do you for the next two weeks these lovelies must remain in contact with your skin twenty four hours a day you will feed and do whatever is necessary to care for them they have not had their venom removed if they feel in anyway threatened hungry or any of a dozen other things they ll bite you i assure you it quite deadly alex swallowed and held out her hands i want that potion on time as well yes mother her moan was low and muffled the coast was clear alex sighed in relief inching her way along the rooftop until she came to the apex alex took a deep breath and swung her leg up and over she stopped and shifted her weight as she d been taught in her riding lessons until she found her balance once that was assured she moved forward with her mission all she needed to do was reach the far chimney and the roof tile her right foot had braced against moved alex glanced down at it in horror but it continued to slide taking her foot and her balance with it alex fought desperately making a grab for a hand hold she had one she had it she with the sharp pain of scraped skin and a lost nail the ten year old felt herself falling it was nothing like she thought it would be there was no painful tumbling just a fast sharp slide on her side as she watched the edge approach it came far too soon and then she was plummeting through the air trying to grab for her wand alex landed with a crunch a thud and a scream everything faded into a haze until her mother appeared above her wand out why did you scream she demanded scanning the area as if for enemies i alex croaked i fell deana sharp gaze flew to the roof and she frowned well she said at last your leg looks broken as does your collar bone and probably a few ribs nothing fatal though her eyes narrowed which means you re a lucky idiot mother alex knew she d messed up big and she knew better than to try it again she tried to put all that into her voice hoping her mother would lecture her after she healed her almost every other time she d been willing to no the word was firm alex eyes flew open in shock wh you re ten you ve been training for years you ll be going off to hogwarts soon you can clean this up yourself you should know how as she walked away alex turned over fighting the shortness of breath the pain and the nausea and began to trace a pattern in her own blood with any luck she wouldntpass out more than once before she finished alex kicked out and dimly heard a thud as her comforter hit the floor you really think so smiling with just a hint of shyness alex smoothed her hand over the skirt of her gown only of late had she filled out enough to wear dresses reminiscent of her mother wardrobe i would never lie to a lady but you look a little flushed miss alex i i am a little alex stuttered as her awareness clicked on it was a dream she didnthave this memory to relive when she was awake it only came to her in her dreams and even then she never saw his face perhaps a stroll along the balcony will help you he was all kind refinement one part of her mind classified him as upper merchant class but it made little difference she would probably never know the name of the only person she d ever killed if it wasnta sign of weakness she would have told her parents between them they would ve been able to find a cure it is a kind offer i couldntthink of refusing dammit alex hissed between clenched teeth shivering as the cold night air hit her sweat soaked skin not all of the details in her nightmares were accurate but enough were and once she started dreaming she didntstop not for weeks usually the lesser ones at first and then down the spiral til dammit she rubbed her hands viciously over the back of her neck and dug her nails into the skin under her hair mmmmm she whimpered moving with the nervous energy inspired by adrenaline struggling out of her mattress alex hissed again as her feet hit stone floor the shock was enough to stir her from her emotional haze and back into thought and the one thing she thought was absolute sleep was out of the question feeling around the top of her trunk at the end of her bed for her robe alex knocked a thick book with her wrist damn she dove for it and managed to catch it before it hit the floor and woke her dorm mates well i cantstay here setting the book on the area rug alex opened her trunk and dug out a certain satchel might as well get some of her special homework done since she had the time she d been neglecting it worse than her schoolwork lately the slytherin common room was attractive to her just then in a way that no non slytherin could ever understand it was an island a refuge and a highly defensible fortress all at once but also a place you need never fight for you could breathe in here relax in a way impossible almost everywhere else in the middle of a cold night where sleep brought even colder things to light the empty tables chairs and furniture all lit by the warmly crackling fire both made alex want to burst into tears and kept her from needing to if you ever asked her what her home was she would ve answered bellmonte manor instantly but if you asked her to describe what the word home meant this room would have taken shape in your mind shivering alex walked into the circle of warmth and headed towards a favorite chair all black leather and elegantly overstuffed for comfort halfway there a low growl stopped her in her tracks who what she whirled towards the sound and almost laughed in relief off in one corner so she couldntbe seen from most of the room was a harassed looking tania dethart sitting in the middle of a small sprawl of junk glaring into her trunk the growl had come into being in response to the annoyance that spread over the thin face this time alex couldnthelp herself maybe she was getting hysterical she laughed tania did the expected she jerked up spotted alex and froze hi tania alex changed her destination and moved to join the other girl sorry about laughing but the look on your face i guessing a project isntgoing the way you ve planned something in her words or manner must have struck the right cord because tania reverted back from statue tania no uh i mean you re right she said her tone thick with the annoyance of a moment earlier alex ignored both the tone and tania reaction for the silly girl was sure to think alex would take insult from it instead she dropped her bag onto a nearby couch and asked do you mind if i join you for a bit i have some extra work i need to get done out of sight of course it was graciously said even as tania glanced protectively at her things alex smiled never fear my dear i wontpeek at your notes though if you do need some help with whatever it is in your trunk that has you stumped feel free to ask thank you tania refused politely turning back to her trunk it was around then that alex realized how much she liked tania something about the girl had completely drained her of all the stress and fear left behind by the nightmares it had snapped her back form the emotion faster than anyone but blaise had ever managed not that that many people had ever helped her overcome a nightmare even unknowingly hmm she d have to do something about tania stupid brother though if they were to become actual friends well something to ponder but not when she had work to do pulling open both pain and her notes on the book so far alex settled in for a long night oh bloody blustering the rest of the swear faded away even though looking up alex still saw tania mouth moving what was she working on and what did her trunk have to do with it empty and propped up on end like it was somehow she didntthink it was the nice leather stitching maybe there was a secret compartment but why put in a muggle thing like that you could just ward a portion of the wizarding space and besides if it was a hidden compartment there was a simple spell to find them thoughts of this nature distracted her for a while even though her gaze remained on the pages before her but then something crazy and unthinkable happened tania coughed umm miss bellmonte alex obligingly pulled her nose from her book i i i umm if you have a moment perhaps you could help me with something as she finished tania blushed fiercely but alex noted mostly out of humiliation she doesntlike to ask for help then she did a mental double take tania dethart just asked for help has the world ended without my knowing will a weasley be sorted in slytherin next if i not interrupting not at all tania alex affected an elderly air you re too young to know the value of interruption the only reaction she got was a low snort which may have been amusement anyway alex slid off the couch and grinned what re we working on tania made a small motion aborted almost as soon as it was begun but alex recognized it and laughed silently at the mental image of tania diving protectively over her research never fear she repeated from earlier i give you my most solemn promise and a bellmonte and slytherin that anything related to or involved with your project that is discussed will never go beyond us two furthermore i swear that i will personally torture anyone trying to steal or use your work without your permission and besides alex shrugged lightly you donthave to tell me why you need the information you re asking about her exaggerated melodrama did the trick and tania relaxed again i want to know everything you know about wizarding space tania stated alex blinked do you know how long it ll take to get through all of it she asked then frowned a little we can do it that way but i d hate to waste your time covering things you already know if you could give me a tiny little hint as to what you re looking for well it d all go much faster tania scowled but not at alex directly smoke almost poured from her ears as she thought alex just waited okay and with that one word tania agreed to let alex have a glimpse what do you know about the formation of wizarding space making it umm well supposedly the original owners of never ending came across the perfect formula which has remained a closely guarded secret ever since but i find it unlikely as there are reports of things that could only have taken place thanks to wizarding space from long before the store existed i do know that the amount of space per inch ratio in the never ending inventory is vastly higher than most normal shops which is what makes it so expensive in fact alex scrambled up over the couch and grabbed her satchel here look at that it a birthday gift from my parent a never ending i ve fit most of the contents of my trunk in there before tania obediently took the bag and stuck her hand in it after a second she pulled it back out looking impressed but then her eyes sharpened again what did you mean by space per inch ratio oh alex looked over in surprise well you cantcreate something from nothing even with magic especially not on this magnitude what happens is they take existing space such a as bag or a trunk and use magic to stretch and expand it so your trunk isntany bigger but it can hold more per inch than it could originally tania nodded slowly understanding dawning over her face which means it not a separate area attached to the trunk to keep it in the physical but just the trunk itself does that help at all alex asked knowing it did and that tania was going to dive into a new round of crazed research mm hmm she muttered already neck deep inside trunk if you like i ll clear out my bag and you can have it either for research or to store your stuff while you work on your trunk alex offered stubbornly refusing to be shoved out just yet she didnt want to go back to her own work yet it didntseem nearly as interesting as whatever tania was doing tania pulled herself back out and stared at alex you oh i couldn t you need it to no not really i have other book bags and i ll be deep in this particular text for weeks and wontneed any of my other references here alex grabbed the thing off the floor and stared pulling things out of it by the time she d gotten to the top of her third pile of books tania eyes were round heh you know maybe i ll clear it out and let you have it tomorrow alright good the pile disappeared more rapidly than they d shown up i d hate to have to carry all that upstairs looking from the empty table to the satchel alex suddenly frowned what was i doing your book tania pointed helpfully oh yeah thanks but tania was already lost to the world again and alex followed her example dropping back into her place on the couch a n so i just realized that the whole thing was only two scenes almost one really but it was long enough right well i hope so next chapter the first challenge okay show of hands who forgot this was in the middle of the triwizard tourney a n alright i know that the dungeon duel see the weighing of the wands chapter happened probably before my little adventure to moody house according to the book timeline but i completely forgot about it until now and as i like it and want to explain it i going to put it in now unless you want me to go back and cover it properly but that would mean i d clutter up your email inboxes because i d have to take down maybe 5 10 chapters post the new one and then put them all back up i thinking no on wants that so just go with it what are you getting so upset about blaise demanded giving draco a look it was poor greg who got boils in the face damn right it was greg muttered in annoyance yes but it not right why should i get punished potter pulled his wand on me first draco protested you were wearing that blaise wrinkled his nose as he pointed to draco potter stinks badge and calling his best friend a mudblood what was he going to do ask you out for tea who asking draco for tea alex breezed into the group from the stairs harry potter yep blaise grinned they re planning on starting a business selling signed photos of the two of them snogging they ll both be rich in a week and can retire comfortably they re both rich now and could certainly retire if they wanted to she sipped from the steaming mug in her hand ah i see you re keeping up your usual level of wit draco please tell me those annoying things arentyour idea what draco looked downright disgusted this thing he pulled at his badge not a chance we got them from the hufflepuffs now they are pissed off by all of this i can imagine greg put in but do you really want to rub it in poor potter face like that alex asked taking another drink draco raised an eyebrow poor potter since when well she smiled reasonably he couldnt have done it himself could he i mean his own friends are abandoning him for not admitting he did it he d never lie to them if he had thus it follows that someone is trying to kill him so yes poor harry potter draco blinked to hear his own thoughts so closely repeated he looked over at blaise in time to see him throw alex a strange glance she didntappear to notice what are you children still doing out here professor flitwick looked surprised at the gathering that filled the front hall classes will begin in moments i suggest you all get going as he left the more obedient students started walking with a few dashing in horror towards dorms and forgotten books you heard the man alex linked arms with blaise onward to transfigurations yeah i guess greg muttered he wasnton good terms with professor mcgonagall these days you heard the woman draco exclaimed in parody of alex onward to transfigurations and if he saw the exasperated looks he cronies exchanged over his head he didntlet on you should all know the theory by now draco noticed that the head of gryffindor couldnthelp by glance minutely at greg as she spoke he chuckled silently this is no harder or more complicated than anything else we ve been practicing this year there will be only one slight difference you will each get to choose what you will be changing you animal into write whatever you choose on a piece of paper and pass them to the front before you begin the entire room fell utterly silent as each student fell to hard thinking it was obvious that each wanted to create something awesome but also something they could actually manage draco himself was no exception his first inclination was to change the scrambling guinea pig into a snake but transfiguring one animal into another of a different species was hard if he managed which he had little doubt he could it would prove that he had been studying ahead a lot ahead on the other hand any kind of edged weapon was out people viewed him as too much of a threat as it was curse of the malfoy name and his father legacy but a really nice dagger one with a snake etched into it draco shook his head sharply too bad but then he had it and his paper went fluttering into the basket on professor mcgonagall desk it would be great fun and it would take more than one transfiguration to do so he would be busy the entire lesson as opposed to being bored for the second half as he waited for the rest of the class to finish a motion behind him caught his attention and he turned to catch alex setting down her mug he frowned how the heck had she managed to sneak that into class and why had she gone through the trouble she felt his gaze and looked up with a smile that clinched it as far as draco was concerned something was up with her all of a sudden she looked over his shoulder in alarm and gestured for him to turn around he did just in time to catch his guinea pig from escaping over the edge of the desk draco decided to proceed with his first transfiguration before anything else after the first step at least the thing wouldntbe able to move moments of quiet spell casting and one scream later it seemed someone had managed to turn their mouse into pure flame he was ready to move on to step two umm pretty draco draco grinned greg it seemed was procrastinating why yes it is pity i not done yet oh greg feigned interest well you mean you re going to turn the crystal into something what none of your business and if you dont finish this assignment you ll never know greg frowned in annoyance but turned back to his own petrified rat step two was only slightly harder than one it would be three and four that would take up all of his class time fixing the mental image of the dragon he wanted in his mind he only transfigured the shape of the clear diamond like crystal while keeping it basically the same draco found himself humming quietly this was one of the funnest things he d done all year leaning forward he began the third step he was going to transfigure bits of the crystal dragon into different colored crystal of the same shape wings silver veined black sailed neck and back ridges black claws and fangs silver scales green he chose thinking over his color options rapidly after another second he decided to start with the scales that was the biggest area the rest was detail work focusing his mind he began to recite the correct spell alex blaise yell the sound of chairs banging to the floor and muffled screams from the other students snapped his concentration messing up the spell he whirled temporarily ignoring the mess to find a stunned alex on her feet dripping in horror what happened she asked blaise bewildered i he shook his head even as professor mcgonagall descended on them an efficient wave of her wand banished the bloody remains of alex rabbit the spell did nothing for the blood spattered girl though you were trying to make a metal goblet so what exactly did you do the professor asked she d turned it into the goblet blaise spoke up when alex seemed at a loss silver of course and was starting to etch her family crest into it went it exploded the first transfiguration didntstick alex said suddenly i could feel it fail even as i cast the etching spell it changed back and my spell tried to etch the animal the only eloquence the rest of the class could manage was a ravenclaw girl grimacing with a shuddering eww i see you are excused to clean up miss bellmonte you needntreturn to class but you will be expected to turn in the homework the same as everyone else yes professor alex reached out and scooped up her book bag and her mug both which were now as bloody as alex herself before heading out the door draco sighed and turned back to his crystal figure instead of the slytherin green scales just under the surface of the crystal was a rolling red splash it looked draco thought almost like fire under the skin he spent the rest of class changing minute bits of the red to achieve that effect even better alex rejoined them near the end of lunch slipping onto the end of the bench unobtrusively blaise looked over at her but as she was several students away could do no more than wave a greeting at the head table dumbledore stood teachers students and esteemed guests today is the day of the first task for the triwizard tournament and now is the time once you have finished your meals please proceed outside and to the stands in an orderly fashion it was unlikely that anyone ate more than another couple of bites after that a low level buzz filling the huge room determined to be one of the first but with an indolent air that belayed that fact draco got up and headed for the door there were only a few other students doing likewise and the teachers had yet to leave their table he made it outside in good time several feet ahead of anyone else before he heard rapidly approaching footsteps a large group by the sound of it draco glanced over his shoulder and smiled it was a large group or rather a group of two large people apparently he d managed to pull one over on greg and vince for once as they approached the newly erected stands draco grinned he was the first to arrive care to join us draco blaise smiled pleasantly from the best seats in the place how did you manage that vince demanded starting up the stairs alex flipped a galleon into the air caught it and slipped it into her pocket shortcut was that draco began of course and you used one to come here alex just shrugged at him it not like i cantmake more draco felt himself freeze on the last step to their row halfway up the stands exactly in the middle she knew how to make portkeys greg braced himself on the bench and surveyed the dirt ring he frowned i think i want to be closer to the action crabbe hmm i doubt anything that dangerous will come anywhere near us i all for moving draco i value my skin far too much to risk it on there shouldn t s sorry he shrugged and took a seat greg and vince made their way to the first row as the rest of the school first trickled then flooded into the small stadium so what do you think we ll be watching blaise leaned back on his seat and stretched i dunno alex replied ingeniously the claw marks could be from any number of large predators claw marks and now that she d pointed them out draco noticed them scoring the ground near a large gate at one end of the oval he stood temporarily to get a better view over the milling crowd and then sat down abruptly those he said in something akin to awe are not just any claw marks those are dragon marks blaise leaned forward in interest really no draco deadpanned alex laughed at his joke earning raised eyebrows from both boys she shrugged it off taking a deep drink out of her mug draco frowned it was the exact same mug from breakfast from transfigurations minus the blood and then from lunch what was she drinking a nasty suspicion formed itself in the back of draco mind oh hey i see tania getting trampled i ll be right back blaise said suddenly standing and wading into the chaos bye alex called mind if i have a sip draco asked gracefully swiping the mug before she could register his words he took a ginger swallow and froze blinking rapidly to clear the tears from his eyes during the moment of stun alex snatched back her mug draco damn alex that stuff is strong draco coughed trying to clear the lingering taste of hot chocolate and a harsh stimulant from his mouth it an acquired taste she snapped back a clear fire shining angrily in her eyes draco suddenly realized he hadntseen her angry like this in days she d been a little too happy all the time lately or a little too out of it a voice whispered in his head like when you use stimulants in place of sleep too many days in a row so he said conversationally how did you acquire this taste she started to glare at him but her gaze faltered and softened around the edges alex shivered and draco realized her hair was wet in it normal braid it was already deeply cold anyway he frowned and cast a warming spell on the benches under them then on his outer robes alex draco trailed off she replied anyway a tired note entering her otherwise controlled voice what draco why are you substituting stims for sleep and why that one in particular it one of the strongest and most dangerous second question first i use this particular stim potion because nothing less works for me anymore and as for the other she cut herself off looking over his shoulder alex he said warningly later she snapped lifting her arm to wave at an approaching blaise her arm bumped his shoulder as she did at some point probably when his robes had started giving off heat she d inched closer to him until she d taken blaise seat later draco promised shifting to let blaise passed he didntcomment on the seat change as he slid into his new position he was also currently tania less her brother had already found her before i got there blaise explained though no one had asked yes hunter not falon lex welcome welcome welcome ludo bagman thundered suddenly from his place next to the judges box welcome to the first challenge of this triwizard tournament how are you all doing today there was a round of applause that was more interested than excited but it seemed to satisfy the man he grinned and continued now before we bring out the first champion i should explain what is it you ll be watching each champion will come into the ring in a randomly selected order it will be their task to retrieve one of these large golden eggs he gestured broadly at the four eggs gleaming quietly on the table what they dontknow is this guarding the eggs from all but the bravest is a fearsome fire breathing dragon the crowd all froze and gasped with appropriate amounts of horror bagman grinned again they will be judged by mr crouch madame maxine headmasters dumbledore and karkaroff and of course myself as he introduced them each judge inclined his or her head from their seat but no more ado onward to the first champion somewhere a shrill whistle blew and a large blue gray dragon was let into the ring where during bagman speech a nest of eggs including one gold one had been set up a moment later before the dragon had even settled a terrified but determined cedric diggory stepped into the ring almost instantly the dragon lunged forward hissing at the trespasser swedish short snout draco heard himself muttered to his two companions notoriously territorial arentall dragons blaise asked rhetorically oh narrow miss there very narrow bagman commented as cedric dodged and rolled backward into the door standing with his back to it he waited until the dragon was practically on top of him before diving aside again it ran full on into the door he taking risks this one an edge of excitement filled the words from the ring cedric shouted something incomprehensible to the crowd and a nearby rock turned into a labrador scat he shouted scaring the dog to the right as he began racing left the dragon snarled at the newest enemy following it in preparation to attack long enough for cedric to get most of the way across the ring to the nest but apparently he got too close and apparently the dragon was more flexible than he d thought it head snapped around and blistering fire raked along the side of the hogwarts champion as his hands closed around the golden egg clever movepity it didnt work bagman responded blithely as six men in matching robes raced into the ring and stunned the dragon several professors namely the four heads of house appeared behind them and escorted the injured boy off the field and presumably into a hospital tent nice bit of transfiguration blaise said with the air of someone who knew as cedric score was posted ouch looks like that injury really hurt him or rather him and his score draco agreed feeling a momentary flash of sympathy for the burned boy he could honestly say he knew what that felt like but a new nest a new golden egg and another whistle all happened killing the emotion the gorgeous glamorous magically enhanced fleur took the place cedric had left she wasted no time beginning immediately she glided up to the beast oh i not sure that wise bagman declared from his bench she wove her hands and her wand in a complex motion whispering to herself as she did so for a long terrifying second nothing happened then the welsh green head began to droop it seemed half asleep and it was certainly ignorant of her as fleur edged around it and approached the nest but the eggs were halfway under the dragon it having not moved off the nest she stood on her tiptoes and stretched towards the golden egg her fingers hooked on one end and oh nearly bagman shout made her drop it careful now his noise also startled the dragon it snorted in irritation and the flames caught the edge of the champion skirt a string of what could only have been french swears echoed over the stadium as she doused her skirt with her wand good lord i thought she d had it then but not this girl shooting bagman a scathing glance the french girl viciously accio ed the egg to her and the round was over her scores came and went just a little higher than cedric s as did the set up for the next champion chinese draco classified a fireball i think the scarlet dragon fixed the crowd with a hard look as if it were trying to decide if it could eat them all in one meal or not krum came in at the whistle and just like fleur began immediately but his plan didntwork nearly as well he shot a spell at it face striking it in the eye the dragon froze for just a second before it began to howl in pain in it agony whipped around the floor coming dangerously close to the front rows and trampling half of its own eggs he had to dance and weave wildly to avoid the maddened beast but krum got the egg and the dragon tamers rushed it one in particular with flaming red hair casting a healing spell on it even before s stunning spell his score was an even 40 some of the crowd hissed as he exited though nasty thing to do to a dragon draco snapped glaring at the retreating boy a conjunctivitus curse is no laughing matter in general and to be winning because of it just because he got the egg the fastest so far blaise agreed so alex said smiling slightly are you going to join me in hoping potter wins this one damn right draco covered his badge with his robes and last but never least the famous harry potter bagman yelled and harry potter joined the hungarian horntail in the ring the match began as harry shouted something but then he just stood there what was going on had potter finally snapped draco hoped not but then it would be just like the wonderful boy who lived to go nuts at the worst possible time but it seemed he hadn t he was just waiting and his broom sudden zoomed into view breaking the silence draco grinned he hadntknow potter was smart enough to play to his strengths like that launching himself onto the firebolt harry zoomed into the air capturing the dragon attention as she lurched at him he swerved into a tight spiral emerging at exactly the right place to beginning another sweep bagman was as always commenting great scott he can fly are you watching this mr krum it was unlikely any of the other champions weren t draco mused not with the noises of horror and excitement coming from the rest of the crowd right now what potter strategy was became clear in just another minute as he began to lure the dragon up off her nest he got a little too close on only one pass earning him a minor cut before succeeding with a easy dive he swooped in to grab the egg look at that will you look at that our youngest champion is quickest to get his egg well this is going to shorten the odds on mr potter i ll say alex muttered and a few minutes later when his score was revealed the crowd went nuts harry potter was tied for first with an even 40 points a n hmm nothing else to say except this there will be a little draco alex relationship development in the next chapter according to my chapter list which i had lost but i just re found yay they dontofficially date until later this spring i not sure if i ll keep it that way though review oh yeah ps have the chapters been long enough cause i can start combining them if i need too a n the perfect pure blood song just cause i have nothing else to say hit the floor linkin park meteora well if i may be so clich as to say it draco joked quietly alex for her part jumped out of her skin her face was bleach white as she whirled towards the new sound it later he finished putting his hands up in mute appeal against the wand currently pointed at his heart for a long moment neither of them moved then she snapped out of it pocketing the wand and gasping for breath draco merlin alexandria what the hell is wrong with you he almost asked her what she was so afraid of but his good sense got the better of him it was only the stims making her so jumpy an extended overdose of adrenaline would do that to anyone she swallowed hard and glanced around but draco had chosen his timing well they were entirely alone in one of the dungeons back hallways i alex hesitated then clenched her hands together you canttell anyone about this draco why he asked cautiously because i calling in your blood debt thanks she flared oh draco had a sudden sinking feeling what was she doing what was he getting into why the hell was he sticking his nose in because she a slytherin of course draco i failing alex hesitant statement reclaimed his attention i cant hold it together and i failing all of my classes a cough that almost covered a sob echoed in his ears somewhere abstractly draco felt a headache begin to form but it did all make perfect sense now stress from home from the moody project and probably from a dozen other sources she d never talk about had conspired to distract her just when she hit new material because as intensive as their homeschooling was they still very much needed to attend hogwarts draco himself had had the same issues with some of his classes last year and greg and vince had tutored him through it well if this was a matter of pride he d keep silent for her draco resolutely ignored the binding of the debt of honor and if no one else could know he sighed softly i ll help you alex froze w what i said i will help you alex draco repeated slowly you dontwant to know what kind of score i almost got in charms last year now come on let get back to common room why why so we can both get our books and do homework until the place empties out you know very well that not what i meant draco malfoy he sighed sometimes humoring her was more trouble than it was worth as i said you dontwant to know what scores i almost got in charms last year besides if you know and i know and i ve been sworn to secrecy then who else is going to get you back up to speed as he watched draco saw something frantic and suitably desperate fill her she swallowed hard and tried once more we have more important things to do draco like moody and bugger moody i wonthave you besmirching house honor now go back to common room and go get your books march and completely contradicting words with actions draco gentlemanly offered her his arm and when she took it escorted her back down the hall it was forty six minutes past midnight they d covered the basics of every subject she was taking and one thing had become entirely too clear to draco alexandria bellmonte was lying the girl in question stifled a yawn with one hand and leaned across the couch to the small study table for this time a tea cup draco snatched it before her fingers could close on the handle not a chance bellmonte i dont care how badly you re flunking you will be sleeping tonight and with a flourish of wand wielding skills the tea the powerful stimulants and the cup itself vanished into the fireplace alex eyes followed it painfully now you know i enjoy your presence to help warm cold nights but the night isntall that cold alex draco calm sarcasm was softened to the point of teasing but even so a mask slid over her face he frowned in annoyance would it ever be possible to step rightly with this girl what was so very wrong that even the chance to bite his head off went unseen as she delved deeper into her shell i sorry for the inconvenience draco she replied in a voice that would have been biting if it hadnt also been so tired i think it is time to remind you that for all your power the malfoys have yet to purchase hogwarts and as such it is still my right to be here despite your objections rubbing the back of his neck draco muttered sweet merlin at the ceiling of common room what she twisted in her seat to look at him you donthave to leave alex but you donthave to lie to me either i not lying you re also not behind lost or confused in or by any of these subjects he gestured to the texts spread across the table in front of him what the point of all this if you already know it it nearly one o clock in the morning you re going to disgrace the house tomorrow in your condition you re very nearly disgracing it now go to sleep i d rather not alex spat out far too quickly and then in a very small voice if you dontmind draco eye widened just a little of course i dontmind he responded automatically his mind whirling her problem was with sleeping he d just thought she d been staying awake trying to solve a different problem not that her staying up was the issue thank you so hmm draco tapped his fingers on the table top as he tried to think of something to say that they hadntalready covered you know i dontlike you right he said at last alex froze and turned to gaze into the fire oh really quite he continued blithely because of you i spent an extremely entertaining summer trying to plan my revenge against you the trick was i couldnthave your parents finding out alex profile was taut as she asked what exactly are you seeking revenge for well miss bellmonte i was just standing there trying to be polite ha and you snubbed me cruelly what made it worse is that power wise you re one of the few people who can in my defensive and her tone really was defensive i was under a deal of stress at the time it was my coming out party point but it made for an entertaining summer nonetheless all my elaborate plots would have sprung into motion as soon as i stepped off the train and have they it was barely a whisper but in it was the sound of trust crumbling draco sighed unfortunately for me and my plans my father found out about one of my rather idiotic abortive attempts to throw you off balance and made me apologize i walked into a library and discovered a person unworthy of my hatred in hindsight i was being something of a git alex laughed more out of relief than humor at his self insult you came to my home ground and threatened me i apologize if my reaction insulted it did and i forgive you this time there was real humor in her soft laugh her entire posture relaxed and her head fell back against the couch so draco what your favorite subject mine easy transfigurations really even with mcgonagall as professor she has an overabundance of gryffindor traits i ll admit but she fair and she knows what she talking about true so why transfigurations because because it tricky complicated a challenge but everything follows a certain set of rules and once you know what those rules are you can do anything you want badly enough you can change anything from whatever it is to something different or something better it an enormous power to have with just as much responsibility alex commented sleepily dontyou ever get tired of always having to be responsible for everything i dontknow i get tired but i ve never known what it like to not have all this stuff to deal with mmm a silence fell between them a comfortable easy thing like your favorite pair of socks right out of the dryer and what your favorite subject lex it was though neither of them where paying enough attention to realize it the first time he d ever used her nickname hmm she stirred yawning oh i dontreally have one maybe history of magic though history of magic no thanks to the professor but like it says those who dontknow the past are doomed to repeat it which means that us humans haventchanged so very much which means that by studying the past we can figure out the now and maybe the future history explains things to me draco paused and considered her words the more he thought about it the more sense it made alex wanted to know things it was all that drove her well that and survival hey alex the question died on his lips as he looked over at her she was curled up against the armrest fast asleep a tired grin of triumph took its place and he stood to start gathering up the mounds of textbooks and miles worth of parchment he hadnttaken two steps making it only seconds into her sleep that it started she whimpered in pain in fear in both he couldnttell but moving back to her side he saw that her eyes were flying underneath her eyelids and she was barely breathing alex he reached out a lightly touched her shoulder please don t she begged grabbing his hand in a death grip please i ll be good draco felt a sympathetic ache in his chest and even had to fight back a sympathetic wave of memories for a moment it was all too normal to him alex alex wake up he pulled his hand back lifting her into a sitting position alex she came awake with a wild violent motion more animal than human and draco found himself under attack as she desperately tried to escape the couch alex come on lexy please he yelped on instinct ineffectually trying to get out of her range with one of his hands still clasped tightly in a deathgrip draco with recognition all the fight left her oh shit she shook her head violently and lurched to her feet shit shit shit shit i sorry i so sorry i i have to go alex was halfway across the room before he could even tell his hand was free leaving her books behind she was racing for the door how could this have happened she d been so careful she d done everything right so how the hell had she fallen asleep in front of draco so which parent was it draco drawled from behind her alex froze and turned to see him watching her a wry sympathetic smile curving his lips e excuse me oh great alex really brilliant in your nightmare which one was punishing you alex couldntbring herself to speak to admit he was right would only make it worse would only make it that much more real it my father usually he said after a minute almost managing to sound casual about it but he predictable mad it my mother you have to watch out for she subtle and sneaky an all around good slytherin and you can never tell when she ll do you in it s she swallowed hard resisting the urge to run from the room resisting the equally powerful urge to hold onto him like a lifeline somehow not bursting into tears or screams it the other way round for me my mother you know what makes her mad and you know how she ll respond to you when she is but m my father what draco prompted softly when he not mad he nice even as she watched a slow shudder ran the length of draco malfoy body at her words alex felt a sudden flash of understanding somehow impossibly he knew understood even better than blaise did what it meant to have two sets of parents inside only one couple the caring and the cruel inside her own mind she firmly removed draco from the borderline acquaintance list and placed him on the trusted list he d seen her at her absolute lowest and had merely joined her it was a sacrifice of an impossible kind for a slytherin alex re found her seat on the couch my mother he said moving over to the table and beginning to stack books she likes to buy me stuff clothes books jewelry furniture all sorts of crap i guess cause she likes to destroy my things in front of me as a punishment and it more satisfying if she knows how expensive it is or maybe she just wants to make sure you have enough things to make the rampage worthwhile alex suggested softly yeah that actually sounds more like her than my idea mmhmm she moaned softly sinking lower on the couch and rubbing her forehead merlin draco i need to sleep if i dontstart soon i really am going to start failing classes i was in transfigurations today i entirely believe you he was silent for a while and alex twisted her head to get a good look at him when he caught her gaze he smiled encouragingly i think i think i have something for you it a potion and no i canttell you want in it but if i promise you that you wontdream would you try it alex spoke without having to think about it first yes he grinned i ll be right back and disappeared up into the boys dorm he was alex noted multitasking as all of his books and papers had gone up with him he was also she decided having nothing else to think about in his absence being really adorably sweet in a blonde not her type kinda way and who the hell said that blondes werenther type anyway she d never had any boyfriends so she sure as heck didnthave a type yet and why the hell did she care if draco didntfall inside her made up type just because he was someone she could trust well okay and who understood her and who put up with her moods and who was undeniably hot and whom she didntview as a brother but that didnt mean anything right alex was still debating if she wanted to selectively ignore this new information when its focus returned in his hand was a small mostly empty glass vial at the end of a gold ish chain here it tastes vile and yes pun very intended as it the best joke i could come up with this late at night but i promise you it does work he handed it over and leaned on the back of the couch to watch her i promise i believe you about both parts alex wrinkled her nose braced herself and downed the potion oh merlin drac you dontlie draco laughed nasty vile repulsive eww yes of course and i agree now he glanced over at the neat piles on the table you think you can make it to your dorm with all that stuff or do you need help ha and can you make it up the stairs to the girls dorm without help draco hmm come to think of it no okay then i think i can make it alex rose to her feet and pulled her wand wingardium leviosa good and hey alex turned back around to face him her foot on the first stair if you do dream you come get me you know which dorm i in and that was quite decidedly that nodding once to herself sharply as if making up her mind alex covered the distance between them and kissed him lightly on the mouth when the slowed down mental command made it from brain to arms he made a grab for her but by then she was already gone within seconds she was up the steps and out of sight eventually draco went to bed himself a n well there you have it bonafide alex draco action sorta we ll see how it plays out from here yule ball coming up next a n so sorry about the delay last week i actually did try and post the chapter several times on monday and tuesday but was doing that weird server overload thing that it does so i couldntlog in thanks so much for the reminder btw and i ll try not to let that happen if i can apart from that here we go the beginning of the great yule ball arc snickers yeah right great my grin well whatever was wrong with her it would seem malfoy handled it all nicely i hope this lasts for both of their sakes draco needs stirring up and lex needs someone to take care of her blaise grinned though she d kill me for saying so hey zabini caroline stevens a startlingly blonde seventh year ravenclaw walked over to him he eyed her slowly then decided to let his grin stay caroline what can i do for you he did his usual half bow glancing longingly at the open door to ancient runes only a few steps past her tell me zabini she offered him a look he knew just a little too well do you have any plans for after the yule ball at least he thought she remembers enough to not expect me to actually take her to the ball i don t now that you mention it why her eyes flashed lightly she knew very well he was playing with her would you like some he laughed we ll see i donthave any plans after class let start there caroline smiled sure zabini you know how to find me and i always do he stepped lightly around her and walked into class as he took his seat blaise chuckled slightly later would be a pleasant diversion and it had been almost a week for him welcome back mr zabini professor jackson said and how did your research go blaise cast a look around and seeing that no one else had yet arrived opened up about his project well not so much a project like alex s more he just wanted to know pretty well so far sir the books you recommended helped a great deal i never knew that the codes julius caesar used during his rule were actually the basis for our current alpha rune set in a rather abstract way zabini it was the rhythm of those codings that got used not the actual codes themselves he frowned but the style of writing at least the writing tools and the spiral form are both greatly present in both yes but caesar got those from some of the greek art we ll be covering after christmas break who in their turn probably got some of their inspiration from babylon blaise felt that shivery goodness begin to tingle in the back of his brain all this information to know and this was just from the alpha set there were more than enough sets to keep him busy for the rest of his life and it wasntso much the power of the knowledge for how a rune came into being did not better allow a person the use of it it was a whole different thing to learn how to use the runes and blaise was neck deep in that as well but this this was fun he grinned openly obviously shocking the heck out of his professor but them the rest of the class was trickling into the cool room and he could say nothing blaise turned his attentions to other things as he waited for the lesson to start namely where the heck was alex she was in this class too blaise sighed it didntreally matter he could always just go over the lesson with her later which was exactly what she was counting on he knew sighing lightly he let his mind drift it suddenly struck him that the room they were in was awfully bright considering it was situated entirely within the castle and had no windows the only light source was a chandeliers made of tarnished brass hanging above their heads but even that shouldntgiving off this much light was it a runes thing or would that mess up the spells taught here and if it wasntthen was it just another part of the castle legendary magics blaise decided to find out there was a spell he knew one he was actually supposed to know but one he wasnt supposed to be using in this class right now it was supposed to help you spot magical traps but it should give him a clear view of the runes being used in the room if there were any alright class let get started the professor move to the front of the room and tapped the black board a series of letters and page numbers scrolled slowly up front the chalk holder at the bottom beginning where we left off at the end of thursday class please turn to page 215 of you main text and the diagrams on 476 to 480 in the addendum of rune technology blaise let his eyes drift half shut calming his mind and pulling up the memory of that defense against the dark arts class as you can tell these formations cover both the alpha and gamma sets but as most of you have no practical knowledge of anything beyond alpha and certainly not to the level of gamma we ll be ignoring that set that would make it the dark red lines on your diagrams that you ll be ignoring now then who can tell me he lost track of the lesson as the appropriate words found their place into his head videor so the word it sounds like isntanywhere close to the actual use definition of the rune very good jordan veneficus i want you all to keep that in mind as you continue to study these runes this particular sub grouping was created or discovered if you will by a one marcus vinvenn absconditus a notoriously paranoid roman he was and that not just hearsay recently researchers have uncovered some of his original journals videor but i digress my apologies students the point as i usually tend to have one is that these particular runes are of the more twisted and confusing variety so please try and not take them at face value blaise was in shock and not just the surprised kind he quite literally couldntpull his eyes from the glowing designs currently etching themselves forever into his brain the seemingly random patterns of lines dots dashes curls and letters of various languages rippled slowly idly he wondered why his eyeballs werent burning as he certainly was blinking but it was just magical light not real light maybe that was it but still not blinking he noticed something else the colors were different and while yes most of it was the gold people commonly associated with magic the gold itself ranged from the palest of shimmers to the rich fullness of the metal to a dark dull kind almost bronze and beyond under around that were the other colors a tiny hint of blue on that window fluttering slightly in his vision as if by wings a deep undercurrent of browns lacing the stone of the castle solid and unmoving and in the far corner almost directly around an empty desk beside him was a dark purple ish red the runes written in that last blaise swallowed they seemed to pulse in time with his breathing in fact as he looked on the color itself seemed to move and flow in his vision it was mesmerizing quiet calm powerful alluring unending f fini he was drowning quietly it was really quite pleasant finite incantatem blaise professor jones looked over inquiringly blaise himself was discovering that at some point he had in fact stopped breathing did you say something no sir he covered smoothly just a cough and he proceeded to cough again to prove his cover story well that and he really did need to cough important note to blaise from blaise dontdo that again stupid very well as i was saying the fge rune or more likely know as the fugo rune is composed of a twelve point swirl and unlike our commonly used spell of fugo has absolutely nothing to do with spatial movement at all ha i d just as soon marry a mud blood oh really and where are you two registered blaise grinned the argument could only be coming from two of his favorite people stopping and permanently disrupting the smooth flow of students from point a to point food he started tracking the sound by the time he found them disrupting the flow themselves and entirely oblivious to it alex was sighing oh alright draco i ll be ready when you need me to be it was said grudgingly almost prompting another grin past blaise mouth trust alex to be annoyed when she got asked out on a date so zabini draco turned to greet his dorm mate instead of being gracious about lex capitulation who re you taking to the yule ball ooooh so that was it he thought fast obviously his plan of taking alex by default had fallen through not sure yet none of my girls are of the right breeding to be seen with me in public and i haventhad the time to start investigating and evaluating the slytherin females i d ask you to look younger draco stated i sure all of the younger girls at least will manage to get invited and it would be better if they went with someone in house unless of course you re going to go with someone your own age may i suggest you avoid pansy a slightly strange expression flickered over alex face milli already has a date but he right in fact you should take tania otherwise she ll just end up going with hunter and no one deserves to have a relative escort them to an event like this speaking from personal experience draco who me draco pulled back in mock insult he sniffed i assure you miss bellmonte i have always attended every event i wished with whoever i wished and if that person was a family member then it was only at my choosing thus not even remotely like our current topic of discussi wow okay shut up alex sent him a look of extreme female disbelief and exasperation wow okay lunch blaise replied diverting the conversation always sure why not they spoke at the same time and as blaise could see either response coming from either person he didnt discern who which had originated he didnthave the brain power to devote to it anyway after all he still had to find a date man it was gonna be annoying to not go with alex anymore well here i am just like i said i d be alex was draco noted not entirely enthused but then apparently she d just as soon marry a mud blood so he d kinda already known that he eyed he outfit interesting look making a fashion statement yes well since i being treated like one i thought i d dress like a servant she gripped a handful of the worn once black but now grey ish robe and dipped a curtsey you re really playing this up arentyou before that night he would never have said it it was by far too real too honest for either of them and even though that night and the events therein went entirely unspoken about it had in fact changed things this being one of them of course she snorted why in the world would i want to go trekking through the edges of the not so forbidden part of the forest for your herbology homework draco smirked his eyes flicking briefly towards that not so forbidden and quickly approaching forest because you d have to do it for your homework one of these days and it ll go faster with two people ah but there where you re wrong i wouldntneed to go anywhere but to the owlery the owlery what alex shot him a look stepping lightly over a muddy root i d order the plants malfoy and get in trouble with the professor you think she wontbe able to tell that they arent fresh it was alex turn to smirk she hasntyet why alex they both burst out laughing alex leaning on his shoulder as she stumbled slightly why alex she mimicked shrilly mirthful eyes already scanning the ground around them for the plant he needed what was that draco a horrified response to the news that you ve been cheating i have not been cheating she never said we had to get the plants from out here she just said that we d be able to find them here and that they must be fresh fresh alex that the point all of mine are fresh she sniffed it in the guarantee that inspired another round of laughter a few minutes later their search still fruitless draco settled himself onto a large boulder what are you doing alex demanded indignantly keeping watch for bad things she sighed bad things huh well i think i have a mirror on me somewhere ha ha so funny alex about as funny as me doing your homework for you draco obedient to the unspoken order draco climbed back to his feet so bellmonte who re you taking to the ball silence met his teasing question and he glanced over his shoulder to see a slightly tense set to her shoulders you know i not sure if i ll be going yet draco frowned she was telling him the truth but not really oh why not she stood up and stretched a little i sent off an owl to my parents explaining the situation and asking if i could stay over break but i haventgotten a reply yet which was also the truth question when did i figure out how to tell when she lying but she still didntlook happy about something hey there it is draco followed the pointing finger and sure enough red stem brown veining and a slightly furry look that was it all right d you have the spade no i gave it to you so you did and the subject was dropped a n first things first videor to be seen veneficus magical witch absconditus hidden also occultus fugo to chase away used in the jaina fic on sirius black also expect some pansy and some of hunter marauders from the tania fic in the next chapter or two review a n oh the pain the headaches the rewrites but no i waaaaay too lazy for that see i looked up a list of canon slytherins for a list of slytherin girls featured below and guess what i found out that right there are two people canon people in alex blaise draco year that i haventeven brought up theodore nott 4th year and adrian pucey 4th year sob well adrian at least i have an excuse for as long as you dontmind her being female theo though no clue maybe i ll just make him older younger i dunno i may actually just ignore this as i said lazy on that note i actually surprised i finished this like i did see i was working from 10 am to 5 pm saturday and from 3 30 pm to 11 pm sunday after going to church until 12 30 pm so all my writing time went away mostly icky really but i did it oh also i just realized in the last chapter i mess up big time i said that the ancient runes classroom was an inside room without windows then i say there a window yeah i suck shrug since the dawn of time when fire was a sign of wealth and verbal communication barely existed man has found himself eternally on one search one quest a quest to find the perfect woman and whether this is a soul mate or just a female of the right physical proportions to bear his children the search has been never ending and the problem that has plagued man the most is that once they find this female how do they keep her but this was not blaise problem blaise just needed a date to a dance blaise might as well have been searching for a soul mate oy his head hurt blaise ran a tired hand through his hair and stared dispassionately at the sheets of parchment spread out on the table lists all of them lists of all the girls in slytherin lists proclaiming his doom but he would not be angry with alex he absolutely wouldn t it wasnther fault her decision to go with draco made his life miserable with another sigh blaise turned back to the lists 7th years tara cromwell raquel smith julia tyler veronica asia 6th years alanna jor janis c elissian raya c della stephanie maxwell 5th years lucy derrick cilia c warrington diana winner nicolette minamino terry marquise 4th years alexandria bellmonte millicent bulstrode pansy parkinson adrian pucey 3rd years tania dethart liana c montgomery laura c montgomery christina asia rachel ileum faith cromwell okay then blaisey boy back to the top tara cromwell no way she d hurt me for even asking heck i think all of the seventh years would a large tipped quill drew a thick line through the names in heavy black ink now then sixth years i guess hmm alanna jor blaise thought hard trying to do better than a vague image of red ish blonde hair and washed out skin then he hit on it oh yeah that flint girl flint the older rather she out janis c elissian he winced hell no just not from the heir line tara would hurt me in fact all the cromwells are under her protection now that the twins have graduated i think i d better be safe and stay away and janis c elissian raya c della cilia c warrington liana and laura c montgomery went away then faith cromwell first question of tara by her father sister actually it suddenly struck him that he should go through and cross of all the girls he knew were unavailable alexandria bellmonte millicent bulstrode pansy parkinson adrian pucey away this year studying abroad and christina asia little sister of veronica asia seventh year mean blaise felt his spirits begin to sink out of twenty three possibilities sixteen had already slipped through his fingers that meant he only had seven girls left ew umm stephanie maxwell nope used to date jorin cromwell so she probably under cromwell protection lucy derrick eh heh ew diana winner twitch crazy strange child not that i should talk as he d spoken the quill had been busy leaving him with a measly four names of them all tania somehow seemed the most appropriate at least the most appealing besides alex had had a point if not him then who well hunter but that was wrong in many many ways a girl shouldnthave to tag along behind her older brother and no boy should have to take his sister on a date ick he d have to go ask the two older girls first but it looked like tania was his one and only choice blaise groaned when had his life gotten so bad alex stared critically at herself in the vanity mirror she frowned and gave it a sudden rough shove flipping the dull non reflective side out to face her they re afraid of you lex she could almost hear the words blaise would ve said had she confided in him they only fanned the hurt into bitter anger how could he do this to her but you aren t blaise zabini her voice quavered a little and she silenced it why couldnti have just gone with you that thought instantly converted her anger into guilt she didntwant to get in his way when blaise dated had tried her best to give him space when she could she sniffled alex slammed to her feet grabbed a pillow and hurled it across the room a snapped spell word brought it back at speed hugging the thick comfy thing she curled up against her other pillows on the bed pansy paused outside the open door to her dorm and eyed amazing alex curled up like a wounded animal on her four poster it just an inconvenience she muttered unconvincingly i am not jealous of tania dethart it was at this moment that pansy realized both that she hadntbeen noticed and when she decided to change that unlikely your high and mighty bloodline bred such lowly emotions from your genetics centuries ago alex as a credit to her training probably didntjump though she did look up and meet pansy eyes what with the hostility pansy she snorted is your memory failing you alex you started it alex didntreply her lips compressed into a tight white line and her eyes dropped so pansy broke the silence as she walked over to her closet why arentwe jealous of tania dethart alex yanked viciously at a stray curl she has a date to the bloody thing she muttered growling pansy froze a shiver of sympathy welling up who she going with she asked softly alex hesitated then sighed tiredly blaise zabini ouch talk about betrayal no i that is he knows he can do what he wants leaving you in a lurch i know alex agreement was a whisper he never done that before merlin pansy replied just a little too loudly bloody socially acceptable pervert alex suddenly smiled you realize he d probably kiss you for saying that well it not like there d be anyone to stop him it came out bitter but who cares alex frowned what we re in the same boat bellmonte she flashed an evil grin at the other girl i take it that means you have a plan of course a silence stretched out until alex lifted an eyebrow so what will you be doing pansy sighed frowned and settled her hands on her hips turning to fully face her dorm mate are you really sure you want to she jerked to a halt as alex cut her off if the words someone like me end up in that sentence a deep silence snapping with taut anger flared up you ll what bellmonte alex sighed and tossed herself forward so she was lying face down on the bed you re one of us miss parkinson your mother is vapidly obvious your father is an annoying oaf but you have earned yourself a place weather you like it or not for a brief moment pansy looked gratified a brief moment an interesting observation about my parents i sure we ll have to continue this some other time but for now you want to know my plan i do the tired sunlight filtering through the thin windows bordering the ceiling lit her face as pansy dropped onto the edge of her bed well i plan to persuade an escort out of the fifth years alex snickered donovan boys eddie charlie hunter and miles well and mark wanna join me you think they can survive being double teamed they re slytherins they re boys point taken pansy bit her lip still smiling we ll have to go slowly so we have the who and how let nail down the where and when a n dontknow if anyone noticed but by the end i was getting just a little desperate about the last names for the girls two separate and awesome anime are in there can anyone guess grin oh and yes i know it bad this week short etc sorry a n must read well not really but i really have to say at least that i hate the house system at hogwarts i was thinking about it today while coming up with a new hufflepuff oc for a hp role play i joined and i ve decided the whole think sucks all it does is draw lines and fosters stupid rivalries that wouldntexist otherwise why is it that the hufflepuffs are pissed with harry in the 4th book because their house rarely gets any recognition not because they feel bad for cedric or anything it forms large clicks for no reason i can think of stupid just stupid anyways that mostly it please dontkill me for voldie joke or for the way the chapter ends i really didntfeel like writing anything at all but my sister forced me to that all folks master my lord wormtail muffled reedy voice disrupted the decades of neglect and diligent spider work voldemort frowned anger flickering in colorless eyes there was absolutely no excuse for the annoyance nagini hissed from her spot curled up beside the empty fireplace and wormtail recognized the warning for what it was rearing back in fear m master he blinked rapidly in the dim light master i f found it voldemort paused considering his servant words stalling nagini own motion with a thought and allowed his voice to cool of its fury oh icicles sparkled on each syllable did you again wormtail pulled back stuttering into silence as voldemort waited for him to either scrape together enough courage to speak his message or leave he swept his gaze over the room whitewashed stonework dirty with age and neglect provided a strange backdrop to the scenes played out here thin sheets of medium blue fabric hung from the walls and windows it was silk and had probably shone and glimmered once but no longer overlaying it all was a collection of furniture that was whimsical fun and altogether too feminine the dark lord found it somewhat ironic that the only place with the comforts and view he required would be the women solar but not that ironic and as it was he wasntbothered by the femininity of the place as everything beyond the general shapes and colors were lost to him with his physical form in shambles to the point of nonexistence focusing was well impossible no voldemort corrected himself not impossible per say just long complicated and excruciatingly painful nothing was impossible for the dark lord nothing at least not once he got his body back nagini hissed again this time in angry pain as voldemort ground her teeth together in his rage his mental grip unshakable damn potter and even as he thought it voldemort wasntsure which one he meant all three had brought him down to his current state the rest of the world cried praise to the little one but little did they know the true events p potter m lord wormtail stammered his hands clenching against each other in anxiety voldemort drew in a hissing breath so he d spoken aloud it wouldnthappen again his control would not follow his body into oblivion you have news he snapped y yes master b but potter he th the k key master the key he repeated i thought he was the boy who lived wormtail did not get the joke as usual yes master the key to returning you to your body voldemort felt something inside him begin to stir with fury if potter was involved any potter for that matter it was all bound to go wrong oh is he wormtail do tell wormtail quite literally squeaked in horror as his lord smiled down at him and the dark lord felt his fragile sanity fraying damn coward where is my circle when i need them dammit where bella and dolph as it was he had to wait a full seven minutes and twenty two seconds for his one remaining servant to gather himself enough to speak the dark lord knew he counted it was in the books master his voice quavered again but at least with any luck he d finish what he came to say before it gave out again and at least he wasntstammering the books from jackle apartments m lord i thought i had it days ago but then it panned out to nothing again so i didntsay anything but then i found it the way to make it work voldemort calmly let wormtail ramble while nothing close to an academic genius the one redeeming quality of the useless creature was his ability to retain a terrific amount of knowledge at once what came out of his mouth was only a distilled version of it all it really just a spell to return something stole from you where you bring together the person stolen from and the person who had stolen the item and cast a potion over both alone with a simple spell but it wouldnt have been powerful enough to bring back your body because your body doesntexists elsewhere in the physical world but as i read through those books on blood magic i found it what books on blood magic voldemort cut in frowning again and trying to remember there were four of them wrapped in brown paper with the name alex on it master along with a note saying i hope these will help to complete your collection sitting in his chair voldemort watched wormtail for several nervous minutes before the other realized he was supposed to continue erm uh oh yes in the books there a potion that will combine part of you with the willing offering of flesh by someone else to create a body then you do the stealing spell and it will return that body to you and harry potter is the key because without him we can make you a new body but we wontbe able to give it back to you it was towering majestic and powerful it was home and he was lord bellmonte king of this castle the great foyer was a favorite place of his at this time of day huge and half full of shadows echoing in its emptiness he smiled as the silence of it enfolded him franklin most people would ve asked if their loved one was home but not his wife she demanded that he be there his smile widened into a grin which he covered with his hand yes my love he called already moving towards the library where her voice had come from franklin she said softer looking up from the book she was reading how was your day thrilling deanna sent him a look at his wry tone i spent the day with lucius he leaned against the doorframe and crossed his arms did you expect me to have fun the fading sunlight softened her hard edges as she shook her head and franklin once again found himself thinking wistfully about other children but he knew better by now it was the price one paid for marrying a bellmonte you spent the rest of your life living by a bunch of rules even they hated and how is lucius it was his turn to send her a look you needntask a question if you already know the answer darling mine tell me anyway sighing he crossed the room and joined her picking up a small cookie from her cold tea tray he has been acting exactly as is normal for him these days which is to say strangely franklin frowned jumpy isntthe word but it close he seems jumpy agitated on edge but excited also like he knows something is happening and he isnt sure if it ll be good or bad deana nodded slowly frowning herself narcissa is much the same though i think she hides it better lucius always did have his emotions on his sleeve she smiled nostalgically true a pity he doesnthave any better emotions to show these days jackle murder shook him up it shook all of us up franklin crumbled the cookie to bits and let them drop back onto the plate that anyone would dare kill such a man he was under our protection deana said bitterly ours the malfoys the zabinis i think even the cromwells championed him he was one of us or near enough that should have been enough it should have he agreed but it wasn t somewhere with someone we lost the power we had not for long it was a promise revenge was in the air and franklin almost flinched at the blazing fury in his wife eyes someone somewhere would pay for this it also disturbing that whoever it was they knew about his personal books the aurors didn t they reported that nothing was missing the fools the subtle change in top worked better than he d hoped deana latching onto it and alexandria will she be held up without those books i doubt it she was merely thinking ahead and ordering the books before she needed them that why i was picking them up for her mmm our daughter franklin felt a flash of apprehension about his only child what about her i ve been hearing rumors lately about her about her actions at hogwarts of late rumors only he pointed out what sort of supposed actions for one thing she taken an interest in tania dethart dethart i know but tania is kent youngest the only girl i see he trailed off on purpose considering the issue she knows what kind of social climber that man is franklin dontinsult my daughter intelligence with your silence of course deana alex knows enough to keep her head but that not what has you concerned no she said nothing glaring death at her teacup he fought growing worry and waited for her words it would seem she said finally that alexandria may be getting involved with someone who franklin bellmonte snapped draco malfoy lady bellmonte smiled coldly ah and as it sunk in he began to wonder if she really would be able to keep her head i going to order dinner deana said standing and sweeping out calling for the kitchen elves outside the huge windows the sun was finishing its race for the horizon and in the dark a stray bit of poetry popped unbidden into his head do not speak to me of hell until you hear this tale i tell darkest night a soul bain listen well this tale of pain strangely it seemed appropriate so how do i look alex threw her head back and laughed at the sheer absurdity of the question they d put two days into the preparation for their plan which boiled down meant this look it was plotted planed and designed to perfection and once they applied it their goal would be handed to them on a silver platter walking down the stairs into common room was an experience or rather the arrival in common room was somewhere between glancing up to see who was coming and registering the two of them every male mind in the place stuttered to a halt alex hair was hanging loose slightly rumpled with a hint of messy falling down around her shoulders and emphasizing the hint of pink in her white cotton shirt the shirt itself was tucked into tight black jeans that were stylistically worn in places to make them look comfortable the black belt had a hint if silver stitching in it and she was wearing her three inch heel boots it was by far the most muggle outfit she owned and one pansy had helped her put to together the point was to put together something that departed so radically from the elegant sophistication people expected from her and pansy was something else entirely her deep brown locks were pulled up in something that looked simple or would have if alex didntknow that they d spent forty five minutes getting it right and left just a few wisps to frame the other girl face a black yarn lace poncho covered a sleeveless red turtleneck and draped down over the waist band of the black gypsy styled skirt covered in red roses it softened her hard look and all of a sudden they were the girl next door the very hot girl next door and considering that the boys of slytherin were used to facing ladies who could take them in a fight it was really no surprise they reacted like that that didntmake it any less amusing though alex tapped one pink tinted fingernail against the seam of her jeans and wondered when the effect was going to wear off beside her pansy threw up her hands and sighed come on alex we have places to be she nodded right let go linking arms the two girls left the room umm blaise said into the silence that followed them when did those two stop hating each other i dontthink they have zabini draco replied with a hint of fear i think they re just plotting something well make them stop would that i could i dontthink i could take even one of them right now neither could anyone else a seventh year boy said soberly completely missing the silencing look tara cromwell was shooting him and if they keep it up i think we should get professor snape and for some reason none of the guys could figure out that set off the biggest round of hysterical female laughter that slytherin house had seen to date i hate divinations i hate divinations i hate divinations hunter looked up from his book and sighed repeating your motto in life is not going to make the homework go away eddie his friend looked up and glared half heartedly so i hate divinations that woman is a total nutcase behind eddie two vaguely familiar figures paused in the door to the library two pairs of eyes sweeping the room spotting his group they looked at each other said something at the same time and walked over as they came nearer he finally figured it out it was pansy parkinson and alex bellmonte sorta they were dressed normally but somehow they weren t no hunter thought to himself they were dressed like normal people not normally hey guys alex smiled as they came up can we join you why hunter turned to stare at mark for the rude comment and saw a very interesting look on his face wh it certainly took the girl aback she cast a look at pansy because pansy put in smoothly with a hint of annoyance in her voice common room is an absolute zoo right now and this is the only slytherin group in the library oh eddie you have mars graphed wrong alex leaned over his shoulder and tapped a finger against the planet chart if we re bothering you we ll leave oh hell no eddie said suddenly grabbing alex hand before she could move if you understand this crap you re not leaving until i do mark started laughing and hunter sighed in exasperation charlie on the other hand was a little more practical reaching behind himself he snagged a chair from an empty table i do not alex emphasized sternly understand all this crap professor trelawny is an absolute fruitcake but i do know how to draw correct star and planet charts oh good now fix it he moved the chart under her nose she just looked at him fix it mark prompted after a second fix it please lady bellmonte please who poor eddie looked more confused by her than the chart pansy leaned over as she took the chair charlie offered her and whispered in his ear oh sorry please wontyou help me alex she smiled at him calling on her best dimple as she did sure it easy here she leaned over him again placing one hand on his shoulder as she pointed with the other right there you got the formula backwards it 1 16h 4 mv5 1612 not the other way around really mark leaned over and grabbed the page bugger i got mine wrong too would you like me to proof read it donovan the whole table froze every boy waiting for the typical outburst from mark about his given name but instead he just stood and pulled out his chair for her if you would i d be in your debt alex really she turned to look at him while sitting how much in my debt a n so there we go all done with any luck next up will be the beginning of the yule ball keep your fingers crossed though readers of mine because a big tania event will happen during the ball and so jaylyn wants us to post that part at the same time meaning well if she doesnt manage to fit everything into one chapter then i ll have to scrounge up some more filler from somewhere and maybe end up sending blaise and draco on a clothes shopping trip oh joy imagine that one i really hope that doesnthappen review a n okay i ll try to be as brief as i can apparently something in my last mostly an chappie caused the admins to jump all over me and delete it sorry anyway i ll briefly recap my points aka copy them from my saved to the computer document a my slush fic really it barely exists besides in my head and most of it will match up with scenes from year 5 so i haventgotten around to writing them out yet the point is that i ll give you the two well i call them core chapters cause they have enough info to remind me of everything i wanted to do with the plot if you ask basically i ll need your email if you still want them elektra b ozalan to answer your questions no my formula was not real in fact i couldnteven tell you what i meant by it math is evil i just threw down something that looked math y sorry if that a disappointment also the reason tania was blaise last choice was 1 if you ll remember the only reason he took her to hogsmeade is because he had to find someone to play alex 2 she is a year younger than him and he likes older women and 3 he did take her to hogsmeade and since he is currently sure he not interested in her romantically i promise that ll change eventually he doesnt want to lead her on he is a massive sweetheart you know c i think this was the problem child as it was just a rant about the mary sue review anyways my rightly confused queen of zukia a mary sue is a story whose main character an oc is perfect and happy and beautiful and everyone loves her and she is always amazingly powerful in exactly the right way to save the day in the nick of time usually causing whichever character the author likes best to fall madly in love with her and either they ride off into the sunset or she dies horribly sending the entire cast of characters into deep and eternal mourning these characters have no real backstory or reason for them to be there and tend to make the main characters act out of character themselves d i never did get around to that whole shopping trip thing instead i posted a sneak peek at the last scene of the last chapter of this fic it was heart wrenching and since there actual writing in this fic i wontrepost it shrug sorry and now what was the new chapter a n i think i need to apologize lately as in the last 5 10 chapters i ve been feeling as though i ve lost control of this fic it been dragging me all across the landscape for no reason and leaving a rather strange tale behind it well no more i ve redefined in my head both the characters and the plot so with any luck it will flow better from now on if there was any confusion created i apologize and if you tell me what is confusing i ll try to explain and or fix it heh shrug ps i ll put up the actual pics of milli and pansy from the movies that i could find and a couple that look like what i think pansy looks like i haventfound any for milli yet you know i almost feel sorry for her alex mused quietly who milli asked pausing in her make up application to look at her dorm mate through the mirror tania she chuckled i dont even know what to do with party blaise half the time i know milli rolled her eyes merlin that boy is a terror during a party hey alex sat up abruptly clutching one of her pillows he just a little hyper around that many people at once alex darling pansy stopped dress in hand to shake her head that boy is a pain rambunctious she tried pain alex sighed and shrugged you cantdeny he cute milli giggled alex he the hottest boy in our year but he still a pain a cute adorable rich to the hilt old blooded old fashioned sweetheart of a pain the black haired girl glared at her companions so she demanded what your point gods give it a rest bellmonte we all adore your bloody brother pansy snapped so he has a flaw one flaw besides the gender specific ones that is what like being denser than anything else in existence alex sighed in purely feminine exasperation and flopped back into her pillows exactly milli straightened up and turned around to level a look at alex and speaking of boys why arent you going with draco what alex wrinkled her nose cause he didntask me neither did any of the weasleys gonna bring them up next no i was just wondering cause greg told me that malfoy doesnthave a date and what with you ruining all my beauty rest with your sad little dream moans oh draco i do not alex shrieked jerking upright once again and hurling a pillow at the offending friend milli started laughing and sent it straight back at her you re transparent about boys you like lady bellmonte it why no one ever mistaken you and blaisey boy for a couple i am not she repeated inanely glaring somehow the glares didnthave the effect they should have probably because she had to admit in her head if not out loud that milli was right whatever alex ta still smirking milli swept from the room oh my gosh alex muttered shaking her head you um pansy cleared her throat causing alex to look over at her there was pain on her face you would ve gone with him if he d asked you draco when pansy nodded she sighed i guess but he never would have you know his parents and mine you can imagine the carnage if they found out he would never have risked asking me but you wanted him to it wasntmeant as a question i look i know he was with you last year if there some ex boyfriend rule you think i ve broken pansy then we need to talk about it a sharp hurried knock cut her off abruptly ending the conversation the look pansy was giving her as she headed for the door was nothing short of murderous and for the life of her alex couldntfigure out why which was precisely why they needed to have this talk when fellow slytherins didntlike you they said so to your face and the two of you had it out usually in a duel in common room this brittle silence was infuriating a second louder knock was just beginning as alex yanked open the door she paused hand on the knob and blinked on the other side clutching a chaotic mass of cloth which could have at one point been dresses stood a harried looking tania dethart i going to the ball she declared as if it was new information and it all wrong the smaller girl gave her pile a malicious shake none of it works it came out just as angry as the rest of her words but there was a whimper in it alex fought a grin suddenly understanding you donthave anything to wear do you all the fury drained out of her face leaving only desperate frustration no she wailed alex laughed sympathetically you poor thing come in i ll fix it with gentle hands she took the crumpled clothing and tossed it on her bed motioning the girl inside if you need anything from mine go ahead and use it pansy said abruptly snatching up her purse and making a harsh exit alex cast her a strange look which she didnt notice before turning back to her subject tania was standing in the middle of the open area fidgeting okay then she shut the door behind her tania nothing meant but strip the other girl jumped what had she forgotten i was there crossing to her own wardrobe which stood directly behind the door anyway alex glanced briefly at tania who was obediently taking off her school uniform then frowned and stared at her clothes it didntactually take all the long to decide all of her uniforms were out as were all of her old dresses that she d already worn but hadnthad time to alter yet there was no way she would make tania look like she had to resort to hand me downs so all that was left were her new things and of those only a few were ball material no pun intended of those one was brown no chance given tania coloring and one was silvery grey waaaaay too clich no house colors hmm let do no umm this one alex snatched up the dress and held it up to tania after a second she nodded yeah try it on obediently tania did her face lighting up as she felt the silk slide down over her skin with a little twisting to get it to sit right and alex casting a temporary hemming spell that fit it to her slightly smaller size it was on and alex cast an appraising eye over it ankle length with plenty of flow in the skirt the gown was a deep red with hints of purple in it it was backless with a v neck cut just a little too low to be conservative coming up tie around behind her neck perfect no tania no mirrors until i finish here put those on alex handed over the dancing slippers meant for that dress simple and elegant they were made of accenting black silk tania took them and sank onto the bed as alex crossed the room to her desk pulling out a jewelry case she began humming as she rummaged through it here she said again dropping a pair of dangly earrings into tania open hand i ll get the choker what what kind of gems are these tania asked softly looking at the glittering black jewels black opals i think her friend replied a black silk ribbon bearing a much larger version of the opals in the earrings dropped across her eyes for a second as alex tied the chocker deftly around her neck that brilliant now hair up or down do you think tania opened her mouth but before anything came out alex decided down definitely down it long enough you wontfreeze in that dress tania smiled feeling the first hints of excitement bubbling up under the anxiety of it all sliding the earrings in she reached up and began pulling out the pins keeping her hair out of her way alex stopped her rummaging and turned back towards her a black ribbon in one hand she froze suddenly a frown twisting her smile umm tania tania let her hands drop from her hair in confusion saw her own bare arms and blanched there was no way she d screwed up so badly it was and now alex knew and well then gloves i think the calm acceptance in the other girl voice ended the panic attack before it got off the ground reaching around behind her alex pulled out a handful of elbow length gloves of half a dozen colors pulling out the surprise black ones she handed them over before moving around to kneel on the bed behind her tania stared at the lengths of silk as she felt a brush working its way through her hair breathe m dear alex said softly near her ear i not going to say anything tania lips twitched and she wanted to say something anything but there wasntanything she swallowed painfully as if something were caught in her throat and took a deep breath to calm her shattered thoughts i think i ll do a little of both actually tania let just take most of this top layer around your face and do a half ponytail uhh tania applied all of her genius to a reply sure whatever you want alex sniffed arrogantly always dear always she stopped her puttering and leaned over tania shoulder and smiled at her profile all done go find a mirror tania shrugged walking over to the full length mirror whatever alex said tania had seen herself made up before it wasntgoing to be much different except it was she wasntin a dress designed to create a wallflower of her in fact despite the length of fabric and the gloves a very great deal of her skin seemed to be showing a very great deal of her skin was showing and she looked good tania started to grin at her reflection hey i done myself if you are tania we should go blaise isntlate to anything alex words had a profound affect tania stopped grinning shit she hissed blushing furiously still watching the mirror tania noticed that the red flush extended much lower than her neck alex appeared behind her in the reflection her gown white with a scarlet corset her face serious you look gorgeous tani let him think he leading and keep him on his toes you ll have no problems she wrinkled her nose me on the other hand i going with the head baddock himself i will be having problems tania started to giggle and alex smoothed her skirt and straightened the off the shoulder ruffle that made up her very southern american style gown what she asked innocently just nothing tania shook her head let go alex felt a smile cover her mouth wondering if tania would blame her for abandoning her to blaise she wondered if maybe tania would actually yell at her now that might be fun out the portrait hole and down the hall alex kept her skirt out of her way with one hand and wove automatically through the standing groups of students on the left side of the great stairs exactly three steps up exactly where he said he would be lounged alone donovan baddock he looked bored he looked tired of the whole thing alex would bet good money her parent of course that he was as giddy as she despite her initial misgivings somewhere between trapping a date and choosing a dress alex had started looking forward to the ball stopping at the bottom of the stairs she looked up at him hands on her hips so are you ready for your social debut baddock donovan started minusculely before flashing her a smile i hate to disappoint you alex but i ve already been introduced to society ah her smile turned decidedly flirtatious with just a hint of smugness but never on the arm of a bellmonte oh he mined a pout and here i thought you were going to be my arm candy not the other way around alex shrugged unrepentantly sorry donovan i asked you i get the perks granted but either way i get to go with you you have fueled my fantasies for months alex opened her mouth stopped and frowned sharply at him donovan baddock you were talking to blaise about this guilty the boy is full of advice on he cleared his throat with a little more than a hint of hesitation how to handle you was he now she started to snicker covering her mouth with one hand thank you for telling me donovan alex moved up a stair and put a hand on his arm dont worry though i wontblame you he sighed in relief then winced that three times now m lady three times of what alex shook her head in confusion three times you ve used my full name he eyed her warily and alex threw up her hands i do not offend that easily baddock so you dontlike donovan okay what would you like to be called i prefer mark she frowned a little mark that not your middle name i dontthink so why mark to her complete and enduring shock he blushed i can t say those who know are sworn to silence he added hurriedly and alex knew why the instant he d said he couldnttell her it had become a puzzle the look on her face was probably somewhat fear inspiring to someone with a secret uh know what you can call me van instead sure i wontpry if you ask me not to he opened his mouth and she waved a hand as if to clear the air between them consider it asked van so van bowed and offered her his arm shall we go in we ll be fashionably late and indeed the entrance hall had emptied greatly since their conversation had begun the huge doors to the great hall open on a glittering scene of course alex grinned and slipped a hand into his elbow let us always be fashionable a n there we go i forgot but someone did ask how i could jump from a task 1 to b yule ball well m dear let me put it this way nothing interesting happened between a and b sorry also there is going to probably be a two week period with no updates check the tania story she will still be here maybe but i going away to church camp for a week or so so while i ll be writing none of it will be on the computer and i wonthave net access not my fault and i ll try to have something ready for right when i get back a n two words halfblood prince read it adored it a must read as if anyone was planning to skip it as it stands i working on re working my long term plot a little so that it matches up yeah even though you probably couldnttell i do have this story planned in detail through 7th year it wontchange too much in the near future but i can promise that alex draco goodness will probably proceed faster than it would ve before thanks for your patience draco tugged on his sock again before sliding his feet into his dress boots slim fingers pulled on the laces tightening the supple leather around his upper calves standing he wiggled his knees until the crisp black fabric pants fell back into place a half hearted yawn escaped his mouth and draco reached above his head stretching oh put a shirt on malfoy greg said flicking him in the stomach with his robe as he walked past no one wants to see your pretty pecs yet you re the only one who noticed them goyle draco missed greg response as he pulled his shirt over his head but blaise shout of surprised pain made it clearly through the cloth he gave a hasty yank and freed his head blaise was on the floor engaged in an enthusiastic wrestling match with greg draco laughed at them both as he stuffed his arms into the shirt blouse like sleeves come on old boy vince waded calmly in and grabbed a handful of greg collar you know what bellmonte would do if you marked up her boy toy what are you talking about greg sputtered straightening i wasntanywhere near draco blaise let out an entirely unflattering snort oh if she heard you draco scoffed and crossed over to the mirror i am not a boy toy he said casually fluffing his hair i am a kept man the other boy finally picked himself up off the floor with a shrug suit yourself i am a boy toy and i am not listening to this i outta here i with you vince try not to take too long primping girls blaise response was smooth elegant and not entirely anatomically possible greg just grinned and waved as he shut the door behind them with them gone silence fell and draco absently tied the cuffs on his sleeves the shirt itself was loose and breezy and pale icy blue he reached back and grabbed his robes they were black with silver lining his mother had planned and sent him out the whole thing as soon as she d found out about the ball it was as close as she d come to the dreaded ice prince wardrobe he d suffered through years ago had suffered until one day when he d snapped and coldly told her that if she wanted a ghost as an escort she could very well use one but he wouldntplay the part anymore he snickered at his reflection the look on her face had been amazing after that she d dressed him in solid black for weeks until someone had asked who had died after that he d been allowed to dress himself mostly one last fluff of his hair a quick fastening of the frog clasp at his throat and he was public perfect once more donttake too long blaise he admonished on his way out the door you have a date waiting for you i not going to feel sorry for you draco blaise called after him as he descended towards common room i didntask you to draco muttered to himself sliding his hands into the pockets of his pants parchment crackled and his mood turned a little sour the clothes had come with a price tag a letter from his mother it was less than her usual chatty missives but more one line sticking out in his head things are changing draco for good or ill stay alert worry settled sharply on his forehead and he wove through the jazzed chaos of common room without really noticing it she was obviously concerned but things are changing made it impossible to define the threat draco grumbled softly to himself wishing his mother would for once write him a letter that was straight forward and helpful instead of acting like the enemy whoever that was was reading over his shoulder the halls outside his house were cool and quiet quite the perfect place for worry to consume him into a full on brood but draco was having none of it tonight he was going to have fun and if the opportunity presented itself make his move to secure his new girlfriend he felt a smile tug at the corners of his mouth and didntfight it there were problems and obstacles to the relationship some massive in scale but dammit she was just so amusing oh true she did have a date tonight but that didnt bother him donovan and him were on while not precisely friendly term still terms of a kind it would be good enough having successfully shaken off his gloom draco stride took on a more distinct swagger as he paced towards the entrance hall the closer he got the more people there were and not all of them his housemates after a while the sounds of too many conversations in too little space rolled towards him through the dungeons but even through all of that he was able to pick out one distinctly familiar voice oh really pansy and he tracked her words and finally found them her dates three ravenclaws circled her down a side hall and the girl herself looked something less than happy about it all draco hesitated look slytherin that is the third time you ve told me to look and i ll ask you for the third time look at what you pubescent bookworm she snarled back coldly so not a friend then draco growled a little in the back of his throat how dare straightening and putting on the frigid malfoy persona he joined the group pansy he greeted sliding in next to her early as usual i apologize for making you wait she sent him a look that said i can handle this and thank you at the same time you re forgiven draco he inclined his head so who re your friends pansy smiled they aren t she replied cheerfully really draco raised an eyebrow significantly and watched as all three paled well if they re not friends of yours there this one spell i ve been dying to try he slipped a hand into his pocket where his wand was currently residing and grinned evilly you wouldntdare malfoy one particularly brave soul snapped every fiber of his being demanded that he snap wouldnti and attack the other boys but he d been trained better than that he slowly let all of the tension drain from his body and laughed it was quite probably the last thing they expected and as per plan the sudden and random appearance of a laughing malfoy completely freaked them out they shifted uneasily exchanging glances then almost as one they all turned and walked away very quickly the instant the ravenclaws were out of sight draco sobered his grin dropping into a scowl are you alright pansy shiver was barely noticeable as she gazed after the three boys fine good draco eyed the secluded hallway as if it was to blame why were you down here i was over there she pointed at a well lighted crossroads farther down waiting for my date date yeah eddie boles pansy frowned angrily he was late the ravenclaws weren t yeah he said noncommittally come on i ll find milli for you pansy nodded resigned finality on her face as she took the arm he offered with a bow filch has been busy she commented the entrance hall had little up in the way of decorations but the whole place practically shown the high window lit the huge room firelight reflecting off their dark surfaces draco leaned closer to her to be heard in the chaos i doubt we d be able to find a spot of dirt within ten miles for all he an annoying terror he really is good his job she replied politely scanning the crowd draco spotted the clear space around his two cronies easily come on i see them he led her further into the room guiding her and protecting her from the twisting jostling throng when greg spotted them he used his well earned reputation to clear the rest of the way for them goyle he bowed pansy off his arm and onto his dorm mate s the lady needs looking after of course greg said immediately looking at his new date in concern are you alright fine she repeated with a sigh just fine but i d like a word with eddie if you happen to find him she knows me too well draco decided she knows i going to go track him down i ll keep an eye out good evening ladies draco inclined the top half of his body towards them and took his leave as he walked away he heard milli ask so what happened he smirked the story would be all over slytherin house before the ball was over eddie was in for it and soon if draco had anything to say about it he scanned the mass of humanity again looking for any of the sixth year boys he spotted donovan easily standing apart on the stairs but as draco approached alex cut across to join her date draco sighed but now wasntthe time so he went in searching of someone else he came across hunter chatting amiably with his date just as the doors to the great hall slid open dethart he called joining him amidst the rush into dinner good evening draco raya greeted kindly my lady draco bowed dontlet me interrupt i just wanted to know if you ve seen eddie hunter frowned not recently why draco eyes sparked with anger he was supposed to be escorting pansy supposed to hunter glanced over at the younger boy as he pulled his date closer to keep her from being run over she got cornered by a trio of bird brains hunter froze mid step and growled i ll let you know if i find him he snapped i d appreciate it he smiled at the visibly angry girl please dontlet this upset your evening i wonttake up anymore of your time bowing yet again he headed off after a few interesting moments of dodging and weaving draco found himself a seat it wasntexactly near anyone he knew but it did afford him a good view of the hall the colors of the four houses spun dizzily across the walls separated by the muted colors of greenery that kept the vibrancy from becoming overwhelming the hogwarts crest was also very much in evidence and while the whole show was rather ostentatious it did come across with a quiet dignity that made what would have been offensive merely exuberant the headmaster leaned forward and ordered his dinner from his plate it was the good cutlery draco noted as he breathed the pine laden air and considered his options there was no menu and draco knew very well the culinary limits of house elves after a few moments silent of thought he finally went with calamari and scallops in a light burgundy wine oh and twice baked potatoes with extra cheese sparkling white grape juice it all appeared with that distinctive white flash representative of house elf magic and draco hummed a single happy note it wasntoften he got to eat exactly what he wanted when he wanted selecting a fork he began picking slowly at the food after a few minutes a stray thought passed through his mind you know it really is interesting how the color of the cheese contrasts with the color of the potato and the color of the skin it was then that draco discovered just how bored he really was he resolved to fix that glancing around he finally noticed that he really was completely isolated from everyone he knew there were slytherins scattered in his general area but they were all firmly entrenched with their dates draco sighed good thinking malfoy even alex found a socially acceptable date his eyes fell upon a pair of hufflepuffs engaged in animated conversation the girl had straight brown hair that fell to a little past her shoulders and her dress was distinctly muggle style the boy on her right draco left was obviously her date and even more obviously not sure how to treat her aw draco whispered in a faintly grandfather ish tone he likes her the boy said something causing the girl to hastily swallow her food draco was too far away to hear what was spoken so he made it up in his head so uh the steak is really good cough is it yeah really juicy mhmm yeah my chicken good too and draco decided that realistic was even more boring that doing nothing did you know the boy asked gesturing to his plate that i like steak rare because the juices on my plate remind me of blood oh she leaned forward eagerly spearing a bite of his meat what kind of blood the blood of my victims human victims of course are there any other kinds worth considering she laughed no though i doubt you ve killed more than me possibly but do unborn children count the ice prince jerked minutely in his chair draco malfoy you are a morbid bastard you know that yeah so as entertainment and possibly punishment draco settled back to watch alex and donovan baddock enjoy the feast a n to sod off etc briefly when i posted that little whine hadntupdated to it current form so there was no such thing as that stat which i now have and love btw plus the counter is a little off cause evertime anyone pulls up one of my chapters it counts up so if you sat and read every chapter in a row then it would add 39 to the total i actually have over 2000 hits but i canttrusty it 100 also i find it ironic you envy me my almost 100 reviews when i sitting here envying those mega read stories with thousands of reviews anyway thanks to the hbp work and now college my updates will be a little longer apart but me and my sister are always making each other feel guilty for not writing ever spare second so it wontstop completely if i donthave another chapter up by sept 1st go ahead and find a chapter you haventreviewed and chew the crap out of me for being so lazy reposted 12 04 07 fixing bad spelling bad grammar and other typos etc etc alex what a surprise i had no idea you would be here today draco looked up from his circle of sycophants and grinned at her i ve never been known for my lack of social involvement draco alex smiled back i wouldnthave missed this for the world draco smile flickered briefly her poke at his own less than stellar record of social attendance was so well aimed he doubted anyone else noticed it isntit great alex julia flint cousin to the slytherin quidditch captain bubbled up next to draco draco malfoy and alexandria bellmonte both at my event you re never both at the same thing unless the other person is throwing it there never been an event quite like this one so why wouldntwe come alex smiled at the eternally cheerful second year the girl comments were true due to their overwhelming social influence narcissa and deana tried to coordinate so that neither family presented overwhelming support for any other lesser family they also tried not to have both family names represented at any one event indeed when i read the invitation i couldntwait to attend draco commented amused with all the effort your father put into getting clearances from the ministry this ought to be quite entertaining no one was completely sure what tonight s extraordinary entertainment was going to be all anyone knew was that it had taken a ton of money to bribe the clearances out of the ministry of magic not that that was anything new mind you but there had been rumors circulating over the nature of the show for weeks however it turned out it promised endless fun for alex either it would live up to its hype or it would be terrible and then she d get to abuse the flints for a few months i agree what more could one ask for but a beautiful day alex gestured first to the clear blue sky overhead then to the circle of teenagers around her and wonderful companions to share it with the beauty of the day pales in comparison with the company draco put in smoothly the girls in the circle sighed softly how charming of you draco alex responded trying to divine his game arenti though and arrogant too she noticed the quickly concealed horror on nearly every face around her no one spoke to a malfoy that way it wasntdone but she was a bellmonte who was going to stop her alex could almost hear the headaches forming she suppressed a grin how kind of you to notice i ve been working on developing that trait lately draco gaze flickered briefly from her toes to her head you ve developed some new interesting traits yourself recently alex oh yes alex grinned purposefully mistaking his meaning and continuing cheerfully i ve become fluent in two more spell languages and my mother has finally gotten around to teaching me her collection of castration spells draco choked on the punch someone had offered him there was a flurry of concerned female voices offering him everything from a napkin or towel to a new drink or a new shirt alex laughed dontworry ladies he ll be fine i think he just allergic to something nearby she extracted herself from the group i have other people i simply must greet i ll talk to you all later alex managed to avoid draco for the rest of the afternoon it wasntuntil later that night that she met up with him again the entertainment had finished and had turned out to be quite pathetic a display of fire works and other forms of muggle explosives she d been sitting on the grass enjoy the cool night air and the quiet muggle explosives really do live up to the name you know when he approached her alex come for a walk with me alex glanced up at darius goyle older brother of one of draco cronies alex had never liked him he was large strong and not at all opposed to using those attributes to get what he wanted no matter what it was or who objected i rather tired darius i think i ll just stay here and rest she offered him an apologetic smile that conveyed some level of exhaustion i know something that will re energize you faster than any amount of sitting and resting darius seized her hands and hauled her to her feet come on alex i wonttake no for an answer excuse me alex tried to pull her hands free and that only resulted in darius closing his grip around her wrists tight enough to hurt alex never knew why draco malfoy appeared beside her she only knew he did and she had never been more grateful for his presence though she never knew the why of that either it wasntlike she couldntblast the big man into the dirt is she wanted to well if she needed to i highly recommend you remove your hands from her draco voice was low and anything but pleasant he slid one arm around alex waist she tensed but then she realized what he was going for and playing along she rested her head on his shoulder i do think i ll need use of my hands before the night is over darius draco might object otherwise alex widened her eyes and smirked knowingly the malfoy men are known for being jealous apparently her not so subtle comments were enough to remind goyle that he was facing off a bellmonte and a malfoy and the malfoy seemed to be angry with him alex suddenly found herself in possession of her own hands again perhaps you should leave alex wondered if the air had dropped in temperature due to draco tone or if it was just her apparently darius discovered the effect too because he disappeared into the night without a sound an amazing feat for such a large man you re alright draco was still glaring off after darius of course i am it struck alex that he d just commanded her to be alright not asked if she was she started to remove herself from his grip i was handling it you know draco finally looked down at her tightening his grip on her waist i was handling it better i doubt he ll ever speak to you again as long as he thinks you belong to me i dontbelong to anybody draco few men have ever handled being in a relationship with a bellmonte woman no one has ever owned one alex tried to rip away again stop that draco commanded i trying to talk to you and i trying to leave it would seem our interests conflict why do you think i your enemy alex his voice seemed impossibly soft i dontknow draco maybe the threats and the leering alex realized she wasntangry any more just tired what can i say he spread his arms releasing her and smiled i a product of my society sadly true keep going to these things alex maybe i ll show up to another one draco smirked suddenly every inch the jerk she hated he disappeared into the night alex stared after him confused what just happened she breathed softly to herself how the hell did he manage that round four complete winner draco malfoy alex was floating on a cloud well sort of ever since they d walked through the hall doors mark had been the perfect gentleman acting kind and attentive and making her feel beautiful and the meal she d let him order for her was absolutely delicious but for the love of merlin she couldntshake the feeling that someone was watching her it was just a feeling and in a room this size it was impossible to pin down a culprit but it still made her skin crawl mark was of course all over it are you cold alex she shrugged maybe a little it was probably just a draft probably he agreed she wanted him to insist on casting a warming spell on her gown to which she would ve objected as it would ve been arrogant and controlling and then they d have had a fight so why exactly did she want him to in the first place alex decided that she was just going mad from the inbreeding yeah that was a good enough excuse that thought trailed off and before she could dredge up another one dumbledore stood almost abruptly a wave of his hand and a genial invitation brought the rest of the students to their collective feet there was a faint breeze as the tables retreated to the walls clearing a dance floor the headmaster waved his wand once more and a stage rose out of the floor the weird sisters took their places and the champions stepped off the line with their dates and swung into the dance alex sighed and languidly lifted herself free of her chair let make the rounds and get it over with will do i think i spotted some of ours over there he nodded left lead on she took his arm so yours mine or social contacts what the people we re going to see your friends my friends or necessary social contacts oh either a or c i think okay then alex started lining up expressions and topics of conversations for the approaching face to face dontworry mark whispered leaning close to be heard they ll love you she sent him an amused look but inwardly was gratified by it he really was quite the sweetheart when it got right down to it do you think i care who likes me baddock he just looked at her yes the look alex was sending him suddenly became less amused just because he was a bloody sixth year he thought he knew anything oh look she said coldly it eddie mark sighed with what she translated as pity hey ed the other boy turned at his name and the two clasped hands mark and the lovely lady bellmonte of course ed took her hand and bowed over it good evening eddie but and here she reclaimed her limbs from both boys just to make her point where pansy eddie shrugged helplessly when i showed up where we were meeting she wasntthere i see alex frowned pansy had left to meet him long before alex herself had met up with mark she should have been more than on time and not just that pansy was the very definition of social climber though less odious than say her parents she would never show up at a social event alone never not when she had a date anyway so what could ve before she could follow that thought to its logical conclusion an arm dropped heavily across ed shoulder physically jarring him edward hunter greeted in a falsely light voice miss bellmonte could i possibly impose upon you to entertain raya for a few moments you possibly could could i ask what this pertains to alex replied lightly linking arms with the other girl who strangely enough didntseem to mind getting passed off like this i believe alex raya responded that the boys merely need to address edward current bachelor hood alex was nobody idea of a fool her head and shoulders slowly drew back and up and she raised an eyebrow but mark was no fool either really it strange we were just talking about that now that is funny hunter commented not that funny alex snapped though she didntmove out of courtesy for raya what did you do with my dorm mate you unpunctual cretin temper my lady charlie corrected easily joining the group i dontunderstand what you re all shut up ed you were late only a little bit late though if miss parkinson got offended over that then you were thirteen minutes late hunter all but snarled which was more than long enough for her to get set upon by three birdbrains and need to be rescued by draco eddie to his credit paled brilliantly ladies if you will kindly let the gentlemen handle this charlie said graciously apparently the only one currently retaining the ability to speak of course raya replied for them both leading alex out of hearing range of the group edward was going to get a dressing down between peers it would only humiliate him to have women witness it set upon alex asked in a low voice she fine ray assured it was apparently all verbal then draco stepped in hunter and i stopped by and chatted with them for a few minutes them raya smiled seems your mini malfoy not only saved her but he also found her a date alex felt a faint pressure in her chest and swallowed to try and relieve it well she is his ex the older girl laughed you re not perfect alex bellmonte you should see your face right now i just called him your mini malfoy did i not she began breathing again and pretended nothing had happened so who is she with gregory goyle they re safely ensconced with his friend vincent crabbe and her friend millicent none of them looked like they were planning to move anytime so our deepest apologies ladies we can do nothing but humbly beg your forgiveness charlie entreated to those who knew what to look for it was an interesting display of the class system within wizarding social hierarchy charlie warrington stood in front as spokesman flanked by mark and hunter both of lesser bloodlines than himself though only slightly in mark case and then trailed by eddie the shamed one but beyond that the four men sought out and approached the women to beg their forgiveness out of more than just courtesy for as much as their society seemed to resemble a similar muggle institution there was one glaring difference while an irate muggle woman was something of a disturbance there was nothing quite as terrifying as an irate witch thus women had gained equality and even a hint of dominance in some cases much more so than in muggle society and as the women registered the apology they glanced at each other once calculating rapidly raya della was of lesser blood than alex but she was older and part cromwell the facts balanced almost evenly leaving the question of who would take the lead up in the air but it was nothing if not a familiar conundrum and alex inclined her head slightly of course you know you have it gentlemen raya gracefully offered charlie her hand in assurance he clasped it briefly before passing her off to her date alex slid over to mark and put her hand on his arm smiling at him to show her agreement he blinked and then smiled back we ll see you later mark said strongly steering her back into the crowd if you can find us charlie called after them alex snickered and muttered we wontbe looking hard mark smiled at her again welcome to my world sorry about that i getting the feeling i ll be saying that myself before this evening over so let call it even ever as my lady desires where to next pansy she said without hesitation i thought as much come on incoming greg murmured pansy scowled word had gotten out at break neck speeds and ever since everyone with a connection to her or to eddie had stopped by to chat for a moment translated that came to to check her over and report back to the rest of the gossips it was annoying and getting worse by the chat the only time pansy got this kind of attention at a social function was when she pulled a stunt and even then it wasntthis much of this kind of attention alex and donovan milli announced brightly pansy was suddenly grateful for her friends even if the boys didnt technically count they d all taken to playing her bodyguards right off and were making the whole event she d become bearable and at least this time it was one from each camp coming together two birds with one stone hey milli alex greeted lightly hugging her friend like normal boys pansy she only offered smiles to the rest of them retreating back to her date arm just like normal pansy frowned and looked at her dorm mate alex met her subtle gaze squarely okay so alex did know and was here to check up on her but she wasntgoing to harp on it she let out her breath slowly in relief and felt her spirits start to recover so has anyone else had any problems with the frenchies they all groaned at milli remark alex sighed more so than with the bulgarians apparently viktor mates donthold him in as high regard as his headmaster does ever since i put him in his place well they ve been downright friendly if a little scared of me not a one of those icy twigs has even given a hint of having manners for all they whine about ours vince added stupid barbarians donovan mocked in smooth french as if we cantunderstand them greg laughed you re just sore that your bloodlines arentgood enough for them you lot should ve seen it he was trying to be courteous and introduced himself their ringleader that little wisp of a veela crossbreed looked him over and said baddock isntthat italian stock i donthit women donovan stated darkly dontfeel bad mark alex consoled even my blood is inferior to them and i have a french branch of my family what milli exclaimed staring at alex but i thought you bellmontes only the one marriage one heir rule yeah we do but that doesntmean accidents donthappen the three boys exchanged a look yeah that it accidents vince muttered as they all snorted into their fists oh shut up milli scolded smacking her date on the arm i mean it blood that counts alex continued blithely look at it this way if you all didnt acknowledge your bastard branches you d be in pretty dire straits no pansy nodded her agreement who here has siblings only donovan raised his hand a little brother in his first year and a couple of sisters even younger even pansy looked shocked there are four of you two children in a pureblood family wasnt unheard of but four or even three was you re related to the cromwells arent you alex queried that group was known for huge families it was why there were so many of them in slytherin at all times fraid not well milli huffed i at least take your point alex we must compromise or we re screwed that not exactly it i wasntgoing anywhere near as deep she shrugged i was just going to point out that i hope you want to get married otherwise even your heirs wontofficially count now lex vince flipped his hair and adopted his best blaise impression what did i say about springing the word marriage on unsuspecting men all six of them started laughing and i think that my cue to leave alex prompted donovan smiled would you like to dance my pleasure completely he started to lead her off and alex cast a patented isnthe just adorable smile back at her girlfriends milli rolled her eyes she gonna end up with both a consort and a fully stocked harem isntshe pansy snorted with only a touch of bitterness she thirteen and has half of male slytherin house wrapped around her littlest finger what do you think wisely neither of their dates answered the question incoming greg intoned man it hard to come up with new topics of conversation all the time mark grumbled to himself as he led his date out onto the dance floor he blew a strand of hair out of his eyes it wasntso bad with people he knew he could say anything he felt to hunter etc without a care as to what they d think but this wasntone of his buddies this wasnteven one of his female friends this was a girl an actual honest to merlin girl who was cute and single and frankly intimidating though she didntseem to realize it her hand was currently tucked trustingly into his as he led the way onto the dance floor he was glad for the list of presentability spells guys passed around to each other namely the anti clammy one he smiled at her as he pulled her around to face him the current song was middle tempo so they settled a half step apart mark sliding his arm around her waist so alex startling green eyes rose to look directly into his and she was smiling he swallowed did you hear about the huge american national quidditch team scandal her loose black curls floated around her head as she moved to the beat mesmerizing him until she spoke i couldnttell you if america had a quidditch team alex wasntfrowning but her smile was more polite and less happy i dontfollow the sport you dontfollow quidditch he asked reflexively disbelief all over his face of course muggle sports are so much more entertaining her tongue traced a line over her top lip there so much more blood mark felt himself freeze what in the oh dontbe ridiculous i dontfollow any sport she scoffed he was being obsessive he knew it he was bored he was obsessing and he was annoyed at being obsessive but as he d said he was bored so there was nothing to distract him silver grey eyes narrowed as a one donovan baddock up until now a perfectly fine male companion in draco world led her onto the dance floor neither one of them could see him through the crush so he wasted no time glaring at them well not much time someone jostled him from behind making him stumble forward draco jerked back up and whirled on a pair of ravenclaws the boy he didntknow but the girl was a prefect he d had reason to meet before she d caught him out of bed in a place he wasntsupposed to be stolen medical potions and paraphernalia under one arm for reasons he d never been able to figure out she d let him off so he let his anger fade keep a tighter leash on you boy toy lisa he might tackle someone more vengeful than i then because he couldnthelp himself he took her free hand and bowed kissing the back gently a harsh look of jealousy filled her date face lisa turpin raised an eyebrow thank you malfoy i ll be seeing you the two moved away leaving draco in the same proposition he d been before a new song started one draco had rigged as a warning he d lost track of alex and mark so he waded into the dancing crowd they were just about where he d last seen them mark saw him approach and something between resignation and relief was in his smile draco sniggered to himself completely understanding it he tapped alex on the shoulder she turned and he bowed may i cut in he asked formally alex eyes scanned him from top to bottom then she smiled of course dontyou boys mind me and her amusement was obvious as she stepped away from them both draco saw understand reach mark the same moment it found him ever as my lady wishes mark said heavily laced with sarcasm draco wondered idly what alex had been doing to the poor boy this evening he didntget a chance to ponder the question because mark was bowing to him and offering him a hand i haventhad near enough to drink he protested stepping into the other boy arms and sweeping off into the dance behind them he could hear alex cracking up and a quick glance revealed that she was doubled over barely keeping her feet let keep this up until the end of the song draco prompted what mark chuckled tired of my company shut up baddock i have an arrangement with the band one aristocratic eyebrow went up in amusement oh this was the signal song the next five are slow dances ah hah he glanced over at alex now off the dance floor and using a highly amused greg as a support well you have my blessing you two deserve each other as the two boys swirled past her tara cromwell whistled loudly calling you go boys flaunt it and they were attracting attention draco waggled his fingers at a group of unashamed starers as the song flowed to an end mark spun draco one last time and let go have a good night lovebirds he said by way of leaving having deposited draco at alex feet draco didntwaste any time talking he swept alex into his arms and back onto the dance floor lovebirds alex scoffed as the slow strains of a sappy love song filled the huge room draco looked her straight in the eyes why not they danced in silence a dreadful uncertainty edging into her gaze as she searched his face then she scowled abruptly what are you playing at malfoy she demanded angrily you know very well what he interrupted keeping his voice even the parental sized problems to all this yeah she snapped they re obstacles not impossibilities alex bit her lower lip so it a challenge and when have you ever backed down from a challenge draco swallowed and went for broke i like you lex the disbelief and distrust was painful to watch though draco knew he d be reacting exactly like she was if the positions were reversed darkened green eyes narrowed you sure as hell had better not be lying to me draco and no cheating on me either dontforget blaise tells me everything it took him only a second to grasp what she d said though it was rather convoluted and she d come at it sideways it was all he could do not to break into a cheek splitting grin he settled for smirking widely the same goes for you then with who she scoffed we bellmontes are notoriously monogamous unable to come up with a response that wouldnt get him into trouble draco leaned in and kissed her happily that all folks occasionally i have to have something good happen to my babies next chapter all hell breaks loose wonttell you why but we see blaise and tania again and if i get the inspiration i hoping to for this next bit i should get out 3 chapters this month maybe i make no promises it was too good to be true this moment of unblemished happiness and she really should ve known better as usual it was blaise who grounded her back in reality the worry in his eyes halted her steps mid dance causing draco to step on one of her feet i sorry lex are you the pale prince trailed off when he noticed blaise she gone alex another couple made a mad last minute dodge of blaise when he stopped with them in the middle of the dance floor who tania she frowned what did you do nothing he looked about ready to tear his hair out she was happy she was laughing i went to get her a drink while she rested from all the dancing when i came back she was gone well did you yes the witnesses all said she left with her brother alex stiffened and shivered against draco arm what brother she breathed anxiously blaise just shook his head draco glanced between them what wrong with tania dethart and or her brothers alex looked up at him you ve met falon dethart haventyou it was an entirely rhetorical question he eyed her with exasperation come on alex grabbed both of their arms and pulled let go find mark draco expression darkened with a suspicion and jealousy that was entirely unbecoming fortunately alex didntnotice wading through the dancers and dragging the boys along behind her blaise ignored the dirty looks they were getting trailing along obediently lex umm he either with hunter or knows where he went she tossed over her shoulder draco face cleared first to relief then chagrin several long minutes were spent in fruitless searching before blaise dug in his heels stopping them all against one wall alex this isnt working she didnthave time to do more than frown before draco drew his wand donovan baddock point me the length of ebony spun on his open palm to point unerringly towards the drink table blaise was off like a shot blaise blaise alex called racing after him draco kept pace one arm around her waist and together they barely caught him before he was lost in the crowd what the hurry i i dont know he admitted softly i canthelp thinking something is wrong she wouldnthave just left like that not without having you or someone at least express her regrets he didnt slow or even look over his shoulder as they power walked not of her own free will alex finished or him she shivered again if i ever get my hands on that bastard hey draco arm tightened a little on her waist she glanced at him what do you know that i don t we dont know anything alex explained under her breath they re all too clever and closed mouthed for that we have suspicions only and that nothing good she was going to say more but blaise spotted their prey baddock he snapped his voice tight the duo leaving the drink table pulled to a stop and they saw mark companion and hunter oh dammit nice to see you again too bellmonte hunter drawled shut it blaise snarled tania gone she left with one of her brothers while i was getting her a drink and since it obviously wasnt you hunter paled oh shit everything from murderous rage to despair to terror crossed his frozen face donovan tentatively broke the silence hunt mark make my apologies to raya of course his friend said instantly what else can i do uh hunter cast around appearing to be at a complete loss can you keep people out of the dungeons alex asked yeah hunter nodded round up the guys done let me know how it turns out mark vanished into the press of bodies they wasted no time i ve got a starting point to narrow the search a little blaise put in almost on top of mark parting words from there we can use the tracking spell draco almost physically interposed himself between the two boys who were eying each other like two alpha males from different packs hunter growled lead on zabini and they were off again they moved if it was at all possible even faster through the room this time hunter and blaise were out front practically racing though hunter had no idea where they were going draco and alex trailed them at just under a run shooting quelling glances at anyone who dared object to being run over by the two boys soon enough at the speed they were going it became clear where they were headed a strange arrangement of tables and potted trees created a quiet little corner it was somewhat hard to get into thanks to the placement of tables but as blaise and tania had discovered it made a good place to rest and retreat from the rigors of dancing and social interaction several other couples were using it for that purpose when the four of them literally burst onto the scene all the other students however were from the older grades and all of them were paired off and in various stages of making out needless to say no one noticed the four slytherins they said she went down there somewhere blaise pointed at a small door it led into a small antechamber that in its turn led off in three directions stairs spirals upwards on the right and two hallways branched away on the left one of these stayed on the first floor the other angled down into the dungeons stay by the door draco directed balancing his wand across his palm again he frowned and his eyes unfocused in the tell tale sign of unspoken magic tania dethart point me once again the wand spun father until it was a black blur then slower slower until at last it stopped pointed directly at the wall drac shh draco waved a preemptory hand at them now we know she on this floor and it ll keep shifting to track her as we move alex nodded good one you ll have to show me that one later draco let go she linked arms with the blonde making sure not to bump his wand hand and they strode out the level hallway the sound of a fast scramble behind them preceded hunter and blaise catching up to the duo slowly the light and noise of the great hall fell away behind them it soon became difficult to see and if the hall hadntbeen perfectly straight the floor perfectly level no doubt someone would ve tripped the length of ebony wavered and shifted in the semi darkness draco the only one who could se it at this point jerked to a sudden stop and then started again dashing down a side hallway it all happened too fast for the rest of the group to follow the other boys had to backtrack several steps and alex barely managed to turn with him in time she pivoted on one foot her other leg swinging out to maintain her balance and hitting the stone corner she winced at the jar and had to take a tiny sideways hop to keep from falling the motion shook draco who glanced over as she whispered sorry he looked at her soberly and shook his head no lumos a thin beam of light shot out from the tip of his wand making it even clearer where they were going towards good thinking draco the new light beam let the two boys race ahead impatiently thank you alex mouthed she would ve smiled but the leaden weight of worry in her stomach prevented any such acknowledgement of his sweetness draco smirked a little to himself she fought the desire to roll her eyes the wand shifted again and draco called out left just to make sure they caught the change alex glanced at the darkness that seemed to close in behind them the instant the passed that clenched panicky feeling was still making the muscles in her neck and shoulders tense up you do realize her escort said quietly that we re heading for the outer wall of the castle yeah she bit her lip there arentthat many rooms this way could they be outside in front of them the sound of feet pounding against stone slowed to a stop draco and alex pulled up next to the boys at a four way intersection of halls which way malfoy hunter hissed his breath ragged more from emotions than the run i draco shrugged and shook his head malfoy he grimaced what do you want me to do draco demanded pointing the beam and the wand pointed directly at one corner not even a little off center dragon shite alex muttered trying to think of a way out of this the most obvious was of course to start calling for her but that was too stupid to comprehend if falon got spooked he could kill her out of desperation then against the plan wishes and better judgment of the rest of them before anyone could stop him blaise opened his mouth blai don and yelled tania silence for one breath two faintly muffled almost beyond recognition by the thick stone of the castle a scream of pain reached their ears they took off left alex hauling up her skirts to keep up it wasnt pleasant to run full out in heels that didntmean it wasnt possible jolts of pain shocked up her legs with each foot fall however they thankfully didnthave that far to run this hall paralleled the rooms that were on the outer wall from front to back and it dead ended against the wall itself a small woodened door then led out into a small secluded courtyard it was used rather often during the summer for secret make out sessions it wasntused at all the rest of the time the heavy wood door slammed open thanks to attentions of three pissed slytherin males a second door directly across from this one thunked shut at the same time falon had escaped out onto the grounds hunter growled his fury but where s blaise went absolutely rigid tania at the sound of her name a thin whimper came from a darker patch of snow in the far corner ah hell hunter whimpered himself in a voice choked with tears he was at her side between one breath and the next his hands hovering over her but not daring to touch i shite with healing spells draco said canceling his tania finder spell and taking up a position where he could see both doors if falon dared come back alex nodded blaise he didntmove as she brushed past him to drop to her knees beside the other girl the snow drift was much deeper than she d thought completely covering her calves and knees it was still snowing tania hunter murmured soothingly he linked hands with alex and they lifted her gently just high enough that they could inch forward until their knees hit each other then they laid her back down so she was supported on their laps she whimpered again pitifully as they moved her snow settled in her sticky dark hair in fact most of her felt sticky blaise i cant see the light of the moon and stars was completely blocked out by the thick could cover she glanced back over her shoulder the boy she would ve trusted with her life just stood there unmoving in the snowfall draco please looking at his dorm mate in concern draco spoke his spell spotlights with a steady even glow appeared in the air above them alex choked it was both better and worse than she d thought what she d assumed to be bloodstains was partially tania gown spread in taters around her but there was still far too much blood the smaller girl body was covered in blood from cuts boils and burns there were several strange patched of skin where some curse or hex had gone wrong hunter started to swear vehemently draco spared a glance from guard duty and his face darkened with a fury she was gratified to see tania brother raised his wand a healing spell on his lips no alex grabbed his wand hand for a long second or a small eternity hunter looked like he was about to hit her dontbe an idiot dethart she snapped coldly to cover her fear you dontknow all the spells he used any more than i do you could kill her with the wrong kind of healing interacting with those unknown spells we have to do something of course we do please try and keep her warm hunter i ll use blood magic to stabilize her so we can get her inside how can you be so sure it wontreact with the other magic he asked though he didntstop her from tracing a complex rune on tania forehead because alex shifted out of his way as hunter pulled off his dress robes and wrapped his sister in them i using her blood it ll be the same as if she healing naturally she just doing it really fast tania tensed then relaxed into true sleep as the rune of blood first glowed them faded into her skin alex expression became strained around the edges mobilocorpus hunter whispered after a few minutes and some of the worst purely physical damage began to fade he rose slowly to his feet as tania floated slowly bonelessly up into the air alex jerked to her feet staggering a minute as the cold in her legs affected her balance her anger kept her upright though and she only stumbled once on her way over to blaise blaise she snapped slapping the frozen statue of a slytherin across the face get a frickin hold of yourself you re on point draco will follow behind make sure nobody sees us she hadntrealized how much blood she had on her hands until she saw the bloody print on blaise cheek alex felt immediately guilty as he snapped out of his paralysis and gave her a look so full of anguish it made her want to cry but he gave her no chance to apologize taking point as she d ordered and moving out the door into the castle alex winced and tried to ignore a headache as she took her place next to tania head ignis a flash of flame incinerated the spot of snow that was soaked in blood dontforget the alex never finished her reminder to draco as the courtyard plunged one more into darkness of a starless night a n wow that was one long scene i told you all hell broke loose yay for plot twists lots of yelling the next chapter a n well it been over 2 years to say the least i had no idea my little break for a couple of weeks would turn into this in my defense real life firmly battered me over the head with a board but that neither here nor there after i got several reviews and pms recently i wontname names but y all know who you are many thanks and hugs i realized i should at least take another stab at this at the very least i could finish year 4 so here goes nothing i cannot promise regular updates not like i used to but i will try and make them timely lastly i have actually had this chapter complete and finished since that september all those years ago 2005 i didnt know i had it until i went back through my files about six months ago but i did ah well shrug disclaimer i own nothing but alex but if anyone wants her feel free seriously she scares me in my own head they brushed past one of hunter dormmates alex couldnttell which one in the dark but the finger she pressed briefly to her lips in a plea for silence was acknowledged with a sharp nod and they continued on unmolested and though they were now inside a line of protection in the form of wand wielding teenage boys the appearance of the sharply superior slytherin portrait was never so welcome a quiet merry christmas from blaise who ever said slytherin passwords were mean and they were inside as promised the common room was empty no one had gotten past hunter gang meaning falon hadn t yet at least alex spared a half second of worry for the boys standing guard before refocusing on tania again fire crackled to life automatically on the huge hearth warming the room pleasantly after the bone biting cold outside put her on the couch draco suggested we might need the room agreed hunter moved his wand lowering tania gently onto the plush furniture what was left of the ball gown bunched around her still form alex wrinkled her nose it couldntbe comfortable someone get me the blankets off your bed alex knelt beside the couch and began undoing buttons and blaise could you please summon my kit you know what it looks like all three boys vanished from her sphere of attention though she d only given two orders blaise stood at the bottom of the girl stairs with his wand out but it was still hunter who returned first his arms loaded down with thick fabric under their cover alex finished stripping tania of her rags and tucked the heaviest feather down blanket around her here hunter put a soft towel in her empty hand you chafe her hands while i get her feet she too cold his gaze slipped to some middle distance too cold sure thing hunter her voice snapped him back to his task a minute later draco reappeared with a heavy wooden chest a foot across and half that deep without waiting to be asked he dropped it onto the low coffee table and set to work on tania other hand with a corner of the blanket she seems better now draco said softly as blaise added the other healing kit next to draco on the table could we let her sleep it off she still under curse blaise pointed out as alex shook her head and for all we know leaving them could be just as bad as trying to deal with them with the wrong counter hunter gaze never left the slowly pinking flesh between his fingers as he spoke his face so full of worry that it hurt to look at it if we can get her to wake up she can tell us what he did problem solved but i dontknow if she will alex eyes flashed darkly of course if we had the bastard wand we could find out what he did no all three boys shouted at the same time i ll sit on you if i need to lex draco warned try it she hissed without any real heat maybe next time we re alone he placated alex snorted and turned back to the patient okay then come on tania wake up to their immense surprise it worked her lips twisted in annoyance and she whimpered noooo in a way that fairly begged for just five more minutes tania marie dethart hunter intoned bu hun er i don feel good her deep brown eyes flickered open then screwed up in the corners in pain we know sweetheart but we need to know what wrong with you so we can make it better alex said with an almost furry softness in her voice that none of them but blaise had ever heard before she lightly placed a hand on the other girl forehead to gauge her temperature tania winced and stared why blaise was worried sweetheart so we came and found you tania froze a million things flashed across her battered face in that moment mostly boiling down to fear betrayal fury and shame there was an awkward silence during which everyone tried to figure out what to say strangely it was draco who spoke first hunter couldnthave stopped us from coming falon is a bloody son of a bitch and this isntyour fault no one thinks less of you it was crisp and matter of fact and he met her eyes unblinkingly as he said it tania swallowed she looked back at him in only partial comprehension and shrugged minutely kay hunter winced she she regresses when it particularly bad so do i blaise admitted no one missing the implication that this was a common event tania sweetheart alex murmured do you remember how falon cut you was it a knife or a spell u u ummm tania turned her head towards the back of the couch tania sweetheart i wonttell alex carefully took one of tania hands the other girl hesitated i didnttell about your project did i mmm no that right sweetling i didn t so could you tell me b she paused like she was trying to think b both f f fal he d drew wi his w wan alex back tensed but her expression didntchange sheer force of will and did he give you any potions sweet no tania sounded a little more sure of herself this time it made sense considering what blaise had said about tania affinity for potions in general alex nodded not demeaning tania by asking her if she was sure okay good girl that easy enough then hunter said quietly his eyes finally leaving his sister face to glance up at the rest of the crowd i can take care it from here he slipped his arms underneath tania and lifted her blankets and all she whimpered in pain here alex practically dove into her kit and grabbed a dark green vial with careful fingers she opened it and held it out to tania the younger girl looked at it then at alex in a way that made alex remember how disdainful she d been when she found out alex hadntread potions of the 13th century snape made it alex clarified back when i fell on my way out of the quidditch stands last year it for the pain tania still didntlook enthused but she allowed herself to be dosed with the potion anyway thank you hunter all but mouthed walking away with his sister the trio didntreply as he made his way up the stairs to the boys dorms so much for this draco hefted his own medical kit and followed in hunter footsteps heading back to his own dorm blaise followed silently and after banishing her kit back to her room so did alex thud the door was not shut kindly draco glanced up from sliding his kit back under his bed to see alex apparently not satisfied with that kick the door viciously stop it blaise snarled i will not she snapped back repeating the noise a third time alex dontyou side with him draco malfoy oh please draco threw up his hands and passed her to yank the door back open i going to go call in the watch dogs please be finished murdering each other by the time i get back frustrated as his words were the draco slid the door quietly shut a pale hand grabbed it before it could settle against the frame and her skirt whipping around her ankles alex dashed after him oh sure walk out on me malfoy she shouted after him her feet pounding down the steps even as he vanished out into the hallway merlin only knows you dontcare after all what she to you nothing that what and though the blonde reappeared in the room her yelling didntquiet you sodding stuck up piece of cut it out alex froze excuse me blaise strode forward from his spot on the stairs cut it out alex i will not blaise frederic zabini i will say whatever i want whenever i want to then do it in your own dorm her eyes flashed i pissed off and you re being a jackass blaise scowled and slouched back against the stone behind him immature she scoffed silence pressed in around their heads both trying to hold their tongues as people unnoticed to the combatants started to file in mostly people from their own group those who knew something had gone wrong but then alex burst out with merlin beard i ll rip his vocal cords out of his throat with my bare hands she flexed her hands in front of her face as if preparing to do just that i ll deprive him of his ability to sire children and break every bone in every finger toe and appendage he got he ought to be crucified blaise snapped flayed alive impaled on a pike snogged by a dementor blaise bared his teeth agreed his head snapped up dontyou dare agree with me you bitch alex expression fell flat i ll agree with whatever i damn well please zabini blaise lurched forward off the wall and stuck his face in hers you re just a stupid little girl alexandra with a bad case of arrogance and nothing to back it up if you werentrich at least i am rich in my own right what do you have no money no pride no brains in that pretty little head i suppose it a good thing you like whoring yourself out cause otherwise he grabbed her shoulders painfully his face tense and white you dammed blood mage alex inhaled harshly through clenched teeth i am no she slammed her heeled shoe down on the top of blaise soft dancing shoes damn then jerked one of her arms free blood mage and slapped her best friend across the face if he had been pissed before it was nothing to his expression now blaise didnteven flinch from the physical abuse his face darkening to fury without missing a beat he began to swear at her in a conglomeration of french italian and japanese the insults ranged from comments about her intelligence to cheap slurs against her mother blood line and magical and sexual preference or lack thereof i speak seven dead languages and at least three times as many living ones blaise alex said softly her face far too calm yet i find there are quite a few things that are best expressed without words locking eyes with him alex drew her wand in one hand and a tiny throwing knife in the other she hesitated for a second then cast them both to the ground behind her blaise grinned in a way that could and had scared small children and discarded his own wand you re a sad sorry excuse for a witch putain 1 alex threw herself at him shoving him off balance blaise grabbed her wrist as he stumbled but she yanked it away from him despite the sharp pain it caused her the girl got behind him as he regained balance and wrapped her arms across his throat he grunted and leaned forward his hands reaching up to grab her arms alex fought him pulling with all her weight but making little progress her chest began to hurt from most of her weight which it was currently supporting against his back al ex blaise snarled swinging to his side and dropping her off onto the stone floor she caught her nails across his cheek as she fell the cold stone jarred her spine and she sat for half a second stunned above her blaise merely scoffed whore she snapped again surging to her feet and straight at him he sidestepped lightly and she went flying past towards the stairs and in one solid move vince caught alex as she tried to stop holding onto her as she tried to turn and get back at blaise alex draco said surprised get get off me alex snarled pushing at vince hands he looked down at her and met her blazing eyes calmly do you really want me to he asked let her go crabbe blaise suggested in a low mocking tone i d love to see her try again pathetic little zabini one of the older boys in donovan gang said warningly probably donovan himself but there was no proving it clumped together as they all were mark i think hunter may need you draco cut in with the politely phrased command the fifth year nodded and made for the stairs followed by his year mates still breathing hard in vince arms alex all but wailed but it isnt right hogwarts is supposed to be safe blaise stopped looking furious instead just looking deeply deeply angry apparently not anymore alex scoffed finally extracting herself from vince apparently it never was a n putain french for hooker whore ps if you d like a summary of what going on so you donthave to completely reread it all just drop me a line and let me know i can pound one out for you a n holy crap people still read this thing who knew thanks y all huggles anyway i want to say a specific thanks to teg i had no idea i was missing a scene break in chapter 7 my apologies i intending to go back through the already posted stuff and do a whole bunch of polishing edits so if anyone else noticed or notices anything you think needs fixing please let me know i write fanfic as a way to improve my writing skills and because i minorly obsessed with certain universes so i welcome all comments positive negative or harsh ps i reposted chapters 7 and 8 7 has only minor edits and some shuffling of the description but 8 has a whole knew scene from draco pov because i realized that i knew his motivations but i didntstate them in the fic itself pps this was my first new chapter after not writing this story for 2 years it a little rambly bear with me disclaimer i dontown and make no moneys from my babies alex scrubbed her face uncaring for once that she was admitting via non verbal cues that she was tired it wasntthat she hadntbeen able to sleep that wasnta problem that plagued her often even when she didntwant to when she knew the nightmares were coming she still fell asleep as if she were an innocent child no her problem last night had been that every time she had fallen asleep she d begun to dream and in the dream she was suddenly faced with a younger female housemate that she needed to protect from physical attack on a long term basis basically even asleep her brain kept circling the unpleasantness of last night over and over again her body might have rested but mentally she was exhausted and it didnt look like she d be getting much relaxing done today if she didnt get this problem solved to her own satisfaction which tended to differ from other peoples levels of satisfaction she would be bothered by it until she did the thing was the whole thing was complicated first there was the fact that the detharts were purebloods oh one of the lesser houses to be sure but pure nonetheless and thus they were all bound by the rules by which one member of the society must interact with another member of society most of which were highly antiquated so because tania was an unmarried younger female in the dethart family an older male had the right to do pretty much anything he wanted to her that particular rule didntapply to bellmontes of course because of their female succession but it wasntin general use with most anyone else either most pureblooded witches just wouldntput up with it tania the poor child didntseem capable of standing up for herself or also possible there was a reason she didntdare hit back a more powerful figure like one or both parents could support the behavior or falon could have some sort of control over her blackmail of some kind second not one of their families was closely connected with the detharts if for example tania had been from a second or third line in the zabini family alex could very easily step in the zabinis and the bellmontes had been allies for centuries though it was true that it hadntgenerally been because of a close personal relationship like she had with blaise mostly it was because the lord zabini whoever he was at the time had no trouble working with a dominant female it was the house least bothered by the reversed gender roles in terms of succession oh that wasntto say that alex shook her head merlin she needed sleep okay first tania was technically under falon control according to the rules second there was no inter house connection for them to exploit draco might have a chance talking falon out of it if he invoked his father authority since lord dethart was a known malfoy wanna be but that would be tipping quite a few of his cards and alex couldnthonestly see draco being willing to do so not for some barely known entity like tania hell alex wasntsure she d be willing to expose that much to save tania she wanted the girl safe but she wanted herself safe even more stepping out that far on the branch unless everything went perfectly and falon was a bigger moron than anyone alex had ever met draco might as well be baring his throat to the enemy no it wasntgoing to happen they didnthave a leg to stand on in terms of a straight forward approach they couldntjust blast the little snot into the wall mores the pity she muttered something you d like to share with the class miss bellmonte alex glanced up at professor snape noted him taking note of her condition she smiled faintly gods she loved to hear him talk in that particularly dry tone it was so familiar that it was soothing no matter what the actual words were she briefly considered casting a spell to help her get to sleep just a simple recreation of his voice from memory playing in a loop over and over ten points from gryffindor mister potter ten p miss bellmonte care to join us back on this planet to her horror she felt herself blush faintly sweet merlin it wasntlike she d been having inappropriate thoughts about him or anything she covered with a brilliant smile and chattered so sorry professor i was just trying to recall the exact ingredients in my grandmother memory potion it would help keep important things like the fact that it christmas break and thus we arentin class from slipping your mind i understand how at your age keeping track of the details might become a challenge much to her delight alex caught sight of those two tiny creases on the corners of his eyes and the faint twitch of his lips when you ve succeeded in recalling the specifics of the potion create a report and have it on my desk by the time we resume classes it was said as if he were punishing her for her impertinence but if he d been blaise he would ve winked at her alex nodded sharply dimpling yes sir professor snape without another word he turned and headed out of the great hall as if being hit in the back of the head by a flying broom alex suddenly realized she was being stupid wait professor she all but tumbled out of her seat and leaving her books dashed to catch up to him he paused and turned with an air of bare sufferance she looked up at him professor i need to show someone the error of his ways but i cantjust tell him he being a moron and blast him into a wall i assume we arenttalking about mister malfoy alex snorted him i can call an idiot and blast into walls with all due respect professor instead of reacting like she expected snape just looked down at her and shook his head as if she were suddenly a very slow student then remove all opportunity for him to repeat the error miss bellmonte for a single brief instant alex wanted to whine but that hard professor fortunately for her snape was well out the door before that desire became fully formed she ruthlessly quashed the feeling even if he had still been standing there it wouldnthave helped to say it the best outcome she could hope for would be a slightly sympathetic disgusted stare more likely would be a completely vicious tongue lashing involving the words hufflepuff gryffindor fool and the phrase status in life at least twice and then he d start getting mean alex grinned just imagining it mostly because she wasnthaving to experience it she waved a hand behind her the books she hadntbeen paying any attention to obediently forming into a pile a single sharp motion of her wand a word and they dashed across the room into her book bag she shouldered it and considered levitating it behind her alex shrugged it higher instead and started walking one indulgence led to two which led to weakness in the long run hey bellmonte have you seen blaise nope she called in response not even bothering to glance and see who had asked if she had to take a guess she d say he was in his room probably passed out drunk trying to block out dreams brought on by last night drama she frowned what was wrong with her it felt like her brain was in a million places why couldntshe concentrate this was important alex grabbed a hank of hair and pulled on it hard enough to hurt but just shy of actually pulling out hair physical pain was one of the things that was always always real and it gave her a tangible focus alright make it so that falon canthurt tania anymore even if he wants to she muttered her pace unconsciously speeding up in time with her narrow flow of thoughts so when and why would be exert control over himself why would he not hurt her she wrapped the strand of hair around one finger still pulling well when professors are around he knows that physical abuse whether it his sister or not is against the rules and he has to abide by the rules of the school if he wants to graduate apple cider alex felt a wave of heat wash over her as she stepped unseeing into the slytherin common room clearly someone had been messing with the temperature controls but she didntcare alex much preferred to be warm hey alex but it not like i can sew the hems of their robes together not and live to tell about it hell i donteven think snape would be my main concern if it came down to it a large human type shape was suddenly in her path and she only had time to start registering that fact before she barreled into it hi alex a large hand easily lifted her overstuffed book bag from her shoulder alex glanced back and vince winked at her in front of her greg bowed slightly wontyou join us she wrinkled her nose tugging on the lock of hair i trying to think about something right now boys ah thinking a rather odious task last i heard the words dropped out of vince mouth like a well used reply which it probably was she looked down at her books bag which he was swinging lazily in one hand i not getting that back unless i let you bother me am i vince paused as if he actually hadntconsidered that angle before in a sweeping motion greg grabbed the bag and held it out of course you can but come on two brains are better than one hands closing around soft leather straps alex considered there are three of us you know she commented neutrally greg glanced at vince then back at her and grinned would you like the big chair or the sofa she glanced at both options and decided the matter by simply dropping onto the couch a soft blanket was draped over the back and she tucked it around her legs at the boys sat themselves alex it has got to be 80 degrees in here she waved a finger it is winter vince cold nasty winter bringing us back to a common point of conversation greg interjected alright alex felt some of her revived spirits start to fade so professor snape no details involved says that the best thing to do is to remove all opportunities for falon to get to her and you know he wouldntdo a damn thing around a professor but she sighed ah now the robes comment makes sense funny too even vince said with a half smirk but you re right we were thinking yeah yeah i know it hurt but we were thinking about the same thing just substitute you and draco for the professors but that probably a worse prospect why well unless by some fluke all the class times and locations match up which we cantknow until we get a hold of tania class schedule somehow alex scowled now see i knew this was going to be harder than snape made it sound is hunter still upstairs a boy who was a bare few inches shy of six feet at fourteen was impressively tall a boy of that height and age with enough meat on his bones to qualify for heavy weight wrestling was down right intimidating two of them put together well sometimes they made small children cry but greg and vince had been friends too long and had the muscle too long not to realize how they made other people feel and they generally made an effort to tone down the effect not of course when they were running around playing draco brute squad but most of the rest of the time it was for the same reason that draco didntuse his malfoy ice prince aura all the time that kind of power was necessary only at certain times it was unintelligent and unslytherin to use their brute force to gain them every little thing they wanted mostly they just kept people thinking they were pea brained brutes because it suited them no one would ever suspect them for being behind their more subtle work if no one thought they were mentally capable of it of course that idiocy did not translate into the classroom she is not quiet you know greg said beneath the clatter of alex heels on the stone stairs i honestly cantbelieve they made it out of moody house alive if those are her sneaking abilities i know i surprised he stopped as he heard a very faint sound like cloth over stone and turned tania dethart was twisted on the stair two above them clearly attempting to make a break for it back up to the girl dorms now she is quiet vince muttered wait greg held up his hands flat and empty in front of his chest we re friends of alex and hunter they asked us to hang around near you if you go outside common room that was what they d worked up together as their opening line one person doing all the talking to help her forget that there were two of them for some reason vince seemed to think that greg was less threatening weird slowly very very slowly tania look of cornered prey faded and finally she sighed very softly in what sounded like relief why she asked slowly greg met vince gaze that was an interesting question considering their opening statement but it made some sense that she d know they werentthat close to either alex or hunter frankly he said taking the chance of looking her straight in the eye we dontlike your brother falon dethart is one of those sickly throwbacks that should be pruned from the family tree not to mention he annoying vince added you on the other hand have yet to annoy me at least not enough that i remember it that good enough for me besides greg let a tiny bit of humor show in his face we were hoping you were hungry which would be a perfectly good excuse to have a second breakfast greg might might have seen a flash of amusement slide into her eyes before she ducked her head and nodded i i d like breakfast your wish m lady vince murmured with a bow crossing the room ahead of them and opening the portrait door he was going to walk ahead and keep an eye out for falon hopefully heading him off before tania even saw him while greg settled in a couple of paces behind her or possibly next to her depending on what she was comfortable with what he said greg commented ingeniously stepping back so she wouldntfeel crowded or like she had to go past him in order to get down the stairs again he might have heard a very tiny snort but with her hair concealing her face and muffling any sounds it was near impossible to tell in the end the plan was a lot simpler on its face than it would be in practice but then it would be a lot simpler in practice than it was going to be to convince everyone of what should happen alex pondered whether a little snack break right now would be a bad thing oh no you don t blaise said grumpily from his spot in the corner he and draco had both been sound asleep read as passed out when alex had invaded dragging hunter and his gang of miscreants behind her greg and vince having already agreed to their part of the plan were currently escorting a pale shaky tania down to the kitchens for some early afternoon breakfast draco glanced over at him no what she had her mad dash for freedom look on her face and if i have to be awake with this hangover then you have to say whatever it is you dontwant to say damn is he going to whine all day charlie asked drawing his wand reaching out he whacked blaise over the top of the head with it blaise winced then his face and eyes cleared rapidly he pulled himself up straighter you have got to teach me that enough hunter jerked up off the wall which he had been steadily supporting since he d come in right now my sister is being watched over by two potentially trustworthy cronies and you re wasting time with hangover cures get used to it alex snapped cutting off both charlie annoyed retort and draco defense of his best friends what well shut up for a second and i ll tell you she sighed it not like i ve spent all morning working on this with greg and vince and anonymously professor snape after another minute of useless commentary and grumbling the boys sorted themselves out now to get all the dirty work out of the way gentlemen alex waved a hand at hunter and his surround of friends you all are useless for this for whatever reason his odiousness is not afraid of you hunter i have theories on that blaise muttered alex shot him a glare but he was too busy eyeing hunter to notice good for you she snapped instead before firmly taking herself in hand therefore it stands to reason that he wouldntbe entirely concerned about your companions not that is as afraid as he would be of us she pointed to herself then draco blaise and greg and vince empty beds you see we cantforce him to stop hurting tania as usual there no straightforward route on this one so instead we have to force him to control himself he doesnt care about the good opinion of hunter friends because he already considers then off limits but he rather desperate to cultivate good relations between his oh so wonderful self and those of his peers with better connections or more power than him damn obviously desperate draco sneered making a tiny flicking motion with his finger as if he were removing a bug from his person when i consider the list of things he overtly and covertly offered to do for me the look on draco face made alex wince ew ew eeeew do not finish that sentence malfoy so you think he ll control himself if one of you three or five is around charlie asked looking sideways at hunter for confirmation the older boy took a deep breath in all honesty it could work he would barely even notice her standing there if he was busy trying to impress one of you but it not a long term solution it not meant to be alex tried not to feel defensive as she pointed it out it supposed to be our very best option right now considering the limited time we have to come up with a solution besides blaise drawled before anyone could reply while we re spending all this time with tania using our glorious selves to shield her one or more of us can be forming friendships with her once she the close personal friend to the heir of the zabini house and line he paused and shrugged well there your direct route of intimidation alex let out a breath she hadntrealized she d been holding that genius blaise darling marry me alas my sweet i have but one love and if draco wonthave me then i shall have no one even your vibrant energy is no match for his pale beauty blaise collapsed onto the mussed sheets as if love sick draco lifted an eyebrow but held his peace apparently this was not the first time blaise had made that type of declaration to him vibrant energy huh alex twirled a strand of hair around her first finger you know if i didntlove you i d kill you for that my sweet if you didntlove me i d have killed myself a long time ago oh dontbe morbid she commanded charming draco pillows to whack continually at blaise hey the boys both protested at once hmph she scoffed wordlessly and began to fluff her hair as if there wasnt another single thing in the room to occupy her attention children hunter voice cracked out harshly they all paused mid motion though alex pillows kept swooping at blaise what draco asked for them all how do you expect to protect my sister if you canteven stay on topic for two minutes he all but snarled blaise glanced at alex who shrugged and answered in a faintly insulted tone what the point there nothing else to do until greg and vince get back with tania then we can all discuss schedules paths to and from class etc we cantdo anything now hunter looked like he was holding in some serious anger but somehow at the same time he looked like a balloon someone had stuck with a pin deflated he waved a hand as if dismissing them all come on boys mark shrugged off his wall and waved open the door let not ruin miss bellmonte reputation with only minor grumbling after all why had they all needed to get up early in order to hear that they were useless and unneeded the older boys filed off dragging hunter along with them through sheer momentum yeah like you all are the people i d have an orgy with alex muttered only realizing she d said it out loud when mark threw her a wink fortunately this time unlike earlier with snape she didntblush instead she put on her best devil may care grin and winked back alex hmm there was a significant silence or at least significant enough to make her turn around what blaise would you quit it with the damn pillows awww big strong manly man afraid of some pillows blaise grabbed one of the unensorcelled ones and hurled it at her alex ducked and started to stick her tongue out at him draco pillow didntmiss a n so sorry so so sorry i was going to post in november but for some reason this year nano nanowrimodotorg ate my soul i won though yay 50 000 ps chapters 2 5 have been redone edited within an inch of their sad one scene each lives gag so up to chapter 7 is reposted no big changes in any of these enter the detharts has been split into two scenes though because it kept switching povs it all the same content though pps i am working on that many times dammed plot summary but being a graspy author i keep putting in way too much detail and have to go back and rewrite everything i up to chptr 29 at the moment i ll shoot it off the instant i finish it i dontown anything important 3 car payments notwithstanding enjoy the first week would have been a walk in the park should have been a walk in the park with no classes to contend with if it hadntbeen for their damned guests maybe it was the fact that they d all gotten more confident after the ball maybe it was just that they were more now relaxed having gotten some thanks to their accents and the ball whatever it was the students from durmstrang and beauxbatons were out in force causing chaos and turmoil wherever they went filch face constantly alternated between bright purple and a white expression that looked as if he were about to cry mcgonagall spoke in a short clipped tone usually reserved for the worst of offenders in her classroom at all times and that vein pulsed in snape forehead constantly and if they had been anyone else anything other than the slytherins they were they all would have holed up in their common room for the duration considering the short fuses and fragile state of the entire group it would ve been the smart thing to do but they were slytherins and by merlin they werentgoing to allow these foreigners to send them into hiding on their own ground not even tania was willing to give so much as an inch though she jumped at shadows and flinched from every touch well well what a turn out for lunch greg murmured as they all settled themselves at one end of the long slytherin table draco nodded his sharp grey gaze taking in the nearly full slytherin and gryffindor tables right along side the nearly empty ravenclaw and hufflepuff ones in fact there were only two puffballs at their table directly next to slytherin s the rest of the people sitting at the table were the foreign students neither of the hufflepuffs looked comfortable and they kept shooting glances down the table at the interlopers turning back around he wasnton the side of the table with the view of the puffballs draco curled his lips in a sneer something needs to be done about them i cantdisagree draco vince said darkly rubbing the side of his face tiredly but do we have time to do anything right now what with our yule break homework and all our extra curricular activities draco sighed then realized what he was doing and pulled himself up straight this is not our current project he had to come at the moody thing sideways because of the small brunette seated next to alex we can get the rest of the house in on the international cooperation and i know just who you should talk to alex commented playing with her spoon with slow motions as they all waited for the staff to show up and lunch to begin tara cromwell draco felt himself wince even as he heard blaise laugh disbelievingly you ve got to be kidding lex blaise said firmly there is just no way alex grinned slightly the biggest smile draco had seen on her since the ball what you canttell me you all are afraid of tara cromwell she a sweetheart the boys all looked at each other and avoided looking at both girls because tania was giving them the same look as alex albeit from underneath her hair oh fine i ll talk to her later alex said finally breaking the silence she looked about to say something else when a cutting french insult skipped lightly across the air draco head whipped around as a pair of those powder blue wearing frenchies walked up to the two bold hufflepuffs and while draco knew french knew what they were being called it quickly became clear the puffballs didn t not that it mattered draco had heard enough no one insulted his school in front of him no one attacked his puffballs without permission no one broke draco malfoy toys standing slowly uncoiling upward draco glided forward silently behind him he knew would be greg and vince they d been doing this so long it wouldnteven have to pass through their heads as an actual thought before they followed him excuse me bitches he murmured in flawless french tapping the nearest one on the shoulder as they turned he interposed himself between them and the puffballs i believe you just said that this is a pile of moldering bricks filled with people who might as well be teaching muggles for all their competence he easily pitched his voice to carry and saw the rest of the slytherin heads lifted in that same deadly slow motion he d just used i would like you to apologize the french students easily two years older than him looked down with condescension draco smiled and then i would like you to kiss the mud off my boots the blond on the left drew his wand faster than draco could watch in the next breath greg grabbed him the slytherin table surged to its feet and low and behold the gryffindors and ravenclaws did likewise draco glanced around and took in that the mood of all his classmates matched his he let a very satisfied smirk settle on his face you really should have taken my advice he murmured reaching for his own wand and then just as the tension was about to break out into an all out brawl with the entire student body of hogwarts taking on the visiting students without mercy a tall man with a very long beard stepped into the room ah i see you ve all just arrived as well the headmaster said evenly a note of steel underpinning the cheerfulness excellent we ve not kept you waiting please everyone have a seat there was a minute one very long minute where the students all stared at each other then something like intelligence slipped back into the room draco slowly lowered his wand his grip loosening as greg dropped the blond the boy immediately collapsed into a chair gasping for air draco didntstop smiling evilly though because it wasntover they were going to hurt them it was just going to be done in a slytherin way quietly in the back hallways later when no one else was around to stop them does it bother anyone else george weasley commented randomly later that day what the french thing lee jordan replied no not really i meant the slytherin thing even fred looked at his twin in something like confusion what slytherin thing draco malfoy and his two cronies george continued tucking his hands under his head where he lay on a gryffindor couch jumping up and defending a couple of hufflepuffs like that it was weird i didntsee malfoy doing a good deed george lee said his voice mocking on malfoy i saw him picking a fight with those damn french fred snorted a much needed fight i gotta say i am surprised though about what well someone picked a fight with a couple of french he said in his leading up to a good joke voice and they just stood there not a one of them ran for the hills oh come on fred george shot back easily fulfilling his part in the joke the french dont run they were just waiting for malfoy to shut up long enough for them to surrender lee let out a bark of laughter as katie bell and angelina johnson slipped into common room i d ask what was so funny but i dontwant to know katie said shaking her head besides you ve got to hear this at her tone fred and george sat up and looked up at her it all over the place or at least it all over gryffindor seems dumbledore finally got fed up it said that he had a private talk with the other two headmasters somebody said he was heard yelling something about keeping their students under control fred snorted again about damn time alex rubbed her forehead with her first two fingers as she followed tania slim form toward common room she didntknow how the little girl did it it didntmatter that she d just been through a healing she kept right on going trucking along without so much as a falter alex respect for her rose she could do a lot of things handle a lot of things but physical pain and exhaustion it knocked her on her ass every time just look at what she d been like after the protection spell on her books though she mused as draco came up behind her and slipped a hand around her waist the end result of that was fun even as she thought it she was filled with the desire to settle back lean into draco and let him take some of the weight she blinked a little in shock it wasntjust that she was thinking like that about draco the whole concept disturbed her donteven think about it draco murmured directly into her ear as she pondered how to pull free without it looking like she was pulling away from him she twisted her head dontthink what alex flashed a smile now see that was just weak bellmonte i didnteven have to try to tell that you re lying through your teeth oh draco a high voice that sounded very much like a falsetto version of greg came up from behind them you re just so hot and you smell like cheese and beef alex my beauty it is in fact you who smells like beef the finest veal even vince replied his voice even higher than greg s alex looked up at draco out of the corner of her eye do something to them please refractions draco called the portrait swinging open for tania as she approached it but alex you do smell like veal he was teasing her she knew it and she knew that if she were less tired and in a better mood she d be taking it better she tried for a tightlipped smile but the corners of her mouth barely moved thank you for the escort gentlemen but i think tania looking a bit peaky we re going upstairs wait what draco sputtered but she d already ducked away from him jogging a couple of paces to catch up with tania fortunately for her tania was still in her completely silent mode and didntcontradict her instead she followed silently her head down as alex led the way across the room toward the stairs she fully expected another objection but they crossed the slytherin common room without incident as her clunky heels clumped up the stairs alex felt a tiny thrill of disappointment she didntwant to be around them if they were going to be pains but she didntwant draco to just let her go alex sighed and shook her head sorry tania whispered alex glanced over at her managing to catch tania as the small girl looked up at her from under her hair despite the fact that she was walking as if she was perfectly fine there was a weary beaten look in her warm brown gaze what for she shook her head pausing at the top of the stairs they were being pricks i d rather spend time with you any day there was a pause and then tania shrugged tossing her hair behind her shoulder a tiny smile slipped into her expression so what now alex flashed a tired grin your dorm or mine tania tara had a mission for my dormmates tania offered it ll be empty for hours good enough for me let go she bunched her robes in one hand and set off down the hall her desire to lie down giving her the energy to move at speed what you re not even going to go after her blaise sneered from the far rear of their group leaning no lounging on the inner edge of the portal picture draco turned grasping his suddenly empty hands together behind his back if she wanted me to follow her she d have gone someplace i could go he replied coldly taken aback by the harshness in his dormmate voice wonderful just damn wonderful blaise shoved past them stomping toward the stairs to the boys dorms after everything we gave up for this little tryst and you wonteven play merlin save me from damn idiots his voice faded trailing away as he disappeared up the stairs taking them two at a time despite his fatigue draco wrinkled his nose is he drunk greg exchanged a look with vince he drunk a lot more than you d think draco scowled so you cantsleep either alex said to the canopy above the third year bed she was borrowing she and tania had decided to spend the next few hours napping but alex couldntsleep it was too hard to relax these days she never slept when she was on duty anyway in the silence she heard tania breathing irregular clearly the other girl was awake as well there was a rustle of fabric as tania sat up tucking one knee up underneath her chin alex rolled off her bed and flopped the wrong way across tania s at the other girl feet i sorry you know tania murmured after a minute or so of comfortable silence tucking a strand of hair behind her ear the motion didnthelp because it dislodged several more loose curls alex twisted to look up at her huh about what tania rested her cheek on her knee looking away across the room about the dress she whispered regretfully it was gorgeous alex scoffed made as if to wave her hand dismissively but then decided it was too much trouble and let it flop back down beside her it was nothing dontworry about it i ve got dozens just like it tania didntrespond for a minute a long minute alex frowned and started to sit up i really am sorry anyway the younger girl said even quieter it i didntmean for anything to h happen to it i mean alex sat all the way up crossing her legs tailor style her frown deepened you we arenttalking about the dress are we honey tania was suddenly a bundle of energy she threw herself off the bed and crossed the room her robes whipping around her legs her fingers wrapped around her lower arms tracing along the inner side over and over as she paced alex tumbled forward off the bed and grabbed tania by the shoulders the other girl flinched then froze holding herself completely still for a second it looked like she wasnteven breathing stunned by the sudden change alex slowly peeled her fingers free honey she bit the inside of her lip searching for words it didntmake sense that she didntknow what to say everyone knew who needed to know in slytherin about what happened at home but no one ever talked about it there just no one talked about it it hurt too much it made too many things real alex felt a rough patch pinch the back of her throat and swallowed it didnthelp honey i dontknow what to say to you she rubbed her head i dontknow if you re mad at me or if you re humiliated and wish you d never met me which i ve gotten before mostly from blaise or maybe you think we should ve been there sooner tania turned and looked her full in the face for the first time today what she asked in complete disbelief i did it i ruined the ball you didn t you couldn t are you kidding me alex demanded falon the bitch is not as subtle as he seems to think he is we knew what he was or rather we d started to guess we should ve known better i should ve kept a closer eye on you but i got distracted she hissed the last word the memory of her dance with draco washed over with the blood on a patch of clean snow clawed its way to the surface you didntdo anything tania actually sounded mad neither did you alex snapped then pulled herself up short when tania physically winced away from her tania the only person i mad at is your whiney ass kissing sociopath sadistic bitch of a brother if i promise to stop blaming myself will you stop thinking i blame you tania ducked behind her hair again her fingers wrapping around her left wrist maybe she admitted grudgingly alex didntsmile it wasnta full on agreement but she would ve been even more suspicious if tania had agreed outright there was no way to remove guilt that easily instead she stretched rising up on her toes before falling back on the nearest bed you owe me a favor though she said to the green fabric canopy after all i did yell at hunter and his many many friends until they agreed to let you hang out with us they arenteven going to hover all over your life much anyway the laugh that slipped out of tania was a little weak but it was a laugh alex smiled in relief a n well christmas chewed me up and finally spit me back out this year anyway the only note i ve got is just this someone mentioned they didntunderstand why blaise and alex attacked each other after the ball they found tania since that shows up again i wanted to explain it if it still isntclear see alex and blaise attack each other because they can the only person in alex life who is safe enough to hit insult yell at is blaise and vice versa she knows he wonttruly hurt her wontkill her doesntmean the insults it isntexactly healthy but it one of the few emotional releases they have they rarely do it in front of other people though waves and that it i still own nothing etc etc well we got them draco glanced at the speaker one tara cromwell then looked away before she noticed he was looking at her merlin he twitched scary scary woman i ll say she did greg murmured into his left ear take a look around even dumbledore rant couldnthave caused that draco turned but he couldntfind the foreign students eventually he spotted them they d split up into smaller non threatening groups and were scattered around the far end of the room about as far away from the slytherin table as possible he grinned and that is why the world is a more disturbing place since lady tara was born all i can think of is that one time in first year greg had a distant expression on his face what happened in first year alex asked sinking down between greg and vince and looking back and forth between them tania slipped down on greg other side and casually reached for a fruit bowl without so much as glancing at her greg reached out and moved it closer so she could reach it tara cromwell happened alex tara cromwell happened the older girl must have heard him because she looked over at them and winked significantly greg paled i love you my queen he called she grinned alex snickered leaning back to exchange a glance with tania who was being far more polite than alex and holding in her laughter so where blaise alex looked around half rising to look over the heads of the boys around her draco frowned at her it just didntseem right that something was going wrong with blaise and alex didntknow about it until this moment he hadnteven remotely considered blaise issue to be a real problem he up in the dorm vince answered she looked at him two lines forming between her eyebrows what he up to vince looked at draco who leaned around him he s busy draco made the rapid decision to avoid the details it wasnthis place to rat out his dorm mate and it wasnthis place to keep alex informed she leaned forward and frowned her jade green eyes searching his face for a long silent moment still concerned she leaned back and grabbed a roll pale fingers slowly shredding it across her plate the smell was sharp in her nose the recognition instantiations alex stopped one foot half off the floor and inhaled again she put her foot down and turned around as she d suspected blaise had come up behind her his eyes were white and clear his step was steady and even he was drunk well and truly trashed and wasted the smell of alcohol was like a living thing in the air around him she pinched her lips closed until her teeth ground together hey lex he flashed a smile that she immediately distrusted what new she flashed an equally insincere smile hi blaise why dontyou tell me he stopped in the middle of the hallway a shrewd angry look flaring in his narrowed eyes whatever do you mean lexy she eyed his face letting the words wash over her without taking them in emotionally there was no point to it when blaise was this trashed frankly if he stayed this nice she d be greatly surprised alex draco had stopped a few feet farther down the hall she shook her head waving them on we just need to talk i ll catch up to you in a minute the boys just shrugged and kept walking but tania sent her a worried glance her brown gaze darting toward blaise before she allowed herself to be led away by greg alex ignored them staring at him without blinking until the many slytherins emptied farther into the school heading for common room you werentat dinner last night zabini you were passed out in your dorm for breakfast this morning you smell of booze and you re neglecting your duties to tania and to the house in general if it were possible blaise got even stiller he inhaled and let out his breath slowly and who are you to critique me bellmonte alex flattened her palms against one another and very specifically chose her next words she didntreally feel like dealing with a long drawn out conversation before they got to the point she didnt have the energy for it oh give it a rest zabini donttry to focus the blame on me you are the one who letting this rather minor event in your life defeat you but you know what i donteven know why i talking to you you arentgoing to have a single intelligent thought in your heat until you arentso shitfaced she turned sharply on her heel and stalked off down the hallway bitch the word breathed past her ear as blaise grabbed her arms whipping her around alex was barely registering her new direction when her back hit the wall she gasped clinging to the stone with her fingertips stunned at how quickly he d gone from verbal attacks to physical it usually took longer there was usually more warning alex hid her hurt and let her lips curl into a sneer idiot y blaise slammed his hand against the wall less than an inch from her head alex flinched away i dontneed your prying bossy input you stupid little whore he sneered into her face alex wrapped her fingers into the soft cotton of his shirt jerking him even closer if you didntyou would ve just walked away very softly very gently blaise wrapped his fingers around the place between her neck and her jaw firmly controlling her breathing alex wrapped her hand around his wrist significantly his warm hazel eyes bored into hers and for one long second alex thought it was over but then the ugly look reasserted itself bitch he shouted hurling her to the left alex fought to control her flight but just managed to tear strips out of blaise arm before falling and hitting the floor she rolled to her feet to find herself staring down the wrong end of a wand laedo 1 sharp pain slashed across her face knocking her back on her ass ahh alex scrambled into her sleeve and lashed out at his legs with her wand inflixi 2 blaise grunted and stumbled forward nearly falling on top of her he solved his problem by putting his weight into his knee which landed on her back and then it was alex turn to grunt noceo 3 she gasped out jabbing her wand blindly upward there was a sound like a massive hand slapping against stone that told her she d missed blaise shifted and alex found herself hitting stone again minuo 4 alex eyes flew open in shock her arms coming up to protect her face blades of light rippled over her drawing a soft whimper from her unwilling lips stupid she hissed as blood began to drip to the floor so stupid t ogliere wand 5 expelliarmus her fingers already loosened around the length of wood lost their grip even as the blood around her flashed with light and blaise wand slammed into the far wall well she drawled ignoring the throbbing pain in her arms now that we ve got that out of the way she surged forward but of course blaise was waiting for her fortunately blaise growled shoving her back down you re predictable he grabbed her throat harder than before and began to squeeze bitch alex looked up into his eyes as her air was slowly and brutally cut off his eyes met hers but they were flat and empty blaise her blaise didntlook back seconds ticked by and though she fought it panic started to fill her she forced herself not to fight back but she couldntstop herself from shaking blaise she screamed mentally as white stars cut off the corners of her vision get a hold of yourself dammit al the noise that came out of blaise mouth was a low groan lexy and just that fast she could breathe again alex coughed blinking against the extra moisture in her eyes b blaise you stupid boy she breathed reaching up to touch his face he crumbled on top of her tears streaming down his face alex scrambled up wrapping her arms around him and muffling his sobs in her shoulder you stupid stupid boy it felt like up it felt like breaking the surface of the water after nearly drowning it felt like slicing open his stomach and slowly pulling out his intestines blaise clung to alex as if he d drown if he didntand sobbed like he was dying tania hand in his tiny and trusting a big hand hairy and demanding yanking him along by the back of his shirt his tiny feet bare and scrambling to keep up with too long foot steps you stupid stupid boy she smiled at him the purity of the joy rocking him back on his heels until her face twisted up into a hoarse scream blood splattered across his face he could smell it taste it it choked him somewhere someone laughed i hope at least it was the good alcohol honey child he couldntbreathe he couldntbreathe there was blood on his face blood on his shirt blood on the dress blood on the snow he shivered in the cold it was so dark down here so cold in the basement after all we canthave you rotting your guts out darling blaise what are you doing blaise looked up from his project and grinned up at his mother dont look he said forcefully it a secret she paused in midmotion and turned toward him excuse me he felt a tremor of unease but stayed his course after all grandma had said that birthday presents had to be secrets blaise hadntknown people were supposed to get presents on their birthday he felt bad that he d never given his mommy and daddy anything so he was putting in extra effort this year you cantsee you cant look it a secret his mother face twisted and she stalked forward she grabbed his project then flung it away from herself with a cry what the hell is this you stupid brat she shouted shoving her hand now covered in blue paint in his face you werentsupposed to touch it when it was wet he wailed scrambling off his seat it constantly amazes me she hissed viciously grabbing his face and smearing paint on his nose and mouth how much of a mess you can create in so short a time and when i specifically told you not to blaise stared at her in silence as the taste of paint filled his mouth and her nails dug into his cheeks they werentdrawing blood yet but that was just because she was being nice i i it it w was a a b birthday pr pr present he stuttered trying to explain surely once she knew she d understand she had to a present she shouted her hand tightening until her nails broke skin warm liquid dripped down his face i ve kept my closet clean you know in case you need it you think ruining my table destroying my dress covering this room in your stupid little messes is a present she was practically shrieking by the time she was done using her grip on his face to shake him violently with a wordless snarl she threw him from the chair to the floor i am so sick of you a pair of blows followed her words blaise curled in on himself i haventforgotten my promise honey you re welcome to move in whenever you need to i wonteven make you sleep on my shoes this time alex her arms around him her voice in his ear blaise dug his fingers into her hair grabbing the memory with both hands and shoving it back into the box where it belonged it it was a birthday present he whispered oh that bad huh she murmured wincing i i left her i knew i knew and i left her alex eased up on her hold enough for him to lift his face from her shoulder but didntlet him go running her fingers through his hair i know honey it all your fault blaise stiffened disbelieving what he gasped feeling the floor drop from beneath his feet oh dontbe an idiot she snapped shoving him off her he jerked as if she d doused him with cold water what alex reached out and placed one hand on either side of his face i cantbaby you blaise i donthave the luxury you donthave the luxury so sit up suck it up and face reality the speech echoed in his head repeated over and over again in his memory he d said it she d said it they d screamed it and whispered it dozens of times over the years blaise took a painful breath and let it out slowly taking himself in hand even though it hurt gods it hurt and reality is the reality is tania thinks it her fault i think it mine hunter fairly reeks of guilt you re jumping into the guilt lake full tilt we cantall be right can we tania fault how the hell is it tania fault her face closed down over an expression blaise specifically chose not to interpret the same way it was your fault your mother got paint on her hands he closed his eyes and focused on breathing for a second and so so alex leaned forward until their foreheads touched i want to point out that there is one person in all of this that doesntfeel guilty at all falon falon blaise echoed hazel eyes drilling into green i bet he went to bed and got a sweet night sleep so i think maybe just maybe you should start blaming him you make a very good point blaise felt as if the world was slowly settling back onto a normal balance and one last thing i going to say during which you are going to listen and not get angry at me for she leaned back winced and glared at him this is obviously not the first time this has happened the look on hunter face when we told him should be evidence enough of that so he prompted when she hesitated so what damage this she didntsay abuse wouldntsay it but blaise knew did to her has already been done one more round in the closet in the back of her mind isntgoing to make it worse blaise first response was a disgusted sneer but he couldn t he knew what she was doing what she meant underneath that cold unfeeling statement still he couldntbring himself to agree with her either instead blaise leaned forward and wrapped her in a quick hug so are we better now she asked her voice muffled blaise chuckled alex i dontknow what i drank but i think i gonna have a bad hangover blaise darling that isntthe alcohol that was me alex snickered then coughed ow she whined blaise stiffened then slowly very slowly almost against his will he leaned back and got to his feet clenching his teeth he looked down at her the right side of her face from hairline to chin was a massive bruise that was beginning to swell distorting her eye slightly she lifted her hands to probe at the injury gently giving him a clear view of the tatters that used to be the lower half of her sleeve damp with blood he grabbed her wrists pulling her arms up for a better view of the slices into her flesh instead she used the motion to pull her to her feet see anything you like zabini she joked tilting her head with mock flirtation please that just he cut off and dropped her wrists alexandra she braced her hands on her hips and blinked at him blaise reached out and very very gently tipped up her chin extremely deep harsh bruises covered her neck his heart in his throat blaise counted fingers he dropped her face and scrambled back until he hit the other side of the hall gods alex he shouted scrubbing his face how could you i could ve i almost lord merlin she winced and ducked her head clutching her elbows it worked didnt it she shot back uncertainly bloody hell he crossed the hall in two strides and grabbed her into an all engulfing hug with a sniffle she relaxed completely we gotta go alex murmured into his shirt yeah he glanced around for their wands i ve got a place we can hide out until later alex groaned i not going to get dinner am i he grinned nope it was well after dark when they finally decided it might be safe to sneak back into common room truthfully they should ve stayed away longer but alex wanted her healing kit a bit desperately and so they headed back early in the end it didntreally matter how late or early they were because they wouldnthave managed to avoid him pinecone blaise murmured to her majesty the lady of slytherin she barely batted an eye as she looked down her long nose and swung silently open blaise waved for her to stay put as he ducked into common room first and made sure the coast was clear alex crossed her arms then thought better of it as her cuts protested and tapped her foot impatiently on the stone floor one minute passed then two alex was about to throw up her hands and go in anyway when she heard blaise call to her lex he called softly his voice strained she frowned that certainly didnt sound like all was clear in fact it sounded like he d just gotten caught if she were smart she d make a run for it before whoever was in there found her out too but by the same token if she were smart she d have to assume that they already knew about her after all blaise would never have called to her if he hadntbeen prompted to if he d had no choice it stood to reason that she wouldntbe doing anything but getting blaise into worse trouble than he was already in by running she couldntdo that to him blaise she called back cautiously come on in lex he answered unhappily the water fine rolling her eyes alex bunched up her robe unceremoniously and climbed over the threshold in the dark of the entrance she kicked off her shoes for the comfort of it well that and it was a clear statement that she wasntgoing to run whoever was here whatever they wanted she was going to fight back she just wasntin the mood for anything else right now the bruises along her side and back now well developed protested loudly as she bent to pick them up alex tried not to wince but all she managed was to keep her groan soft and barely hearable oh now you re just procrastinating she scolded herself sharply get on with it lifting her chin she strode forward firmly her steps faltered as humorless eyes cold and black met her own p professor snape she whispered he smiled it wasnta look of happiness or joy alex closed her eyes you have got to be kidding me i am going to ask you this one time only mister zabini who caused miss bellmonte injuries his voice was dry too dry and alex had just enough good sense left to keep her mouth shut the muscles in his jaw clenching blaise pulled himself up and looked professor snape straight in the eye i did sir snape lips twitched and not in that good way you he drawled darkly his voice laced with iron command will not heal yourself you will not imbibe any potions to that effect nor will you take anything for the pain you are no gentleman mister zabini have i made myself clear blaise took the hits with a single sharp nod yes sir i understand good bed professor snape gestured toward the boys dorms blaise glanced at alex in concern i will not tell you again mister zabini snape enunciated sharply face pale blaise turned on his heel and marched from the room though a less forgiving audience might say he fled alex winced and looked up at her very tall very imposing head of house it was her turn now sit miss bellmonte the voice was softer but the implied command wasn t alex walked to the closest seat a black leather couch and sat i find it hard to believe he crossed to stand in front of her and gripped her chin with cold fingers tilting her face that zabini could have done this to you entirely against your will alex winced met his eyes and looked away it wasnthis fault she tried to say firmly but ended up whispering i attacked him first her head of house opened his mouth to respond but stopped miss bellmonte he said her name on a sigh you are on a very dangerous path she had no good response to that so she stayed silent and watched him draw his wand from his sleeve a black gaze locked with hers and alex heard the order loud and clear even though he didntsay anything stay still dontmove dontresist she held her tongue and waited holding his wand in both hands snape let his eyes fade half closed and every so often mouthed a word alex watched him because she had nothing better to do and tried to guess which spell he was using from the minor amounts of lip reading she was managing she d only just begun to guess when his hands started to glow replacing his wand in his sleeve professor snape gently but firmly placed his left hand over the side of her face and wrapped his right around her throat alex swallowed convulsively and had to fight to hold still had to fight to keep from whimpering it was going to be awhile before she let anyone touch her neck again it seemed his fingers warm this time and rapidly growing hot pressed into her flesh and alex felt panic start to build in her stomach i cantbreathe the heat became unbearable scorching her alex gasped in a breath and cool black eyes looked directly into her green ones instantly the panic faded this was snape professor snape her head of house he would never ever hurt her not without a damn good reason she trusted him implicitly her brain began to function again and alex realized that while he was holding her neck he wasntchoking her she could breathe she had always been able to breathe tears of relief popped into her eyes startling her alex bellmonte didnt cry and not in front of people her face gave a sudden throb then the pain vanished along with the weird larger than life feeling your arms miss bellmonte alex glanced down at her arms where her cuts were hidden inside her repaired sleeves she should have been surprised that he knew but it was snape so she wasn t the man was sneaky and every member of his house had learned the hard way at one time or another that it was impossible to get anything past him it was why they trusted him it was why they respected him it was why they down to the smallest first year would follow his orders without question no matter what they were or how terrifying the consequences if he asked her to kill she would if he asked her to die she would though she d object to the second one just out of principal if there was time she sighed and shrugged off her robes the better to reach the sleeves of her button down white undershirt it not like i do this on purpose she muttered as she fumbled with the buttons of her cuffs do what miss bellmonte there was amusement in his velvet soft dark voice he was laughing at her and alex wasntentirely sure why get myself beat all to hell i not a masochist you know of course you are alex froze in the middle of pushing up her sleeves and looked up the smirk the smirk was settling across his features and alex felt a flash of pride that she had been the one to inspire it but there was still that comment to deal with her eyes narrowed oh really she said too brightly do tell the smirk faltered then vanished and that deep brooding look was back in his eyes your life is shit miss bellmonte no matter what anyone else sees or says your life is an empty hell alex very deliberately stared at her hands as she rolled her sleeves up carefully digging her finger nails into her palms against the pain that was probably coming either from the healing or from the words he was throwing in her face she extended her arms and turned them over to present him with the bloody slices they had mostly stopped bleeding but they were too deep and wide to have even considered scabbing over yet in a single rapid movement perhaps he thought she would flinch away from him snape grabbed her low arms with his still glowing hands now that hurt it felt like someone had added salt to lemon juice then set the whole thing on fire and poured it into her cuts alex blanched but as quickly as it had come it was gone she yanked her arms out of his grip and rubbed her hands over the still stinging flesh that was not cool she muttered fiercely unable to hold in that much emotion at this point and i beg to differ about the other bit snape lifted an eyebrow the rest of it alex sighed and half turned lifting her shirt to expose the bruise forming around her side and up her back i still object my life is not an empty hell it has it moments but she shrugged some part of her mind commented that it was a strange double standard she d drawn blood on draco when all he d done was kiss her but here was this fully grown man with his hands practically on top of her bra and she didnthave a bad thing to say about it well screw that part of her mind this was snape where do your problems come from alexandra he inquired softly surprising her by using her first name what are the causes idiots she supplied instantly earning herself another smirk more specifically alex frowned i snape exhaled sharply and looked at her like she was failing some kind of test you are in this condition right now because because blaise needed my help she scowled suddenly gaining a clue as to where he was going with this he sat back and crossed his arms over his chest waiting and i haventbeen sleeping because of the tania problem if it had been blaise he d have rolled his eyes at her how much time in a day do you spend on things that are not your problem define my problem alex asked if it had been anyone else she d have snapped it coldly but she was controlling that emotion right now if professor snape felt the need to interject some advice into her life she would be as open to it as possible he leaned forward not mister zabini problem not miss dethart problem not mister dethart problem not mister malfoy problem contrary to popular belief she tilted her head up at him and crossed her arms now that she could i do not do favors for people especially not draco contrary to popular belief his voice went so soft alex had to strain to hear him you would jump in front of a cruciatus for any one of those people and you wouldntbe able to help yourself alex tried to stare at him but found she couldntmeet his eyes it was a warm puddle in her stomach feeling to know that someone else knew her that well but it was also unnerving if he knew that if he could see her that clearly then what else did he see she knew her parents were disappointed in her she wasntnearly good enough she only barely got by scraping out a win from every test by the skin on her teeth the thought that professor snape might see how much a failure she was horrifying didnteven begin to cover it if you live your life for yourself it will be better easier more successful snape continued there was a tone in his voice that alex had only heard once before when she d been nearly passed out from pain after she d been accidentally pushed off the quidditch stands back then it had given her permission to cry while giving her the strength to bite her tongue and endure now it gave her the courage to look up whatever else he was feeling behind those bottomless black eyes she didnt know but she didntsee disgust or even condescension she managed to start breathing again so i should give up on them all she asked curiously no longer defensive he shrugged indifferently if you continue on with the path you ve chosen your life will become hell i thought it already was hell snape looked at her soberly ignoring her attempt at a joke these are the good days miss bellmonte it will only get worse from here well hell alex said jerking her chin up defiantly my life is going to suck anyway i might as well go for broke then you truly belong in my house for the third time in one conversation professor snape smirked go to bed miss bellmonte ever obedient alex went a n 1 laedo strike hit hurt damage offend annoy 2 infligo inflixi inflictum to strike hit knock cause damage 3 noceo to do harm to inflict injury hurt 4 minuo to draw blood let blood to bleed someone 5 togliere take away a n well this story has been kicking my butt i want to say that i am hugely flattered by all the people who keep adding this to their favs or alerts and especially those who review i am sorry about the time between updates and if these next chapters feel a bit like filler with luck and work it ll get better soon classes start tomorrow oh dont remind me liana her twin groaned ducking around the boys coming in as they darted into the hallway vince grimaced she didntneed to remind me either he muttered rubbing his head greg snorted then lifted an eyebrow well well look who alive and kicking he nodded across the room vince followed his gaze in time to see blaise looking much the worse for wear which meant he had to be sober approaching alex and tania he hesitated for a second then took up a position by alex side hovering attentively greg frowned did he ever come back last night move boys a sharp female voice ordered a slim hand applying pressure to a shoulder each they turned then obediently parted at pansy glare sniffing she flounced through grinning wickedly vince took a swipe at her backside as she passed a tiny squeak escaped before she turned and offered then both a rude hand gesture now now boys let behave ourselves draco drawled from the stairs to the boys dorms pansy included him in her gesture control your idiots before the things tara did to the french give me ideas i know how you hate people breaking your things draco glanced past her to his cronies he laughed once somebody broke those two a long time ago pansy there not much left to damage she scoffed and retreated to her dorm rolling his eyes draco leaned against the wall as his dormmates joined him you wound me draco vince complained i know the blonde replied his silver grey eyes picking out the new and improved blaise but you bleed so pretty they fell into a comfortable silence until the blonde murmured i wonder who he got into a fight with considering how drunk he was greg scoffed amused probably a wall a wall with nails then alex moved to stand up and blaise all but leapt to help her with her chair draco snorted well so long as our resident goodie goods are distracted would you gentlemen care to assist me with something they looked over at him i ve got a couple of ideas about moody greg lifted his brows in interest hmm do you draco laughed cantlet alex have all the fun can i oh blast it alex glared down at her quill the tip of which had just snapped off right in the middle of the elegant down curve of her y repairo a soft tenor murmured instantly an extra sweep of his wand rounding the splattered ink back into the pen very neat thank you alex said looking up at her foster brother with a pointed smile but if you wanted to do me a favor you could sit down she pointed at the perfectly empty chair to her right hover if you must but dont lurk moving gingerly an act that had more to do with his hangover than anything she d done to him blaise slowly lowered himself into the chair alex couldntquite manage the smile in the face of his obedience for days after he snapped out of a slump he d be overly submissive in this case it might take longer but any way around it alex hated it yes she adored being in charge but not when everyone just let her and to be completely honest with herself at least she hated being the only person willing to take charge it meant she was the only hope there was no safety net taking her eyes from blaise she glanced at her other companion tania had a weird diagram made of string pinned to a piece of parchment in her notebook and was staring at it from different angles in silence shaking her head alex bent back over her letter she d gotten a letter from cassandra de nore over break with christmas greetings and a summary of the goings on in the large french clan and while they were only related through alex great great great something grandfather and thus they werent bellmontes they were about the only blood relations alex had she never saw them much maybe once a year but cass one of the girls around her own age had always made a point of keeping her filled in she grinned as she thought of the other girl a quick wit with a vicious tongue and she didnthesitate to put in the details of the revenge they d taken against the french students cass would appreciate it you misspelled jacasser 1 blaise murmured pointing it has two s s blaise she said lightly wondering if snape would get mad if she stabbed him in the eye with her quill i would really love some pastries and tea he winced sorry then obediently took himself off to the kitchens alex groaned faintly as she fixed the misspelled word she really hated when blaise lost his nerve to offend her what she looked up to see tania staring after blaise departing back the other girl frowned what happened to him alex almost did a happy dance unprompted conversation yes instead she sighed he was being kind of an idiot and he took offense when i mentioned it to him she shrugged we got into a little fight wide brown eyes flew from the portrait hole to alex face are you hurt tania gasped looking slightly horrified i think i broke a nail she tried waving her free hand at the other girl going for innocent tania blinked exactly once then calmly shut her book and set it on the table she pulled one of her legs up onto the seat of her chair and rest her arms atop of her knee why wouldnthe heal himself the unspoken like you did hung in the air alex replaced her quill in its holder she shrugged he doesntlike to he says it helps him get a better grip on reality a thin line appeared in the center of tania forehead why do you hit him and i going to translate that into why do you let him hit you but i ll answer both she dragged a strand of hair from behind her ear and pulled on it idly this may sound strange to you but blaise sometimes has thoughts and memories that he cantshake himself free from it takes getting him very mad with a dose of physical pain tossed in to help him snap out of it the easiest way to help him that i ve found is to pick a fight and then let it turn into a duel but it never gets out of control he too out of it to be really dangerous and i know what i doing from the start liar liar liar a voice in the back of her head taunted viciously alex stuffed down the desire to rub her neck defensively mmm tania replied noncommittally after one last uncertain glance at the door she pulled her book closer and opened it again this was hell absolute mind melting hell blaise sat beside alex his guilt keeping him glued to his seat even though he knew she d forgiven him merlin but he d never hurt her that bad before even if snape hadntbitten his head off he d have felt this bad it was a hundred times worse knowing that another man knew what he d done but worse than it all was the knowledge that tania wouldntlook at him or be alone with him he stared across the room at the tiny figure hunched over a book next to her brother and swallowed hard alex would let him pay her back for his failure in the only coin he had but tania he was hit with the desire to scoop her up in his arms cradle her against his chest and head for the hills where no one least of all her damn brother would ever be able to find them then he would spend the rest of his life as her willing slave until maybe someday she might forgive him he wanted her to smile again like she had during that last dance he d never seen her smile before that nothing more than a shadow of happiness flitting across her face it had absolutely shocked him but now that he knew what was hidden under all that hair he was determined to dig it up again if only she d give him a chance to abase himself before her and beg her forgiveness an old concept from the dark ages of a knight swearing himself into the service of a lady he d wronged was very very appealing right now blaise looked again as hunter leaned over to talk to one of his friends and spotted tania sneaking resolutely away toward the portrait he glanced around but no one else seemed to notice blaise leaned in toward alex i going for a walk he murmured she nodded a hint of relief in her eyes as he climbed to his feet blaise nearly smirked oh if she thought he was giving up this early in the repayment game she was in for a nasty surprise he was going to hover until valentine s but first he has someone else to hover over the hallway was silent and deserted when he got out the door and blaise paused but turning left only took you to the great hall while right led off to a lot more interesting places he went right his soft boots nearly silent on the stone with his longer strides and the fact that tania was clearly sneaking while he wasntbothering to it only took him a minute to catch sight of her again instead of stopping her then and there he let her continue as soon as he found a good spot to stop and talk without it looking like he was cornering her he would a chill filtered through the air as they walked her flitting along the edges him slipping silently behind that eventually clued him into the fact that they were nearing the outer edges of the castle up ahead tania stopped in front of a simple wooden door and stared at it darkly her hands on her hips why are you following me she asked the scarred wood her voice a mix of hesitant exasperation blaise froze then ran his hands through his hair and grimaced the move pulled at his scabs and he sent bad thoughts toward alex finger nails a second later regret flooded him and he winced i guess i not as good at the sneaking as i thought tania traced an ancient mark just to the right of her nose the terms stampede and oxen come to mind he sniffed and tossed hair he didnthave do not condescend me just because you re a master of the art form he took another step toward her stopping about three feet away i was greatly impressed by your escape just now even mama hen hunter didntnotice a thing i a slightly strained silence fell blaise crossed his arms loosely over his ribcage and waited a glimmer of light clued him into the fact that she was watching him as covertly as possible out of the corner of her eye okay someone was going to have to say something in the next ten seconds of things were going to get awkward he began looking for something that wasntcompletely idiotic and found there wasntmuch to work with i was going for a walk tania burst out as if the words were being forced out of her he glanced up and for a second found himself looking her full in the face she was pale and her eyes were huge as they searched his face for clues to his state of mind blaise felt himself relax a little and put a smile on his face his real one for once and he was surprised at how tentative it was may i join you he heard himself ask and almost held his breath as he waited for her answer she pursed her lips and nodded once firmly turning she fumbled with the metal latch and eased out the door trying not to leap forward blaise grabbed the edge and almost lost it when he realized how much the wind really wanted to slam it shut again he tried to imagine how the tiny girl in front of him had managed to open it in the first place even as he slipped out it nearly caught the edge of his robes outside was a patch of stone four feet square then a steep short flight of stairs all covered with whirling snow the white powder hard edged and icy blasted around their heads he looked down at tania are you sure about this she shook her head holding her hair down with her right hand it ll be better up above the stairs trap the wind resolutely she grabbed the railing with her free hand and started upward blaise quickly followed standing next to her but one stair lower just in case however he neednthave bothered she made it up without so much as faltering and blaise mentally smacked himself for underestimating her especially as she was once again proven right up in the open air there wasntmuch wind at all just a whole lot of dark icy air tania glanced around then turned left and headed out wondering at her idea of a walk blaise followed her the snow was more crunchy ice than powder dehydrated by the cold and easily part way up his shins tania was several steps ahead resolutely pushing her way through snow that was to her nearly knee high why why why is this girl going for a walk in the middle of winter in the middle of the night outside in the part of the castle where they dontclear the snow blaise you idiot why must you always get caught up by the strange ones wisely blaise chose not to answer himself it was a stupid question anyway the strange ones were more fun or at least that what he always tried to tell himself but by merlin he was getting snow in his boots now while as a gentleman i should wander around forever until you decide to talk to me again i not going to he said making an effort to catch up with her she glanced back at him and for a second blaise could swear she was laughing but all she said was it only drifts near the door what but he couldnteven finish the thought because half a step later the snow had cleared out to a bare few inches that crunched under his feet why that little he wrinkled his nose at her back she was laughing at me blaise shook his head and dug his hands deeper into his pockets now as i was saying he continued as if nothing had happened i know i talked to and got talked at by alex and i know you did and since we both know alex has a monumental sized mouth when she isnt trying to help people i think we can assume that we know some things about the other person right now tania snorted then flashed him a blatantly too bright smile well i know you hate pears blaise ignored her and looked up at the blanket of stars it felt like thorns tearing at his throat but it came anyway my parents hit me he whispered at the heavens a bitter laugh escaped his lips every day of my life and twice on sundays he looked down and found the space beside him empty turning he found tania two steps back frozen the expression in her eyes was completely unreadable she didntseem to be breathing he opened his mouth but had two false starts before he managed to continue they called me things i will never live down and gave me scars i have to hide before i go swimming or use the boys baths when i look in the mirror i see the same person you do i feel that quiet horror that this is who i am this creature blaise found himself reaching a hand for hers and aborted the motion before it became obvious he stepped forward just once instead i know how much it takes to wake up in the morning and simply be alive how could i ever despise you when we re exactly the same tania looked up at him her brown eyes liquid with relief a horrified shared pain and briefly so briefly hope she blinked rapidly then stepped forward and took his hand in both of hers blaise didnteven realize he d been holding his breath until it escaped him in a rush he shifted so that he held one of her hands in each of his and added in complete seriousness if you ask me to i will give you his head on a silver platter at breakfast tomorrow i i i i tania pulled her hands free and covered her face shaking her head violently oh god she wailed in a cracked voice you donthate me sobs shook her thin frame and blaise stared in horror good one blaise you idiot you go to cheer up the girl and send her into hysterics instead clearly you are loosing your touch he shook off his emotional turmoil in favor of helping his hands dove into a half dozen pockets in his robes and pants and eventually came up with a handkerchief taking her wrist gently he peeled her hand back from her face slipped in his handkerchief and slid it back into place her fingers wrapped around it and from what he could tell put it to good use but the crying barely slowed oh oh oh shit where is alex when you need her alex now there is a nice sensible woman she doesntcry if you hack off a limb with a blunt ax oh shit a voice in the back of his head whispered a comment about putting snow down the back of her shirt but blaise ruthlessly quashed that idea he wasnt quite that stupid alright old boy get ahold of yourself think like alex if you cantactually have her channel the inner bellmonte when i am gushing like a two year old alex does what well she normally calls me names and gives me a hug he muttered under his breath merlin he was an idiot some times reaching out he took hold of tania elbows drawing her in and wrapping his arms around her slowly in case she decided to bolt bolting it would seem was not in her plans as soon as her forehead brushed his shirt tania buried her face in it grabbing his robes with all her might and holding on blaise pulled her tighter stopping just short of crushing her shhh honey he whispered into her hair it all okay 1 french for scream reposted 12 04 07 fixing bad spelling bad grammar and other typos etc etc originally one long scene with an amazing ability to swap from hunter pov to alex and back again it is now two scenes with only a few extra sentences stuck in to facilitate the transitions ps part of the original a n the detharts are entirely the creation of my very dear authoress friend jaylyn gilfer bustinex but since we struck a deal where she has use of alex as a minor character in her fanfics i get to play with these idiots oh flaming dragon shite alex swore under her breath she was in diagon alley passing the time with some shopping and had just spotted falon dethart making his way towards her brother hunter trailing behind frickin dethart parasites alex she turned at falon call and smiled in greeting hunter she hugged the older brother lightly hello falon while she didntlike any of the dethart boys hunter was by far higher up the evolutionary chain than falon the stupid what are you two doing here shopping of course falon held a package wrapped in brown parchment aloft as proof alex waited for hunter to answer not quite ignoring falon doing some last minute errands before we have to come back in a week and get all our new hogwarts supplies you re going into fifth year hunter alex was sure he was she knew the ages of all three dethart children off the top of her head hunter was oldest at a year and two months older than her middle was falon alex year and older than her by four months and the youngest child was a girl named tania that was eight months alex junior yes o w l s this year oh you poor thing alex was all sweetness and sympathy she linked arms with hunter angling so falon had to stand on hunter other side if he wanted to see her which he did thank merlin together they moved down the alley i sure you ll do fine though you are a dethart whether he didntknow what to say or if he just didntwant to be the topic of conversation hunter neatly redirected it what were you shopping for alex anything we could help you find and that was the reason alex liked hunter even if only just a little she smiled i on a search for an extra copy of some books my parents wontlet me take to hogwarts with me they say that since we only have one copy in the library they cantrisk losing them onward to flourish and blotts falon proclaimed alex cast a disparaging glance across hunter chest at him do you really think anything from the bellmonte library that is too valuable for my parents to risk losing would be sold in flourish and blotts i heading for jackle s if they cantget them for me i ll try my luck deeper in knockturn alex shrugged off the mention of the less than reputable area off diagon alley casually falon fell silent at fourteen he hadntbeen allowed in knockturn alley without a parent yet his father had said that he would be allowed when they came back for their school supplies hunter glanced down at her my offer for an escort still stands alex i d be happy to see you around knockturn falon will have to stay here though alex almost sighed in relief despite her bravado she hadntbeen down knockturn alley without an escort of one kind or another before she was only fourteen thank you hunter offer accepted and if you ll forgive us for abandoning you falon i ll treat you to anything you want out of the apothecary i have some potion ingredients i running low on as well since there really was no way for him to disagree with her falon left them grumbling under his breath as soon as he thought he was out of earshot the other two teens moved into knockturn the air seemed to darken just by stepping into this part of the street four shops down and on the left was jackle book store hunter held the door open for alex to enter first she moved slowly among the racks of books loving the musty old smell of them sometimes under cut with hints of potion ingredients or old blood though their entry made no sound a white haired wizard in faded black robes appeared from a back room almost instantly ah mistress bellmonte master dethart what can i do for you today hello mister jackle alex stepped up to his counter i looking for an extra copy of a few things so i donthave to put my studies on hold when i go off to hogwarts this fall she pulled a scrap of parchment from her pocket and handed it over jackle leaned over it for a few minutes occasional hmm ing softly to himself well he said finally i can get you a life of shadows a theory on death little actions big revenge to walk with darkness and by moonlight right away they can be shipped to your house by the end of tomorrow in the end it all evil relative killing a comprehensive guide and the making of sinister potions and the effects that made them illegal will all take longer i may be able to get them before you come back to buy your school supplies but i cantpromise anything as for pain and blood magic spells and potions now mistress bellmonte he looked at alex sorrowfully you know that there only one copy left of each in the world and that they reside in your library alex just smiled i know but i had to try it was easier than talking my parents into letting me have them a formidable task i sure her smile extended on the edges into a real smile as jackle knew both of her parents well from a long life of patronage he really did know how funny he was being the dry old man dropped one eyelid in what might just might have been a wink the world was swirling within his mind and hunter was trying very hard to figure out who had hexed his ears he stared at the thin little girl barely older and barely bigger than his little sister as she leaned on the counter and chatted with one of the oldest and most powerful shopkeeper in knockturn the very same girl who had just placed an order for books hunter recognized for one reason and one reason only nearly every single title he d just heard had been a book his father had been trying to get his hands on for as long as hunter could remember how how how could this girl just walk into jackle and order them like a new set of robes and they ll be delivered to her house by tomorrow what strange reality had he fallen into not to mention not to mention that a fourteen year old was studying such high level dark arts texts the fact that she was alex bellmonte finally for the first time in his life settled into his brain he had always thought of her as he thought of his sister a sweet little girl he needed to look after within the rules of society it was people like her parents the lord and lady malfoy and draco that hunter had long since learned to be wary of and even now as he watched her he still couldntquite make himself believe what his mind was telling him he swallowed hard and alex seemed to notice his discomfort something wrong hunter uh no i just wasntexpecting he trailed off what alex mocked innocence my reading habits she glanced back at jackle i ll take it all the way you said i ll be back in a week to pick up my last three books you can put that all on my tab good day mr jackle alex turned his away he offered her his arm automatically his mind still racing and she took it as they left the shop you do realize you ll have to keep your mouth shut about this dontyou hunter alex spoke conversationally as they stepped onto sunlit diagon alley hunter hesitated his scattered thoughts finally freezing up logically alex was apparently just as much of a threat as his father if something happened to her on top of that there were her dangerous family connections but that wasntwhat made hunter make his decision i wasntplanning on it he frowned i wouldntsubject you to what my father would do if he found out you had those books he wouldntsubject anyone to his father if he could help it of course that was the rub wasntit if he could help it alex shot him a sharp glance that stopped him in his tracks i had no idea your father was reaching for things so high above his head she said flatly her eyes narrowing in calculation it was a joke hunter but still hunter stood still unsure if he should offer some word of comfort but at the same time strangely unwilling to do so if she decided he was a threat would he really come after me she asked finally her voice hard over a handful of books would he risk his entire house again hunter hesitated this was family stuff not to be spoken to an outsider but she deserved to know if she was in danger if he finds out a fourteen year old girl has the books he been hunting after for decades he said slowly finding the truth hard after years of lies well your family name wontprotect you he ll do anything to get his hands on those absolutely anything alex let go of his arm and turned to face him her eyes were razor sharp but there was some weird kind of compassion on her lips you dontneed to worry about me hunter she said trying to reassure him i can protect myself even from your father she hesitated then rushed on i have killed before hunter i ca so falon sudden appearance beside her cut her words short are we going potions shopping or what hunter fought the desire to punch his brother falon alex glared violent murder but as usual falon seemed oblivious to the emotional undercurrents around him as always he only knew that he was happy which meant everyone must be happy hunter glanced down at alex some rude dismissal of his brother blowing to life on his lips but she shook her head of course we are alex smiled with chilly politeness lead the way reposted 12 04 07 edited for typos etc in bold is one semi important change originally the fidelius charm the name content of the protection spell has changed it was always a different spell anyway i was just to lazy to write up a spell for it i still too lazy to do a full spell considering how complex something like this would be but i did give it a name as usual i explain all original spells in the ending a n ps yes it is short it was a long time ago so you got all your books alex mother informed her when she returned from diagon alley no i got most but nobody but us have copies of pain and blood magic you have to let me take those with me mother i ll have them back to you by the holidays but i cantjust stop in the middle and i cantfinish between now and school you cant a male voice spoke softly behind her alex turned to find her father had emerged from his study she knew instantly that she d screwed up because she hadntbeen paying attention no sir alex hurried to correct herself i am entirely capable of completing those texts in the time allotted but not if i still required to eat sleep or keep up with any of my social appearances he nodded just slightly accepting her response alex didntsigh in relief though there was still her mother and her request to deal with so her mother continued because you believe you cannot do without an invaluable text then we must let you take it to your school where anyone could see it read it steal it or turn you in for having it every consequence you just mentioned could occur with any of my dark texts are you suggesting that i as a bellmonte should cease my true studies while i seek after an education at hogwarts her mother expression closed alex repressed a flinch and met deana blistering gaze as calmly as possible painfully tense moments of silence ticked by her father just watching them with a smug look on his face just when alex began to consider the possibility that she d made a mistake and would probably get punished to hell and back for it deana nodded you may take them i ll put them in your room and we ll put the spiritus obligatus fido on the whole collection at once your blood will fuel the spells this time taking her skirt in her hand alex mother swept coldly from the hall her father laughed an unpleasant sound now we ll see what you re really made of he said before he too left the hall alex shivered at the sudden chill all too late she d registered her mother last sentence the amount of blood required to perform all the spells on all of her books all her blood and all of it fresh at the time of the casting she shivered again and thanked whatever heavenly being might exist that nearly bleeding out was all she would have to pay it wasntlikely as alex climbed slowly to her room she began to count the days til hogwarts alex didnteven look up from pain when a house elf entered her bedroom it wasntuntil it moved up to her headboard prostrate itself before her and squeaked mistress the mistress sends a message that alex shifted the gaze to it well she demanded impatiently mistress you are commanded to prepare for your attendance at the malfoy gathering shit alex rolled off her bed still swearing i forgot she yanked her robes over her head and began to haul her hair from its casual braid turning comb in one hand jewelry in the other and completely naked alex caught sight of the still prostrate elf get out it scuttled to the door but squeaked fearfully the mistress requires a response well go tell her i preparing you rodent alex commanded casually slapping it it didnteven wince just disappeared out the door useless animal she muttered turning back to her jewelry choices i hope that isntone of the ones we re breeding from a n spiritus breath breathing life soul latin

the same just some details typos and grammar was changed the malfoy manor was the dark twin of her own home the architectural style was nearly identical between the two having been built in the same period but where bellmonte manor had cream marble and warm woods malfoy manor was built entirely from pure black stone and silver thus unimpressed by the imposing fa ade alex stepped lightly up the stairs her port key gallon slipping into an inner pocket a human servant opened the front door for her alex twitched slightly at the showy display of wealth among those with ready access to house elves then considered the source mentally rolling her eyes she handed off her cloak relieved from the length of silk alex unobtrusively settled her strapless dark green gown before moving confidently forward into the three story entry hall she caught a glimpse of someone else slipping away into the next room as she approached lucius and narcissa and curtsied my lord lady aunt my parents send their regrets they had unavoidable business and will arrive later understandable lucius was as imperturbable as ever she barely spared his mask like face a glance draco inside alexa narcissa added shooing her along if she hadntknown better she d have said they didntwant to have to bother themselves with her she rolled her eyes for real as she obediently stepped into the ballroom she didnt know any better whatever else she would ve thought on the subject vanished into the cosmos as the decor hit her head on the inside of the massive ballroom was completely different than usual to put a fine point on it everything absolutely everything inanimate was made of silver even the walls were covered in silver woven cloth and alex had no doubt most all of it was real she was suddenly glad she d chosen dark green with black accents for her outfit anything more cheerful and thus more suited to the summer setting would ve clashed badly in fact as she scanned the crowd alex noted that just about everyone but her was clashing to one degree or another pansy walked up to her as she stood observing the crowd it so cute she exclaimed mockingly her eyebrow up you and draco but really alex i expected you to be more subtle at least before alex could demand to know what the hell she was talking about pansy had disappeared into the crush leaving behind a faint feeling of unease it was only an empty revenge to notice that pansy yellow gown looked particularly horrendous against the silver cautiously weaving her way into the crush alex spotted draco and immediately understood pansy comment draco was dressed in crisp black pants and a loose set of dress robes underneath was a tight pressed shirt in a deep green the exact shade of her gown it seemed to all appearances as if they d chosen to wear accenting outfits hers deep green with black draco black with green sighing alex changed her course and moved towards him with a shake of her head the better to get this over with quickly draco good evening he looked up and smiled alex felt her mouth curving into a matching grin she firmly fought the compulsion the smooth idiot good evening alex how are you i quite well and you looking forward to school alex you know the detharts dontyou apparently remembering his social duty draco gestured to his three companions not as well as i d like alex offered the other girl her hand tania correct yeah she doesnt get out a lot falon interjected himself into the conversation tania quietly shook alex hand it nice to meet you miss bellmonte she said softly oh please alex smiled at the younger girl call me alex it a shame i haventmet you before i ll have to start asking my parents to invite you specifically to our gatherings falon hid a flash of anger but wasntquite fast enough about it hunter just looked grateful alex came to the conclusion that it wasnttania own choice that kept her close to home tania inclined her head gracefully towards alex but said nothing you really neednt trouble yourself alex falon said all smoothness and slime oh dontworry falon i never do anything that troubles me alex used her intense dislike of falon to put a mental marker on the invite tania thought if falon had just kept his mouth shut she might have forgotten now however she d do just about anything to get tania to put in an appearance at whatever social engagements she thought she could get away with just out of spite it true draco confirmed carefully filing away the entire scene for future use she quite self gratifying mostly well someone has to do it for me alex shrugged off draco comment i might as well stick to someone i know i can trust to do it right hunter chuckled alex suddenly realized that the detharts were watching the conversation avidly glancing at draco she saw that he d come to the same conclusion so pansy approached me as i came in seems to think our outfits were cute draco alex abruptly changed the topic not wanting her and draco feud to become public if it didntneed to why draco all but sneered cause they are alex barely heard tania whisper but it seemed everyone else had caught it too she glanced over at the girl but before she could do anything falon casually laid a hand on tania shoulder the girl paled the lack of blood in her face emphasizing the deep red of her gown hunter subtly tensed alex laughed lightly the girl speaks truth stepping forward she threw an arm around tania shoulders accidentally dislodging falon in the process pansy said they were cute draco cause they are deal with it draco contented himself with a second long withering glare before putting on his society face again well if you three think them cute who am i to argue never argue with women draco you ll live longer alex grinned and turned to her companion care to mingle with me tania alex saw hunter place a hand on his brother shoulder as casually as falon had a moment before this time it was falon who tensed but much more visibly i d hate to impose tania continued to be soft spoken alex sighed dramatically what is with people thinking i doing them favors alexandria bellmonte does not do charity come on tani let ditch these boys a look of utter astonishment crossed tania face before she regained control of her features if you put it that way i d be delighted good now you boys play nice i ll bring your sister back in mostly one piece alex waved a hand over her shoulder at the group she d just left draco what do you think you re doing alex glanced around at the long dim hallway that ran along the top edge of the entry hall ceiling why did you need to talk to me up here she pulled futilely against his grip on her wrists draco had approached her in the ballroom moments before and asked for a private word it seemed his idea of a private word involved imprisoning her hands alex draco stopped and turned to face her light glinting off his pale gray eyes before she could speak again he stepped close and kissed her alex stumbled back and found her spine pressed against the black wood molding on the wall draco kept pace with her and the kiss never faltered as she rapidly ran out of oxygen and recovered her wits what was happening found its way into her brain yanking at his tightening grip on her left hand alex got it loose and raked her nails across his neck he leapt back with a yell what the hell his gaze was pure venom draco malfoy if you ever touch me again i wontjust scratch your neck i will slit it from ear to ear alex raced for the staircase groping in her pocket for her galleon once her feet found the floor of the entry hall she looked around for the servant he was nowhere in sight from behind her she heard draco start down the stairs giving her cloak up as lost she held up the gold coin and clearly pictured her bedroom the feeling of a sharp yank formed behind her navel and the world blurred when it settled alex found herself in her own bedroom she tossed the now useless galleon onto her desk it only had magic enough to last for two trips and she d used up both getting to and from the malfoys striding over to her door she shut locked and activated its silence spells that done alex threw herself onto her bed and dug her fingers into her hair a n i originally thought it worked better if i split the reactions into a new chapter since i not doing that much editing it is still in that format a n reposted 10 21 07 as with all my reposts all the important content has remained the same just some details typos and grammar was changed new scene i just couldntleave draco acting like an idiot without explaining his motivations draco leaned against the wall shaking his head slowly trying to wrap his head around well everything it had all been too easy find alex draw her away and then play some cat and mouse while on his home ground it was a perfect opportunity to throw her off balance and mess with her head and he didnteven have to wait until school started but then he d kissed her which had not been a part of the original plan draco still wasntcompletely sure why he d even done it he was sure that he d enjoyed it well the blonde grimaced he d enjoyed it until alex had hit him he d been rejected before but no one had ever fought back like he was attacking them a push or a laughing no merlin she d looked so small and angry damn angry a small of part of draco was surprised that he wasnta streak of blood on the wall at this point a much larger part of him was wallowing in a guilt he wasntsure he could define what he was sure of was that he d been very very stupid something bad was going to come out of this but with luck the only fall out would be a premature tipping of his hand to alex with a whole castle full of luck a swell of noise from below reminded him of his other guests and draco pushed himself to his feet he fingers the light welts on his neck and headed even further upstairs first he needed a new shirt what is wrong with him alex wailed casting herself onto her bed tears of anger rolled down her face i didntnot want to be kissed in an upper hallway by draco frickin malfoy my first time merlin less anger and more pain filled her crying it not fair why do i have to be strong powerful perfect all the time curling up on her side alex cried until her eyes were burningly dried out and her throat ached crawling off her bed she slipped slowly out of her gown and into a night robe wallowing in her misery alex bypassed the sleep potions and grabbed her diary instead adding a never ending ink quill to her grasp she walked back to her bed and slid under the thick covers propped up on her pillows with her knees drawn up alex pressed her finger to the diary lock it sprang open at her touch she flipped to a clean page personal it all too personal it all means too much to me whom nothing means anything too private beyond private betrayed it mine it belongs to me by what right do you claim it by what right do you dare to enter a territory forbidden by what right do you know me i not yours dont own me please dont i belong to myself so little anyway cant i escape from them all just once for one night canti be mine you dontknow me you dontown me please donthurt me i do that enough on my own tears began to blotch the page alex rubbed her forehead battling a coming headache the loneliness opened inside her like a gaping void damn him she muttered damn you draco malfoy leave me alone shutting the book alex shivered and burrowed deeper into her comforters i hate him she whispered to her pillow i ll never forgive him for this draco a word if you please draco froze on his way upstairs to his room when his father began to ask it was always bad yes father he said casually stepping into lucius office the elder malfoy sat behind his desk fingers lightly steepled in front of his face did you have a pleasant evening yes sir it didntcome out differently than anything else draco had said this evening thanks to his control but he was wary of the unreadable man before him i saw you speaking with miss bellmonte have the two of you become friends merely acquaintances at the moment i plan to change that this year draco regained a little of his usual uncaring tone if all his father wanted to know about was him and alex so you wouldntknow the reason that she left early draco mentally froze did she he asked with he thought believable surprise why lucius leaned forward his gaze sharpening why dontyou tell me the temperature of his tone dropped several degrees with each word i donthave any idea why she left draco scoffed shrugging how would i know something like that we re only passing acquaintances father the girl doesnt confide in me perhaps you should confide in me lucius commanded arcticly about what you changed your shirt why i startled by the sudden change of subject draco glanced down at his black turtle neck spilled something on the other one oh really lucius stood and paced out from behind his desk you didntchange it to hide that he yanked the collar of draco shirt away from his neck revealing three long scratches i silence lucius slowly advanced on draco pulling his wand free of his cane if you need to satisfy your lusts because you are too weak to control them then i will buy you a girl alexandria bellmonte is not yours to toy with no matter what she looks like she is a bellmonte she is not to be touched do i make myself understood yes sir draco felt his eyes widen and shut down his fear with an angry thought he was draco malfoy he didnt fear anyone tripping over a chair leg draco slammed onto his back as the stars cleared from his vision he saw his father standing over him a black and silver wand was leveled at his heart good lucius said quietly crucio because i keep forgetting disclaimer i do not own anything harry potter more the pity alex crawled wearily out of bed sleep had not come swiftly to the bellmonte house last night her tears had kept her awake her tears and a pesky thought that refused to be banished even if you didntwant him to you liked it anyway you wouldntmind if he tried it again right and there it was again rattling around inside her head the moment her eyes opened stupid brain she muttered angrily it never obeys me i need to do something about a knock sounded interrupting her grumbling stalking over to the door alex glared down at the house elf it was her father personal one linge what she demanded he looked up at her unruffled my master and the mistress await you in the library they are prepared to do the book spelling and you are required tell them i on my way dismissed alex turned back into her room and leaned against the inner wall she d forgotten that her parents had said they d be putting the spells on her books as soon as the malfoy party was done with it seemed she was forgetting a lot lately merlin shit moving as fast as she dared she d get in just as much trouble for being one hair out of place as for being late alex dressed plaiting her hair into a thick braid sighing at her reflection one last time she quit the room heading for the stairs you needed to see me alex announced calmly entering the library with her wand in one hand neither of her parents commented just looked at her suppressing a wince alex stepped into the very center of the circle and sat down around her lay her dark texts the most important in the innermost circle and ranging outward from there next lay a glittering brown circle outside of that paced her parents still without a word her father tossed a razor sharp dagger aloft alex caught it deftly in her empty hand as it fell steeling herself she slit a long gash down first one wrist then the other her mother spoke a word the crimson liquid flowed through the air raining gently down on the books in deeper tones fredrick bellmonte began to speak rhythmically deana higher tones occasionally joined in alex didntnotice too much her mind was focused on the seemingly endless amount of blood that poured from her for a second time her mother spoke a single powerful word and alex felt as though her blood were being pulled from her her cuts began to throb alex couldntkeep track of time but she did watch the sunlight ride higher and higher up the floor to ceiling windows on one wall the pouring streams of light seemed rude to her inappropriate well now i guess you ll never know if you d enjoy draco kissing you again hmm what we already decided that one no we didn t you would ve liked it you know would not have and you just said it never going happen anyway so i dontwant to hear about it again not until the day i die well at least i wonthave to keep my mouth shut long what the hell are you talking about alex demanded of the annoying voice inside her look down you fool unnerved at the abrupt change in the voice tone alex did as she was told shadows obscured her arms but even so alex could see that they were nearly transparent the blood from her wounds had slowed to a sluggish spurt every few seconds an agonizing throb accompanied each spurt lifting her suddenly heavy head alex saw her parents still pacing her father voice sounded hoarse to her ears but then she wasnttrusting her senses at all right now finite alex parents finished in a loud ringing voice deana turned and strode out without a backwards glance her father stepped into the spotless circle and waved his wand over alex integument repairo the gashes on her arms disappeared but huge purple and black bruises ran from wrist to elbow father it finished you re stronger than i thought you re still conscious he shrugged and turned away go to bed alex placing her hands on the floor alex tried to lever herself onto her knees she shifted a few inches before her arms began to shake with a whimper she collapsed onto the floor resting her head on the text ironically titled blood magic alex wrapped her arms around herself and fell into darkness draco growled low in his throat jamming the galleon savagely into his pocket it was time according to his father to make the appropriate apologies to alex stifling the urge to stalk up the sweeping drive the fronted the bellmonte estate draco began his climb it was easy going but for some residual stiffness the crucio curse doesntharm a person physically but the thrashing and screaming that accompany it tend to do that for it even a full day later draco was still feeling his bruises he growled again alex had much to answer for a servant answered the door instantly when he rang the bell the man bowed low greetings m lord how may i assist you this morning i ve come to call on alex if she in it rather important draco said smoothly never once looking at the man before him it never occurred to him to do so the doorman bowed again of course the little mistress is in the library this way absently casting a critical eye over the flawless state of the bellmonte entry way draco followed the servant down a short hall the man opened one side of a set of double doors and bowed draco through inside draco saw alex leaning heavily against the window she was looking out a large smudged circle darkened the middle of the marble floor master draco malfoy the doorman announced before departing alex whirled alarm clear on her face she quickly regained her composure draco what a surprise her tone was flat and hostile draco stopped this wasntwhat he d expected he d known she d be angry for being kissed without giving her permission but this continual anger it didntfit with his facts she d been raised the same as him what did it matter that they were only thirteen when one bloodline was this important one learned the art of procreation early why should one little kiss that barely did anything have her so up in arms like he d actually done something to her in his surprise he blurted out the first thing in his mind you re angry with me alex let out a laugh of disbelief wow how clever of you draco malfoy why with that brain i surprised you arentbeating out that granger chick draco jaw clenched echoes of his father lectures on the subject of hermione granger flooding his mind he opened his mouth but alex wasntfinished she began to pace slowly towards him what did you think you were doing leading me away from everyone are you so brave draco that you only assault girls where no one could possibly hear them scream beginning to get angry himself draco took a few steps forward he inhaled preparing to launch an attack of his own and smelled blood and fresh blood too the dark smudge began to make some sense do you really think you could use my body to gain control over me you forget draco i a bellmonte everything in my world is under my direct control that includes my physical being as she got closer to him draco realized that alex was pale almost bloodless looking she raked a hand through her loose mussed hair and he caught sight of bandages covering her arms from wrist to elbow significant shadows underscored haunted eyes her words were even more haunting when draco used his family name or claimed control it was because he was desperate to convince himself that he had some i sorry alex i over stepped myself they were the words his father had drilled into him at wand point night before last but somehow they seemed appropriate she froze and stared at him w what you re entirely correct i over stepped myself it wonthappen again alex put a hand to her forehead and sank onto a nearby couch with a sigh confused exhaustion ran across her features draco stayed where he was waiting but why her words came out as a plea and she seemed to realize it i mean she tried to compose herself what was the point draco frowned and tried to figure out an answer truth be told he wasntall that sure himself he d told himself it was to get revenge on her but by his own logic that was ridiculous why would she even care if he kissed her if she had the experience he d been sure until just now that she d had i he slowly shook his head i dontknow alex shifted and bit her lip briefly fair enough but then why are you here now my father found out i ve been required to apologize alex winced at the bitter underpinning of his words his father if he was anything like hers this is lucius malfoy we re talking about he no doubt much worse she felt a wave of sympathy for draco and then wondered why she wasntresenting it well you ve apologized you re free to go if you like and am i free to stay if i like from the look that crossed his face when he d finished speaking draco was as shocked by his request as she was i not very good company on the best of days and today doesnteven count as a neutral day spell casting makes our kind unpleasant afterwards can you name an activity that doesnt make our kind unpleasant afterwards alex smiled wryly well draco sent her a meaningful look ha then your parents must sleep at different ends of the house from each other or you wouldntstill harbor that myth draco frowned lost in thought after a very short length of time he shuddered eh i d forgotten about that you re welcome he sent her a glare that wasntsomething i d thank you for bringing up i didntbring up anything draco you did so draco wisely changed the subject what were you casting oh alex tossed a hand and tried to look casual about it there are a few books my parents are loaning me that they d rather didntget things spilled on or stolen or anything so we put a few protections on them and since they re your books the blood had to be yours alex head jerked up and she stared at draco but it wasntphrased as a question so she wasntrequired to answer he shrugged how nearly did you come alex stood to her feet chin in the air i have no idea what you re talking about draco malfoy i ll bet was there anything else she words were coldly precise no if you have no objection i ll take my leave draco glared at her before turning on his heel and stalking away the servant had to scramble to open the front door before draco reached it before his foot even touched the first step draco had gripped his galleon with a sharp snap he was gone alex stared out the window after him hand pressed to the glass a n no alex isntcrazy oh come on like none of you have ever had conversations with yourself i hope you enjoyed this it a little longer than before review and tell me if it was long enough for you
