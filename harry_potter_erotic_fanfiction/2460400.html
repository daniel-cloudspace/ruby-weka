 harry potter and the burden of becoming prologue the golden candlelight flickered off the stone walls walls built before the founding of hogwarts before the campaigns of charlemagne before the birth of christ these walls endured the battles of pharaoh and of caesar and saw the creation of magic in the earliest of days the rhythmic chant of the sixteen cloaked in black resonated against the walls which somehow knew what was to come a thin toothless smile creased her aged face worn by years of waiting but now now the time at last had arrived with the sacrifice set she closed her eyes and nodded and the sixteen thrust forth their daggers she could taste the blood and her smile broadened the age of pravus and morgana had returned a new age reborn the age of voldemort and no she screamed sensing too late his presence harry woke with a start his sheets soaked with sweat a mixture of the night heat and the new nightmare her screams still ringing in his ears he adjusted his pillow flopped back down and smiled for the first night all summer he woke to a dream that had nothing to do about sirius black harry potter and the burden of becoming chapter 1 a new beginning the air was hot and humid as harry lay on his back watching the clouds fly over privet drive droplets of sweat fell from his forehead making his hair wet under the shade of two large bushes he found himself again as last year outside the dursley open window hoping to hear some word of what was going on in the world hoping to hear some sign that might give him a clue as to what voldemort and his followers were up to he had received a few owls from ron and hermione and one from remus each wishing him well and reassuring him that all was quiet in the wizarding world yet harry knew that voldemort greatest strength was stealth an ability to move unseen and undetected all might be quiet but that didntmean that nothing was happening so he listened intently for the smallest of clues the least story that was out of the ordinary and in those moments during advert breaks his mind mulled over the prophecy of his fate a fate only known by harry and professor dumbledore one day harry and voldemort would meet and only one of them would survive the newscaster led the stories of the night with a five car pile up outside bristol a petrol tanker had caught fire and three people had died a drop in the bucket thought harry if he has his way in a few minutes the news turned to the weather hot hot and hotter chirped the weatherman with this harry mind wandered to the parchment ron had sent him earlier that afternoon he pulled it out of his pocket and read it again it was the most newsworthy note he d received all summer harry sorry to hear you re so miserable i thought for sure you were going to be able to stay with us this summer but things have taken a bit of a turn dad was appointed to direct the ministry efforts in the capture of you know who and his followers dumbledore says that the appointment has put our whole family on the death eater hit list we ve had to leave the burrow to live in the one place i dontthink you d want to come back to at least not yet it not the same here as it was last christmas that for sure mum says as soon as we get things straightened up you should come to stay be strong harry it should only take a few weeks be careful ron harry knew of course it was his godfather house sirius black they d spent christmas there last year it was the happiest harry had ever seen sirius the pleasant daydream swirled in harry mind but then as it always did his mind shifted to the scene it had played all summer long he saw himself yelling at hermione demanding that sirius was in trouble he saw himself lead his friends into danger he saw sirius coming to the rescue sirius battling bellatrix sirius falling through the curtain if harry hadntbeen so arrogant his godfather would still be alive and as much as everyone had tried to reassure him it wasn t he knew it was his fault he groaned just thinking about it again the pain palpable in his heart had sirius lived harry would be with him right now the ministry had cleared his name and the daily prophet was declaring him a hero sirius black the closest thing harry had to family and he had led him to his death there was a loud pop from across the street and harry jumped up twisting just in time to miss the opened window he d grabbed his wand from his pocket but it was just the carpenters finishing up some remodeling work on the old wythe house in front was a new sold sign the house had only been up for sale about a week harry had never seen a house sell so quickly on privet drive put that down boy his uncle vernon hissed staring down at harry from the open window sweat dripped down his uncle ruddy face as his eyes flashed up the street if you want to eat get in the house now harry slid the wand back in his threadbare jeans and walked around to the front door not much had changed since last year even though the dursley knew that voldemort had risen again and that he was out to kill harry no one would speak of it in fact nothing had really changed at all except for one thing dudley harry oversized cousin was now speaking with him and not just jabs and insults they were having real conversations harry was amazed dudley could even string three good sentences together at first they were just questions what were those things that attacked us last year why couldnti see them who voldemort why is he after you it seemed the more he learned about harry and harry world the harder it was to hate him dudley still had his gang but when any of them tried to punch harry in the ribs or trip him while he was walking past dudley would simply say lay off and now they simply did just that not only was harry free to walk the village without fear of being pummeled he was able to talk to other kids without having to worry that dudley thugs would come after them the one thing dudley wouldntdo was talk with harry in front of his parents so after another silent dinner of cabbage rolls and cottage cheese harry climbed the stairs to his room it had been an exhausting day of nothingness and instead of reading the quid ex magazine ron had sent him he decided to go straight to bed clear your mind harry thought relax he had resolved to practice occlumency over the summer and was actually getting quite good at it he was able to sleep at night without dreaming of voldemort and his scar had stopped burning thoughts of ron letter left his head the film of sirius death stopped playing in his mind and soon he was asleep the sound of a loud squeal like fingernails on a chalkboard broke his slumber at the sudden noise he sat bolt upright in bed the sun was streaming through his open window it was morning already there was a loud clanking and banging in the street outside harry rubbed his eyes trying to adjust to the light he grabbed his glasses from off his nightstand and walked over to the window outside a moving truck had pulled up to the house across the street a rather beaten up four door sedan was parked out on the curb as well movers were opening up the large truck and talking to a rather tall dark haired man whose eyes kept darting up and down the street the morning was warm but he wore a long sleeved shirt as he seemed to be pointing out what he wanted done so that my new neighbor harry thought i wonder what he looking for a dark haired woman stepped out of the house unlike the man she was wearing a t shirt but her eyes too were looking up and down the street mrs neighbor harry whispered what are you looking for the woman cupped her hands around her mouth and yelled gabriella then turning she yelled something to the man in a language that harry could not understand and the man yelled back in the same tongue clearly irritated was it russian greek again the woman called gabriella yes mama a tall slender girl appeared from behind the house she had long black hair that was tied back in a ponytail she too wore jeans and a t shirt but somehow they seemed to suit her better than her mother was she about harry age her mother stepped down from the front door grabbed her by the arm and took her over to her father he began to yell but what was being said harry couldntsay the daughter kept replying in english but the parents he couldnttell he leaned out his window slightly to see if he could pick out some word he might interpret when an owl carrying the morning daily prophet hit him square in the face the owl squawked loudly somehow entangling itself on harry glasses get off me you bloody bird harry felt himself slipping out the window he reached up grabbed the bird and tore it from his face the bird screeching louder just in time he caught himself from falling on the side of the window frame and then looked down below in the street the yelling had stopped everyone had turned to view the second story of number four privet drive the movers looked perplexed the mother and father stared blankly and the daughter seemed to be laughing with her hand over her mouth to harry horror he realized he was hanging out his window in his boxers with no shirt and of course a severe case of bed head he quickly pulled himself back up flashed a half hearted wave and smile and shot back into his room what a glorious way to start the day there he was thinking perhaps that his new neighbors might be in league with the dark lord instead a perfectly normal family moves in and he almost breaks his neck falling out a second story window nearly saving voldemort the trouble of killing harry himself he went to put a shirt on when another owl arrived this time with a letter from hermione he sat down on his bed trying to gather himself and read harry i hope this note finds you very well it wontbe long until we re all together again i know it only been a couple days since my last post but i ll be traveling for about a week and i wontbe able to write dontworry though everything fine just a short holiday i ll write again as soon as i get back love hermione not a moment later a third owl flew in this time it was a letter from ron harry things have been getting pretty busy around here so i wontbe able to write for a few days dontworry though it nothing really important i ll write back as soon as i can ron the owls began to fight with each other their feathers littering harry room hedwig hooted reproachfully from her cage in the corner harry ignored the commotion instead he reread each letter trying to figure out what was going on obviously he was being left out of something was he too much of a liability to start helping the order it was perfectly clear in harry mind that they were asking ron and hermione to help out bit of a holiday harry spat they were probably being asked to travel somewhere to get information or maybe to try and capture one of the escaped death eaters bellatrix lestrange did they expect harry to just sit in his nice cozy room and wait for school term to begin he tore the letters in his hands and scattered them with the feathers across the floor get out of here you filthy birds i ve got nothing for you i never want to see another owl again he chased them from his room and slammed his window shut hedwig gave a scolding hoot in her cage sorry girl i just i just sorry he laid his forehead against the pane of the glass and watched the movers below take furniture into the new neighbor house he stood there watching nothing until aunt petunia called him down to start breakfast breakfast at the dursley table was much the same as dinner the night before harry knew better than to say a word and instead he let his mind turn over the early morning events what was the order up to what had they asked ron and hermione to do why did they both tell him not to worry who was the family moving in next door was the girl part veela uncle harry had found the words falling from his mouth before he could stop them do you know who moving in next door and what business is that of yours boy the question had clearly brought something to the surface reminding harry of why he was never to speak at the table uncle vernon face began to grow scarlet and his eye began to twitch he turned to petunia perfectly fine neighborhood perfectly fine and now now ruined his last word squirted out like a deflating balloon now dear aunt petunia spoke in her nicest and most proper voice they may be perfectly fine have you seen their car how could the vermin even afford to live in this neighborhood aunt petunia simply shook her head but harry caught dudley eyes and he clearly detected a look of disgust they probably came in to some money the wrong way if you ask me how else eh how else after breakfast harry went outside for a walk to the park and met up with dudley who was heading down the street toward magnolia avenue what was the ruckus at breakfast about he asked the neighbors of course responded dudley thickly i know it was about the neighbors what wrong with the neighbors harry asked trying to spell it out for his cousin well they re not from around here are they dad says they re from somewhere in the middle east he figures they ve got to be terrorists or something god he bloody ignorant harry just nodded and listened the woman was over working on their house the other day and asked me if i wanted some cookies from the lunch basket she d brought they looked weird but it was the best meal i ve had in ages a look of rapture had spread over dudley face you dontsuppose they re really dangerous harry asked wondering if maybe there was a connection however remote with voldemort look anyone that invites a stranger in and gives them food is number one in my book dudley exclaimed harry couldnthelp but wonder what mad eye moody would say that evening during the news harry found himself under the bushes again listening to yet another account of stories that meant nothing when the adverts started the film of sirius death began to play again in his head only to be cut short by the sweet sound of whistling a tune harry had heard playing on the radio over and over for the last few weeks he sat up and peered through the bushes across the street was the girl her hands clasped behind her back she was simply whistling and looking at the flowers in the front of her garden harry looked and listened for a moment and his heart seemed somehow lighter from inside the house he heard his aunt call out dinner quietly he stood up and walked over to the front door the whistling stopped harry could feel two eyes staring at the back of his neck he thought to turn around and then caught a glimpse of himself in the window his clothes were covered in dirt and debris from the bushes and his hair had something imbedded in it that resembled a bird nest he was frozen for a moment quickly he rushed through the front door shutting it behind him he looked back through the pane of glass but the girl was gone he laid his forehead against the door and sighed why should he care what he looked like she was only a muggle after all but then another voice in his head whispered a very pretty muggle that evening preparing for sleep he sat down on his bed and began to clear his mind it was more difficult tonight there were many voices bouncing about his head why didntanyone think harry could help in the war why was everyone ignoring him they ll come to regret it he thought he imagined ron and hermione dueling with a death eater if only harry were here the weasleys being attacked at number twelve grimmauld place if only harry were here the girl across the street in a long white dressing gown if only there were loud shouts and harry dream came to an abrupt halt he knew the voices in the darkness harry got up and went to his open window the lights were on across the street through a downstairs window he could see the parents fighting again the father was clearly agitated pacing back and forth the mother seemed dismissive which only heated the argument further the father kept pointing his finger at the ceiling and harry looked up his heart skipped a beat and he quickly jumped back at the window directly across from his stood the girl looking back at him did she see it too dark he thought slowly he edged back toward the window the girl still stood there but she wasntlooking back at harry she was gazing up at the stars her dark black hair was free of its ponytail of the morning and was draped over a white nightgown which was blowing gently in the warm evening breeze she seemed somehow sad he stood gazing across the street for how long he didntknow the yelling downstairs had stopped she stepped back and drew her curtains shut harry lay down on his bed he had utterly forgotten about ron or hermione or number twelve grimmauld place but it still took some time before he could clear his mind the next morning he found himself outside with a clean pair of jeans and the best t shirt he could find that wasntthree sizes too big he was looking for weeds in the sidewalk even though he d just pulled them all two days earlier when he heard a door open and close from across the street casually he straightened up and turned around it was the mother he exhaled she was taking out some rubbish when she caught harry eye she tossed a plastic bag in the bin and looked back at him instantly a light spread across her face and a huge smile appeared darting across privet drive she walked straight toward harry she was a smaller woman with round brown eyes her smile revealed a golden tooth as she came close enough to hold harry by the arm are you alright she asked with a very slight accent harry had never heard before er yeah you gave us quite the scare i ve never seen so many birds attack a person like that before oh yeah i guess have you had breakfast no he lied but not by too much for breakfast aunt petunia had served cold toast with cucumber jelly come here then without ever letting go of harry arm this small woman with surprisingly great strength was marching him to her front door no really i can t he sputtered he was telling himself how crazy this was to go into the house of a potential enemy he began to pull back but the woman held tight and thrust him through the door dontbe silly she said with a hint of mischief in her voice all about the entryway and into the living room were boxes and boxes waiting to be unpacked the air was filled with a warm sweet aroma and harry felt his stomach give a slight jab as if to say shut up stupid gabriella the woman called a moment later the girl descended the stairs in shorts and a halter top yes mama breakfast is ready and we have company that young man from across the street harry had never been referred to as a man before at least not in a polite way he felt his stomach give another lurch i met your brother the other day said the mother brightly although she looked harry up and down you dontseem much alike he my cousin harry responded dully still looking at gabriella she was standing only a few feet in front of him and he could feel the tips of his ears redden slightly her eyes were as black as her hair and her skin a dark copper brown she had a dazzling smile and seemed to blush slightly herself we saw you yesterday morning she said still smiling fighting off some attacking birds why did they come after you i dontknow never seen anything like it that smells wonderful he changed the conversation and looked toward the kitchen but he could see her eye him up and down much like her mother as he looked away they ate breakfast while harry shared what information he could about the village beyond pointing out what was where harry wasntmuch help with dudley and the gang off his back this was really the first year he d ever had a chance to meet anyone he did emphasize that vernon was his uncle and petunia simply his aunt and that they were most definitely not his parents but when they started to ask more about his dursley family roots he quickly turned the conversation by asking questions himself he thought perhaps too quickly as gabriella mother seemed to have noted the second shift he d made in the conversation gabriella was born in lebanon a place called tripoli the language he heard her parents grigor and soseh speaking was armenian her father had taught physics at the university of balamand in tripoli and her mother was an artist the opportunity for what they thought would be a better life came up when grigor was offered a job at pensley college outside of little whinging with their astronomy department he always had his head in the stars and now he can get paid for it soseh smiled life in lebanon is improving but the country is still a very dangerous place life here on privet drive will be much safer a chance for gabriella to walk the streets without worry harry mind flashed to his encounter with two dementors less than one block away just last summer yeah he said with a half hearted smile her mother english was nearly perfect he could barely believe she was the same woman shouting at her husband the night before they spoke for quite some time before gabriella mother offered them some very strong coffee in tiny cups it reminded harry of some potion that professor snape would concoct but he smiled and thanked her for it drinking it down in one gulp without too much of a grimace gabriella seemed to think it funny and laughed perhaps some sugar she offered asking for sugar would mean another cup however small and harry didntthink sugar would help but he couldntstop himself from handing her the cup and saying sure their hands touched and he could feel his ears reddening a bit more fully this time mama perhaps harry could show me the neighborhood this morning she asked as she put a small spoonful of sugar in the cup and then handed it to her mother i think it a marvelous idea darling soseh filled the cup with coffee and handed it to harry here you go it will put hair on your chest she grinned harry pictured himself topless hanging from his bedroom window will you have time this morning harry time time was something harry had too much of his time was spent thinking about sirius death of voldemort return of his two best friends taking on adventures he could only wait to hear about absolutely he smiled sipping from the tiny cup within ten minutes he and a very beautiful girl were walking down the street talking about anything but the wizarding world harry potter and the burden of becoming chapter 11 an unhappy inheritance it was dawn but still quite early the sky was a glowing deep purple and in the dim light it took harry a moment to adjust his eyes and clear his head he slipped on his glasses and patted the edge of his bed where hedwig hopped to his side he untied the post from her leg and held it in his hands the dreams of the night before were washed from his mind as he looked at the writing it was addressed simply harry my love his heart began to pound this is silly he thought get a hold of yourself before he slipped the seal he took in a deep breath and resigned to stay the course he had laid down he would not be swayed she was safer where she was and that was the end of that carefully he opened the letter my dearest harry hedwig was in my room waiting for me when i got home mama asked why i was crying so and i told her that you had gone i saw them gathering your things through the window it was fred and george i grabbed fred when he came out i think i frightened him a bit tell him i sorry i was so rough he walked with me and we talked he not too bad really in fact he sweet he says you ll be off to school soon you have nothing to be sorry for there nothing i would have ever done differently you say you travel your path alone but you don t from what fred tells me there are many others who walk on either side i ll be happy to stay a few steps back for now if that what you want dontthink you ll get too far ahead you won t i keeping your heart and soul though i ve got this pretty little box mama made to keep them in i think you might be surprised how quickly you will have us all back i going to the store tomorrow to buy some decent food for hedwig i expect to see her again and before too long i asked fred to let me keep one thing of yours just something to remember you by when i brush my hair at night i hope you wontmind but it padfoot mirror i guess if you do mind you can come to get it i ve glimpsed a bit into your heart and if you look into mine you ll see that i will hold yours warm and safe in my little box you ll also see that i love you and will wait for you to return love now and forever gabriella he read the note several times and with each reading his smile widened he had thought of giving her the mirror himself but it was foolishness to think he would use it to speak with her he would do all he could to shield her from the wizarding world one day they might reunite and just knowing that she had the mirror made him feel happier hedwig gave a little hoot i sorry girl he said all i have is a bit of bread there might be some mice outside she nipped at the piece of bread we re leaving to grimmauld place today if you decide to wander off meet me there okay he stroked her feathers and she flew out the window as soon as she left harry got up and put his clothes on he winced as he pushed his arm through his t shirt his mind flashed back to when his body was sliding along the pavement looking at the bandages he stretched the fingers on his right hand he was lucky he even had an arm the basin by the mirror had been filled again with water he splashed his face ran his fingers through his hair and toweled off he put his glasses on and walked over to the flowers he remembered the day he saw gabriella looking at the flowers in her new garden and then he remembered his own loitering outside looking for weeds he knew werentthere was she outside on purpose he wondered waiting for me that moment mrs weasley entered his room good morning dear she said smiling good i see you re dressed we can go now or after breakfast which would you let go now i just need to know my wand he asked oh yes i nearly forgot she reached into a large handbag and pulled out his wand here you go dear she paused and checked the room the twins have gathered all your other things and brought them to the house shall we go harry looked around at the room then up to the open window the sun was starting to fill the frame he nodded and walked out the door mrs weasley at his side st mungo was the same as he had remembered he thought of the longbottom and touched his forehead what if this belonged to neville instead he thought as they walked down the corridor they past a sign artifact accidents mrs weasley he asked yes harry they entered the main atrium mr weasley had two others in his room with him i was by myself why it was just safer dear so i still being watched he asked coolly her face reddened no one been watching you we ve just been making sure you re safe that all because you think he after me the pink in her face turned ashen she nodded do you know why he asked simply wondering what her answer might be instantly the blood returned to her face and fire lit her eyes she placed one hand to harry cheek he pure evil harry even when he was simply tom he would never consider failure an option now he sees himself all powerful and yet a mere child has bested him well not so much a child anymore are you she now had to look up to see his eyes pausing for a moment she took his hand he wontstand for it he ll risk all to rid the world of you harry it ll be his ruin i think we both know that but it also means we must be watchful you must be watchful this is not the year to go off wandering the grounds at night or playing with giants in the forbidden forest harry eyes widened they stepped to the street where a limousine was there to take them to grimmauld place she looked up and down the street we must all be extra careful this year they stepped to the car and soon left st mungo behind them when they walked through the front door of number twelve grimmauld place harry stood awestruck the first thing he noticed was the light it wasntdark and dingy but bright and airy the next thing he noticed was the smell or rather the lack of smell the air was fresh not dank and moldy the first words out of his mouth were where his mother oh yes well that required dumbledore help he stopped by the house here only a few nights after well after sirius had left us the old hag began to scream bloody murder calling sirius a mudblood lover and a traitor to wizarding kind i dontthink i ve ever seen albus quite so angry he simply raised his wand and she was gone he hasntsaid how or where none of the order could even get her unglued from the wall and believe me we all tried makes for a nice change i think well let see who here she started forward to the kitchen door but harry feet were somehow stuck to where he was come on dear he didntwant to move he couldntmove he felt weak perspiration began to prickle on his forehead it was suddenly very hard to breathe he reached for the edge of the door as the room began to spin upside down mrs weasley quickly grabbed him by the arm just in time to stop him from collapsing to the floor harry what wrong he couldntanswer the room air had disappeared his sight was failing everything was turning dark ron hermione he heard her yell as if from far far away soon everything was black a voice echoed from the darkness he not gone you know just on the other side it was luna lovegood but he couldntsee her the voices didntyou hear them if only we could find a way to see them but you know the way dontyou harry cantyou see the key it right here but harry couldntsee anything if anyone can find a way harry you can if you see my mother tell her i miss her so the voice was fading harry can you hear me another voice broke the blackness harry can you hear me it was hermione cool air seemed to rush into his lungs he could breathe again slowly his eyes opened he was in bed in the room he had stayed the summer before the same empty portrait of phineas nigellus hung on the wall opposite the bed was bigger and he looked up to find four faces staring down at him mrs weasley hermione ron and remus lupin i dontknow mrs weasley spoke first perhaps it was too early to bring him home they said he d had a bad night give him time molly remus replied harry how are you feeling harry brought his head off his pillow he was a bit confused i okay he said not really sure how he felt i dontknow what came over me he lied he knew exactly what it was he knew before he d walked through the door it didntmatter how much mrs weasley had cleaned he didntwant to be here the thought of sirius hung in the air it was part of the walls that still had the portraits of the black family it would be only a matter of time until he saw sirius photo again as moody had shown him the picture last year of his parents before they had been murdered here lupin said try this he handed harry a large bar of chocolate harry was still somewhat unsteady dementors he asked thinly no said lupin with a smile great deal on fizzing fudgebars at honneydukes then he turned to the others in the room what do you say we give harry some time to rest no harry said taking a bite of chocolate i okay really now dear said mrs weasley taking harry hand they said you should just rest for a couple of days everyone began to file out of the room he was desperate he didntwant to be left alone not here not now remus he called do you have a minute remus returned and sat down in a new chair that was not in the room last year harry searched for something to say anything where the other bed he asked well molly spread things out a little fred and george arenthere this summer ron in their room she and arthur are staying in he paused in the master bedroom ginny and hermione are still rooming upstairs we haventdecided what to do with buckbeak yet he shifted in his chair and looked uncomfortably at the empty portrait the fact is harry we need to talk i just dontthink now such a good time harry put the half eaten chocolate bar on a small table next to his bed all i have is time remus his words were hollow then then you should know that the weasleys are only living here temporarily it arthur new position that puts him and his family at risk just a precaution really they were too exposed out at the burrow he paused again searching for words to say harry sirius has left the house to you there more than just the house we found the papers downstairs after he died essentially all he had all the black family had goes to you harry harry looked at the walls they were clean and looked freshly painted the carpet a light baby blue looked as if it had just been installed tears began to fill his eyes and he looked to the ceiling i dontwant it he whispered he didntwant it either lupin said kindly too many memories too many bad memories really but you have a chance to start some new ones harry maybe some good ones harry didntanswer the tears were falling back on his pillow well lupin said as he stood up you need to know it yours molly been waiting to get your permission to take care of a number of things one of those is buckbeak he walked over to the window the sun glowing off bright white curtains you also need to know that there more to the black estate other homes and of course an account at gringotts well not really an account more like a fortune i dontwant it harry yelled i dontwant any of it of course you don t harry no good soul wants to come into money like that but it yours it never about how much harry what you do with it how you use it and to what purpose that what makes the difference remus walked over and sat at harry bedside he took harry hand your father and sirius were my family they were closer than brothers i d be dead now if it werentfor the two of them before sirius died i made a promise in case something should happen to him i swore i d watch out for you and i will he squeezed harry hand tight and i swear to you now harry we will destroy those who took them away from us for a moment fire flashed in his eyes harry could make out the werewolf in lupin face but the look soon softened and the grip on harry hand relaxed there is much to discuss harry but not now now you need to rest if only for an hour he started out of the room ron and hermione have missed you terribly perhaps you could put on a face of reciprocation he paused for a moment looking down at his shoes cherish your time with your friends harry it is precious he choked and left the room harry turned on his side and cried the tears soaked his pillow and still he cried all the money in gringotts couldntbring them back all he would ever have was pictures he held his bandaged hand flat against the wet white sheet he needed her here he felt so terribly alone it hurt harry did not leave the room that morning it was not until mrs weasley came to the door that he lifted his head off the pillow harry dear she said you really must eat something i can bring it up if you d like to be alone i ll be down he called just give me a minute take all the time you need dear we re not going anywhere today he sat up at the side of his bed his hair was wet he felt miserable he walked over to the dresser where mrs weasley had set a basin of water and fresh towels on the wall was a mirror he looked at his reflection he not only felt miserable he looked it his face was puffy and his eyes swollen and red his wet hair hung down limp like the greasy strings dangling from snape scalp he took a towel and leaned over to dry his hair as best he could get a hold of yourself harry he thought he closed his eyes and tried to relax standing up with the towel over his face his hands were flat against his cheeks and his fingers gently pressed his eyes he took a long deep breath tossed the towel aside and reached for a brush in a hopeless attempt to set his hair straight when he looked back to the mirror he stood frozen the reflection looking him in the face was not there a minute ago the puffiness was gone the circles around his eyes were gone and he leaned closer the redness had disappeared that impossible he whispered he looked down at his two hands turning them over in front of him who are you he said out loud and then looking back at his reflection he said what are you he could hear his name being called from downstairs coming he yelled with his left hand he felt the bandages on his aching right arm he reached for his wand in his back pocket it wasntthere he glanced across the room and saw it lying on his bedside table it was some ten feet away not much more than it had been last year he held out his right hand the door to his room creaked open and at the very same instant he called lumos the wand burst into a brilliant white light it true said hermione standing at the door a slight look of surprise on her face behind her looking over her head stood ron his jaw hanging somewhere around his shoes bloody hell was all he mustered harry felt the fingers in his right hand begin to tingle he made a small fist and stretched his hand and the odd sensation disappeared he knew they were standing there but he wanted to try he raised his hand again and commanded accio wand nothing happened accio wand again nothing happened well not so spectacular is it he sighed and walked over to pick his wand up are you kidding ron exclaimed that was fantastic i mean well here he put his own wand on the bedside table he walked over to where harry stood held out his hand and called accio wand nothing accio wand nothing lumos again nothing hermione let out a great sigh ron glowered at her well let see you try then i not going to try she said i cantdo it i dontknow of anyone that can not like that i mean we all can do a little something without our wands right ron just looked at his shoes magic slips out usually when we re emotional or upset chants and incantations for charms or hexes require constant eye contact and tremendous concentration she looked at harry and shook her head and then repeated i dontknow anyone who can do it like that but i ll find out if there have been others when we get back to hogwarts the cogs of hermione mind began to turn it wontbe in any of our old books maybe i can look while we re at floursih and blotts buying supplies for a moment hermione was lost in concentration then shook her head and returned to the present let go harry you need to eat and besides you know better than to a sudden flame burst in the center of the room a note and a tail feather a phoenix tail feather harry grabbed the note harry as much as i admire your capabilities magic by students is forbidden outside of hogwarts with or without a wand and please be sure to remind mr weasley as well headmaster dumbledore he stared at the note dumbfounded but how he whispered how what mate ron took the note and read it blimey that impossible he half way around the world trying to recruit supporters he looked at hermione it from dumbledore he knows harry done magic he handed her the note she read it and shook her head well however he knows you re lucky dumbledore in charge again harry you could have been expelled she chastised ron rolled his eyes and that goes for you too you know she added i hungry was all harry could say let eat the three made their way down the stairs to the kitchen the smell of browning sausages and roasted potatoes filled the air well it about time mrs weasley scorned then turning to harry and directing him to a chair she asked consolingly are you feeling alright dear much better thanks mrs weasley filled their plates and they began to eat harry was famished it was the first time he could remember asking for a second plate before ron half way through he noticed where are the others remus and ginny remus had some work to take care of mrs weasley said and ginny visiting the thomas s the who he asked dean injected hermione she visiting dean and his family they re traveling up on the well on vacation is that safe harry asked exactly what i said harry ron jumped in traipsing off all over the country when you know who trying to kill us all oh ron mrs weasley scolded be quiet you know perfectly well mad eye with them and if he there nothing going to happen ron seemed to slump somewhat it just not ron hermione interrupted we ve been over this time and time again i know harry hasntheard it all but would you please wait until later so i donthave to hear it again for the two hundredth time ron just sat and sulked the afternoon was growing late harry had had his fill and was feeling somewhat tired again his head still didntseem to be on all the way straight he sat up off the bench and started to the door i sorry but i think i ll rest for a bit hey mate you dropped something ron reached to the floor and picked up a small white folded envelope harry heart skipped it had fallen from his back pocket oh yeah that mine harry walked briskly to snatch it from his hand just as ron was pulling the folded paper closer to his face my love he read out loud before harry had a chance to tear it from his hands harry quickly slipped it back into his pocket and began to walk to the door but before he made his escape ron queried my love what i dontknow just found it at st mungo s harry was grasping for ideas to cover his tracks found it ron asked again blankly well then let have a look might be kind of fun have you read it already he stood up and was walking toward harry when hermione stood up blocking his path come on ron she said you heard harry he tired let him rest yes ron mrs weasley added to harry defense leave the poor boy alone go on harry ron you can help wash these dishes and make sure they clean themselves properly this time she waved her wand and brushes began to soap the plates in the sink ron sighed and sulked over to the sink grabbing his wand and pointing it at a towel come on harry let me walk you to your room i alright really i know there just one thing i want to talk to you about as they were climbing the stairs she said you understand we re only here temporarily i know remus told me he replied yes of course and you know then that this all of this belongs to you harry nodded swallowing hard i ve tried to leave as much of sirius in the house as i could i wouldntpresume to know how you feel i can take it all down or leave it all up or anything in between just give the word harry it your house and we re grateful we can stay here you can have it he said with an empty voice i don t i don t he began to shake and mrs weasley reached out and held him tight in both arms i know dear i know we ll get through this together i promise you that but maybe you could promise me something she held him back and looked into his eyes donttry it on your own harry have faith in those around you those that love you and those that you love they ll bring you strength harry she let go and escorted him into his room rubbing his back she picked up the wet towel and scanned for anything else fred and george brought your trunk last night you have your broom and a few more items in the closet out in the hall they say they had help making sure you got all your things i guess it about time that uncle of yours started acting like a human being later i afraid we need to discuss two more items buckbeak and kreacher kreacher the hair on the back of harry neck rose instantly and he started for the door mrs weasley took his arm kreacher dead harry he came back to die we think he returned to fulfill his one true dream of being mounted with the other house elves in the hall arthur has him in a box upstairs we can t well it not for us to decide harry the film in harry mind began to play again kreacher betrayal harry folly sirius death he wouldnthave the head mounted in the hall to remind him everyday of how kreacher outsmarted him of how he stood there and lied to his face and how stupid harry had been for believing only because he wanted hermione to be wrong only because he wanted to be right to be the hero he began to shake again mrs weasley walked him back to his bed and sat down beside him i knew i should have waited but arthur wanted you to know the day you got home he said that each day i waited would make it more difficult oh harry i m i so sorry she began to cry holding him in her arms again i know you loved him we all did in our own way and now we all miss him so they sat there like that the two for some time finally mrs weasley stopped shedding tears and harry stopped shaking indeed his eyes were quite dry you need to rest dear we ll talk more later she stood up and made her way to the door when harry voice stopped her mrs weasley he called his voice was suddenly steady but cold as ice can you get the others off the wall the other house elves without turning to look at him she nodded i want them out of the house take kreacher and all the rest and get rid of them i dontcare if you give them a proper burial burn them or throw them in the dustbin i dontgive a damn i i never want to see a bloody house elf again to hell with them all her back still toward harry another tear began to streak down mrs weasley face yes dear she said calmly closing the door behind her harry potter and the burden of becoming chapter 16 the sword and the snake hermione bent low to help malfoy with the blisters that were growing worse on his face but crabbe and goyle pushed her aside they grabbed malfoy and trundled the unconscious blonde back to the slytherin carriages ron repaired the window with his wand while anthony tried to clean the splattered blood as best he could padma held her head in her hands sobbing harry had his arm around cho brother jim held his eyes unblinking at the spot he d last seen his sister harry looked to hermione where d they go he asked and who was that with cho st mungo s and that was a new healer mrs everett professor dumbledore thought it wise to bring in a few healers to help madame pomfrey this year she looked at anthony who was shaking so violently his spells were ineffective blood still soaked the carriage floor and his shirt i guess he was right to think things might be more dangerous let me see your hand he held it out to reveal the blisters that sprang from his wrist to his fingertips oozing clear liquid i really need a potion for this she said then holding out her wand she whispered a spell harry couldnthear the wand emitted a blue green glow just as had happened on the hospital ward his hand went cold the swelling went down and most all the blisters disappeared she held it in her own they could hear screaming down the corridor i ll get it ron sighed as he left the compartment anthony stood up with padma he was still shaking blood dripping from his hands i ve i ve got to tell the others what happened he said his jaw became rigid as he clenched his fist his eyes burned with fury whatever you did to malfoy harry he deserved it we ll have every slytherin head on a plate before tomorrow morning and as he stormed out of the compartment harry saw the fire begin to rise in padma eyes a moment later she plunged after anthony harry what happened hermione asked he looked to her eyes and then darted his own to jim and slowly shook his head but it was jim who spoke he he killed her he whispered that what happened no jim she ll be fine hermione comforted i know she will but the quiver in her voice revealed her uncertainty i ve seen plenty of snakes like him jim spat they re all the same blonde hair blue eyes and as creative as slugs hey slant eyes or yellow skin you yellow or or his lungs heaved well he the snake now isnthe harry you gave him the mark to prove it he shuddered and began to cry harry held him close the mark hermione whispered the train was slowing as it entered hogsmeade the shouts down the corridor were growing louder through the window harry could see in the darkness there was already a commotion starting among students leaving the train ron slid open the compartment door he looked as though he d been running at his side was professor flitwick this is her brother ron panted professor flitwick kneeled down looked jim over and then turned to harry is he okay he asked he afraid harry answered professor flitwick lifted jim to his feet come with me james he said kindly we donthave much time he escorted him out of the carriage harry looked at hermione what did that mean not much time he asked hermione was pale she wasntwell harry she she lost a lot of blood hermione voice began to quake oh harry i so sorry if she dies hermione began to tremble and ron put his arms around her holding her close she not going to die harry snapped standing to his feet a head injury like that is dangerous mate ron whispered looking pale himself we almost lost you this summer and you were wearing a helmet he continued to hold hermione in his arms as students gathered their gear to depart rumors spread like wildfire throughout the train one told how draco flanked by half a dozen slytherins had tried to kill cho because she was asian and before malfoy could finish her off harry came to her rescue another version had cho already dead at the slytherin end word came from crabbe and goyle draco had simply complimented cho and harry flew into a fit of jealous rage he pushed her nearly through the window and attacked draco without provocation ron hermione and harry remained in the compartment as the students filed off the train hagrid voice was heard calling for the first years to follow him a number of students were walking toward the horseless carriages harry could see the threstrals waiting to take them to hogwarts they seemed nervous one stretched its wings when harry noticed another surge in the crowd somebody yelled and suddenly the darkened streets erupted in a blaze of colored light students began firing jinxes and stunning spells into a group of slytherins who returned the fire he could see anthony goldstein leading the charge his shots werentvery effective harry thought but what he lacked in precision he made up for in quantity he was firing like a man possessed they tried to kill her i tell you he screamed and plunged into a sea of green followed by a dozen more ravenclaws i ve got to do something harry said standing to leave but ron grabbed his arm do what harry he asked shaking his head it madness out there but harry left hermione and ron in the compartment and entered into hogsmeade assisted by the lead engineer hagrid was still calling for the first years and they were now running for him trying to duck the wild spells a few hit hagrid on the back bouncing off with the thud of a winter snowball but they did raise his temper to their credit he and the engineer concentrated on the safety of the younger students harry ran over to help them get the first years in the boats and on their way a beam of red light shot from the crowd toward them harry flicked his wand and deflected it go on hagrid get them to the school he called i ll try to do something he looked back over his shoulder at the crowd with no clue as to what that something might be as soon as hagrid and the students were on their way the engineer ran to help a fifth year who had been stunned at the front of the train harry turned back to the onslaught screams rang out up and down the streets the regular townspeople of hogsmeade were ducking into the various shops just for cover other parents had brought their children to meet the train and take the carriages to hogwarts unaware of what had happened on the train they were completely dumfounded but when some students saw their own classmates being attacked they too joined the fray soon it was no longer just ravenclaw against slytherin others out to settle scores from years gone by began to try and get even before long students were firing at others they didnteven know just because they didntlike the way they looked harry saw ron and hermione emerge from the train they were yelling at the students to stop but few would listen hermione was knocking the wands out of student hands right and left but there were just too many ron seemed able to block the occasional spell that flew their way brilliant harry thought but not enough harry looked over at the threstrals they were becoming irritated by all the commotion threstrals he whispered quickly he ran to the front of the waiting carriages he raised his wand and cast a stunning spell into the ground before the lead carriage the creature reared and turned toward the fighting harry cast another and another one by one each creature turned toward the melee there was certainly the smell of blood in the air the threstrals were intrigued and now even more agitated finally harry conjured a patronus and charged it into the crowd firing on the threstrals at the same time the plan worked the horseless carriages plunged into the crowd following the stag the students intent at firing on one another realized that a hundred carriages were careening their way some were bowled over by the invisible creatures causing even more panic in the crowd the firing stopped and they scattered like mice in a matter of minutes professors from the school began to appear professor mcgonagall had her wand raised and was yelling at the gryffindors to gather to her professors snape and sprout did the same professor mcgonagall harry called professor flitwick he gone to st mungo with cho brother jim but a flash and a snap later revealed professor flitwick apparating among the ravenclaws this way he squeaked raising his wand no one dared disobey there were many students unable to answer the call to gather to their heads of house some lay on the ground unable to move others unable to see which way to go anthony goldstein ran to professor flitwick they tried to kill her he screamed the words echoed down the streets of hogsmeade covered in blood and inflicted with a jinx that had made one leg stiff as a board he pleaded his case again they tried to kill her harry could hear something more behind the words something much deeper anthony yelled professor flitwick stop this instant undaunted he turned and limped toward the group of slytherins he kept repeating they tried to kill her they tried to kill her he raised his wand petrificus totalus rang out it was professor flitwick immediately anthony went stiff and fell to the ground two other ravenclaw students ran to his side that is enough cried professor mcgonagall each house will walk back to hogwarts take the time to think about how foolish you ve all been and so what would later be called the hogsmeade march began the sky was dark and it began to rain large ruts of mud splattered students as they splashed through the puddles each house kept a wide berth between the other slytherins were at the head of the line ravenclaws at the rear malfoy was walking toward the end of the group of slytherins with crabbe and goyle at least it looked like malfoy his face was covered in gauze hermione and ron had joined harry at the head of the gryffindors harry eyes trained on malfoy as the rain splattered his glasses you were brilliant harry hermione said holding his arm ron at her side they d still be fighting if it werentfor you i dontknow replied harry you and ron were getting on pretty good he smiled back at them it looked like the slytherins were getting whipped pretty bad maybe we should have let them finish it the smile left his face he knew what it was anthony felt holding cho in his arms i hope she okay he whispered hermione squeezed tighter the glow of lit wands made for an eerie procession the trip which during happier times seemed to take ten minutes now was taking ten times longer students tried as best they could to help their hurt classmates walk toward the school ron stepped to the aid of katie bell who had been hit with a curse from a ravenclaw while they were arguing over quidditch heavy drops of rain splashed whitecaps on the lake as they passed by the air was silent save for the splatter of rain on the wet ground no one spoke as the rain seemed to drain their last bit of energy as they passed the whomping willow swaying in the evening breeze when they arrived at the front doors the groups began to compress there was a fuss and a bit of shoving when professor flitwick levitated above the crowd his flaming wand lit the grounds below if i see so much as one false move he squeaked you ll find yourself hanging from the seventh story by your ears everyone looked up to the top of the castle and the commotion instantly died down madame pomfrey and two other healers were waiting as they arrived if you re hurt come with me she yelled about three dozen students filed forward many more were injured but unwilling to go the sheer number of injuries stunned her absolute foolishness she quipped in all my years harper she cast a levitation spell on anthony guide goldstein to the hospital wing you there crabbe who is that crabbe looked up draco ma am he said dully well bring him here so mr malfoy what happened to you but there was no reply very well crabbe help him on his way the healers swept the injured students into the castle professor mcgonagall stood before the crowd if you think this is finished it is not she called professor dumbledore and the first years are waiting for you inside file in quietly or you ll have him to deal with slowly everyone made their way into the great hall the familiar house banners hung over the ends of each house table with so many in the hospital wing the hall seemed empty echoing the sound of every movement as students sat one could hear the sound of water dripping to the stone floor from their soaked robes professor mcgonagall walked over to the first years who though dry seemed absolutely petrified hagrid nodded to her as he took his seat at the head table harry caught dumbledore eyes for the first time they were grim were they blaming harry as the last students sat dumbledore rose to his feet today we mark only the second time in hogwarts history where house has turned on house in so violent a way at a time when it is more vital than ever that we should join together i fear voldemort may have already won there was a shudder in the crowd you must ask each of you if it is worth the price you have saved voldemort the effort by turning brother on brother and sister on sister how much easier it will be for him to take you to take your families your house name will mean nothing if he should gain control of this school and yet you seem eager enough to be done with it as he stood dumbledore shoulders slumped this year we have a new defense against the dark arts teacher an auror professor nymphadora tonks subdued applause greeted her warmly harry eyes darted to tonks he hadntnoticed earlier he was expecting to see a pink haired girl instead she wore black hair and looked every bit a woman her face was stern and cold he d never seen her look like that dumbledore continued tell me is it pointless that you should learn defense against the dark arts shall i send professor tonks home this year no harry called out professor dumbledore glanced his way shall we invite voldemort in for tea he pressed this time ron hermione and a few other students scattered throughout the hall joined in no shall we close the doors of hogwarts and be done with it now most of the students were standing no they yelled please dumbledore said holding his hands high take your seats he paused and then leaned toward the students below i shall ask this question only once dumbledore voice lowered the only other sound was the rhythmic drip of water on the castle floor to raise your wand in anger to turn on your own to hate those who would be your allies is it worth the price he commanded an answer but now the entire school stood even crabbe and goyle were caught up in the energy no they all cheered harry wondered if malfoy would have risen to his feet dumbledore straightened and a smile appeared upon his face he held his hands out and everyone sat this year he said we will face many challenges we will be stronger only if we can face them together he turned toward the large group of first years huddling behind professor mcgonagall this year the new class is one of the lartgest ever i fear that their future mentors have left them with a rather poor first impression i hope they will learn as i already know the great warmth and love you have for each other he sat down with a slight smile on his face professor mcgonagall placed a stool at the front of the hall the sorting hat sat motionless as if scanning the students before him then the tear in the rim opened and he began his song it was a melancholy tune long long ago four strangers met on a voyage from the sea of face and mind of heart and soul they were different as can be discovered they a common thread that would bind them to each other they d share their gifts with sorcerers guide as sister and as brother a wondrous thought said ravenclaw we will build a school to teach but where on earth asked hufflepuff is from muggles out of reach twas gryffindor who felled the land from the mountain to the falls and slytherin who found the gold used to build these very walls said he pureblood lines set the mark of the greatest whom shall enter but gryffindor was muggle born thus was sewn the seed of winter four strangers all became best friends merged talent in unity yet split the one school into four so that one might best the three in one was placed the diligent one took the brightest minds another took the brave at heart the last sought pureblood lines each one searched for the perfect path so to make their students best yet the greatest trait had sunk too low like a red sun in the west lost inside was love and friendship which bound them on ship at sea together they held then power bringing life and energy too soon the seed had grown it seemed of enmity and despair when stunning spells and curses too began flying through the air each alone without the other fought to stop the inner war but each alone had lost the trait which would bring us peace once more the greatest fight the age has seen saw the closest of them all turn wand on wand before the school twas then we began the fall slytherin fought his finest friend to prove that he was right though both his heart and hapless soul were screaming for the light gryffindor dropped his wand and turned but the serpent struck his back and thus was drawn the golden sword so to fend off the attack he raised the blade high in the air and there its head did hew and ignorance and enmity laid bare for all to view the friendship of the sword and snake was severed that dark day until it is renewed again to save us from the fray the battle rages on you see and reaps a bitter cost in you the challenge lies within to find the trait once lost if soon you dontfind unity within this grand estate the enemy will win unchecked and doom you to his fate there now you know all that been said for i ve warned you once before perhaps too late i truly feared as i saw you breech the door new students come and gird yourselves for the challenge deep within i ll send you to the proper house let the sorting now begin for the first time in harry memory the great hall was silent after the sorting hat song scanning the tables many were looking down at their plates or sheepishly at the house tables that stood to either side some looked to those they d considered friends just three months before but who they d blasted just hours earlier the hall was filled with a tremendous sense of shame and regret even harry mind turned to the hospital wing and draco malfoy with his thumb he rubbed his forearm dumbledore held out his hand toward the first years still standing to the side of the great hall their wide eyes were unblinking these students represent some of the brightest and bravest most cunning and diligent students ever to cross the gates of hogwarts they will be sorted as has been the custom but i hope that each of your houses will welcome them as part of the hogwarts family professor mcgonagall walked over to the sorting hat her steps reverberating against the walls in front of the school she held a very long parchment in front of her her glasses hung low on her nose as she read the list and called the first name the sorting hat placed spencer allistar in hufflepuff ron atwood in hufflepuff peter black in ravenclaw and rebecca brandt in gryffindor each one received cheers from their house and general applause from the rest of the school professor mcgonagall continued down the list without thinking chang james she called there was an uncomfortable silence in the room as the name echoed off the stone walls of the great hall immediately she realized her mistake and the blood drained from her face yes well there were murmurs in the hall let see then ravenclaw yelled padma patil from the ravenclaw table the ravenclaws burst into cheers and just as the clapping began to subside harry stood gryffindor he yelled and the gryffindor table howled and cheered hufflepuff called ernie macmillan and they too cheered there was the slightest pause when pansy parkinson stood up slytherin she called and the whole school erupted in an explosion of cheers somewhere in st mungo s james chang sat by the hospital bed of his sister not knowing that he had just been the first hogwarts student accepted into all four houses a small seed of spring planted on the1st of september that would grow into the ultimate defeat of the dark lord harry potter and the burden of becoming chapter 17 the metamorphmagus by the time harry and the others entered the gryffindor common room they were exhausted with the large number of new students the sorting lasted forever ron thought they would never eat and yet when meal time did come he mostly just sat with his eyes closed he was clearly not enjoying himself in the great hall harry thought it might be the voices again it was all ron could do as prefect to direct the first years into the gryffindor common room ron immediately fell into one of the large soft armchairs by the fire hermione was concerned ron she said you dontlook well at all you didnteat much of anything and that not like you she held his hand you re cold do you want to go to the hospital wing it ll be a madhouse in there he whispered i ll be fine it just a headache he turned to dean thomas hey dean would you get the first years straightened away sure thing ron dean smiled back take it easy dean stood and cupped his hands over his mouth okay first year boys he yelled quit gawking you ll have plenty of time to look around in a year or two now it time you get to bed follow me and the first year gryffindors stepped behind dean like new recruits at boot camp hermione sighed well ron i ll see you tomorrow and harry perhaps we can have a little talk tomorrow too okay harry nodded as she called to the first year girls they disappeared up the stairs to the girls dormitories after they had left the common room grew very quiet everyone was looking at their new special guest the result of one of the changes dumbledore was instituting this year an exchange program between the houses from each house was selected an individual to spend the term with a different house they would represent both the house they were visiting and the house they were from in loosing or winning house points if they participated in competitions like chess or quidditch they would represent the house they were visiting seamus finnigan of gryffindor had been sent to ravenclaw taylor watson of ravenclaw was sent to hufflepuff hannah abbott of hufflepuff was sent to slytherin remaining a prefect gregory goyle of slytherin fresh from the hospital wing after a rather sound round of jinxes by ravenclaw was now in the gryffindor common room all eyes were trained on him as he stood motionless and a bit pale looking into the fire finally harry spoke out breaking the uncomfortable silence ron do you know where he staying ron nodded but wouldntlook at harry finnegan bed harry sighed ron nodded again unhappy but not willing to be the reason for problems he turned to goyle okay goyle follow me you ll be sleeping in my room he started up the stairs to the boys dormitories goyle stayed planted on the spot look harry said your trunk will be up these stairs on your right i dontcare where you sleep i exhausted goyle was clearly distraught he scanned the room you re not going to make me sleep in the same room with potter are you he was looking for anyone who would come to his aid he ll he ll kill me look goyle nobody going to kill you ron said trying to calm him did you see what he did to draco did you see his face the blood was beginning to pool in goyle large feet clearly without his mentor he was at a loss they cantfix it madame pomfrey and all the others tried he ll kill me i tell you alright goyle ron stood up still shaky and casting a glance at harry who was at the top of the stairs waiting i ll keep an eye on him for you and ron pulled his wand out pointing it at harry no funny business eh mate he tried to say in as serious a voice as he could muster whatever harry shrugged rubbing his eyes within seconds of hitting the pillow harry was asleep whatever happened to goyle he didntknow and he didntcare when he woke the next morning goyle bed was empty in fact it barely looked slept in neville and dean had left and ron was just getting up harry stretched as the first sunrise in october splashed across the hogwarts grounds how are you doing ron harry asked better mate much better he rubbed his face with his hands it was bloody awful last night they werentvoices he whispered they were screams everybody smashed together it didntstart to settle down till everybody cheered for jim chang he yawned i going to the shower where goyle harry asked he was sitting on the edge of his bed staring at you when i fell asleep he was totally terrified ron shook his head half smiling i dontknow where he is this morning i wonder how seamus is doing well let get ready and ask him as the two departed through the portrait of the fat lady groomed and ready for the day hermione called from behind ron wait up she called she ran down the steps carrying two books with her the three continued down to the great hall harry she asked have you read the fifth chapter in advanced transfiguration hermione why do you ask questions you already know the answers to harry asked because she wants to tell you that she has said ron with a smile hermione looked cross for an instant then smiled back as they sat eating their breakfast they scanned the tables looking for the gryfindors that had transferred to the other houses seamus was just finishing at the ravenclaw table he looked a bit distraught as he walked by harry ron and hermione i goin to die he moaned what harry cried standing to his feet what did they do i feel like such an idiot and it only breakfast he plopped himself down next to ron do yeh know what they were doin this morning in their common room seamus asked and ron shrugged quizzin each other on facts from their books advanced eh somethin er other he stood i don think they re used teh ravenclaws losin points fer bein daft his shoulder slumped you re not daft seamus hermione snapped and dontlet them say you are you may be sleeping in ravenclaw but you re still a gryffindor dontforget what that means seamus straightened adjusting his robes right hermione he took a deep breath and off he went a bit taller than when he sat down harry watched as seamus left the hall then his eyes went to the head table tonks had arrived and was speaking with hagrid the night had softened her look and a smile was on both their faces harry sighed and looked down at his hands a voice started to whisper in his mind what wrong harry a picture of red eyes flashed in his mind and then harry hit ron on the leg with his fist ouch he yelped harry snapped hermione why did you it alright hermione ron interrupted rubbing his leg with one hand and his temple with the other boys hermione breathed exasperated well we better be off first class is in the dungeons and we ll be late if ron began to push eggs around on his plate oh sorry ron she whispered he too took a deep breath and exhaled it okay hermione you and harry have a good time in potions i ve got professor santos for muggle studies a smile began to appear on ron face give snape a kiss for me harry professor snape harry uttered back in his best dumbledore voice the three laughed hermione touched ron by the side of the face i ll see you at lunch okay ron she said with a warm smile he looked at her and then at harry hermione dropped her hand potions harry the two left ron still sliding his eggs from one side of his plate to the other the potions n e w t included students from all four houses from gryffindor dean had made it but neville had not there were only two from hufflepuff about seven from ravenclaw including marietta and eight from slytherin for the first time malfoy found himself in potions without crabbe or goyle his face was covered in bandages as he sat at the back of the room as far away from harry as he could manage only his right eye could be seen with a small slit for a mouth and nose the eye refused to look at his nemesis for the first time harry wasntthe one everyone was taking quick glances at indeed the class seemed intrigued with malfoy new look quite enjoying the moment harry decided to go over and speak with marietta is she okay he asked his voice tightening marietta slightly shrugged and then nodded i think so harry she held his hand they made me leave right away her lip began to quiver she was coming around when we brought her in though the nurse outside said that was a good sign just as i left she asked if you were okay the steel door to the dungeon burst open and slammed shut as professor snape strode in robes furled in his wake i understand that you expect some special privilege potter but remember that in this class you will receive none in the back draco sniggered and if you intend to stay in this n e w t i expect you to be ready for class before i walk through the door can you wrap your rather large head around that harry was already walking toward his seat when he looked back at snape the first thought in his mind was that the only person with a large head in this class was malfoy sitting in the corner covered in bandages yes sir he said with a pleasant voice sorry professor and harry sat back down next to hermione he was determined not to let snape goad him and he was successful indeed the more insults that snape cast harry way the more pitiful the man before him seemed for once harry was not so irritated at snape the man that he couldnthear snape the professor and except for stirring a bit too vigorously his portion was nearly perfect when the lesson was over each student poured a sample and handed it to their partner harry gave his to hermione and she to him in the back malfoy found himself alone the jailbreak potion as it was called was originally concocted to shrink you just long enough to squeeze through jail cell bars after which you would regain your normal size and run away padma sat next to marietta whose mind had clearly been on the events of the day before when padma took the potion only her head shrunk it reminded harry of one of the death eaters he had battled at the ministry of magic the one whose head was that of a baby most everyone laughed including marietta and after a few moments her head re grew to normal size professor snape stood over the two of them as humorous as you may find your failure ms edgecombe he hissed realize that three such failures in this class and you will be removed you now have one his words were ice do i make myself clear marietta glared at him who you need to remove sir is that beast in back she snapped she turned glowering at malfoy mr malfoy well let see he walked to the back of the room i see you have no partner mr malfoy very well take your own potion through his bandages malfoy sipped the liquid immediately his entire body began to shrink in unison as you can see ms edgecombe mr malfoy potion is once again there was a scream in the back of the room and then the crash of a cauldron two slytherins were backing away from malfoy harry watched the whole thing malfoy potion worked to perfection but when his body and head shrunk the bandages around his face fell to the floor the blistering harry remembered on the train had all but disappeared but as his head re grew the disfigurement became apparent to everybody a dagger wrapped with a snake hung like a teardrop from the corner of his left eye the blade plunging down his cheek and ending near his chin fruitlessly he tried to wrap the bandages about his face everyone including snape stared in horror class is dismissed he spluttered everyone stood in place gawking you heard me leave he shouted as harry started for the door snape cast him a glance from the corner of his eye yes professor it was me he thought leaving snape alone with malfoy who was holding his hand to his face trying to turn away as harry and hermione made their way up to the front doors of the castle she began the questions in the most subtle of ways so did you see malfoy face she asked looking down at her class schedule as if she hadntalready memorized it not too well harry replied he was on the other side of the room and all it the same mark he had last night on the train i d say interesting he said refusing to give an inch well it should give him a whole new appreciation for the word scarhead dontyou think interesting choice harry that it should be a snake it not a snake harry snapped a few students turned to look then went on about their business hermione continued to study her schedule he lowered his voice and said it more much more is it she asked innocently and in the sweetness of the question harry knew he d been hooked like a fat fish in the lake he pulled her aside out of the flow of students making their way in and out of the front doors you you re a sly one you are he said yes it more we can talk about it tonight i ve got class with hagrid now so it ll have to wait she stared at his face smiling glancing from eye to eye a sword and a snake appear on malfoy face hours before the sorting hat sings about them for the first time her smile turned to concern i i cantseem to tell this year harry she whispered are you okay he nodded but had to look away yes he whispered in reply and then louder but i wontbe if i late for class and neither will you if you miss arithmancy he left her looking at his back as he pushed open the front doors and made his way toward hagrid hut students had already gathered around the half giant near the paddock harry was surprised to see more than himself and ron indeed there were a number of students including an odd pair padma sister parvati and her friend lavender more stunning was the presence of crabbe and goyle even though goyle was now in gryffindor it was clear he was keeping the old alliance it the only n e w t they passed ron whispered in harry ear i ve got em in muggle studies too he sighed dejectedly in front of hagrid was a low table and on the table were three small boxes please dontlet them be dangerous harry thought to himself gather roun gather roun hagrid called to them all nobody moved come on they won bite he coaxed happily slowly harry and ron stepped forward wha we ave ere is one of the rares magical creatures there is he opened one of the boxes and gently lifted a tiny black furry creature into his massive hand around it neck was a small silver collar a molamar harry gasped hagrid had to do a double take when he heard harry utter the words why righ yeh are harry five points fer gryffindor parvati and lavender were now coming forward ooh ing and ah ing lavender reached to pet the creature shiny fur but hagrid pulled it away not too fas there ms brown he cautioned they may look pretty an cuddly an there the problem the molamar is famous fer two things firs when it dormant like yeh see here they don eat ner drink nothin a little warmth an they ll survive fer years second they re one of the greatest minin creatures on earth they re responsible for the london undergroun the great diamon mines in south africa an the early coal mines in the states his face turned grim problem is they re also responsible for the great sahara desert hagrid ron asked how can this little thing be responsible for anything more than diggin up my mum roses everyone laughed the idea that the little creature dwarfed in hagrid hand could do much of anything seemed absurd when the molamar leaves the dormant state it begins ter grow ron as quickly as it can eat dirt it grows bigger a full grown molamar is about the size of a large whale an no bit o magic ill shrink em down once they re full grown they cantstop eatin it as if they re makin up fer all the years they fasted they tear through rock an stone an grind it teh dust tryin teh find any organic material they can if a niffler looks fer treasure the molamar looks fer carbon coal diamonds and oil an when that gone plants animals and people unchecked these three full grown would turn the forbidden forest inteh a dust bowl in abou a month should they even be here then asked crabbe arentthey dangerous hagrid shook his head well a lot of em have been killed through the years there are maybe a hundred left on earth misunderstood is wha they are harry and ron looked at each other raising their eyebrows see here hagrid said rubbing the tip of one finger on the molamar silver collar the collar cantbe removed an as long it around the critter neck it cantgrow hagrid continued on with a lesson harry thought even hermione would enjoy with the cautionary note to stay away from the creature collar each of them was allowed to hold the soft furry creatures it was amazing how well things went without malfoy there to ruin everything before long it was time for lunch as the rest of the class headed back to the castle ron and harry stayed behind and helped hagrid put the molamars back in their boxes i see you re looking well harry noted to hagrid is grawpy gone then nah he still in there got imself a nice place now really tha where these buggers came in used one teh make him a nice cave near aragog aragog ron screeched yeah well i know yeh had a bad run in with him and all but i ve talked to him about tha and he said he sorry didn know yeh and all besides he and grawpy they ve become kinda friends yeh see friends ron squeaked well he was lonely i didn have a chance teh get him a partner yet i was gonna go back this summer but didn have the time good thing is the centaurs are leavin him alone now they won go near aragog and his family no harry said i bet they won t he handed hagrid the last small box containing a molamar well hagrid a brilliant lesson really but where the big one ah tha one well i had him shipped off teh china big dam they re buildin harry shook his head and just smiled come on ron we better be getting on hagrid held harry by the shoulder harry wha you did las night helpin the kids that was somethin somethin special that was it makes me proud teh see what kind of man yer becomin the words were still echoing in harry ears when he sat down for lunch with ron and hermione in the great hall again he found his thumb rubbing the smooth flesh of his right forearm what kind of man am i becoming he whispered well malfoy came in late to my arithmancy class hermione said the bandages were back a few seats down goyle was eating and actually carrying on a conversation with dean thomas about muggle soccer the three of them slid that way hey goyle ron called under his breath what up with the bandages goyle simply took another mouthful saying nothing ron turned to harry i heard malfoy face was melted and that his brains have started to ooze out of his left ear they have not goyle snapped hermione picked up where ron left off someone from potions told me that he has the mark of a death eater on his face it not the mark of the dark l he stopped himself what what is it then she pressed goyle looked to harry ask him he put it there for a moment goyle paused they still cantget it off potter snape going to mcgonagall and she ll make you remove it harry looked at goyle his green eyes were hard and his face set like stone i can t he said there only one person in this castle who can instinctively everyone glanced to the head table dumbledore sat lunching with tonks they were both smiling about something harry shook his head if we re lucky the day will come when you ll understand he took another drink and left his seat ron stood as well hey ron dean called where ginny it was as if someone had just thrown gasoline on a lit birthday cake ron eyes instantly flamed do i look like her keeper he snapped hey no big deal i just thought you just thought what that you could have your way with my sister harry grabbed ron by the arm come on ron let go he began to pull him out of the great hall well you can t ron called back i ll make sure of that they made it to the corridor what up with you ron harry asked you feeling okay i fine ron snapped again but to harry he looked tired they walked silently toward the common room finally ron broke the silence she loves him can you believe it well i had an idea that she might no i ve seen it in her well you know she is starry eyed in love i dontknow ron harry spoke as they started up the moving staircases for what it worth i think dean loves ginny too they stepped off on their floor took a few steps and then ron nodded he does he spoke emphatically well then said harry wondering if he should tell ginny that really is excellent isntit ron stopped grabbed harry by the robes and darted his eyes up and down the corridor to the fat lady no it not excellent it bloody terrible is what it is what if what if what if what ron he s well he black harry ron whispered as if saying the dark lord name himself harry was confused of course he was black they love each other harry it not just some kind of fling this might actually last what if they want to get married harry was starting to take up where ron was going and he didntlike it and if they did he asked slowly well they might have children ron explained as if it seemed so obvious yes they d be they d be half breeds harry he breathed half breeds did his best friend just say what he thought he said he could feel the temper rising from the pit of his stomach but he felt cold i see half breeds i guess that would make you the uncle of a half breed wouldntit he could see by ron eyes that ron wanted to take the words back but he couldntcould he they were out on the table now now harry knew why he d been so angry about ginny and dean it wasntjust that he was dating his sister it was because he was serious about her and she about him and the problem with that he was black what that make me then ron or seamus it doesntbother you that dean a mudblood that that different he sputtered why because i white and he black harry grabbed ron robes this time and spun him to the wall hidden behind a suit of armor what if i wasn t ron what if i was a half breed and as he held ron tight against the wall his eyes began to turn brown and his skin began to darken could i still be your friend if i looked like this ron ron stared horror struck could i he yelled you you re a how the green returned to harry eyes as he released ron from his grasp as if disgusted from the touch none of your damn business he spat we re through do you hear me harry straightened his robes i wouldntwant to dirty your pure blood doormat ron it far too white for my filthy shoes and he turned and walked away leaving ron gawking against the wall harry potter and the burden of becoming chapter 40 the marauder eye hours slipped by as harry aimlessly wandered the halls of hogwarts ever alert to avoid peeves mr filtch and his cat mrs norris his mind floated between fear over what was happening to him guilt over what he d done to his friends and anger over what his friends had done to him he had nearly killed seamus and not knowing why he was still shaking an echo of the rage he felt when his mind was turned to destruction if he were to see mrs norris right now her dust coloured fur would likely become just that dust since neville and luna disappearance students were already avoiding him as if he were once again the heir of slytherin how much more isolated would he be if they thought him capable of murdering his own housemate and his friends his friends were up to something hermione said that ron didntknow but harry was sure the two of them were both working for the order behind his back that must be it otherwise why were they always stopping their conversation when he would come to join them why would they suddenly part from each other when he walked into the room they were planning something together completely unwilling to let him know what was it he went to slug the wall but stopped himself short still the stone popped and a puff of dust covered his hand harry clenched his fist tighter shaking it in front of his face every emotion imaginable was surging through his body and with each passing moment the need to get back to gabriella and ensure her safety grew stronger and stronger slowly he convinced himself that it was utterly pointless to remain at hogwarts he had no hope of uniting the houses even with malfoy help an alliance with a snake that was more likely to strike with fangs as coil in friendship once passing by the circular staircase to the headmaster office he considered using the password that professor dumbledore had given him but the fear of what he would find there turned him away the headmaster was now struggling for his life because he chose to expend his magical energy to save harry the young wizard mind played the film of his spirit being captured by the green flame no there was nothing left for harry here and everything waiting for him on privet drive it was so perfectly obvious when he fully committed himself to leave hogwarts forever it was well past curfew when he hastily began to outline his strategy to return home to the girl he loved his first step would be to run for hogsmeade from there he would take the knight bus to diagon alley and from there well he d figure it out along the way harry quickly made his way to the entrance hall and slipped through the front doors of the castle instantly he realized his mistake it was snowing once again the small flakes gently drifted to the ground and though there was no wind it was bitterly cold he had no cloak or covering of any kind but the very thought of stopping now to return to gryffindor tower was anathema he could get his things later but trying to escape hogwarts and make his way back to little whinging in this cold with not but a wand was insanity remembering back to the tri wizard tournament he quickly ran to the bottom of the steps and held out his hand he would fly accio c caduceus he called out shivering on his broom he would stay warm on his broom he would quickly return to her thoughts of gabriella swept into his mind and the sudden exhilaration that he would soon be leaving quickened his pulse shaking miserably in the cold he scanned the skyline searching for his broom he saw nothing so reached for his wand to call for it once again as he slipped the wand out an object caught his eye from the north a darkness was approaching fast f finally he whispered through chattering teeth staring through the snow however he realized that the object heading his way was too big for a broom indeed as it sped closer the outline of a man sized figure became visible he turned facing the attacker and hand shaking held his wand high as the dark outline bore down on him harry was ready to cast a spell when about ten feet in front of him the broom stopped short and through the snow the figure came into view well that twice i ve had your wand in my face it starting to get a bit annoying really in a heavy black cloak untouched by the falling snow because he was flying on harry caduceus sat remus lupin you know harry if i had enough galleons i think this would be my next major purchase remus patted the broom shaft that or a nice set of robes maybe you d give me a turn to fly her on my own sometime harry furled his eyes looking for someone else he scanned the skyline for a hint that this was some sore of ambush but only the sprinkling snow could be seen and only the sound of harry teeth and lupin voice could be heard your father of course was the famous chaser of gryffindor but i wasnthalf bad on a broom for a werewolf remus swung his left leg off the broom and landed both feet into the soft snow still holding tight to the broom with his hand he waited harry at first was relieved his mind had any number of horrible creatures plummeting toward him out of the darkness but for some reason he continued to hold his wand up high still remus continued to smile completely unconcerned about his clearly disadvantaged position but how harry asked there no way oh i think there is harry said remus stepping ever so slightly closer seamus has been in hospital for hours now and when you didntshow up in the common room i figured you d try to run i didntdo it on purpose harry snapped he shot at me first hold on harry take a breath said remus calmly nobody saying you did anything wrong well not too wrong seamus is going to be fine try to relax then w why are you here asked harry suddenly realizing he was frightfully cold like i said i figured you d bolt and the best way for you to do that is right here in my hand excellent j job sh sherlock harry stammered slipping his wand back into his sleeve n now let me have my b broom and i ll be on my way this time harry took a step forward in less time than a blink remus effortlessly slipped out his wand and held it on harry i afraid i cantdo that harry he said continuing to maintain an affable smile sorry for this he nodded at his wand but i canthave you waving your hand at me and knocking me away now can i harry eyes narrowed and a sense of rage began to build inside once again yes that exactly the look harry said remus the smile flickering from his face and that look doesntbelong to you it voldemort i believe and i thought we might have a go and try to remove it harry was confused and angry but he wasntyet foolish enough to raise a finger let alone a wand not on remus you re c crazy harry cried voldemort has n nothing to do with this now let go harry stepped closer reaching for his broom and in the same instant remus flicked his wand instantly harry feet froze into place as if they were stuck to the ground with glue sorry about that remus said calmly you do look cold harry and your broom here is keeping me quite warm with just my touch i ll tell you what let make a deal if you promise no funny business you can touch your broom and we can talk out here or we can go back into the castle harry hesitated there was no way he d return to the castle wait for an opportunity he thought to himself and he nodded his head in agreement i p promise he stammered remus stepped closer and let harry take hold of the broom tip immediately harry was filled with warmth and the droplets of ice on his glasses began to melt thanks he whispered reluctantly sorry no hot chocolate but i have something better remus began to grin again i ve been looking for you all day harry there someone who wants to talk to you but i not sure that in the state you re in you can be civil harry glanced around the bottom of the steps he still couldntmove his feet and an uneasy feeling began to gurgle within his stomach he glanced once again to the sky remus had just mentioned voldemort and the thought brought harry hand close to his wand harry remus chided please put your hand down unwillingly harry obliged you re in no danger harry but i do need to know you re in the right frame of mind just take a moment and clear your thoughts remus voice was calm and even and harry pulse began to slow if someone or something were trying to penetrate his mind remus was right occlumency would wipe it clean but to do that harry would have to clear his mind of the here and now he would forget the moment exposing himself completely to attack how do i know you re remus he asked because i know about the scar on your forearm i know what you saw above the pitch as dumbledore spent himself to bring your life force back i know i know that if i were to drop my wand right now you d take this broom and fly home to gabriella hearing her name harry smiled and a warmth swept away the chill in his bones and then without saying another word he closed his eyes and let each thought drift away the argument with hermione the fight with seamus the thought of dumbledore dying in his study the fear of remus standing before him everything slipped from his mind into nothingness his eyes still closed he heard remus voice as if in a distant dream okay you can show yourself slowly harry opened his eyes and awoke anew the fear guilt and anger had washed away then he saw sitting sidesaddle on the caduceus a familiar face dobby his eyes were wide and worried glancing from side to side searching to see if someone or something might be coming through the whiteness of the snow dobby cried harry with a sudden burst of joy he tried to take a step and realized too late his feet wouldntmove and toppled over releasing the broom a cold blast of air sent shivers down his spine he dusted off the snow and tried to stand when he couldn t remus released the spell without saying a word but still kept his wand at the ready harry stood took the broom tip and the warmth returned harry potter sir dobby said eagerly bowing on the broom as best he could it is good to see the great harry potter still alive the house elf face was sallow and his body thin perhaps not worse than when harry had seen him last but certainly no better on his right arm was a filthy wrap a bandage of some sort again dobby bent his head low dobby has failed sir remus we need to get him inside harry pleaded with concern he needs he needs to talk to you harry remus cut in and you need to listen as dobby had done remus glanced into the falling snow where visibility was only a few feet but you re right this is no place for discussion we need shelter and i think i know just the place remus threw his leg over the broom jump on then harry hesitated no harry i wonttake you back i promise finally harry mounted the broom behind remus and the three were flying toward the castle tower harry remembered meeting ron brother charlie at the tower top handing him norbert hagrid pet dragon but the three didntfly to the castle top instead they stopped against the tower wall some fifteen feet down from the top there were no windows only stone remus glared intently through the snow before harry could ask what he was doing remus called out there it is he said excitedly remus pointed at a small red stone no larger than a galleon hidden among the large gray rough hewn block of the castle walls he pulled his wand and whispered it well past midnight we swear it true open up and let us through the red stone began to grow larger as were the large rocks surrounding it the castle was becoming enormous then harry realized that the stones werentgrowing they were shrinking soon a large red cavern was before them you might want to close your eyes for this suggested remus with a grin the broom plunged forward and it felt as if they were passing though the center of a large watermelon there was a tearing slurping sensation and they emerged on the other side into a large circular room pillows in gryffindor colors scattered the floor interspersed with dusty glass bottles that harry was sure were meant to hold something stronger than butterbeer on the walls hung old posters of quidditch teams there were four chairs facing a large open area against the wall was a desk strewn with parchment and to the far side two cots one bare and the other covered with a torn red and gold comforter the three dismounted the broom for a moment harry gawked as remus set the broom to the side of what now looked like a large red curtain instinctively dobby began picking up the pillows and vanishing the empty bottles where are we harry asked remus smiled looking around the room 1977 he breathed in the marauder eye we d sneak up here after midnight to watch replays of monday quidditch matches from here we watched the cannons lose to the magpies the kestrels lose to well everybody pettigrew was the cannons fan donttell ron said harry sourly looking at an old poster of the broadmoor brothers flying for the falcons now i know why scabbers always sat in ron lap when he d read about the cannons remus walked over to the four chairs and tapped his wand on a short black pillar in the open area appeared an exact replica of a quidditch match the tornados were playing the wanderers harry had never seen anything quite like this before it was as if they were actually sitting in the stands one of the tornado chasers scored and the entire room exploded with cheers rumbling the very floor that game was last week harry gawked remus tapped the pillar again a different match appeared terrence tellman was flying for the montrose magpies that was today harry exclaimed tellman spun his broom in a loop that harry had never seen before damn he brilliant admired harry you can watch the games live too but they re usually over by this time of night remus looked at dobby who was now straightening the papers on the desk dobby please stop and rest we have much to talk about remus tapped the pillar and the figures disappeared harry turned to get dobby when a photo in a gold frame caught his eye a young woman with brilliant green eyes and wearing red robes smiled back behind her were two kids with scruffy hair that harry remembered seeing from his visit into snape memory he picked the photograph from off the desk and stared not saying a word slowly still holding the frame he sat down upon one of the pillows lying on the floor remus sat down beside him merlin we were young remus whispered peter took this picture on one of our hogsmeade outings it was the first time lilly said yes to james and he was beside himself on what to do you ll never find another picture of him wearing a tie the two wizards laughed it was the only time i ever saw james nervous about anything except when you were born remus smiled broadly and ruffled harry hair but that another story he said with a grin dobby it time you tell harry what you told me the house elf turned the stack of papers so that its edge aligned perfectly with the edge of the desk when he turned to look at harry and remus side by side on the floor his eyes were full of apprehension slowly he approached harry not looking at him but around him then he stopped and bowed low dobby has failed harry potter sir he spoke in a high soft voice there is no cure dobby reached out his hand and held it just off of harry shoulder and then he shuddered yes professor lupin sir it has grown stronger i dontunderstand harry said exasperated you look at me like i going to die it a protection charm how can that be bad dobby looked up as if to speak but then burst out crying grabbing a pillow and blowing his nose yes harry remus said in a level voice it is a protection charm but there are two things at work here first the charm was not meant for you from what dobby has told me it was meant for a muggle but why would wizards cast protection charms on muggles harry asked not for the altruistic reasons you might think harry remus sighed during the middle ages many of the kings of the time were wizards or had wizards as their councilors when they would go into battle the wizard would place a charm on his troops hoping that they might live to fight another day countless soldiers of the ottoman empire were given the charm and plunged into battle believing they were invincible more often than not they lost their lives in attempts at misguided valor their wizengamot at the time decided that such spells violated their code of ethics and banned the charms in the early thirteenth century other wizengamots around the world soon adopted similar restrictions of course the use of such spells went underground often being placed on muggle assassins by various dark wizards through the ages they were also used on muggle bodyguards to act as a first expendable line of defense to protect valuables or family members still seated at harry side remus paused considering his words carefully harry on wizards or witches these dark charms dontwork properly they become confused about what they want to protect about what is valuable to them and soon see threats everywhere often they cause the wizard to believe that all living things are adversaries attackers that must be slain inappropriately charmed wizards were known to turn on their own troops in battle slaughtering thousands seamus harry whispered it possible that last year voldemort placed the charm on you hoping that you would turn on your own friends at hogwarts or perhaps even professor dumbledore which brings me to the second bit of magic at play the charm is getting stronger i believe it grows so with each visit you have with voldemort until now your own positive energy has fought off its effects but the darkness of voldemort soul is somehow seeping in and making you more vulnerable he knows this harry he must remus tried to speak with confidence but his words were mixed with uncertainty an uncertainty that did not pass harry notice harry turned his wrist over and examined the soft skin of his forearm his pulse began to quicken and he shook his head somehow this didntmake sense he stood and backed away from remus and dobby so you think i mad and going to kill everybody at hogwarts said harry growing angry again is that it well is it it s it not me that mad remus you are remus stood shaking his own head harry you dontunderstand he said calmly walking closer to harry stay away from me harry shouted holding up his hand a faint blue light shot from his palm and struck remus in the chest knocking him to the ground stop harry potter sir stop dobby cried out you mustntharm your friends remus rose to one knee and took in a deep breath harry he breathed again your new powers they might be part of it i dontknow but we need to find out we need to see if we can have it removed at his words dobby looked away and harry caught the glance his eyes narrowed you can t dobby already said there no cure you cantremove the charm can you remus we have to try harry before before we lose you at these words harry began to tremble again he had been ready to die but not like this not mad locked up in st mungo with gilderoy lockhart still holding his hand toward remus harry turned to the house elf dobby who did this to me harry yelled but the house elf simply dropped his head and sighed dobby dobby has been many places the house elf began with a weak and dejected voice dobby has spoken to many friends and many enemies he said glancing down at the bandage on his right arm all who heard of the great harry potter spoke freely dobby walked toward harry again looking all about the young wizard as if examining something just inches from his skin holding out his hand he narrowed his eyes dobby was right harry potter sir this charm is a dark charm and it is from far away dobby listens and now dobby knows the great dark lord pravus taught it from his castle west of the caspian sea centuries ago those who followed the ways of pravus were killed in the great purge the same time the great wizard dumbledore defeated grindelwald the handful of remaining survivors are scattered across the globe dobby has failed harry potter all dobby knows is that no wand can cast the spell the wizard must be touched to make the mark that information might be enough to help us remove it dobby remus declared excitedly but then his face fell if dumbledore were well i wontbe sent to the mental ward harry yelled i going home accio caduceus the broom flew into harry hand i going home he whispered are you really that selfish harry remus said flatly but harry ignored him and mounted his broom i thought you loved her at these words harry stopped and glared at remus you nearly killed seamus tonight harry what happens when she grabs your arm and you re not suspecting it what happens if she laughingly surprises you around a corner seamus lived because he a wizard harry a muggle girl wouldnthave a chance harry began to breathe rapidly glancing at the red curtain leading to escape when he reached up and adjusted his glasses remus seemed to relax and sat back to the floor what harry searched for the words what about malfoy i gave him the mark and i think it working the same way i know harry remus replied coldly his voice a bit tight we re watching him harry furled his brow watching him he asked bit of a twist dontyou think remus said grimly and the look turned harry stomach voldemort curses you in hopes that you ll attack your own only to find the son of one of his own death eaters cursed with the same magic remus face turned dark with luck little master malfoy will meet up with his father and the two will play a visit to auntie bellatrix it is christmas after all i dontsuppose it much matters who wins remus stood looking at the photo on the table for the last couple days we ve had a house elf following him just to make sure no accidents occur on school grounds remus you can t harry exclaimed professor dumbledore would never in case you haventnoticed harry dumbledore is a bit indisposed remus interrupted as he took to his feet you of all people know what kind of wizards the malfoy are ginny hermione and countless others would be dead if their dark hearts had their way his voice was cool almost icy cedric is dead sirius is dead how many more need to die draco didnthave anything to do with that it was his father i think we both know better dontyou harry mind began to race it was all too much to take in at one time one thing was certain he wouldntput gabriella life at risk again he jumped off his broom and looked at the eyes staring back at him werewolf eyes he needed time to think but not here not now for the first time he felt that it was all beyond him somehow spinning out of control threads of thoughts he couldntbring together he needed he needed hermione the last person harry thought he would ever be willing to talk to and the last person who would be willing to talk to him still he had to try i ll go to hospital tonight for a check but that it no removal i have exams in the morning if you can have a house elf following malfoy you can have one follow me harry said calmly remus looked at dobby and then to harry there no point trying to remove something that cantbe removed if i destined to go mad so be it remus shook his head no harry we canttake the risk we have to harry jumped back on his broom and pointed toward the red curtain okay remus yelled but dobby cantfollow you he needs to rest no not dobby harry agreed quietly the three made their way to the hospital wing where not surprisingly madame pomfrey was waiting seamus was sleeping in the bed by the door and the healer ushered harry down to the far end of the room pulling a curtain around him once harry was in bed remus turned to leave harry he said you should know that hermione wants to tell you everything about her recent activities but i ve asked her not to your link to voldemort is too strong and there are some things better left unknown dontblame your friends harry blame me come on dobby we need to have you looked at as well remus slipped out behind the curtain alone harry simply looked up at the ceiling the room was quiet and warm as he listened to their steps fade off into nothingness if it was voldemort behind this curse harry wasntgoing to give him a second chance he shut his eyes and began to empty his mind soon he was asleep when he awoke the curtains had been pulled open the room was bright and standing at his bedside was hermione granger her brown hair hung about her shoulders and she wore an insecure smile hello sleepyhead she whispered and reached down to hold harry hand how are you feeling harry blinked his eyes adjusting to the light and he tried to smile back fine what are you smiling about when you didntreturn last night i thought for sure you d left i should have known you would come here to see what was wrong if i d have stayed with seamus longer i would have seen you but i wanted to get back to gryffindor to see if you were okay seamus harry said excitedly how is he passed me defense against the dark arts exam i did shame yeh missed it standing from a seat at the foot of harry bed seamus walked over to harry side doesntlook too cursed if yeh ask me hermione harry wasntsure what to say remus thought we should know about your problem hermione said tentatively and yes you ve slept through till lunch he said he was passing you on merit and that it would be best if you could rest harry sat up picked his glasses from off the table and slipped them on seamus i i that the mark then seamus interrupted with a bit of excitement in his voice harry in a hospital gown looked down at his exposed arm there on his forearm was the snake and sword raised and red madame pomfrey tried everything to remove it hermione said i afraid well it just gotten worse i told them said harry through gritted teeth but then he took a deep breath yes seamus harry answered with a solid voice that the mark i doubt most folks would understand dean says it tibetan seamus replied not really paying much attention to what harry was saying harry started to speak but seamus interrupted look harry we had a pretty bad go of it last year and this year wasntmuch better but i ll be damned if i let voldemort decide who me friend and who isn t seamus held out his hand smiling and harry took it seamus started for the door whistling a muggle tune harry remembered from the summer the steel chords harry asked yeah seamus answered with a bit of surprise saw em in dublin over the summer even got the t shirt then he shook his head and rolled his eyes me da insisted he come it was still great until someone let off a bomb at a nearby muggle police station he shrugged his shoulders shook his head and walked through the door i hate bombs said harry putting his head back down on his pillow there was an uncomfortable moment of silence as hermione stood at harry bedside listen the two spoke simultaneously you go harry smiled no you hermione answered if you want to tell me to bugger off i ll understand began harry looking down at his hands hermione said nothing but i well i need you i cantdo this by myself if what they say is right if i start to go mad i gabriella he lost his voice and his eyes began to glisten shh hermione whispered taking his hand we need each other harry she cast a glance at the door and bit her lower lip harry you said no secrets and i ve kept the truth from you for far too long i cantdo it anymore it time you knew that i ve been no hermione harry interrupted i dontwant to know i dontthink remus is right but if he is if voldemort reading my thoughts i cantknow hermione tried to speak again but harry held up his hand and she nodded you know i d trust you with my life right he asked and she smiled back but harry face turned grim and he looked to the ceiling i would have killed him hermione i wanted to kill him if it happens again you ve got to take me down well we ve taken some steps to make sure that it doesnthappen again a house elf asked harry casting his eyes around the room a house elf wontstop me anymore you know that better hermione answered madame pomfrey couldntremove the charm but she placed a blocking spell that will help if your mind turns to rage you ll start whistling like seamus harry asked no hermione laughed he whistles much better than you ever could just then ron entered the room hey mate he said with a bright smile heard you might be up for lunch grinning the whole way he walked over to harry side then glanced to hermione has he started whistling yet no said hermione smiling back not yet what does everybody know harry exclaimed well said ron by lunch they will sort of a hogwarts early warning system remus figures you start whistling and we all duck for cover at first harry was exasperated but then a sly smile began to cross his face this could be fun he said looking at ron over the top of his glasses and whistling a few notes that would not be appropriate harry potter hermione scowled ron just rolled his eyes besides it lunchtime you need to eat and then take your charms exam so there isntmuch time charms harry gulped we also i think have a few things we need to discuss said ron as he gathered harry clothes yes harry agreed it time we pulled our heads together i know he only looking out for me and all but i think remus is wrong i d know if this was voldemort at least i think i would harry sat up on the edge of his bed i need your help that what we re here for mate ron said with a smile that what we re here for harry potter and the burden of becoming chapter 73 the burden of becoming x x x x the cloudy skies and warm weather combined together and made an already weary harry even more bleary eyed the rhythmic click clack clackety clak click clack clackety clak rolled in and out of harry senses her body was warm pressed firmly against his and his head slid over against the wall of the newly remodeled hogwarts express just for a moment he thought and closed his eyes it was warm and the grass made his bare back itch the sun was bright in his eyes and as he pulled his hand up to shield his view she grabbed him by the wrist she sat on his hips and pushed both wrists against the soft earth blinding him in the sunlight he could feel her long hair tickle his sides as she lowered her face to kiss his lips when she grew close she blocked the sun and harry opened his eyes looking back into his were two twinkling black pools that bore mischief in their gleam she kissed him gently at first and then pressed down more firmly letting go of his wrists and drawing her arms around his neck pulling him close her warm breath blew across his left ear and nibbled around the caduceus that matched the one hanging from her own ear her perfume filled his senses and he reached up and held her tight he could feel the rhythmic pounding of her heart next to his racing with excitement with anticipation with a grand sweeping motion they rolled in the grass and harry now looked down into her eyes she was smiling and he tried to imagine a more beautiful sight in the universe but found nothing to compare he could feel her tremble slightly beneath him as if the very earth were undulating rocking rhythmically back and forth but then the rumbling grew to a roar the earth was shaking beneath them both and harry turned to see dozens of centaurs pouring out of the nearby forest as the centaurs charged forth seemingly oblivious to the students presence gabriella screamed and harry dropped to shield her as best he could expecting to be trampled at any minute the ground shook violently and the roar grew more deafening when suddenly it stopped a blue jay cackled in the distance its voice echoing off the silence harry looked up they were all around to the side in front and behind centaurs in every direction harry potter said a voice directly overhead harry turned to see a centaur with bright red hair looking directly at him his eyes were sad his voice familiar it was ronan yes asked harry as he sat up releasing gabriella from his protective grasp next to ronan stood magorian the leader of the centaurs filthy beasts hissed gabriella quietly in harry ear he noticed magorian narrow his eyes but if the centaur heard her words he paid them no heed harry potter said magorian with a very slow methodical voice it is time now sputtered harry but i busy i was just it is time said ronan urgently it time said another voice harry it time harry blinked his eyes and realized the train had stopped everyone was pulling down their trunks and bidding farewell to their mates down the corridors he blinked again and awkwardly began to stand up gabriella looked down at him and smiled were your dreaming of me she asked with a twinkle in her eyes that mirrored the expression that was just in harry mind he smiled back and stood at her side you are all i ever dream of he said and kissed her on the lips oh please groaned ron rolling his eyes can you be any more corny just because you couldntrub two romantic sentences together if you tried snapped hermione is no reason to jump over harry i can too rub two sentence thingies ron sputtered together hermione just shook her head p lease she said with the faintest hint of a smile hermione gathered her things and tried to smooth out her bushy hair well she gave harry and gabriella hugs now that everyone can apparate we can visit each other more often i think i ll stick to flying said harry weakly he really had no enjoyment at all over apparating from one place to another but seeing as it was the one bit of magic he could do outside hogwarts until his seventeenth birthday he figured he d have a bit of fun with uncle vernon over the summer you will stop by before we re off on our voyage asked gabriella after that harry will be staying with sirius i cantwait until we get him out of privet drive once and for all said ron emphatically gabriella pinched his arm hard ayy okay okay number four privet drive sirius had asked if harry would come and stay with him over the summer not at grimmauld place but at a small castle owned by the blacks in greece overlooking the sea harry told him of his promise to dumbledore to stay with the dursleys but that he and gabriella would most definitely stop by during their summer trip to the mediterranean as the friends exited the train harry watched ron and hermione walking hand in hand to greet hermione parents they hugged hermione and then they hugged ron harry had to laugh seeing ron shrink away from the wet kiss mrs granger planted firmly on the redhead cheek he saw mr and mrs chang greet james and cho and much to harry delight patrick o riley who would be spending much of the summer with them as opposed to the orphanage where he had spent the year before coming to hogwarts patrick was showing mr chang the magpies snitch and pointed over at harry mr chang rose up from the small child and looked over into harry eyes there was a tremendous warmth there and mr chang bowed slightly toward harry who nodded his own head back and gave a little wave and a gracious smile suddenly there was a little squeal and harry looked over to see ginny run and jump into her father arms it was interesting to see mr weasley in fine clothes and flanked by two high ranking aurors with the defeat of voldemort he had been resoundingly elected to the position of minister and had finally stopped telling everyone that it only temporary ginny hopped out of mr weasley arms and into her mother s the embrace was followed by ron and hermione s for a moment harry eyes locked with molly weasley s and without thinking he reached into his pocket and fingered a folded and worn sheet of parchment with gabriella at his side he walked over and shook mr weasley hand there was a blinding flash of light harry blinked to find colin creevey and his camera history harry said colin beaming history it ll be the cover photo on tomorrow prophet for sure and he disappeared into the crowd harry turned to see that mr weasley ears had reddened a bit more from embarrassment than irritation and harry was glad to see there was still a sense of humility about the newly elected minister you re looking well harry said mr weasley brightly gabriella it a pleasure to see you again the pleasure is mine sir said gabriella warmly i do hope mr weasley said we ll be seeing the two of you at the burrow this summer there no hope about it arthur jumped in mrs weasley they ll come for a visit as often as they like and at least once a week i dontthink began harry but molly weasley had him about the neck with her arms before he had a chance to say another word she kissed his cheek i know you re supposed to stay at that dreary place in little whinging and that you re planning to stay with sirius she said but you must always know where home is harry she squeezed him in her arms and harry felt a tremendous surge of warmth pass through him arthur has made the arrangements she whispered in his ear the darbinyans are connected to the network now gabriella a voice called from just passed the entrance to the platform hearing her voice shivers ran down harry spine he hadntseen or heard her since christmas and so much had happened so much had happened hesitating harry turned to see soseh darbinyan standing near the platform wall she was dressed in neat black robes that had flashes of deep purple at the sleeves she wore no hat and her hair which had grayed and grown since last they met was pulled back into ponytail at her side was remus lupin also wearing black robes having already greeted a number of students he was smiling brightly and looked healthier than harry had ever seen him even though the full moon was just the night before hearing her mother voice gabriella gave off a little squeal of her own and ran over towards soseh harry however stood frozen not really sure what to do there was a sharp pain at his side ayy called harry turning to find cho chang her fingers pinching a fold of skin on his right side what are you waiting for harry she asked pointedly i killed her husband harry said quietly you didntkill anybody said mrs weasley sharply you returned her son added cho if anyone understands it soseh cho right harry said mrs weasley as she gently pushed him forward go but harry feet wouldntmove he saw gabriella hug her mother and he watched as the tears began to flow down both women cheeks offering comfort remus had his arm about soseh and harry thought his own arms should be about gabriella but he couldntmove then cho gave harry a quick kiss on the neck grabbed him about his arm and pulled his frozen body forward come on she coaxed softly wizards witches and their children continued to welcome and hug each other as the platform burgeoned with traffic harry could hear people call his name and out of the corner of his eyes he saw fingers pointing in his direction but the scenery and the noises blurred into oblivion leaving only a swirl of colors about a tunnel that led toward soseh darbinyan it was almost like preparing the vision for apparating only it was cho pulling him forward they were about five steps from the darbinyan women when soseh pulled away from gabriella reached up to wipe a tear from her daughter face and noticed cho and harry walking toward her soseh face bore no smile but presented a warm expression of compassion and her eyes carried a look of deep understanding that went well beyond harry comprehension harry fears of seeing anger or resentment were washed away but he found himself unable to hold her gaze his own eyes were filled with too much sorrow mrs darbinyan said cho brightly it so wonderful to finally meet you at last harry insisted that i come say hello this was my last year at hogwarts mama said gabriella you remember about cho the other woman said soseh and a curl of a smile came across her lips gabriella has told me many good things you will visit us this summer no that sounds wonderful answered cho doesntit harry harry what harry asked breaking himself out of his trance yeah that sounds great he said mustering a bit more of an engaging voice i cantwait for you to come over said gabriella giving cho a hug i want you to meet my brother i d like that said cho there was a moment pause and she added i d better get going james patrick and my folks are waiting for me outside and i sure those two boys are going to get into trouble if i dontshow up soon soseh it was great to see you take care she gave soseh a hug and then squeezed harry arm see you later hero cho hand brushed his face and she disappeared into a sea of people a busy year eh harry said remus still none the worse for the wear he patted harry on the back is it true what sirius says you ve given up wanting to be an auror no one at hogwarts has said a word i dontknow answered harry shrugging his shoulders i think maybe my path leads to another calling for the first time soseh face truly brightened and a wide smile showed her golden tooth she held out her arm and pulled harry close harry wasntsure why but he began to cry it had been just four weeks since grigor had given up his life for antreas and though mr darbinyan original plan was to take harry life the gryffindor heart was saddened knowing he was gone knowing that soseh husband was gone and knowing that gabriella father was gone when harry pulled slightly back and looked down through wet eyes into soseh face she brought her thumbs to his cheeks and wiped away his tears there will be many more of these i afraid she said warmly come let us go home there is much to eat much to talk about harry looked up at remus and wondered why he was smiling the ministry has seen fit to provide a car said remus someone there must like you he winked and it looks like i ll be your escort for awhile harry i hope you dontmind kind of a light guard said harry somewhat surprised that with the upcoming battle he wouldnthave more watchers i guess the ministry doesntknow then he looked over to thank mr and mrs weasley but they had already left in fact the platform was thinning out though there were still a few gawkers whispering and staring at harry the ministry doesntknow what harry asked remus come interrupted soseh such things are trivial it is time we left harry and gabriella said goodbye to a few more of their friends and were soon on their way back to privet drive in the back of a large black limousine remus helped keep the conversation light by talking about sirius and how he was enjoying freedom you should have seen him strutting down diagon alley said remus brightly the dailey prophet may have declared him a hero but not one wizard would come within ten feet of him he deliberately walked wherever there were large groups of people just to see how long it would take before they scattered harry was surprised to see remus so animated the morning after a full moon still he was glad that the werewolf was so energetic harry was for the most part happy to keep quiet for fear of saying the wrong thing but when remus burst out laughing after hearing one of gabriella stories harry couldnthelp himself i dontget it remus harry said it was a full moon last night how is it possible that you can soseh said remus with a grand smile the part time professor put his arm around gabriella mother and gave her a warm hug a hug that elicited a slight blush in soseh cheeks she a genius when i saw what she d done for fred i well it beyond magic harry i ve asked her to and i ve told you no remus said soseh flatly it is not meant for everyone for in the wrong hands it could be turned to nefarious ends i dontunderstand said harry gabriella took his hand the same potion that keeps a werewolf from turning on the full moon she said has the opposite effect on non werewolves ordinary people could be drugged and turned into entire legions of werewolves pravus used the potion to wage war in the carpathian mountains and there are still people being bitten their to this day when soseh looked at harry her gaze was deep and penetrating and he couldnthold their stare he squirmed in his seat and instead chose to look out the window you wanted to know something harry best to ask and be done with it finally he turned and looked at her you re feeling better then he asked cautiously you seem better gabriella says you re better but it was grigor harry she said softly with nothing but kindness in her eyes something like an imperius curse added gabriella it was the first she d spoken of it and there was sorrow in her words this time it was she who looked blankly out the window yes said soseh with a bit of a quake in her voice that mirrored the emotions of her daughter grigor and i reached an impasse i am afraid it is unfortunate that he chose to control me so there are not too many wizards that could but i ve always had a soft spot for dark haired men she grinned ruffling harry hair with her hand and then her expression grew more serious that why i had to be quick harry and i sorry that it put you in such a dreadful position i can see many things but i never dreamed soseh let out a large sigh and shook her head remus handed her a handkerchief and she daubed her wet eyes there was a long moment of silence as the car turned into privet drive and pulled in front of number four it was the will of asha soseh whispered through her emotions she turned in her black leather chair to look more fully at harry and fought back the tears we came to little whinging because anaxarete came to little whinging she said defiance building in her voice we took that house she pointed out the window at number five not because there was a wizard across the street but because it was the only one we could find that would hold grigor instruments the morning we moved in and you nearly fell out the window i knew the secret you kept i could see what needed to be done grigor would use the first muggle he found to protect gabriella he would use you but you were a wizard and such a spell would be fatal so you needed to be shielded from his control harry reached down and touched his right arm then why not just tell grigor what i was asked harry before we came to britain i had a vision of grigor and a bound wizard before the curtain of phenolem was it simply grigor thoughts or a window into what was to come i still do not know all i could do was to try and protect you from being taken to the ministry answered soseh i failed her shoulders slumped and again remus handkerchief made its way to her eyes harry said remus quietly i going to take your things to your house soseh wanted to discuss a few items with you in private across the street i ll wait with your aunt and uncle until you come on over do you think that such a good idea asked harry remus smiled a toothy grin yes he said yes i do as harry gabriella and soseh walked toward the darbinyan door antreas opened it and stepped out gabriella dropped her trunk and ran into his arms soseh was right there was no loss for tears this evening eventually they all made their way into the living room the air was filled with the wonderful aroma of a simmering stew and fresh baked bread harry stomach turned it had been far too long since his last real meal but first he needed to say something soseh i so sorry he said softly as gabriella closed the front door sorry for what harry she asked for grigor for not realizing his plans sooner for not seeing that he had you under his control soseh sighed and shook her head she walked over to harry took his hand and sat with him on the couch harry the road we travel is paved with many stones if we step upon one that is crooked we might twist an ankle if another is too high we might trip the stones have been laid for centuries and many have walked the same road the only thing that distinguishes one traveler from another is the choice they make as they reach each fork in the road and if one knows well the heart of the traveler the destination is almost certain when i saw you hanging from your window across the street with owls fluttering about your room i knew you were a wizard and when i saw you dawdling on the sidewalk outside your garden i knew you had eyes for gabriella try as i might to turn grigor back onto the proper path he refused and when i discovered gabriella also had feelings for you i knew you were at risk as soseh motioned for antreas and gabriella to sit harry noticed a faint mark on antreas right arm it looked like harry began soseh again this time her voice clear and strong the matriarch of her family first i want to thank you for bringing me my son it appears that grigor has left our child skills he never had before skills the ministry and albus dumbledore have offered to help develop and understand she folded her hands in her lap and looked closely at harry it would have torn me apart if grigor had succeeded and taken your life one evil can never turn another into good i would have both my husband and son but not completely not wholly their souls would have been forfeit that gabriella was there to seal the bond to keep it in the family is as it should be soseh eyes demanded harry attention but it was being drawn toward antreas forearm she noticed harry wandering eyes and smiled second she continued it is time you understood the mark on your arm it was not grigor spell or my protection charm that put it there she chuckled to herself it was perhaps the most foolish and the most wonderful thing i have ever done there was little time to know for sure but when i saw how you were embarrassed to be seen by gabriella and how you cleaned yourself to become presentable i sensed the goodness in your heart it was not enough to truly welcome you to the family but i didntknow how long i would have she turned to her son antreas show him antreas leaned toward harry and held out his right forearm my father bore a similar mark he said but each man is weaved to suit the bearer i was never allowed to carry the burden until until you saved me on his forearm was a thin pale outline of some sort harry leaned in closer to make it out at first he couldntpull it together and then suddenly the coloration and detail came to view it was clearly the outline of a dragon a hungarian horntail harry whispered yes harry a dragon her name is asha said gabriella centuries ago a family of hungarian horntails flew across the black sea and established their home near the village of my ancestors in the south caucasus at the base of mount aragats she lived just outside the village and defying conventional wisdom had come to understand my ancestors as they too came to understand her and her family it is said that during a rise of darkness she was attacked by evil and one of my ancestors lost her life in defending the dragon and her family after the darkness was beaten back asha and her kin took it upon themselves to protect all in our line as long as we were dedicated to use her power for the betterment of all god creatures gabriella knelt beside harry and reached into the pocket where she knew he held the stone of cinnabar she pulled it out and held it in the palm of her hand when she died this is what remained her heart the heart of asha the blessing continued soseh is inscribed on the males of each generation by the women of the generation before it will be gabriella duty to pass the blessing to your sons but i mean we never really that is to say the sons of harry potter said soseh grinning whoever their mother may be both harry and gabriella were blushing bright red the bond is sealed when one shows a dragon kindness little did i know that the kindness had already been shown even before i set the mark harry looked confused hagrid dragon said gabriella at risk to yourself you protected it from harm and saw it to safety harry cast gabriella a questioning look ron told me she answered his eyes and shrugging her shoulders but this said harry this isnta dragon it s are you so sure harry interrupted soseh knowingly look closely harry looked down at his arm and watched in amazement as the symbols of the four houses seemed to transform in front of his eyes the snake of slytherin appeared more dragon like the wings of ravenclaw grew bat like and joined the dragon back the sword of gryffindor flared from the dragon mouth in a great burst of flame while the vines of hufflepuff became the outline of the dragon legs ending in claws with sharp pointed talons clasped in the talons the dragon held two crossed lightning bolts the viswa vajra it is a symbol to be proud of harry but not one to share for it marks you as the keeper of a great power more than just the heart of the dragon isntthis power enough asked harry taking the red orb from gabriella hand and holding it in his own asha did not only leave us her heart harry said soseh slowly and carefully so too has she left us her progeny generations of dragons hundred around the world that are sworn to uphold the oath of protection such is the blessing harry such is the burden soseh took to her feet and smoothed down the wrinkles in her robes she then reached out and took harry by the hands and lifted him up in front of her her eyes were bright and penetrating let me walk you across the street and once you have settled your affairs you and your family can join us for dinner antreas and gabriella both stood and gabriella kissed him on the cheek i know it a bit much harry but there ll be loads of time to figure it all out and there something that can help you find your way harry found his thoughts spinning as gabriella reached around her neck and pulled off the chain holding the gryffindor signet that professor mcgonagall had given harry she placed it around his neck and held her hand over the lion baring two ruby red eyes pressing it gently against his heart for times of darkness she whispered and this time kissed him on the lips and smiled warmly she joined her brother in the kitchen as harry and soseh left the house and started across the street not so much time is there harry said soseh looking skyward as the stars began to sprinkle the heavens ebyrth returns and you have been chosen by the centaurs harry just looked at her in amazement he had meant to tell his friends of the coming battle but hadntbeen able to bring himself to as far as he knew only dumbledore was aware that he had been chosen by the centaurs how did you it is an easy thing to wield power to bend armies to one bidding against a rising storm it is another thing altogether to use such power wisely to serve the betterment of earth they climbed the dursley front steps the power is now your burden harry when the dark cloud returns use it wisely at the door she kissed him on the cheek and started across the street toward home turning back over her shoulder she called out jovially bring your family when you re ready i ve made plenty harry watched as she disappeared into number five and his stomach growled the last thing he was going to do was bring vernon and petunia over across the street for dinner poor remus was probably going mad already he opened the door and saw the back of a wizard head sitting at a chair in the living room vernon and petunia were seated next to each other in the couch on the far side their faces were alabaster white and for the first time in harry memory they looked grateful to see harry breach the door ah harry said vernon with a twisted attempt at a smile such a pleasure as always as harry stepped into the living room he noticed remus drinking a glass of water in the kitchen he was smiling broadly remus asked harry the wizard in the living room turned it was sirius he too was wearing a broad smile and he stood to greet harry my my he exclaimed not even a month and you ve grown two inches harry ran to him at once and held him in his arms sirius squeezed tight and then ruffled harry hair remus has invited me to dinner at the darbinyans is that okay with you it brilliant said harry instantly vernon and petunia were trying to make themselves disappear into the very fabric of the couch did remus tell you asked sirius harry shook his head he moved in next door at least for a while maybe longer sirius winked at remus soseh been giving him potions to help him from turning into a werewolf sirius looked at vernon as if the muggle cared they re almost working i thought harry began but he was cut short by the screech of an owl flying in through the open front window it quickly dropped one of the many scrolls it was carrying and flew back out the window into the starry night harry unrolled the scroll and read it aloud notice to recipient at 0130 the 26th of december 1997 a muggle of your acquaintance witnessed your magical spell you failed to note the name of the muggle in question and send it to the ministry within three days of receipt of the original notice you are to report to the ministry on the 2nd of july for a hearing on your potential fine and imprisonment cedil perkins director muggle relations office imprisonment cried harry crumpling the parchment in his hands wonderful said sirius i can tell you about all the special things you can do while you re at azkaban he began to walk harry to the front door coming remus he called back remus simply rolled his eyes and joined the pair across the street the meal in the darbinyan home was fantastic and harry couldnthelp but notice how the two members of his family were as healthy as he had ever seen them he was also surprised to find out that it was true remus was staying at the darbinyans ostensibly under dumbledore orders to watch the young wizard across the street yet harry couldnthelp but notice that there was a bit of spark between remus and soseh whatever antreas thought he didntshow it he was very much like his father in that way during the meal they made plans for the summer while not joining the youth enrichment program directly remus and soseh would be close at hand should the need arise and they would be joining them at sirius before they all headed to armenia greece said gabriella dreamily i ll love greece tell us about your house sirius well sirius began shyly it not so much a house really the blacks well i own an estate outside the pantheon some call it a castle sirius became quite uncomfortable talking about his wealth and he turned the conversation by telling a joke about his initial introduction with the dursleys and everyone began to laugh it was a joy that had long been missing from the darbinyan home a happiness that filled the empty corners and spilled out through the windows onto the garden and into the street harry could see soseh breathe in the warmth and the energy ideas of dragons and ebyrth thoughts of centaurs and dementors visions of voldemort and the gnawing questions that still pulled at harry soul slipped effortlessly into nothingness they would wait for another time soseh was pouring everyone espresso when gabriella took harry by the hand mama perhaps harry could walk with me through the neighborhood this evening she asked i d like to see if duncan home she put a half spoonful of sugar in harry empty demitasse and then handed it to her mother i think it a marvelous idea darling soseh filled the cup with espresso and handed it to harry here you go my child i d say it will put hair on your chest but i see that there are two already growing again the whole house erupted in laughter as harry ears reddened are you up for a walk harry asked gabriella dontbe silly he said with a smile within ten minutes he and a very beautiful young woman were walking down the street toward duncan house talking about anything but the wizarding world harry potter and the burden of becoming chapter 74 epilogue x x x the day had been long the evening longer and harry mind was filled with an explosion of possibilities and futures he waved at her from his window blew her a kiss walked blearily backward falling fully onto his bed and he pondered the possibility of children she would be a wonderful mother he thought as his eyes closed and a smile curled on his lips quickly his mind faded into sleep save for the lake the pair were surrounded by the tall trees the air was suddenly quite cold and all sound was muffled into an eerie silence harry watched as draco plunged naked into the water dumbledore voice echoed in his mind if not his clothes would wash away a sign to centaurs that such things as robes are unclean harry watched as the stones about the great pool grew skyward they encircled him in a great gray tomb he held out his lit wand but its light was feeble against the darkness there was a stench of death here and as harry tried to stumble forward climbing over the rubble he saw a rat scurry across a pile of dust and debris harry kicked it with his foot the dust flew into the air revealing beneath a set of robes black wizard robes suddenly dumbledore voice began to laugh it was coming from every direction and harry turned to see gargoyle head after gargoyle head broken on the ground around him each roaring with laughter and gleaming at him with bright blue eyes in the early morning hours harry woke to the darkness of his room on privet drive and quickly flipped on the lamp at his bedside he was cold and yet sweat dripped down the side of his face his heart was racing and like a small child who might reach for a blanket he grabbed a well worn piece of folded parchment and opened it beneath the lamp light reading it for the hundredth time my dear harry would that i could reset the hands of time and set the world right but alas my magic is no match for the fate that stands before each of us it is clear to all that the path you ve been forced to travel has been cruel and unkind and still with all the adversities you have faced with all the battles you have fought you have found time to smile to care to love could there be someone else in all the world with more loyalty with more bravery with more compassion we are all forever in your debt you faced death but did not strike and in so doing brought light to darkness life to death it is by your example we still have hope that one day we will win this war against hatred with all the love a mother can give her children m harry took a deep breath carefully folded the parchment and set it at his bedside his racing heart slowed his body warmed and he turned off the lamp at his bedside and closed his eyes a smile curled on his lips and soon he was fast asleep just outside of glasgow the chang family finished saying their goodnights it had been a busy day and although everyone was exhausted the children still wanted to stay awake and share yet more stories of the year events finally mr chang put his foot down if he hadn t patrick and james would never be off to bed as it was he had to tell them to go to sleep at least three times before the two friends finally settled down in the quiet darkness of the night still unable to sleep it was patrick that heard the scuttle across the wooden floor in james room ignoring it he forced his eyes to remain closed just as a loud thump hit the floor he whispered for james but the young chang was already in a deep sleep again patrick could hear a skittering and this time a rolling along the floor risking a bit of magic he lit his wand there on the floor beside his bedroll was a rat with colorless fur pushing the
