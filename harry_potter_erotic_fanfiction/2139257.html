amychris what a sweet review glad you liked it as for being paid afraid not though it d be nice i need some new shoes lol chapter twnety two insanity ron stood in the darkest corner gladly welcoming the shadows that surrounded him his mind was on overload ron couldntfor the life of him get it to slow down and so here he sat his face buried into his hands utter despair clenching his heart too much was happening how had it all happened so fast one moment they were racing towards freedom the next he was back in his cell with hermione new fate revealed the thought of what she would succumb to tomorrow made him want to vomit and his eyes burn in jealousy she was his how dare anyone take her away from him he d lost his virginity to her how on earth was he supposed to think about voldemort raping her and yet neither had spoken since they d been brought back he d apologized a few times but she refused to meet his gaze her wide eyes staring at harry body as it was paraded in front of them acting as if under some sort of trance as harry body was carelessly tossed to the dirty ground and the death eaters had a few good laughs the bars clanked shut and darkness overwhelmed he d immediately reached for hermione only to find her gone walking slowly towards the corpse in the corner he d tried to grab her hand but she d shrugged it off making her words earlier sting in his mind painfully deep down he refused to believe that the only love she had for him was brotherly yet on the surface ron couldnthelp but believe it hermione he had whispered his voice strained he had to know had to figure everything out she didntanswer her brown eyes were frozen open the same horrified expression on her face as she reached the body and carefully kneeled down beside it she said nothing didntmove mione he d tried again slowly hermione reached a shaking hand out softly running it through harry black hair suddenly gaining confidence in one sudden movement she flipped the body over a rotting smell filled ron nostrils as the obvious scent of decay fluttered about the cell making ron heart skip a beat or two harry eyes were closed thankfully something that ron was eternally grateful for his hair was still tousled white bits of debris in it clashing horribly with his raven locks his shirt was ripped a little and spots of blood covered him his skin seemed to take on an almost blue hue to it in the moonlight something that made harry appear even deader to ron shuddering ron shut his eyes unable to withstand the pain he backed into the corner repulsed by the sight hermione seemed not to mind something that bothered ron for some reason hermione he suddenly shouted she ignored him too caught up in the sight of her best friend to notice her boyfriend cries gingerly placing a delicate hand to harry face tears fell from her eyes oh harry she whispered before breaking out into an open heartbreaking sob throwing herself over the body of her friend ron heart felt ripped away from him the gesture not only hurting ron feelings but pulling at his heartstrings too he couldnttake this anymore he didntwant anything to do with that body that was not his best friend harry was alive and out there just biding his time until he could come and save ron and hermione from this place he was the hero the man ron always depended on he wouldnthave left ron like this not without a goodbye the thought made tears prick his eyes but he simply swallowed them hermione sobs enough to be his own grabbing a bit of harry t shirt and crying into it the way she did with him hermione began whispering little murmurs that ron strained his ears to hear i i so sorry harry so sorry all my fault not fair voldemort the little mumblings had more of an impact on ron than anything before and for a moment a fleeting passing moment ron wanted to throw himself beside the body of his best mate and cry as openly as hermione was currently doing now no harry not you hero my best friend my first friend no harry no ron turned around he couldntwatch any longer staring at his shaking hands he looked up into the starless sky though ron had never admitted it to anyone he loved the stars when he was little his mum had once told him that the stars were the eyes of people gone before him that as long as there were little golden dots in the sky he was safe it was silly really that he d believed it as long as he did but it had always made him smile when he would sneak out of his room or out of the dormitory to see the stars twinkling reassuringly for as long as he d star gazed he d never been presented with a starless night and as he searched the skies hopefully for any sign of just a single star his stomach plummeted when he found nothing ron stole another glance at hermione she d stopped her mutterings for now but ron had to take a double take at what she was doing hermione was bent over the body licking her finger and wiping the spots of debris and blood off his face the way she used to when harry had a bit of food on his nose motherly she then began straightening up his robes folding down his collar tying harry cloak up in a neat little bow the same bow she d always tied harry and his cloaks up with he and harry had been teased by the other blokes of course and ron would always turn beet red immediately untying the darn little thing where as harry would shrug secretly happy at some motherly attention even if it was from his best friend but as if that wasntenough she kept going straightening up harry appearance as though he were going on a date or giving some important speech she ran her fingers through his hair shaking out all of the white powder that was in it something that made ron jealous for some unknown reason hermione had never run her hands through any bloke hair but his she tied his shoes rubbed out the scuffmarks in them extended his shirt so that there were no wrinkles she even tried to tame his famously unruly hair she was working herself up ron could see that much she began to make each change faster and faster her breaths becoming labored tears were rolling down her cheeks as she huffed and puffed hermione don t he cried out to her she shot him a look and continued even faster than before dontlisten to him harry she whispered but yet it was loud enough for him to hear ron mouth open in horror his mind froze and he stood gaping at hermione s she was talking to a dead body to harry dead body dontworry harry ron and i will protect you w we wontlet v voldemort get you anymore she cried through her tears kissing his cheek she whispered you re safe hermione no ron shouted jumping up from his chair and grabbing her arms she ripped it away from him i sorry harry i know you hate it when ron and i fight she whispered again ron lost it he put his arm around her waist making a move to pull her back and away from the body noo she screamed hysterically reaching out for anything and everything for her to grab onto hermione ron grunted using all of his strength to pull her away no no dontlet him take me away harry she cried out insanely her arms still reaching out towards harry even though ron was pulling her away once she was away ron tried to hold her in his arms but she would have none of it scrambling around frantically she scratched and pushed at him to try to get away hermione just hold still no no you cantmake me i need harry hermione please he needs us ron he asking for our help not knowing what else to do ron slammed her against the wall pinning her arms above her head shocked at his sudden move hermione remained still for a moment or two stop ron said sternly looking into her eyes hermione lip trembled and she shook her head sobbing she tried to push past him but ron was stronger than she was ron let me go she cried her eyes open in fear no he snapped you re acting like a nutter i no he harry she fumbled for words that is a dead body hermione it harry who cares who it is it is a corpse ron please let me go she whimpered trying to push past him again why so you can go off on your psycho rant i dontwant you near that thing suddenly hermione eyes narrowed dangerously and sudden fire appeared in her eyes glaring at him menacingly she growled that thing that thing ron is our best friend why were you talking to it it harry i dontcare what it is it making you crazy it was as if he d hit her again she recoiled from his words in the same manner tears gathering in her eyes she leaned against the wall her face in her hands as she began to cry you didn t she whispered acting as though the words were painful to say i didntwhat call you crazy bloody hell i did you were acting it hermione placing a hand on her chest she cried defensively i am not crazy you were talking to a dead body i have to ron why the bloody hell do you feel the need to talk to him becauase i dontneed to explain everything to you oh yes you do you donthave control over me i know that he snapped you re just like one of them you dontgive a damn do you about you ron asked painfully yes she shrieked i not some piece of meat and i certainly not someone you walk all over ron was silent his eyes flashing dangerously you have no idea what your talking about he finally gritted between his teeth what hermione caught her breath caught off guard in case you dontremember you are the one who doesntlove me he said crossing his arms and turning his back to her what you canthonestly believed what i said earlier hermione cried her eyes suddenly holding desperate guilt in them why not is that so hard to believe after the display you just pulled over there with harry because you insensitive prat if you dontreacal i ve told you over and over again that i love you i had bloody sex with you you were comforting me hermione and i was comforting you just admit it we both know that it true no ron that not true yes it is you were comforting poor ickle ronnekins i know you hermione you like to take control of things you hate to see people unhappy i wouldntput it past you to sleep with every guy i want to comfort is that what you think of me ron no but do you have any idea how many times i comforted h harry so you re suggesting that i slept with him every time i wanted to cheer him up and lift his burdens by this time ron had stood up and he was marching determinedly towards her abandoning his passive comebacks and using his sharp tongue i just dontknow what to think anymore he cried in frustration throwing his hands up into the air what to think anymore she cried hysterically standing up as well think about the fact that i love you how many bloody times do i have to say it to get it through your thick skull well obviously it didntget through this weasley skull hermione took a step backwards tears falling down her face she shook her head and looked ron in the eye for a moment it was only a fleeting second but in it ron could tell what she was going to do she was trying to run away as she brushed past him he panicked grabbing her wrist and twisting her around ron let me go she snapped her curls whipping around her face no he cried pulling her to him and holding her in his arms ron what are you doing she asked her tone not as sharp breathing in her scent ron sighed i dontknow i feel like i dontknow where we stand it keeps changing on me no ron she shook her head her voice much more quiet it doesntchange it never changed you just think it does my feelings for you have always been the same and they re never going to change that thick head of yours keeps confusing you her mouth curved upwards as she ran her hand through his thick red locks he closed his eyes relishing in the feeling of her hand in his hair but with voldemort i was playing it called acting she said with a smile running her hand along his face b but it sounded so real he protested hermione frowned i had to make it real voldemort wouldnthave believed it otherwise oh as ron felt a pair of lips brush his cheek and hermione slip from his arms resuming her old spot at harry side he lifted his eyes to hers hermione yes ron what were you doing with harry he asked her eyes traveled to the ground you mean earlier yea hermione bit her lip i was talking to him you heard right surprised ron took a step forward bending down so that he was level with her searching her eyes he said softly why because ron she said gazing outside the barred window i d tried to accept his death but seeing him like this i cantdescribe it it ruined everything i wanted to believe it easier to pretend that he still alive i told you he said softly tear filled eyes met his yea you did ron yea can you do me a favor anything c can we give harry a burial ron had to blink a few times to make sure he d heard everything correctly a a burial he choked biting her lip to hide tears she nodded i just want it behind me for now at least before tomorrow with the realization of what tomorrow was ron stomach dropped fighting back the tears of his heart that was currently screaming in agony he nodded hermione y yea could you do me a favor he replayed her words smiling faintly she nodded anything you want ron can could you tell me again tell you what one last time to set the story straight nodding and grabbing the sides of face hermione gently steered ron face towards hers and rested her forehead against his breathing in and out deeply they matched their breathing into one single unison sound pausing hermione closed her eyes and brushed her lips past ron ears i love you nudging her nose lovingly ron sighed contently i d always hoped so a n i must say that i am very disappointed in myself my goal was to get this chapter out on friday but at least i improving by a day each week

as hermione was awoken from her dreamless sleep she groaned she hadntslept that well since before the war and she needed the sleep desperately hermione a familiar voice whispered in her ear silently cursing ron for waking her up she groggily opened her eyes the world was blurred before her she could see ron figure standing above her only slightly bouncing on the balls of his feet rubbing her eyes his face came into focus he was wringing his hands and biting his lip things ron never did unless something had big just happened her stomach immediately dropping and her heart racing automatically she sat up quickly what she asked what wrong what happened her mind was zipping through all the possible reasons for ron distress voldemort wanted her early they d changed their mind and wanted ron dead instead he d somehow found out about another death he was hurt they were to kill her in front of ron hermione went through everything she could think of and fear clutched her heart why wasnthe talking as ron stood there for another moment hermione was about to say something yell at him to just spit it out that this waiting and pondering was worse than the news itself when suddenly he smiled at her hermione blinked several times to make sure she wasntseeing things ron weasley was smiling at her after the war and harry death he was smiling come with me he said grabbing her hand we re leaving as she was yanked off the ground and pulled over to the wall hermione silently agreed with herself that ron had lost it leaving she asked confused where are we going just come on ron grinned pulling her along i have something to show you just play along her brain told her for his sake just play along okay she said apprehensively as ron stopped in front of the brick wall look look through that hole he exclaimed excitedly gently pushing her to her knees it was a hole not quite big enough to fit her head through inching forwards she pressed her eye against the wall not quite sure what she was looking for suddenly as her eyes adjusted she made out the shapes of two people ron there someone out there she said fearfully backing away from the hole i know he beamed who she asked lifting her face up towards ron s h hey hermione a small voice said hermione heart froze where it was and her breath got caught up in her chest she knew that voice she d heard it a million times and yet it couldntbe there was no way everyone was dead she must be hearing things or maybe it was a dream some wonderful yet tortuously cruel dream her head whipped to ron who stood there a broad smile flashing across his face her heart clenched painfully ron she breathed shaking her head refusing to believe what her ears told her no ron no it not yes it is he said softly no it cantbe i dontbelieve it chuckling softly a sound that sounded like music to hermione ears it d been so long he grabbed her hand believe it this is real we re going to get out of here no she ripped her hand away from his a pained expression flew across his face as her stomach churned guiltily i told you earlier she said quietly i sick of getting my hopes up now stop torturing me with this let go back to bed confused ron suddenly pushed her to her knees again seamus come closer it hard to see you hermione look a shuffle of grass was heard as suddenly before hermione eyes seamus face came into focus it was as if someone had knocked the wind out of her there was no doubt that this man was seamus all his features were the same the eyes the hair the nose the skin the accent everything was just as it was a week ago dirt mud and grass were strewn across random parts of his body and his eyes held a different light in them but otherwise hermione felt herself tear up s seamus she whispered her voice shaking the boy smiled and nodded his head nice to see you too hermione at the sound of his voice the voice of a fellow gryffindor of a fellow classmate of a fellow friend hermione couldnthold in her tears trickling down her face slowly she raised a hand to his face she had to touch him make sure she wasntdreaming placing a hand on his cheek seamus smiled sadly his own eyes glistening as he covered her hand with his own squeezing it gently he turned around there someone else who wanted to see you he said softly hermione squinted in the darkness to see as lavender brown emerged from the shadows tears of her own falling down her face l lavender she whispered her mouth open in shock a delicate hand covering it oh hermione the girl cried rushing forwards to grab hermione hands through the hole staring at her roommate face her blurry red eyes her messed up hair her tear strained face she couldnthelp it the tears simply burst from her eyes like a dam and she sat there pitifully her head bent sobbing no one said anything for a moment the only sound being the sobs of the two girls hermione had lost all her senses her mind seemed useless as her body racked with tears seamus and lavender were here alive they were fine they werentdead just that realization made hermione want to cry forever happiness like she hadntfelt in ages overwhelming her body you have no idea how worried we ve been about you two it been so horrible we saw h harry oh merlin we saw him he d been fighting so well and then they just oh hermione i dontwant to be the one to tell you this but he dead lavender cried in between tears hermione could only shake her head and whisper w we know we saw it too you did lavender gasped oh god i i so sorry so sorry who who else she said not hiding the emotions in her voice you mean who else is left she nodded not here seamus said quickly we need to get you both out of here do you have everything you need hermione looked at ron who shook his head we donthave anything but each other alright then back away seamus instructed obediently the couple backed away from the wall walking away hermione stole a glance at ron he was looking at her intensely you okay he whispered hermione smiled softly and nodded never better it was unlike anything hermione had ever experienced it was like being born again everything was so new so wonderful and so good her senses were on overdrive trying to relish in the feeling of the cold soft grass underneath her feet the swish of the night air as they ran and the healthy beating of her heart all at the same time seamus had magically enlarged the hole to about the size of a doorway making it only too easy to walk through towards freedom guilt pounded in her heart at the thought of leaving harry behind it hadntbeen easy to walk slowly through that doorway but with the warm guidance of ron hand hermione desperately pushed all thoughts out of her mind jumping over a fallen tree and ducking a branch her mind couldnthelp but race wondering about the answer to her last question who else was left she couldnthelp but hope seamus and lavender sudden re appearance filling her with the hope she hadntfelt for what seemed like ages they stopped in front of an enormous rock serving as a little cave hermione crawled in after ron the four said nothing for a while everyone concentrating on catching their breaths finally it was seamus who breathing heavily began this is where we ve been for the past two days here hermione asked looking around it barely held all four of them how could they have lived here like cavemen for two full days what had they been eating how did they sleep someone could easily walk in how had they not been caught had they just been sitting in here how did they know to come look for them so many questions buzzed around her head that finally hermione gave up and leant up against the wall yea seamus said how did you find it ron panted it kind of found us we were running from death eaters and lavender tripped right in front of it this little cave saved our lives ron nodded what have you been doing here all this time though how do you know about the others how did you know where to find us slow down seamus sighed leaning against the wall i guess we better start from the beginning we donthave time for the whole story lavender said quickly we have to leave before the sun comes up i know seamus ran a hand through his hair i ll be quick i promise fine lavender said settling against the wall like the others hermione was struck by them both true during school they had not always been her favorite people finding seamus too loud and obnoxious and lavender too ditzy for her own good but here she never would have guessed seamus spoke in a calm quiet voice and lavender no longer used that excited high pitched voice of hers both were tired that was easy to see they were much more serious as if they d matured to the age of thirty in two days time we were both sent out of the same door along with the patil girls dean luna neville and ginny but once the war started we all kind of lost each other everyone had their own spot of trouble we tried to help as much as we could but everyone had their own battles to fight i was right near the forbidden forest when hogwarts crashed lavender was in the forest some death eaters had dragged her in there hermione looked over to lavender who stiffened looking towards the floor when the first part started collapsing i was shouting at everyone to run for it not many people listened to me though i ran into the forest and found lavender who was um seamus paused to gage lavender reaction having some trouble with a particular death eater who was torturing her pretty bad i knocked the bastard over and we ran for it then we found this place and hid for a while the dust and debris wasntthat bad for us since we d found shelter before hogwarts completely collapsed though it did kind of snow us in those who were right near it werentso lucky michael corner somehow managed to crawl around into the forest he died right outside this place we tried to get to him but we couldntget out this tree had fallen in front of us we think that why nobody looked inside here no one likes to go near a dead body hermione ignored the look ron was giving her we kept pushing at this tree to move and eventually created a hole big enough for us to slip through we were trying to run back towards hogwarts when we ran into luna she was frantic neville was hurt really bad we eventually found hagrid who rushed away with luna to help neville we still dontknow what happened to the three of them what about ginny ron interrupted seamus and lavender exchanged looks and ron hands balled up into fists digging his fingernails into his palm nervously what what happened is she okay hermione took in a breath ginny was one of her best friends she was one person she wasted to know about seamus cleared his throat um luna was the one who told us she said that ginny had been tortured really badly because the death eaters knew how close she was to harry they dragged her to where harry and voldemort were battling they were trying to distract him so that voldemort could just finish him off but harry didntfall for it what do you mean harry didntfall for it ron suddenly bellowed his face bright red how could he not have saved her i thought he bloody loved her ron calm down lavender soothed no he cried out stubbornly just let me finish seamus cried it not like harry didntwant to save her and dontworry when the death eaters triedtorapeher harry killed them all what was that ron asked i didntcatch that last bit you didn t oh well seamus looked around nervously the death eaters tried to rape ginny hermione interrupted she knew she was the only one save ginny and ron mum who could control ron seamus shot her a thankful look what ron screamed ron she warned ron met her eyes fire dancing among the sea of blue she gave him a very pointed look and after much protesting the fire simmered and only concern for his baby sister flowed out from him she is i mean is she okay ron asked afraid seamus and lavender exchanged a bewildered look between them looking at hermione impressed seamus continued his story um we re not really sure what do you mean hermione asked for ron but her own heart aching for a certain answer well once harry had killed the death eaters she was weak crying on the ground and stuff they d tortured her pretty badly according to luna harry didntknow what to do he tried to run to her but voldemort kept shooting curses at him he was shouting stuff at her and begging for someone to take her and get her away keep her safe the creevy brothers apparently heard him and colin picked ginny up and the three of them ran into the forest seamus finished his story staring at ron expectantly well what happened next where is she is she okay w we dontknow lavender said timidly that was all luna knew at the time but you have to realize ron at the time such a detailed report of someone was special luna gave us more information than we could have ever hoped for ron said nothing he looked at his hands refusing to meet eye contact with anyone he nodded his understanding to lavender but bit his lip trying to fight back tears hermione heart broke for him placing a loving hand on his shoulder she tried to get him to look at her he wouldn t turning to lavender and seamus hermione asked is that all we really know what about colin and denis do we know what happened to them again the two exchanged worried looks seamus cleared his throat nervously well we know the three of them were together colin and dennis would never separate from each other dennis would never disobey an order from harry and colin he would never leave ginny like that hermione searched in her brain for the memory of colin over the years true he d changed much once fifth year hit and the news of voldemort return was made public he changed no longer did he annoy harry and the others instead he took to reading up on all he could he wanted to fight with them and with help from harry in the d a he transformed into a reliable fighter he still took pictures his passion for photography never ceasing but he d matured and become much more serious by seventh year he had grown up entirely he and dennis were best friends the brothers seeming even closer than the weasley brothers dennis was a lot less serious than colin but with the help of his older brother dennis also was made into a fierce warrior thankful that it had been these two that had responded to harry call hermione had subconsciously let out a breath she d held in the whole time she didnthave to worry too much about ginny safety she was more than safe in the arms of the two brothers i know she agreed feeling much better so i mean we still dontknow about ginny whether or not she safe confusion arose on hermione face but hadntthey just said what do you mean well i mean we can only guess seamus said sadly w we came across dennis body in the forest hermione eyes widened and she gasped all the safety and securities she had felt previously washed away from her leaving her with a sickening worry for her friend heart beating she whispered and colin we dontknow what happened to him or ginny we searched around we never found their bodies or any trace of them the best we can hope for is that colin at least has ginny safe hermione nodded as if she were in a trance this was too much information to process she stole a glance at ron his arms were resting on his knees his face buried in them she suddenly had an urge to bury her face in his shirt and cry into it or run her hands comfortingly through his hair nodding she scooted up to ron and leaned her head on his shoulder wrapping her arms around herself ron didntrespond to her gesture for a while but finally gave in and took her hand gently she squeezed it desperately trying to give him some kind of comfort lavender and seamus were watching the interaction with interest so lavender said softly a are you two together hermione looked up at the girl lavender always had a passion for gossip but without parvati at her side she seemed half as enthusiastic about the news hermione simply nodded she smiled good we were all wondering when you two would seamus laughed merlin we had bets going around for years most people figured you two would cave in during sixth year everyone was rather annoyed i ll tell you that everyone hermione asked curiously not helping the blush that crept up the sides of her face seamus nodded enthusiastically hell yea all of gryffindor betted on you two most of the school as well even the slytherins knew you would get together eventually but how did they oh it was obvious lavender broke in smiling at hermione the way ron looked at you all the time the way you looked at him he was always so protective of you and the way you both fought we all knew it was sexual tension building hermione couldnthelp it with a burst of laughter she grabbed her sides never loving a feeling more and once she began there was no stopping ron looking up for the first time he shot her a lopsided grin before falling in step with her laughter the two continued for what felt like minutes they couldntbe stopped lavender and seamus looked at him confused which made the situation all the more funny tears of happiness were tempted to spill over hermione eyes the situation was all too hilarious s sexual hahaha tension she managed to say in between giggles well yea lavender said as if it were the most obvious thing in the world this set hermione out on another set of laughter w what so funny seamus asked hermione calmed down enough to talk it wasntsexual tension in the least it was more like ron annoying me to all edges of insanity and me lashing out at him yea ron suddenly said it was a competition to see who could last the longest no it was not lavender insisted we used to examine the facts maybe it wasntsexual tension but it was at least a tension that everyone knew would lead to romance it was more of when you two blockheads would admit it we used to talk about it all the time me and parvati i mean with this last statement the soft smile was wiped off of lavender face and she looked down at her hands catching on hermione laughter was cut and her smile turned into a frown yea what about paravti and padma she asked quietly looking at lavender intensely lavender said nothing she looked around the little cave desperately trying not to meet hermione eye it was seamus who squeezed her shoulder comfortingly and met hermione gaze it was filled with sadness and heartache that much was obvious hermione stomach felt empty and suddenly she wished she hadntasked she wanted to laugh again it had filled her with so much warmth she didntwant to talk about war anymore tears were gathered in seamus eyes and hermione knew without a word uttered by anyone that they were dead her head was pounding how could this happen the twins were always there so bubbly and happy hermione had always sniffed when lavender would walk around and chat excitedly about something with them but not because she didntlike them she d still held a grudge about not having any girl friends at first and since lavender and parvati hadntwelcomed her into their group even in first year when they shared a room she couldnthelp but pretend like she didntwant their friendship but once she really got to know them especially in sixth year she found out about the school secret craving to be inducted into the golden trio from there she d been distant friends with the twins and their deaths however they came about didntseem to click in her brain michael corner had been one thing but she d never really known him even dennis creevy death hadnthad as big an impact on her he was in a different year after all but padma and especially parvati this one hurt how she managed to squeak out tears of her own in her eyes seamus looked away and put his hand to his neck as if he were debating whether or not to tell her finally giving in he leaned forwards his eyes not quite meeting her own as if he were staring into another distant world after we found denis and searched for ginny and colin we headed back towards hogwarts the dust had settled more so it wasntthat bad we were running through the forest and were at the edge of it almost to where the castle used to be when we heard all this commotion it was harry naturally we ran towards it to see if we could help when we saw him up in the air a death eater came right behind us so i pushed lavender into some nearby bushes from there we watched as voldemort made his speech and well you know the rest once harry was seamus seemed unable to say it gone we heard these screams coming from right beside us as the death eaters and voldemort celebrated this other death eater was watching the forest looking for friends of harry to have some kind of reaction apparently parvati had started crying this guy swooped down and dragged them both out of the bushes right next to us right next to us we had no idea that whole time they were there we didntknow he didntthink to look for us they re the ones who saved our own pathetic lives because they died we re alive seamus was beginning to raise his voice a voice that was chalk full of heartache lavender was sitting there silently crying while seamus battled tears in his own eyes hermione had never seen something so heartbreaking it just tore at her to see them like this wiping a stray tear off her own face she urged seamus to continue they dragged them both out voldemort broke away from the celebrations to look them over he questioned them about where the rest of us were they wouldnttell them anything parvati kept crying about harry he really liked that that bastard from there he tortured them in front of our own eyes he put them under crucio i i cantdescribe what it was like their screams they just seamus shuddered i wontever be able to forget them by that time lav was sobbing i was crying too he set padma hair on fire when the flames reached her scalp she just seamus broke off tears slipping down his face he wiped them up ashamed sorry he mumbled hermione tears suddenly didntseem enough her hand was covering her horrified open mouth and her whole body seemed rooted to the spot it okay mate we understand ron strained voice said he wasntcrying but tears were shimmering in his blue eyes d dean was with them though i hoping he still alive obviously we searched for him in the bushes but he wasntthere seamus said that all we know of everyone thanks for filling us in ron said softly patting seamus on the back silently hermione crossed over to where lavender sat tears still streaming down her face sitting next to the girl she took her into her arms at the gesture lavender burst into open sobs i so sorry she whispered i i know they were your best friends lavender nodded through her tears yea they were she whispered i know what it feels like to loose a best friend hermione whispered gently wiping all her tears away i know i really am sorry i know you are i sorry about harry too i feel really guilty hermione confessed all those screams that ron and i heard all night long i wished for them to stop but i never stopped to think about who they belonged to t that must have been unbelievable to watch it should have been me they were the ones with the plans for their lives they were the smart ones they were the best people i ever met and what am i i didntwant to fight in the first place i only went so i wasntleft behind no one wanted to go hermione replied gently but still what good have i ever done i wasntclever at school like you i wasntfunny i couldntplay quidditch i was a good flirt and i was pretty my favorite subject was mealtimes where i could catch up on gossip i mean what a wasted life padma was in ravenclaw she was so smart parvati was really good at school too she was always explaining things to me but she was funny they had so much going for them why am i the one alive and they re the ones lying there dead sh dontsay things like that you were in gryffindor we all know you re brave you rescued ron and i if that wasntcourageous i dontknow what else was did you know that in the morning i was going to be raped by voldemort and killed you and seamus saved my life and probably ron too eventually so dontsay that you haventdone anything you ve done one of the best things you possibly can parvati and padma gave their lives for you and seamus and because of that ron and i are living lavender wiped her tears away and sniffed you were going to be raped by voldemort yea hermione replied looking at her hands in some mad attempt to hurt ron i sorry dontbe sorry you saved me from it but i ve been wondering how exactly did you know where ron and i were lavender looked up seamus you want to take this one i too tired sure lav you want to go to bed i ll just take a quick nap i ll be up in an hour she said kissing his cheek and switching positions with ron so that she was in the darkest corner of the tiny cave ron was watching their interactions curiously so are you two together as well he asked in a soft tone so that lavender was able to sleep nah seamus said we re just friends but you canthelp but feel close to someone who went through all that hell with you you know anyways about you guys he said in a business like manner sorry to say that the story you guys are in isntvery exciting but i ll do my best to lavish it up for you to this hermione had to smile so after all that we were sitting in those bushes crying and stuff when we heard a death eater from the jail walk out to join the celebrations he walked over to voldemort and announced that they had captured you both obviously lavender and i freaked out especially after what we d just seen and listened carefully voldemort asked what cell you were in so that he was able to visit you later and the guy told him we were so shocked though nobody had heard or seen from you no one had any information for all we knew you both had died with harry or something but to hear that you two were alive well it wasnta hard decision to rescue you both we knew that the death eaters wouldntleave the area that night so i carried lavender who had practically fainted with all the stress back to this place and we waited it out you should have seen her i ve never seen anyone cry so much she never stopped even in her dreams in the morning death eaters were sent to search out people like us who had escaped the war most were and still are living in the forest it was terrifying you never knew when they d come for you if you were next lavender learned how to cry silently but michael body and this tree probably saved our lives they never came near us then tonight we snuck out i lifted lavender up to that little window to see which cell you were and if there was a crack in the wall that we could enlarge we got lucky getting it right the first time and that it you both know the story from there wow ron said i had no idea thanks seamus really we owe you our lives so if there anything we can ever do to repay you both you just name it don t please we d both hate it i promise this was our way of dealing with parvati and padma deaths i d feel too guilty to accept anything but seamus hermione started shush no more seamus said firmly now we need to talk about tonight didntwe just ron asked confused no i mean what to come for tonight what we re escaping tonight hermione asked bewildered they d just escaped from prison barely escaped death she physically couldn t she was too emotional drained yes tonight seamus said in the morning they ll realize you re gone and trust me by the way voldemort sounded when he found out that you both were captured he will not be happy and he will find us i can guarantee that where are we going ron asked america seamus said lavender has an aunt who lives in some remote city there we can stay there but how ron asked well we had two plans do you have your wands with you ron and hermione shook their heads no that what i figured we ll just have to try plan b which is we escape hogwarts grounds by foot and reach king cross from there we can take a train to the leaky cauldron we can go to diagon alley and buy you both wands there no way we can spend the night there though there will be too many spies so immediately we ll apparate to america and donteven think of telling me we cantapparate cause we re underage hermione seamus said noticing her open mouth ron smirked and hermione rolled her eyes at them both no that wasntwhat i was going to say well then seamus said bowing his head the floor is yours thanks i appreciate you having a plan seamus but this isntgoing to work sniggering seamus asked in an amused voice why not because hermione said indignantly with harry gone voldemort will have access to ministry files if he doesntalready every time you apparate it goes on file he ll just be able to check where our latest apparation was and find us seamus face fell obviously he had not thought of such a thing oh i forgot about that ron worried face turned to her do you have another plan not exactly but i know that we canttravel magically it ll be just too easy to track down we need to do it the muggle way alright i fine with that seamus said but how do we get to america the muggle way without muggle money hermione sighed we can t i donthave enough money to buy a plane ticket for four people or a boat ticket we cantgo to america seamus face opened in protest but we have to that the farthest away place that we have connections exactly hermione said we need to go somewhere he wontexpect no where too far or too close he ll look there first and we should stay in europe with magical people that will be able to help us what about my family in ireland seamus offered too close i sorry eh your right hermione i know you want to pick the perfect place but i dontknow people who live in other european countries ron cried the first real foreign witch or wizard i met was at the triwizard tournament ron words sent hermione brain into overactive mode triwizard tournament foreign witch or wizard who would take them in european country that was pretty far away that was it what is it seamus asked seeing her face i ve got it hermione breathed running through her idea real fast to search for loopholes who ron asked hermione looked at ron you re not going to like it she said truthfully just tell me he rolled his eyes wait do i know them seamus asked ignoring seamus question hermione kept staring at ron waiting for the connection to click in his brain suddenly his face lit up with the answer and then darkened dangerously panicking his turned towards hermione oh no no no no no no not him please hermione ron she warned dontgo there hermione there has to be someone else no ron she cried seriously there is no one else it perfect admit it you know we ll be safe there he rich enough to hide us safely he ll have a lot of news we can take the train there and most importantly no one will ever suspect it hermione ron moaned what wrong seamus asked sincerely confused not catching on to whatever they were talking about hermione turned towards him seamus we re going to bulgaria bulgaria he scrunched up his face what there who we know in bulgaria vicktor krum she sighed rubbing her head trying to relieve herself of a growing headache seamus looked from hermione to ron who was fuming in the corner his face bright red a smirk lit up his face as he realized exactly what vicktor krum symbolized to ron and he sniggered bloody hell this is going to be good a n wow this chapter just flew by sorry to end it where i did more to come i promise please let me know whatcha think hugs haystack a n hopefully there are still people out there interested in this story even though it been more than a month since my last update ducks as objects are thrown i ll apologize over and over again if i have to i feel so bad but unfortunately this chapter proved very difficult to write in the week before i left for my trip to russia i was gone for two and a half weeks and when i came back my room was being painted and my computer taken apart once the painting was done and i put the computer back up it took me a day to get the internet back up and running so madly in the past two days i ve written you all a 23 page chapter which i hope might make up for those two weeks i was gone it a long shot i know but i at least you all know i alive i was beginning to worry there i kept thinking gosh i hope they dontthink i ve abandoned the story which by the way i ll never do anyways responses for last chapter it feels like eternity ago were amazing as always and guys we got to 400 reviews that a record for me thank you thank you thank you i would respond to all of your fantastic reviews but its rather late and i utterly exhausted so let see if i can just answer some questions you all had firstly i so glad you all enjoyed last

have against you ah alas poor ron i also received quite a few lol regarding the last line again so glad you all enjoyed it i also received two questions regarding the number of chapters i planning for this story and luckily i can fully answer this question now because after eight weeks i ve finally found my folder of notes and plot diagrams so now that i have my notes back i can estimate much better as a rough estimate donthold me to this i d say about nine chapters left and will there be a wedding somewhere in those nine chapters i afraid i honestly canttell it wasntin my newly recovered plans but then again the engagement part wasntin my original plans either i kind of just threw that in we ll just have to go with it and see what happens anyways again thank you all sooooo much you all have put up with so much recently i just hope that this chapter is good enough thanks much love haystack chapter thirty five scars of eternity by lunch ron was convinced the entire world knew of his engagement to hermione fred and george bloody brothers had practically tackled him after breakfast and well it had all been downhill from there let me go merlin i sore there what in bloody hell do you think you re doing dontlet him go till he confesses fred had cried holding ron feet together confess what he had asked desperately you know what why mum was so happy during breakfast george had said very loudly into his left ear maybe she just happy i back ron had tried she was singing under her breath and beaming at you she gave you three extra helpings i was hungry ron insisted that doesntmatter fred said seriously what matters is that she knows something and it got to do with you we need to know now so we can avoid whatever it is by all costs or find some way to get whatever it is you ve got the twins had been rendered speechless when ron finally told them and unfortunately been so excited at the prospect of ickle ronnekins getting married to hermione granger that they d proceeded to shout it as they ran around the makeshift house all in all it had taken the rest of the order a total of five minutes to figure it out and in response all had searched out ron or hermione everyone beaming and laughing at the good news it had been an hour since fred and george had announced their news for them and ron had yet to see hermione praying she wasnttoo angry with him for telling the twins he took a deep breath before knocking softly on her door who is it a small and tired voice asked ron decided not to answer as he opened the door to find his fianc e sitting on her bed looking at some book hey he said quietly shutting the door behind him and walking over to her hey she said distantly sitting down beside her ron took this moment to study her hoping to find only happiness on her face what he found instead made his stomach clench unpleasantly though her face was free of tears the remains of them were evident on her cheeks her eyes were red and puffy and ron could tell her nose was runny shocked and unsure as to what could have made her cry so ron instinctively reached for her hand intertwining their fingers surprised hermione looked at their hands and then up at ron what wrong he whispered trying to see through her with his eyes hermione simply shook her head and closed the book placing it on the nightstand it not about the engagement is it ron asked gently praying that she wouldntrespond with a yes again she shook her head no ron she whispered that all fine surprised ron eyes widened really i would have thought you d be furious with me hermione shrugged there no point trying to keep it a secret we should want to share this with your family sensing something hidden in that sentence ron challenged it what about your family he asked as softly as he could hermione looked at him directly what about them ron ran a hand through his hair well i mean engagement that kind of a sort of thing you d want to share with your parents hermione eyes bore into his i cantafford to be too picky ron you re family is like mine i just glad we have the chance to celebrate this with them then mione ron said taking both her hands in his own and looking into her eyes what wrong instead of responding hermione simply looked at him sadly and then reached over for the leather bound book she d been looking at earlier your mum just gave me this she explained curious ron took the book from her and opened up to the first page what he saw made his heart constrict there a picture of a baby ron with his parents waved up at him and then a non moving picture of hermione and her parents and then ron choked back the rush of emotion he felt a baby harry with lily and james smiling and waving up at him his eyes snapped to hermione who was staring sadly at the pictures your mum said she was making this for the three of us for graduation b but you and h harry he asked motioning towards the baby pictures she said she d gotten harry pictures from order members and dumbledore apparently she d talked to my parents as well ron it follows through our lives transfixed ron began flipping by page after page pictures of their first year at hogwarts began to fill his brain and then second and third and fourth and ron stopped knowing what he was looking for he flipped immediately to the last page there standing outside the burrow ron had one arm around harry and the two of them were laughing harry had his other arm around hermione who was smiling brilliantly her eyes shining with happiness ginny was in front of them grinning overdramatically at the camera the four of them were decked out in their hogwarts robes about to embark on their last year at hogwarts together but then again these carefree people in the picture didntknow that how true that statement would become shutting his eyes painfully ron shut the book loudly breathing hard it it hurt too much to look hermione had one hand on his shoulder and was rubbing his back comfortingly wanting something physical to hold ron reached out for her relieved when she willingly hugged him tightly his eyes were still closed but the images wouldntgo away harry first quidditch match harry and dobby at christmas harry and hermione dressed and ready for hogsmeade the yule ball the images all haunted him it hurts doesntit hermione voice asked not letting go ron could only nod his voice too clogged with emotion to manage words we were so close ron she whispered we only had a few more weeks a few more weeks and this album could have been filled with happy memories her words cut at him he needed to communicate to her that that it was harry that hurt him the most h his face he managed to say hermione let out a shaky breath and ran her fingers lightly through his hair the blank pages hurt more than his face it the knowledge that we ll never get to fill them that the story ends here i it doesntfeel right without him here does it ron asked hermione pulled away from him looking at him sadly she shook her head i know he was supposed to be your best man y yea ron said fighting back tears he was i just still cantbelieve what happened it seems like a dream those people seem like strangers now ron could only nod in agreement she was right it was hard to remember a time where everyone was together and happy sure they d had problems then but they were trivial well at least they seemed trivial now why hadntthey cherished the time spent together more why hadntron told harry how much he meant to him why hadnthe told hermione he fancied her why hadnthe been more understanding and kind to people like seamus and lavender why had he complained about ginny so much ron harry and hermione had had the heads up that the war was coming they knew what to expect and had been trained accordingly shouldntthey have of all people treasured every moment of peace before the war broke out why hadntthey taken the cues they d been given ron tried not to let his mind wander into the possibilities of what life would be like now had he lived life knowing that things would change but it was hard ron hermione said quietly propping herself up on her elbow there something else too we have a bigger problem on our hands then i thought she sighed immensely tired ron laid on his back he really wasntin the mood to deal with anything else right now what is it he asked hermione scooted over to him and leaned over him supporting herself with her left arm she was biting her lip immediately recognizing that as a sign of trouble ron reached out and moved some curls from her forehead trying to comfort whatever stress this news would bring hermione kissed his hand but brought it down from her face looking at him with sad eyes she whispered ron your mum doesntknow about harry it took ron a moment to figure out exactly what that sentence meant but after a few seconds he felt his heart constrict he knew what this meant but how he asked how could she not know hermione sighed i guess lupin didnttell them he probably wanted to wait for a better time but the two of us came here together doesntthat seem strange that we d leave harry out there hermione shrugged i guess they dontunderstand that we d never leave harry we came in here a mess so they probably thought we were in a battle or hurt or something they were all so happy to know we were alive i suppose they didntthink what about that book surely she would have asked about harry after giving you that hermione shook her head she said she thought we d appreciate the pictures since all of ours got destroyed in hogwarts rubbing his head ron let out a slow breath and the others the order dumbledore hermione shook her head slowly no one knows knowing what they needed to do ron felt a massive headache coming on this wasntgoing to be easy well then i suppose we need to tell them hermione smiled sadly yea we do groaning ron put his arms up to his head hermione scooted closer beside him and snuggled against his side it ll be okay she whispered we ll have to appear strong though the moment we start crying is the moment everyone will panic i know ron said quietly putting his arm around hermione both were silent for a few moments mione he asked yea are we going to tell them everything hermione sighed i dontknow they ll want to hear every detail i know you know i not very good at lying ron hermione said sternly we re not going to lie we ll tell them the truth just maybe not the whole truth well which parts do you want to leave out he asked hermione thought for a moment viktor she said finally viktor ron said surprised why because hermione said reasonably if there a mole here i dontwant viktor getting in trouble for helping us mione ron said comfortingly there not a mole here dontyou think voldemort would be here by now if there was we re safe now we donthave to worry hermione didntrespond ron hoped she understood it was a hard concept to grasp after days of running from the enemy there were very few people you could trust i i d just feel better if we left viktor out of it hermione soft reply came it was hard for ron to argue with hermione when she was curled up at his side and spoke in hushed whispers it made her seem like a child a child he loved and wanted to protect fine he agreed we ll leave viktor out anything else yes hermione said slowly i dontwant you telling them that you left me with aragog why not it doesntmake you look bad just me mum ll hit me over the head if she finds out i it a bad memory i dontreally feel like explaining it mione if you use that excuse then we wontbe able to tell them anything because the whole damn thing a bad memory for me hermione was silent for a moment but then ron felt her soft hands sliding up the side of his face oh ron she whispered kissing the tip of his nose i sorry i dontwant to do this either touched at her tenderness ron wrapped his arms around her pushing back her hair i just glad that if i do have to do this that i not doing it alone ron said honestly i glad you re here hermione smiled softly and kissed him again me too she whispered in his ear as she planted kisses along his jawline i glad you re here with me unable to stand a moment longer without a proper kiss ron reached out and guided her face towards his own it felt like forever since he d kissed her and it never got old in fact the kisses got better as his love for her grew most kisses they d shared in the past had been fiery and passionate desperate attempts to display their love before time ran out but now that they were safe ron felt an overwhelming sense of peace he didnthave to worry about showing to hermione one last time that he loved her she knew and he could take his time this kiss was simply loving it was comforting in more ways than he could imagine just the intimacy being so close to hermione was enough to make even his darkest troubles disappear and that what hermione did for him she drove his demons away and provided comfort in times when he was unable to do so himself sure he was dreading tonight on different levels but the fact that hermione would be there feeling the same emotions and thinking the same thoughts made him feel better and the fact that he could now reach out and touch her for reassurance made things different but the fact still stood that he would have to announce to his family that harry was dead it wasntso much announcing the death of his best mate that made ron so scared it was more or less the questions that would come afterwards and the story he and hermione would have to share of all people reactions he feared ginny the worst she was so sick so fragile right now he wasntsure how much more she could handle mmm ron hermione moaned as ron continued to kiss her what he asked in between kisses his mind now in reality breaking apart hermione paused to catch her breath ron smiled at the deep breaths echoing from both their bodies as their chests rose and fell in unison hermione gaze was soft but firm and ron knew that she was serious again ron do you think seamus and lavender are really dead she whispered the words obviously paining her to say caught off guard ron stared at her for a moment seamus and lavender as selfish as it seemed he really didntwant to think of them right now the pain that came with thinking about them was too fresh and it hurt too much i dontknow ron said seriously do you think there was any way they survived hermione asked her eyes seeking a certain answer ron tried to remember he remembered the sudden horror he d felt as he realized the mistake they d made but after that things were kind of a blur seeking into his brain ron tried to remember how things had been the moment before the portkey had taken him away lavender help me out quickly come on seamus cried out looking in the same direction she was snapping back to look at seamus lavender grabbed his hands and pulled seamus torso was now over the edge and he was crawling out hurry seamus hurry lavender screamed standing up and grabbing his hand once he got up on his feet they were sprinting across the pile of flaky ashes sending remains flying into the air as they sprinted for their lives lav hurry they re coming i trying suddenly they were revealed at the top of the pile walking with a sense of power and maniac glee lord voldemort himself followed by his death eaters were slowly surrounding seamus and lavender approaching from all sides h hermione ron choked run over there try to go back tell them to get the hell out of here seamus we re trapped no there has to be a way out seamus lavender sobbed we re trapped we cantbe there has to be a way out hello an ice cold yet amused voice echoed it was voldemort he had seamus and lavender trapped they were of no use to him he would kill them this was the end lavender and seamus were going to die screams were heard echoing from the pile of ashes but soon that faded away as seamus and lavender disappeared from him forever as the world went black ron slowly was brought back to the present as he looked hermione in the eyes frightened at the clarity of the memory he tried to hide his shaking hands shaking his head slowly he tried to keep himself under control no mione he said his voice thick i dontthink they survived at all tearfully hermione slowly nodded her head the room was silent for several minutes what about my parents ron do you think they re dead too hermione quiet voice asked ron wasntquite sure how to answer her he had heard nothing of attacks on the muggle world but then again it did make sense to assume hermione parents had been targeted i honestly dontknow ron said truthfully i can ask dad tonight would your dad really know of that though hermione asked ron shrugged then i ll go to the order i of age now they have no right to disclose information to me especially when it concerns my fianc e ron said as he took hermione into his arms again she leaned into them comfortingly thanks ron she said your welcome he replied kissing her hair like he used to do back in hogwarts hermione smiled at the gesture we ve got a full night then dontwe she said ron sighed yea we do we better get some rest if we re going to be up for any of it okay but ron yea i i really think you should go see ginny before tonight why ron asked concerned because hermione said she never came to see me or you i assuming i saw her face in the hallway ron it looks like she taking our engagement harder than anyone thinks and there some stuff a lot of stuff i have a feeling she been hiding from everyone you think she okay though right ron asked worried no hermione replied slowly i dontthink she alright at all she doesntwant anything to do with me right now and she trusts you more than anyone i just think you should talk to her alright i ll go once you re asleep ron said his mind on overload hermione smiled into the dim light you dontneed to do that oh but i do ron countered kissing her lightly on the lips good night mione good night and ron yea i love you good ron said running his hand through his hair because i ll need every ounce of that love tonight ron closed the door silently behind him walking as quietly as he could he turned left and began heading towards ginny room not really sure what he would find ron tried to mentally prepare himself for whatever story ginny would share with him it was a hard thing to prepare for he decided as he made a right and started down a long hallway war held endless possibilities ginny room was the second to the end on the left hand side and as he approached this door he took a deep breath knocking three times ron took a step back waiting for the door to open but it never did knocking again ron waited when he didnthear movement within the room ron gripped the doorknob and gave it a fierce turn the door swung open easily expecting his sister to shriek at the sudden interruption ron furrowed his eyebrows together with suspicion when he heard no such sound he looked around the room and saw no one either his heart beginning to race with paranoia ron slowly stepped into the room his wand lifted the room was dark lumos ron whispered his wand magically creating a dim glow of light around the small room ron looked around the room he couldntfind anything out of the ordinary but then again he couldntfind ginny either images began racing through his mind as he thought of his sister lying dead somewhere his hands began to shake as his clammy hands gripped his wand tighter ginny was fine there had to be some kind of explanation yet ron couldnthelp the surge of brotherly love he felt that sometimes got in the way of his thinking what are you doing a sudden voice asked him ron spun around to meet the confused face of ginny letting out a long breath ron hastily shoved his wand into his pocket going red and feeling quite stupid he looked at his shoes for a moment i said what are you doing here ginny snapped ron lifted his face to look at hers which was a mess with dark circles and bags underneath her eyes i i came to check up on you he said quietly check up on me ginny repeated spitting out his words why would you do that hurt ron stared at her with confusion because you re my sister he said calmly ginny gave him a scathing look and pushed her way into the room turning on the lights unsure how to handle this new ginny ron chose his words carefully and he added because i think there some stuff you need to tell me ginny spun around to face him stuff i need to tell you she cried you know what happened ron there nothing more to say ginny there a lot more ron explained i want you to tell me everything that happened you dontwant to know ron ginny said looking ron in the eye leaning forwards so that his eyes were only a few inches away from her own he said firmly try me there was no denying that ginny had changed drastically since ron had last seen her she was bitter and cruel about everything and she kept to herself when ginny saw him for the first time for a moment he d forgotten there was no war as he saw her face light up she d thrown herself on top of him and hugged him as if he were going to leave her mrs weasley had smiled but as he felt ginny shoulders begin to shake he knew she was sobbing and that was something very un ginny like but that glimmer of her old self seemed to be all ron was going to get to see now he was staring a stranger in the face and although she looked a lot the old ginny she was nothing like his sister ron challenged her with his eyes c mon ginny he thought tell me what wrong get out ron ginny said deep in the back of her throat gin i not leaving until you tell me ron said making sure to keep an even voice ginny face twitched as if she were suppressing tears she sighed why are you doing this ron she asked softly her edge gone now she just sounded tired jumping upon this a sign of her fa ade crumbling ron reached for her shoulders so he could turn her to face him because gin i donttouch me ginny cried twisting out of his reach neither spoke for a few moments ginny breathing hard as she stared at ron in fear and shame and ron staring at his little sister crouching away from him like he was some kind of monster the silence stretched into minutes and as ron stood still frozen all the pieces of the puzzle seemed to fit together pained ron finally managed to croak w was it really that bad ginny was it bad enough to turn away from me i your brother i not going to hurt you ginny didntsay anything she only looked down at her hands ron waited when ginny finally did look up he could see tears in her eyes all she had to do was nod before the tears began to leak onto her face without a word ron sat down on the bed and motioned for ginny to join him as soon she sat down ron put his arms around her the way he used to do when they were kids ginny grabbed onto him so tightly ron heart ached she hadntcried about this with anyone yet and then suddenly ron was angry how could his family his mother not realize how traumatized ginny was that she had probably suffered more than ron and hermione though it seemed hard to imagine how had his mother not sat ginny down and made her talk fred george his father anyone in the order why had no one bothered holding her closer to him ron rubbed her arms comfortingly sh it okay he whispered i sorry so sorry holding onto him ginny wiped at her eyes it okay she said through her tears i should have been there ron said feeling guilty as he said it you re here now she whispered i missed you ginny i was so afraid i thought you were dead ron confessed i wish i was ginny said so softly it was almost inaudible ron sucked in a breath and closed his eyes cringing that one hurt normally ron would have been angry and demand that she never say that again but ron knew now ginny didntsay those things she was serious and with that knowledge the comment had an entirely different meaning tell me about it he said trying to sound calm his heart racing ginny sniffed i was alone ron everything worse when you re alone what happened to the others ginny stood up wrapping her arms around herself as she walked over to the dresser her back to ron she was silent for a few moments picking at the wood in the empty dresser before finally spinning around to face ron who do you want to know about ron she said suddenly a fire in her eyes taken aback ron opened his mouth thinking because whoever you say i ll tell you all i know i not going to leave anything out and i not going to dance around the shit you either want to know or you don t startled ron stared at her for a moment or two what was he supposed to say ron tried to think of a response but he couldn t there were so many people dean he said his voice shaking a little dean had been the one person seamus had wanted to find the one person seamus was hanging onto it felt right to ask about him first since now seamus would never get the chance to ginny took a deep breath i was with dean when we first went out she said slowly some of us went to the right when the doors opened some of us went to the left i went to the left he went to the right i didntsee him again until hogwarts was collapsing i saw him carrying some girl in his arms trying to outrun the dust i was in the forest by then hidden underneath some bushes i could still breathe i watched the dust come up on him and eventually swallow him up that all i know ron there a chance he could have survived but i doubt he made it shaking ron nodded slowly trying to process what he d heard a chance chances didntseem to end up going their way in war to ron it was as good as saying she d seen his body putting his fingers to the bridge of his nose he sighed anyone else ginny asked her face blank of emotion ron looked up at her ginny stood before him like some kind of automatic machine ready to spit out information with no feelings or emotions attached to what she was saying angry at her detachment ron blurted out you ginny blinked a few times excuse me you heard me ron said his tone serious i want to hear about you ginny tell it all from beginning to end ginny gave him a pained expression you re acting like this is some story book maybe the reason i haventsaid anything is because i dontwant to talk about it you have to talk to someone ginny ron snapped and it looks like i the only guy willing to listen so talk ginny studied him tears sparkling behind her eyes ron felt a pang of guilt but brushed it aside he was going to hear this from ginny herself even if it meant playing hardball to do so i trying to move on ron she pleaded i told myself i wouldntremember what happened dontmake me do this it for your own good ron said reasonably trying his hardest to appear disconnected to her cries you dontknow what i ve seen ron i dontwant to go back there you ll drive yourself insane if you dontsay it aloud ron cried i dontwant to see you in st mungo s i can handle it ron i ve taken care of myself all this time haventi while you ran off with the golden trio i was left alone but i survived didnti ron cringed at her hurtful words but tried to put them out of his mind she was bitter she didntknow what she was saying ginny please just tell me i offering you help help help how can you help you still need help yourself just tell me why do you want to know so badly ron do you want to hear all the details of how i sliced my back open and broke the bones in my hand do you want to hear about harry death do you want to hear a play by play of how i got raped i dontthink so ron so just back off ron was quiet for a moment what about harry ginny taken aback it took ginny awhile to respond but when she did she sounded distant as if caught up in another world i was fighting death eaters on the east side of the castle she said quietly nothing had really happened yet besides people dying around me but after a while these two death eaters grabbed me and picked me up i tried stunning them but i couldnthold my wand steady enough to aim right who were they ron asked immediately ginny paused and gave him a look ron if you re going to make me tell you then you have to listen she said sounding much older than she really was sorry ron mumbled i couldnttell you who they were but i recognized their voices ginny continued they took me through the battleground to where harry and voldemort were fighting harry saw me and his eyes got all wide and scared voldemort followed his gaze to me and laughed he d made the connection that the death eaters had apparently made that i was harry girlfriend but gin you weren t you two met secretly ginny finished for ron it wasnta big long term kind of thing we both knew it had to be the kind of relationship that could be stopped if needed to be we knew the war was coming and that whatever we were would complicate matters entirely when the time came for war i knew what i was doing and so did harry what was ron to say to that how could he look down upon a relationship that kept his best mate happy for the remaining months of his life i sorry he finally said it okay ron ginny said ron waited several seconds for ginny to continue the story when she didn t ron looked at her and said sorry i interrupted keep going ginny took a shaky breath r right um where was i the death eaters brought you to harry and voldemort oh yes t that part ginny said nervously twisting her fingers together well harry couldntvery well come get me without voldemort hitting him with something so the death eaters started to do things to me to tempt him over it was pure torture for both of us she said quietly her hands shaking ron noticed and quickly put one of his own hands over hers quieting them looking into her eyes ron asked quietly what did they do to you ginny hesitated tears welling in her eyes t they started to take my clothes off she whispered ron sucked in a breath the statement created such a mad swirl of emotions within ron that he almost didntwant to acknowledge it almost afraid to meet ginny eyes afraid of the vulnerability he d see within them ron slowly lifted his eyes to hers ginny was crying that alone wouldnthave been so bad but it was the fact that ginny was so desperately trying not to cry that broke ron heart voice cracking with emotion he said o oh gin with that invitation ginny found her way into her older brother arms where she finally began to cry i it was so terrible ron she cried teardrops zooming around her face t they didnthesitate at all they were animals and they just attacked me ripped my clothes touched me one of them would hold me down while the other one had their fun with me i was sobbing and screaming for harry to help me b but he couldn t ginny sniffed her eyes and nose now red he couldntcome and save me at least not in time they were laughing as the first one took my virginity away laughing g ginny i dontknow what to say i sorry ron babbled tears of his own clouding his vision i just so sorry i ve never felt so small so vulnerable i grew up in a house full of older brothers so i was used to rough handling b but i couldntbelieve the hatred they had towards me one would hit me while the other slammed himself into me that was the one harry killed first stunned voldemort for a moment long enough to kill the bastard the other one was dead in a matter of seconds ginny said her tears never ceasing but then i had two dead men around me i was naked and exposed and i was weak all i could do was cry ron wanted to say something to find some words of comfort to offer his baby sister he wanted to find some way to make all these memories escape from her mind forever but the fact that he couldntseem to do anything only increased his anger of the world but then i dontknow how but somehow harry found enough time to race over to me he picked me up and put me behind a fallen tree where he said i d be safer he just wouldntstop apologizing and kissing my face he never even glanced down at my barely covered body he just kept trying to kiss away my tears ginny recalled the water leaking from her eyes only increasing as the memory progressed he cradled me in his arms and brushed back the hair on my head i clung to him so tightly i must have strangled him he never stopped to tell me anything except that he was sorry and that he loved me kept repeating that over and over again until finally voldemort approached him angrier than before since harry had killed three of his death eaters the next thing i knew voldemort threatened me and harry jumped up and began fighting him again that was the last time i saw him ginny said her body shaking as silent tears streamed across her freckled face he realized though that he wouldntbe able to keep me safe ginny said hollowly so he started shouting for someone anyone to come and protect me luckily colin and dennis creevy came running from the lake harry asked them to take me and keep me safe and without a word colin picked me up and we ran into the forbidden forest seamus and lavender told us that ron said emptily sounding like a robot ginny nodded and wiped at a tear did they tell you about dennis ron nodded numbly remembering that conversation he and hermione had had with seamus and lavender in the makeshift cave only hours after escaping from prison it felt like ages ago all they knew was that they d come across his body in the forest sniffing ginny used the back of her hands to try to wipe away the tears yes well we were running looking for shelter more than anything else i was clinging onto colin for dear life and he was holding me so tightly i could tell he was petrified and dennis the fire in hogwarts had just started there was a crash and people started screaming as they realized that hogwarts was burning people started fleeing away from the castle and we lost dennis in the crowd after all we were still looking for somewhere safe to hide as death eaters too swarmed into the forest eventually we just flung ourselves into some bushes and waited hoping dennis saw where we d hidden poor colin look so tortured i mean you know how close they were ron nodded knowingly colin and dennis had seemed even closer than ron was to his own brothers and that was saying something since the weasley blood ensured a strong family bond between all its members soon though we heard a death eater voice challenging dennis he was only a foot away from us dennis saw us peeking out through the bushes shot colin a sad look and drew out his wand it took only a few minutes for dennis to fall ron closed his eyes he d never really known dennis and admittedly had found both the creevy brothers to be extremely annoying as first and second years but over time ron had found to respect them for they represented much of what ron couldntseem to do ron would have thought that by now deaths of his classmates would somehow bounce right off him in a numb sort of way he would acknowledge them but not really understand the entirety of the news however ron found that dennis death brought a fresh wave of pain one that ron was surprised would ever be related to the youngest creevy brother colin must have gone crazy ron mumbled not wanting to picture colin reaction ginny misty eyes gave him all the answer he needed there was silence for a few moments as both tried very hard not to think about the pain colin had endured as he watched his little brother die finally ginny made a little sound in the back of her throat and looked at ron we just stayed in the bushes for hours colin refused to look at me i was still so weak i didntmove i just cried w wanting you or harry to come find me i waited and waited but no one came ron stomach tightened guiltily ginny anger and pain all basically came down to one point she felt like she d been abandoned and as hard as it was for ron to admit that he knew deep down it was true they d all left ginny alone in the middle of a war gin he said with difficulty it wasntlike we didntwant to come for you then why didntyou come ginny whispered her eyes reflecting only pain we couldn t he said lamely there was so much going on we all had to focus on saving our own necks ginny studied him for a moment as if judging his sincerity ron gulped under the pressure and tried to convey to her through his eyes that he was being honest but it must not have worked because then without a word she turned away hurt ron moved towards her ginny he said reaching out to touch her shoulder ginny whipped around so fast it took ron by surprised i dontbuy it she cried suddenly her eyes flaming you re lying to me ron i ve always been able to tell when you re lying stunned by her sudden anger it took a moment before he could yell what are you talking about standing up ginny turned to face him i want you to look me in the eyes and tell me that you honestly tried to run looking for me she cried ginny i i dontwant you feeding me this shit about you being so torn to find me when you didnteven make the effort i told you that we tried ron screamed his anger getting the best of him stop putting all of this guilt and shame on me i told you we tried i mean bloody hell do you honestly think i wasntfreaking out about you do you honestly believe that i didntwant to go find my little sister i was going crazy gin but i telling you that i didnthave time to run off and serach the forest for you ginny said nothing as she examined ron face which was now as red as his hair ron was breathing heavily looking down as he had stood up at ginny waiting for her to scream at him in return but she never did instead she said so softly it could have been a whisper you had time for hermione ron sucked in a breath as the words stuck him ginny couldntpossibly be suggesting she couldnthonestly ron brain simply shut down with the effort of trying to understand the full meaning of the sentence all he knew was that ginny had stuck below the belt with this one and it was hurting all he could manage to say through his pain was dontgo there ginny why ginny challenged because you know that it true i not stupid ron i ve always known that you loved her i ve known since the moment you came home for christmas holiday after first year raving about her and how she drove you insane you couldnthave known that you were only ten we always hate what we love most ginny said simply mum used to tell me that even when you said you hated me and wished i d leave you alone that you really loved me and only got upset with me because you loved me so much i d heard that for ten years it wasnthard for me to assume you loved hermione more than me when you came home that christmas gin you know that s and i turned out to be right didnti ginny said quietly as she smiled to herself in a strange sort of way and shook her head first year you purposely sacrificed your life for hermione and harry from that point onwards i knew that there d be nothing you wouldntdo for her that not fair to ginny waved her hand at him dontworry about it ron i ve known it for years it shouldntupset you it doesntupset me anymore but ginny turned around to face him squarely i had secretly always believed that when i was in danger you d come save me you wouldnthesitate and you d do everything you could to get to me you and harry trying to save me in the chamber of secrets while hermione was left behind in the hospital wing only made me believe that more daily you d love hermione most but when it came down to it i d be the one you d save first struck ron tried to open his mouth and say something but he found that words had failed him he couldntseem to believe she d thought all of this for so many years it was all wrong but then as he thought about it a little he realized that what ginny said was partly true knowing he needed to say something to break the silence ron tried to search his brain for something to say anything to make ginny know that he loved her just as much as he loved hermione ginny however saved him from saying anything as she continued i waited for you or harry to come for hours finally once the coast was clear enough and we moved out of our hiding spot to look for better shelter or refuge we met a death eater he pulled his wand out on colin colin barely tried at all he shot me an apologetic look and simply gave up i ran and hid as hogwarts collapsed from then on i was alone and i i j just gave up on you a terrible silence fell over the two siblings as ginny finished her face dry but her eyes holding more emotion than ron could bear to look at his head rang with ginny final words and his heart ached as he understood the meaning of them ron had known when he d come looking for ginny that it wouldntbe a happy talk but he d never expected he d known looking back that the way he d brushed ginny off in first year hadntbeen nice and sometimes he even felt bad about it but apparently ginny had taken it much more seriously than ron had and even after all these years the feelings of resentment were still there he d known that it had taken ginny a few years to really warm up to hermione but bloody hell he d had no idea how deeply ginny feelings ran towards his fianc e and within that thought lay the problem ron could see was tormenting his sister for a moment he sat in the silence quickly running through all ginny had told him and trying to see it through her perspective and when he was done a reasonable pile of guilt landed in his stomach ginny had realized the moment he and hermione had appeared here that hermione had been the one ron was protecting the one he had taken care of while she was alone in the forbidden forest for five days two of which she d spent starving and with the news of their engagement he supposed it was only fair for ginny to have assumed that hermione was now the one he loved most for a moment ron found it strange that he was dealing with ginny jealousy of hermione at a time like this when bigger problems like ginny raping the war and harry pressed upon them but the numb apprehension of actually discussing harry or the war with ginny brought him back to reality and he d found that the moment had passed knowing he had to say something now ron sighed and looked wearily at his baby sister gin you know if i d known you needed help i d have been there right i hadntseen you since mcgonagall took us from the common room i had no idea where you were or who you were with you re not being fair i was scared for you ginny but i was also scared for harry hermione and all the others too but you were with hermione ginny said not meeting his gaze ron took a deep breath trying to be patient yes he said but that doesntmean anything gin we were looking for harry our parts in the war were by harry side it always been that way you know that we were fighting the whole time to get to him but somewhere in there you got engaged ginny pointed out it obviously wasntall war and bloodshed there were enough moments for you two who werenteven going out before the war started to somehow make the leap to marriage ginny ron groaned running his hand through his hair i love hermione i do but i also love you too it doesnthave to be one or the other you re acting like an ex girlfriend that hermione replacing trust me you re my little sister no one can replace that you make it sound so bad ginny said quietly like the idea isntreasonable because its not ron cried gin i see why you re upset i mean i had no idea that you disliked hermione so much before that not fair ginny suddenly cried i love hermione like a sister you cantsay that well how do you want me to say it that i didntlike what hermione stood for i still dontlike it and what is that exactly ginny hesitated her whole body on defensive that she said in a voice barely above a whisper hermione will be the one to take you away she ll take you away from me ron paused before he spoke what do you mean he asked softly ginny eyes filled with unshed tears we d been best friends for my entire life until you went off to hogwarts i didntmind harry being your best mate because you both were blokes but i always knew i was your girl best friend until well until hermione gin and i knew that with harry now gone you d get closer to hermione but there d always be that wall between you two that you and i never had as siblings and now that we ll be married that wall will be gone ron finished for her yea ginny said quietly silence followed and with you two married and h harry gone i ll be alone ron finished again ginny only nodded tears now slipping out of her eyes and as he rocked his sister while she cried ron suddenly realized how much this war had affected them all and how much it had cost ginny he wasntsure what to say to comfort her but he did his best telling her that he loved her that he d never leave her that hermione in no way replaced her and that she wasntreally alone but they all sounded like empty words for they both knew even as ginny quieted down that the scars war had left on their lives would never be fully healed whatcha think let me know hugs haystack a n wow i cantbelieve i finally updating it been five weeks a terrible terrible record for me to have set though two of those weeks i had family business to attend to

including the character who died thirdly because of the classes that i taking this year i really need to devote some serious time towards school so from now on i d probably expect an update anywhere

all put up with a lot from me thank you thank you thank you this chapter is 20 pages so it extra long for you all hope you enjoy it much love haystack and so the story continues chapter thirty six bonds of forever for the first time in ron life he wasnthungry there were mountains and mountains of food stretching all the way down the magically enhanced table but all he could do was pick at his pudding while his stomach was busy doing flip flops of course ron had been forced to eat something he was after all sitting next to his mum but his mind was miles away ron had returned to hermione room after his talk with ginny his mind numb and eagerly looking forward to a long nap only to find a frantic mrs weasley wondering where he d gone he d then had 15 minutes to get ready before dinner enough time in ron book for a quick nap as he d told his mum who had then given him a disapproving look however it appeared that everything ran on mrs weasley time schedule tonight as dinner appeared exactly at six a time ron had made by two minutes he d slipped into the chair next to hermione who looked particularly beautiful tonight just in time to hear his dad make the toast hermione didntask where he d been ron watched with a familiar kind of awe as hermione smiled and laughed throughout the meal playing her part perfectly if ron hadntknown any better he would have believed her to be as carefree and blissful as she led everyone on to believing ron however knew she was petrified announcing to your family and closest friends that your best mate was dead was frightening in more ways then one but the fact that he and hermione hadnteven discussed how they d go about doing it added another level to ron fear he d watched hermione carefully throughout the whole meal to see if there was any way she was trying to pass along a message to him but she made a pretty good point of avoiding his eyes throughout the dinner in addition to watching hermione ron also kept a close eye on ginny she like ron had come in late slipping in and sitting in the corner where no one paid her any attention it was beyond ron how his parents could sit through a whole dinner without looking at their daughter who had once been the center of every meal attention mrs weasley cried raising her glass into the air all conversations simmered down as everyone turned to mrs weasley who was beaming yes well arthur and i had something to say molly said giving her husband a look that got him up in a second firstly i just would like to thank you all for celebrating with us tonight this engagement means a lot to m us i i dontthink it could have come at a better time and well i just so happy molly said looking around the table fondly everyone was smiling everyone except ginny his mum continued with her little speech but ron didnthear another word of it as hermione hand found his under the table sensing something was wrong ron looked up at her hermione was smiling at him but ron could tell it was a fake smile to throw everyone off her eyes were filled with fear and sadness and the way her hand gripped his own convinced him that something was indeed wrong quickly tuning back into what his mother was saying he heard so glad that everyone is here together and safe well of course not everyone but anyways thank you all to ron and hermione arthur said cutting his wife off and raising his glass to ron and hermione everyone echoed ron followed hermione lead and took a sip of pumpkin juice lifting the goblet up with both hands but as the sweet liquid slid down his throat ron felt sick for he knew that within a few minutes no one would be smiling and the war would once again set itself upon those he loved tearing them apart or destroying them completely everyone was to retire into the sitting room after dinner as guests mingled and chatted with each other slowly the table was emptied and ron was left with hermione as his mum continued to whisk dishes off the table using magic of course it wasntmuch time as fred poked his head in the room telling them both to hurry up and get down there but it was all ron needed pulling hermione elbow to get her closer to him he leaned in and whispered quickly what the plan i dontknow hermione whispered back her eyes alert i fell asleep before i had time to think about it and when i woke up your mum hurried me away to dinner ron nodded his understanding but couldnthelp feeling disappointed hermione usually was the one to come up with the foolproof plans ron loved to follow he d have paid quite a lot for her to have one prepared for tonight sighing he ran a hand through his hair what the best way to go about this then hermione bit her lip and shrugged i honestly dontknow ron i i mean we could just wait until it comes up but harry not going to pop up in conversation tonight mione i know that she snapped i meant the war surely people will ask us how we survived and such we can just tell a brief overview and drop the bomb within that but that doesn t finally all done a beaming molly weasley exclaimed her voice coming out of the kitchen let go ron said quickly steering hermione out of the room oh are you two still here molly asked poking her head through the kitchen doorframe no mum we were just leaving ron called out over his shoulder as they disappeared through the doorway and down the dark hallway ron what are you doing we still have to figure out what we re going to do about harry hermione cried as she hurried up to catch up with ron long strides we ll just have to play it by ear like you said just make sure you stay by me the whole time ron said pausing outside the sitting room doors it was a short walk well i would have done that anyways hermione said quietly blushing a little as she said it ron smiled and kissed her on the cheek you ready he asked one hand on the doorknob hermione took a deep breath and nodded her head and with that ron grabbed hermione hand and pushed open the door ah the newlyweds the happy couple ah how sweet fred look they re blushing right on george look at how they re beaming ron shot a quick glance at hermione he wasntsure what fred and george were playing at but her face didntlook happy at all in fact it looked an awful lot like what ron face felt like if grimacing at the sudden explosion of noise and attention counted as beaming then well he supposed they were beaming ron hermione over here an overly excited tonks said waving her arm dramatically to motion them over to the couch where she and some others were sitting walking over to tonks who was sitting with a gloomy looking ginny ron distantly noticed how much tonks was glowing he supposed her glittery bubble gum pink hair and her sequined outfit had something to do with it but as ron got closer he noticed just how alive tonks looked her smile said it all remus lupin was sitting on the couch opposite tonks and looked much worse than the last time ron had seen him however the old professor managed to conjure up a genuine smile for the happy couple as they sat down next to him tonks wow it been a while ron exclaimed hermione smiled warmly how are you tonks she asked oh i doing all right much better since i found out you both were alive and getting married that was the happiest news tonks said her face bright and happy yes we all were quite surprised by the news but it was by far the best we ve heard lupin said sincerely exchanging looks ron and hermione smiled at the two we werentsure if people would think it rash hermione finally said looking around at the other people seated on the couch mr weasley fred and george kingsley mad eye moody and some other order members oh rubbish i always had a feeling never quite sure but the feeling was always there you ve known each other long enough and you re practically adults now both of age there no reason why you should have waited especially in times like this tonks said ron grimaced once just once he wished he could have an ordinary conversation like the ones he used to have before the war even on a night like tonight their engagement dinner the war always lurked the unhappy guest that pouted in the corner and ruined the evening yea he said not really wanting to go in the direction this conversation was heading nasty times you re not hurt or anything are you lupin didntmention exactly what happened to you hermione asked concerned ron wished she hadntasked n no i not hurt tonks said slowly apparently not interested in going down this path either i was on the battlefield though saw enough to give me nightmares for life i was one of the order members trying to put out the fire in hogwarts after it collapsed i was summoned back to headquarters to help with the wounded who were coming in for a long minute no one spoke finally it was hermione who broke the silence have any of you heard anything about neville she asked timidly sensing the tension in the air we d heard he d been injured or something but we werentsure we saw him fred said his eyes downcast it didntlook like anything real serious just a couple of scratches maybe a few bones broken came across him in the forest that loony girl was with him george said luna ron corrected yea her i think he okay i wouldntworry too much about either one of them apparently hagrid was with them is hagrid here hermione asked curiously not right now mr weasley said but he should be coming with dumbledore tomorrow hermione nodded so what is dumbledore doing ron asked trying to keep his tone casual mr weasley hesitated looking around as if to seek permission go on arthur we re all in the order here a middle aged witch said whom ron recognized as hestia jones been trying to locate students sent out some emergency notices to the ministry and to families he still is headmaster even if his school is burnt to the ground arthur said and george coaxed dully as if this was routine and well arthur face turned red looking for harry it was as if time had stopped the world and everything in it had suddenly and miraculously frozen leaving ron mobile while everyone else was not his heart had stopped yet his mind raced miles and miles ahead of himself hermione grip on his hand tightened and ron knew she was frozen as well looking for harry how could dumbledore the greatest headmaster hogwarts had ever known not know that harry was dead how had he not heard how had he not seen and most importantly why had lupin not told him w w what hermione stuttered her eyes wide and fearful he and hagrid had been searching for a few days under invisibility cloaks they never found a body so they ve been assuming he alive mr weasley continued confused at their reactions but when they heard you both survived they decided to come back they want to ask you both some questions about where you think he might be he is after all our hope no no no ron mind screamed you re hope is dead harry dead hermione are you okay tonks asked concerned ron turned to look at her hermione simply had her head in her hands she was shaking not really thinking about what he was doing he reached out to her grabbing her hand taking that as an invitation hermione leaned onto ron shoulder he couldntbelieve it searching for days haventfound a body well of course they hadntfound a body harry was still in their prison cell he was sick this made things much worse finally having the courage to look up he was met with ten perplexed and confused faces what going on fred asked slowly his eyes darting between hermione and ron do you know something about harry mr weasley asked slowly comprehension dawning on his face ron scanned each face quickly tonks her face twisted into a mix of concern mad eye and kingsley emotionless but all business faces mr weasley suspicious face fred and george faces much like their father and ginny she was looking at ron but he could tell she wasntreally seeing him she d crawled back into that protective shell and her face was as blank as anyone s ron sighed and nodded his dad eyes grew wide what is it desperate ron turned to lupin the man only looked up at ron with sad eyes he wasntgoing to help hermione who had sat up now looked him in the eyes there was no denying the panic there but ron also saw a firm determination and he knew that she d made his decision for him they had to tell them what is it mr weasley repeated his eyes urgent taking a deep breath and trying to disconnect himself from the words and their meaning ron cleared his face of all emotion and said harry dead it was as if everyone had been slapped in the face no one moved no one spoke it appeared that everyone had also forgotten to breathe all were staring straight at ron and hermione tears welling up in some eyes and anger brewing in others no no that cantbe true emmeline vance an order member cried dumbledore would have known ron shook his head obviously he doesn t w we saw it with our own eyes ron george said weakly it cantbe true why not ron asked reminding himself of the eerie way in which ginny had spoken about dean because fred finished for his twin it cantbe it true hermione said quietly we wouldntsay something like that about harry if it weren t all color drained from his face hands shaking mr weasley leaned forwards h how he breathed all were silent waiting for the answer i would have thought that d be obvious hermione whispered voldemort several order members gasped the others simply stared their eyes wide and fearful no mad eye growled that would mean that voldemort won hermione finished for him he did he has this cantbe true how are we supposed to beat back voldemort without harry an order member asked shaking with the reality of it ron and hermione looked at each other sadly i dontknow ron finally said are you sure ron mr weasley asked slowly maybe it was a trick of the light or something maybe he was transported somewhere with the spell you said you saw it here we go ron thought bitterly r ron and i were in that makeshift prison when it happened hermione said quietly you were kingsley asked apparently shocked no one came out of there alive how did you escape lupin finished for him he sighed i ve had a lot of questions for these two myself perhaps maybe it might be easier to start from the beginning he suggested ron nodded slowly and took a deep breath mcgonagall pulled the three of us out of the common room right after the attack started he said took us down to see dumbledore after that harry told us he wanted to go out alone didntwant us to be near him in case voldemort captured us or killed us ron put up a fight b but we eventually let him go hermione said resentfully once the war really started ron and i we we were separated she finished lamely what do you mean separated kingsley asked i mean ron looked nervously at hermione she had asked him not to mention aragog but how could he explain it without ron left me with aragog hermione suddenly said who aragog mr weasley asked suspiciously hagrid old spider harry and i met him in the forbidden forest second year ron said is he dangerous mad eye asked his eyes darkening no well yes he was but he agreed to keep hermione safe until i came back for her or the war was over no you didn t tonks cried horrified you were going to leave her there alone you were going to leave her with a potentially dangerous animal kingsley asked ron that was a very stupid thing to do it could have gotten hermione killed i know ron said guiltily but we got reunited how fred asked shocked i couldntfind anyone i cantimagine trying to find someone again w well um she kind of came to me ron admitted all eyes went to hermione she blushed i i realized i had some things left to say to him she said softly you loved him tonks shrieked oh that is so romantic hermione blushed a scarlet red and shifted her weight uncomfortably mad eye snorted yes well anyways ron said trying to steer the conversation back to harry once hermione dug me out then we started looking for harry dig you out george repeated dig you out of what a building collapsed on me while i was dueling pettigrew peter lupin suddenly cried his eyes alert and his face red with an anger that surprised ron did you get him is he gone ron shook his head he got away before the building collapsed what building collapsed a sudden high pitched voice cried ron internally cursed because standing in the doorway with her hand on her hips stood mrs weasley her face stern a building collapsed on top of ron mr weasley explained standing up and offering his wife his seat on the couch are you alright molly asked coming closer to examine ron i fine a whole building ron she asked weakly part of one he admitted goodness you should have told me that when you first came in i would have checked you more thoroughly i fine mum ron said annoyed that the least of your worries he added under his breath what was that ronald ron cursed his mother always had acute ears always knew everything that was said no one said anything flustered she said in a discipline manner why are we talking of such things on such a happy occasion hermione why dontyou tell us your ideas for the wedding all eyes went to hermione no mrs weasley ron and i are telling everyone what happened during the war hermione dear there plenty of time for that later we can harry dead hermione said quickly staring her future mother in law in the face slowly all eyes went to mrs weasley the woman who had been most like a mother to harry the woman who d taken him in and treated him like her own son all eyes went to mrs weasley but slowly the eyes returned the look on her face too unbearable to watch molly had frozen not understanding but slowly realization dawned on her face it was as if her face was shrinking her eyes were closed her trembling lips pressed together it was as if she was shrinking away from the news the world reality and maybe ron thought that was what they all were doing hiding down below the ground celebrating and having a jolly time while people were still dying above them while harry corpse lay rotten by now forgotten and now just another face his face the face that had been both a blessing and a curse to him from the age of eleven was now unrecognizable he was one of many harry had not been the immortal hero many believed him to be he was dead wasnthe when molly did open her eyes again they were shimmering with tears whispering in a choked voice all she said was one word h how ron looked down at his hands voldemort killed him mum he said softly nodding molly weasley sank heavily onto the couch and began to cry big fat tears made their way down his mother face and although ron had seen his mum cry before it had always been large wailing sobs this it hurt him to watch because he knew that his mum was hurting hurting in a way she d never hurt before even after everything she d been through the two wars she d seen molly weasley had never lost a son and suddenly ron realized just how deeply his family love for harry had run it was beyond the point of pretending harry really had been a part of his family why dontyou two pick up where you left off lupin encouraged gently looking somber as he said it um yea okay ron said quietly his voice sounding strange over the silence he turned to hermione w where were we why dontwe just skip to the important part with harry hermione suggested softly her eyes locked on ron s turning back to his audience he noticed all eagerness had left their eyes and only despair and sadness remained ron sighed why dontyou pick it up he asked turning to hermione hermione nodded her agreement and even though it had been her suggestion she found herself at a loss of words closing her eyes for a moment she thought back it seemed so long ago to the moment that changed everything the worst moment of her life harry was levitated into the air his hands to his neck and his legs kicking wildly about he looked as though he were choking his face was a reddish purple his eyes darted around terrified and completely at the mercy of the monster who ruled his life there you have it voldemort voice boomed here for all the world to see is the boy who lived the hero the symbol of strength for dumbledore and his little army take a good look everyone remember him and this last moment when lord voldemort had him cornered and begging for his life this boy may be a hero to some but he is human he is simply a human who has never stood a chance against all the powers of lord voldemort so now my faithful followers here is the grand finale to a wonderful show tonight say good bye to harry potter no hermione breathed grasping ron hand so tight his knuckles turned white the world went silent as voldemort wand tossed harry into the air his body rose gracefully reaching its peak and falling back towards the ground where voldemort shouted something inaudible to hermione and harry her best friend disappeared into thin air as a brilliant gold flash of light blinded her hermione is she okay as ron looked over to hermione he found her crying her eyes were squeezed shut painfully and a hand was covering her mouth everyone else was looking at her concern and confusion in their eyes no one but ron understood a sudden wave of tenderness washed over him and silently without a word he gathered her up in a hug melting into his arms hermione held on tightly her face buried in his shoulder her tears wetting his shirt shh ron whispered kissing the top of her head like he used to do back in school it okay pulling back hermione sniffed and wiped at her puffy eyes i i sorry she said to the group it just that we understand dear mrs weasley said softly w was it really that bad george asked quietly lip trembling hermione bit it to stop more tears from coming she could only nod mione you want me to no it fine she whispered trying her hardest to give him a smile are you sure he asked protectively he hated watching her like this yea she said wiping at the remaining tears on her cheeks i fine alright he said unsure he still held her hand everyone waited for her to begin h harry hermione said voice trembling was in trouble she paused waiting for a reaction when she got none she continued her voice growing steadier dean came and told us so ron and i were running towards him when we got stuck in the debris from hogwarts by the time we got there voldemort had him at wandpoint his glasses broke and i always told him not to wear glasses during battle mad eye moody growled yes well he probably should have listened hermione said sadly why lupin asked because hermione said slowly the glass pierced his eye it was bleeding all over the place he was screaming wouldntstop screaming what did you do tonks asked breathlessly we tried to run hermione exclaimed but i screamed to him and all these death eaters came out of no where they captured us and brought us to that prison mr weasley and kingsley inhaled quickly mrs weasley who had been absent for this part of the discussion gasped b but how she sputtered our cell had a window hermione continued ignoring mrs weasley question we heard a scream and ran to it we saw harry what was he doing he couldntbreathe hermione said her voice sounding particularly strained voldemort had him up in the air he was kicking his feet about trying to escape voldemort said a speech and he was gone he was gone mr weasley repeated yea ron said quietly fell to the ground he was dead b but how do you know fred exclaimed maybe he just gone no hermione said softly shaking her head why not george challenged because we know ron said how the two twins cried out together because we saw him ron said we know that kingsley snapped no you dontunderstand hermione said sadly we saw him we touched him what do you mean mr weasley asked voldemort put harry body in our cell ron said hollowly his response was met with silence it was several minutes before anyone was able to speak again but the first to speak was mrs weasley what she cried out horrified as if it was a delayed reaction you cantbe serious tonks exclaimed we are b but why why would he do something like that mad eye shouted punishment he knew it would drive us insane almost did ron replied we escaped once we were being tortured in this torture chamber and you what mrs weasley cried that impossible kingsley said why hermione asked because no one comes back alive from there that been a proven fact in the first war all torture chambers were death chambers mad eye growled well we did ron said stubbornly they tortured us pretty badly but we managed to kill them we ran for it of course but got caught what did voldemort do tonks asked breathlessly shaking as she thought of the possibly answers put harry body in there for one hermione said then i was to come to voldemort room the next night to you know but you didn t right tonks gasped understanding what hermione had meant no ron shook his head because that night seamus and lavender came for us and got us out there was a hole in the bottom of our cell and he enlarged it since he still had his wand with him so you escaped mrs weasley breathed yea we did ron said quietly did they go with you an order member asked seamus and lavender of course hermione said then where are they ron choked on the lump in his throat he hadntthought they d be talking about seamus and lavender tonight it was almost worse than talking about harry because ron knew he and hermione were responsible for their deaths that guilt knowing he d killed off the only other two people the two people who rescued them when it could have meant their own lives who saved them from death and hermione from worse things he was sure he d never ever forgive himself he d been surprised by how easily he came to love seamus and lavender lavender had annoyed him back in hogwarts with her pettiness and obsession with looks and seamus he d shared a dorm with him for seven years and he d never really bothered to get to know him that well been annoyed beyond imagination by him and now he was in pain from their deaths life could be ironic in the cruelest ways t they re dead hermione said trying to disguise the pain in her voice but not succeeding oh the order member said shrinking away from her question because she no longer wanted to hear the answer no one said anything but ron could tell by the tapping of some feet and the twisting of some hands that everyone was itching to know what had happened to their two friends he sighed do you want to know what happened only if you want to tell us mr weasley said ron stole a glance at hermione did they want to tell them hermione watery eyes told him that she wouldntsay a word it was too personal for her to share it had been her idea after all sighing ron settled himself in for a long story we d come back to england and were looking for you all he began we were trying to think of where the order would base its headquarters we decided to try the huge pile of ashes that had once been hogwarts figured it was a pretty clever idea of yours we decided that two of us should go up and look while two of us stayed behind let me guess you two stayed behind an order member said with a sad expression on his face yea ron said quietly they began digging through the pile and we lost sight of them then suddenly they came up screaming and trying to run away but something had seamus foot caught by the time lavender got him out and they tried to run away death eaters popped up out of the ashes and had them surrounded voldemort himself appeared moments later but two of you had hermione and i even though we were fighting to try to get to them we heard their screams as we were transported here wow tonks breathed her face contorted into one of shock i i didntknow that lupin muttered quietly i so sorry they were good people yea ron said his voice thick with emotion they were great a soft response from their audience was heard everyone quietly saying their apologizes but for some reason all of the i sorry s only made ron feel worse dontapologize to me he thought i the one who killed them it was quiet for a few moments afterward before fred asked where did you go when you all escaped bulgaria hermione said exhaustion evident in her voice but how george asked stunned how did you get all the way to bulgaria we ran to kings cross and took a train there why bulgaria kingsley asked confused because hermione said reasonably it was far enough from england voldemort wasntlikely to suspect it and well i had a friend there that we stayed with wh mr weasley started krum george shouted triumphantly krum fred grinned broadly staring at ron ronnie and hermione in a house with viktor i cantbelieve it shut up ron mumbled his ears turning red as hermione gave a look to the twins yes well as a matter of fact ron and viktor ended up being friends hermione said sticking her chin up in the air i dontunderstand what you weasleys have against viktor he a perfectly nice it because ron been insanely jealous of viktor for three years george cried yes because he was madly in love with you the whole time fred agreed waiting for hermione to give some kind of reaction when she gave nothing but a small knowing smile fred face fell bugger he already told her you told her all that ronniekins um yea i did ron mumbled his ears and face bright red hermione smiled at him bloody hell we ve waited years to share that little piece of information with you and now when our shining moment comes you already know i swear we tried everything even had harry in on it but fred trailed off his face now serious everyone noticed and fell silent it okay fred hermione said softly it hard to get used to yea he said quietly it is i just cantbelieve it mrs weasley mumbled to herself i always believed we d win i know what you mean tonks said her face somber i cantcomprehend evil winning over good that just doesnthappen i feel so helpless hestia jones said what are we supposed to do just hide forever i dontknow mr weasley sighed there are still people alive that need to be rescued you think so an order member asked there has to be mr weasley said trying to sound sure of himself ron could tell he wasn t the conversation went on for a few more moments all words spoken in a quiet whispered tone when ron saw ginny leave startled ron simply sat and watched as his sister walked to the door and shut it behind her without a second glance back she hadntbeen crying or anything hurt and confused ron rose from his seat hermione automatically stood up as well she d seen ginny leave too you re leaving mrs weasley asked surprised yea we re a bit tired going to head off early thanks for dinner mum ron said as he kissed his mother on the cheek goodnight everyone goodnight came the mumbled reply yes thank you mrs weasley it was lovely hermione said trying to sound cheerful as they left their guests practically in tears now in the dark and deserted hallway ron let out a breath he hadntrealized he d been holding in the worst was over now hermione turned to face him we made it she whispered putting her hands on his face and pressing their foreheads together yea he breathed wrapping his arms around her waist and lifting her off the ground so that their faces were level we did how are you doing hermione asked running her hand through his hair eh i feeling better now that that over with he said honestly yea me too hermione replied it was such a question answer thing bloody exhausting he said i feel bad for them though that wasntan easy way to find out better that way then the way we found out i suppose you re right she sighed haventheard those words in a while ron smiled softly well i dontwant to spoil you do i she teased dropping her head onto his shoulder and hugging him wouldntwant you getting full of yourself you donthave to worry about that he whispered breathing in her scent good i like you just the way you are she said sweetly just like i thought you loved me he teased hermione laughed softly a sound that literally made ron heart leap it had been so long i do love you you pompous git she laughed really i might need to hear you say that again didntquite catch all of it this time hermione smiled a full smile one of those smiles that had entranced him as a young boy one of those smiles that still had him trapped in wonder all these years later it was the smile he d fallen in love with and seeing it now made ron feel like everything was right with the world again i love you she said seriously staring into his eyes ron felt his body tingle as he saw the love pouring through her eyes it was amazing that those words still held just as much meaning as the first time he d heard them good he whispered because i crazy about you hermione kissed him then a soft and gentle kiss that couldntbe described as anything but loving when they broke apart they both were smiling come on ron said putting her back on the ground and taking her hand let go to our room wait ron not yet she said pulling on his hand we still have to find ginny she probably went to her room for some alone time i ll talk to her tomorrow when she more calm ron i want to see her too she cried i want to make sure she okay she added much more quietly fine but this will probably end in another full blown drama i warning you ahead of time ron said sighing please i ve roomed with ginny for six summers in a row she one of my best friends there nothing i canthandle with her whatever you say mione or need i remind you that you two currently arentspeaking ron didntsay a word more as hermione shot him one of her famous i can t believe you just said that looks as they began walking towards ginny room as ron lifted his hand to knock on his sister door for the second time that day he sighed remembering his last visit here he knocked three times and then stepped back from the door no one answered hermione shot him a concerned look what do you think is wrong she asked ron shrugged her face still twisted into one of concern hermione bent down and pressed her ear against the door what are you doing he whispered confused shh she said pressing a finger to her lips what are you listening for he asked still confused and slightly annoyed by her brush off without another word hermione slowly opened the door to the room and stepped inside ginny she asked softly approaching the bed in the middle of the room the moment ron stepped foot into the room he understood what hermione had been listening for he could hear clearly now the sobs of his little sister echoing a bit off the hollow walls oh ginny hermione whispered as she sat lightly on the edge of the bed next to ginny whose face was buried in a pillow her back to the world hermione instinctively reached out her hand to rub her friend back as she cried shh it ll be okay hermione whispered sweetly as she rubbed ginny back ginny hadntsaid a word yet but hermione clear presence seemed to make her cry even harder what wrong please tell me sh it okay dontworry hermione whispered wiping a stray piece of hair off ginny face i i feel so bad ginny said through broken sobs hermione looked up at ron who was still standing in the doorway as though asking him to decode what his sister meant once again ron shrugged he had no idea what do you mean hermione asked patiently it took ginny several moments to quiet her sobs enough to talk but when she did she at least turned her head to face hermione i i sorry she said choking back another sob this time hermione didnttry to hide her confusion for what she asked not understanding this only seemed to make ginny feel worse as her shoulders started to shake again and the sound of her weeping filled the room hermione looked up at ron again this time her eyes begging for him to help taking another step into the room and closing the door he sat in a nearby chair leaning forwards close enough to hermione to smell her hair he said in a quiet voice filled with intensity gin tell us what wrong ginny seemingly unaware that ron had been in the room at all whipped her head around to face him he tried to give her a small smile but to him it felt more like a grimace ginny closed her eyes as if his smile grimace was the most painful thing she d ever seen and took a deep shaky breath i i sorry she repeated her face screwed up as tears still ran down her face but her voice much more steady why hermione whispered taking a bit of her sleeve and dabbing at some of the tears on ginny face the gesture seemed to make ginny want to cry all over again but taking another deep breath she managed to make it through the lump in her throat to talk though the lump had grown increasingly bigger i i didntknow she choked i didntknow didntknow what ron asked quietly trying his best to be patient ginny eyes welled with tears i didntknow what you went through she whispered that understandable we never told you hermione said ginny shook her head ferociously no no i was acting like like i was the only one you went through worse much worse oh ginny dontsay that hermione cried why i it true at least i didntsee didntsee him die ginny whispered her eyes closed as though the words cut at her g gin ron began his voice thick dontbe i never saw voldemort ron i wasntin that horrid prison yes but ginny i wasntraped hermione said softly you were bloody well close to it at times ron growled hermione shot him another one of her famous you re not helping the situation looks and ron shut up ginny ron and i had each other and we escaped we d been living like kings for days at viktors you were out there alone the whole time ginny kept shaking her head no you re not listening i i sorry i so sorry the way i treated you ginny couldntfinish her sentence as another wave of tears hit her and she succumbed into them shh it okay it shouldntmatter anymore we re safe now d do you think there a any way h he could have sur vived ginny sobbed no ginny hermione said her voice pained he never coming back as ginny dissolved into her tears and hermione reached out and hugged her ron stopped for a moment watching the two girls who hadntbeen talking in days hug and cry together and suddenly ron understood the impact harry absence would have on the rest of their lives besides the fact that he wasnthere harry would forever bond the three of them together despite everything else the order their friends and family they would forever be connected by the sacrifice of one life of the boy who lived and now the boy who died harry was supposed to have been the hope for the world now even though he was gone he seemed to be the only thing still holding it together that even in times like these when nothing in the world seemed right ultimately things righted themselves out and forgiveness always won a n what do you think let me know hugs haystack a n hey everyone well we seem to be having some difficulties apparently while away this month fanfcition changed some of their

moment or two to figure out where she was when she woke up the next morning strong muscled arms encircled her waist and drew her close but hermione felt alone opening her eyes wearily and looking around their vacant and darkened room she was only acutely aware of the tapping at their door too comfortable to get up hermione instead turned her attention to ron shaking his shoulders to wake him up the man didntbudge sighing hermione laid on her back for a moment temporarily ignoring the tapping at their door it was still early the person would probably assume that she and ron were asleep and go away at least she hoped so hermione wasntsure why exactly she was so tired sure she d been under a lot of stress lately but nothing compared to what she d endured during the war she was with ron and the weasleys and they were safe what more could she ask for harry her brain said almost automatically she closed her eyes and grimaced she hadntmeant to think that she didntwant to think about harry now she d had about all she could handle last night but despite her wishes memories and thoughts of harry shot through her mind it had only been a few days since she d last seen harry last spoke to him last hugged him but it felt like a lifetime ago she still couldntseem to wrap her mind around the fact that harry was gone for good that even when this whole mess was over and done with when life returned to normal he wouldntbe there and that was another thing normality she couldntimagine voldemort ruling the world forever but at the same time how were they supposed to beat voldemort without harry tired she tried to push her thoughts away ron snuggled closer to her right shoulder and despite everything she smiled leaning over hermione kissed his forehead and ran her fingers lightly through his hair but before she could do anything else the knocking got louder grumbling to herself hermione got out of bed and put on a dressing robe making her way over to the door i coming i coming she mumbled to no one in particular wondering who exactly would wake her up in such a manner hermione opened the door slowly all thoughts were gone however as she stared in mixed wonder and shock at the stranger outside her door she wanted to scream she wanted to cry she wanted to collapse onto the floor but for the moment all she could do was stare with an open mouth as the man turned around to face her a widespread grin on his face hermione was all he said but it was all that was needed hermione shook as if coming out of some sort of dream and stepped into his outstretched arms where her tears soaked his shirt through and through hermione brain was racing she couldntcomprehend everything at once how could he be here wasnthe supposed to be dead but as he hugged her tightly back hermione threw all thoughts to the wind it didntmatter right now she held onto him tightly but he pulled away holding her at arms length to check her over hermione gave a tear strained laugh i fine she said understanding what he was doing a smile somehow crossed his face sorry i just i cantbelieve you re all alive it s indescribable i know how you feel hermione said wiping at her tears neville watched her a grin on his face the whole time she smiled back warmly unable to hide the joy in her smile i cantbelieve you re here she said honestly how did you survive all this time i i just cantbelieve it how are you have you seen the others neville face was somber almost immediately it bad hermione really bad hermione heart sped up and panic gripped her what do you mean have you seen the others neville nodded slowly some of them who earlier on in the battle i saw luna hagrid ginny and some of the others but the past few days have been neville looked away unable to finish hermione touched his shoulder it okay she said quietly her own voice filled with feeling come on in i not exactly proper but you dontcare do you thankful for the change of subject neville shook his head you look lovely hermione smiled at him come on in i ll wake ron up ron neville eyes went huge he here hermione nodded yea he is she said as she closed the door behind him neville looked frozen to the spot as his eyes fell on ron slowly he turned to hermione you both are really okay it was all hermione could do not to cry so not knowing what to say she nodded and you two you share a room he asked as he looked around their small room hermione blushed as she walked over to the bed her back to neville shyly she looked over her shoulder at him we re engaged she said slowly watching his reaction hermione would have expected neville to be confused or shocked even worried for them but there he stood a smug look on his face there werentmany times in her life she d seen neville looking smug i knew it he said simply hermione shook her head had that many people really known she smiled yes well we finally figured it out she said leaning down so that she was eye level with ron she shook him gently ron wake up mmm ron mumbled turning away from her but then realizing she wasntin bed opened his eyes what going on he asked groggily someone here hermione said unable to hide the happiness in her voice ron sat up in an instant who he asked scanning the room his eyes fell on neville hey neville said approaching the bed ron face flickered for a moment but soon a grin crossed over his face hey he said back getting out of bed to hug neville as hermione watched the boys embrace she caught herself wanting to cry but not out of happiness for a split moment just a moment she d thought it was harry that had come to knock on their door the back of a black head had stopped her mind from working properly and as badly as she d worried about neville missed him she couldnthelp wishing that harry and ron were the ones re uniting however pushing her thoughts down for later she managed to conjure up a smile for the two does anyone know you re here hermione asked neville who sat down on the bed with ron neville nodded i came in late last night lupin was there he the only who knows he told me that everyone was here and i just assumed that didntinclude you two after all i figured you d be with harry ron and hermione made eye contact she sighed and pulled up a chair here we go again she thought how many times in their life would they have to re tell this story how many times was she going to have to pretend to be strong about this back in school hermione had been a pillar of strength she pushed emotions aside and focused on the task at hand whether that meant her studies or keeping the three of them alive but it seemed as if all of that time spent pushing her emotions away had caught up with her it was exhausting to pretend to be strong even for just a few minutes distantly she wondered if this was permanent was she always going to be a blubbering mess but for now she took a deep breath reeling in her emotions once she knew she had them under control she turned to look at neville who wore a mixture of pain and shock on his face ron had already told him silently thanking ron she made a mental note to do something special for him later he was too good to her how can he be gone neville choked sounding more like his old self hermione was stricken by how much neville seemed to have changed he was somber and wiser less frightened of the world but that didntmake sense did it how could neville experience war and be less afraid of the world his voice was deeper he sounded older dark circles were under his eyes and he d lost a lot of weight too much hermione thought he d been skinny before but perhaps the biggest difference in neville was the way he carried himself she d noticed it when he walked those few feet from the door before he d usually walked with his face looking at the ground and his shoulders up sometimes with his arms crossed in front of his body now his shoulders were back his face was up and he walked with a strange sort of confidence confidence looks good on him hermione thought as ron continued to answer neville questions h how will we defeat v voldemort with harry gone neville asked to no one in particular ron and hermione could only shake their heads it not fair neville continued rubbing his head as though he suddenly had a headache after all this time all that pain ron cast hermione a worried glance and she returned it coming over to the bed to sit next to neville it okay she said hoping her voice sounded soothing it okay but suddenly neville looked up to stare her in the face something he d never really done before no he said quietly it not okay y you dontknow what i ve seen these past few days have been neville took a shuddering breath to control himself hermione heartbeat quickened they d gotten an idea of what life was like right now on the battlefield now just a target zone but ginny hadntspoken much about it and now after all i endured i endured it knowing someone was somehow safe that we d manage to beat this back and i wanted to help it was the only thing that kept me going at times i just wanted to die neville stopped his voice too clogged with emotion to continue neither ron nor hermione said anything they simply waited for neville to continue which he did soon enough and now after all that to find out that harry dead that we ve lost for good he drifted off and hermione got the sense that he d said all that he wanted to say dumbledore coming she said quietly hoping neville would see the importance of this surely he has a plan dumbledore alive yea ron said he coming today neville gave them both a weak smile w who else he asked my whole family here ron said and then hermione lupin mad eye moody some other order members what about dean and seamus neville asked going through the checklist of the five boys who had shared a dormitory for seven years ron shook his head and hermione noted the glimmer of pain that shot through his eyes no was all he said but it was enough for neville who silently nodded his understanding and said no more hermione looked at her hands for a moment it strange the way things worked out she thought amidst all the sufferings and pains little miracles continued to occur it had been no coincidence that all nine weasley members survived not with the death toll as high as it was ginny and neville miraculously surviving seamus and lavender coming to their rescue the night before their deaths dumbledore surviving hagrid dog surviving while hogwarts lay in ruins harry dying it was all so fickle hermione wasntsure if she believed in any sort of god but sometimes she couldnthelp but hope there was picturing harry in a better place than the one he had left was certainly easier on her after all religion worked for people all around the world there may not really be a city in the clouds but dreaming of it could sure enliven the spirit yet in the back of her mind neville words played through how were they supposed to defeat voldemort the prophecy had fulfilled itself there was no changing it now it had said that one must kill the other that part was completed the rest described harry and how they could be sure that it was harry and not neville the only phrase of interest was the power the dark lord knows not but even with her necklaces that hadntbeen enough her brain pounding she sighed and looked at neville and ron who looked just as exhausted as she felt trying to smile she touched neville shoulder why dontyou go lie down for a bit i sure mrs weasley will be dying to thoroughly examine you she said softly ron and i can walk you down if you want no it alright neville said standing up i didntmean to wake you two up earlier it just that dontworry about it ron cut him off we re glad to see you we were worried about you you know it another thing to be relieved about thankful too neville mustered up a small smile yes well i could say the same thing about you two tell ginny if you see her that i ll come by her room later on today okay hermione said we will thanks he said walking out of the door a tense silence fell over the room as soon as he left sighing ron flopped down on the bed staring at the ceiling hermione mimicked him interesting day so far dontyou think ron finally said his voice running on the line between humorous and exhaustion very hermione said distantly her mind chalk full of thoughts seems surreal doesntit ron spoke what him just showing up on our doorstep like that yes i couldntbelieve it when i opened the door a comfortable silence stretched between them can i confess something ron said suddenly breaking the silence interested hermione propped herself up of course she said leaning towards him you see ron looked pained when i opened my eyes and saw him there i couldntsee real well since i was just waking up and all i really saw was his outline nothing specific ron took a breath and for a moment i just i thought it was harry hermione closed her eyes for a moment when she opened them ron was staring at her waiting for some kind of reaction i thought so too she whispered the memory splashing through her mind all i saw was the back of his head he got the same hair it just hermione trailed off unable to articulate the intense emotions that had surged through her body then she d thought for a moment that everything would be okay harry would fix everything they could win the war ginny could tell harry again how much she loved him ron would have his best mate back harry could be the best man at their wedding the world would have its hope back there would be no more war no more raping or torture no more suffering and death no more evil sh ron said gently taking her into his arms she hadntrealized that she d been crying i know it he never goes away from my mind i sorry she said wiping at her tears furiously i dontlike being weak ron just shook his head you ve been strong for as long as i ve known you almost too strong he teased it about time you let yourself be weak let someone else take care of you for a change he said as he wiped some hair from her face and then kissed her forehead merlin knows you ve deserved it i want to take care of you though you need me i ll let you know when i being neglected okay ron said gently for now just cry i not going anywhere and with that invitation hermione cried she cried about anything and everything she cried about harry she cried for ginny she cried for ron she cried for those still on hogwarts ground she cried for seamus and lavender she cried for dean and the others she even cried for dumbledore but most of all she simply cried cried for a world that she d once known that now was no more hermione ginny cried as she opened the door and spotted hermione lying on her bed a book in her hands surprised by the urgency of ginny tone and the way her eyes were flashing hermione put her book down what wrong she asked trying to calm the way her stomach was flipping i ve been looking for you everywhere ginny exclaimed stepping into the room mum sent me you and ron are wanted by who hermione asked her mind trying to think of who would call them like this her mind gave her only one answer dumbledore here ginny smiled he wants to see you and ron it was the first thing he said at ginny words hermione couldnthelp but smile as well dumbledore was here she let out a sigh of relief everything would be okay now dumbledore always had a plan he would fix this whole mess up life would be able to return to normal come on hermione said her face alight let go and with that thought hermione followed ginny out of the room xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx by the time ginny and hermione had reached the end of the hallway they were running where are we going hermione asked ginny as they turned a corner parlor ginny said over her shoulder they continued to run ducking people and objects in the hall hermione felt so light so free she felt like a kid again with no troubles or worries relying solely on adults to take care of things although however unreasonable it was to depend on dumbledore in this manner she couldnthelp it and judging by the way ginny face had lit up back in her room she felt the same dumbledore would pull them out of this sorry she shouted as she and ginny trampled by an already confused looking hestia jones hermione turned to catch ginny eye and the two girls laughed it feels so good to laugh she thought finally turning the final corner hermione and ginny slowed down to see a nervous looking ron pacing outside the parlor door coming to a stop hermione grinned at him he hadntnoticed her yet thanks ginny she said as she put a hand to the girls arm ginny squeezed her hand good luck she whispered hermione smiled thanks i ll let you know everything once we re done you better ginny said and without another word ginny turned around and walked away walking up to ron he finally noticed her presence hey he grinned walking up to her and giving her a quick kiss as they broke apart hermione smiled any new news ron shook his head no hermione tucked a curl behind her ear and wrung her hands together nervously so what do you think he going to say he shrugged it a shot in the dark really i mean he ll probably tell us his plans and what we think and such you re probably right she said absent mindedly staring at the door in anticipation you nervous ron asked humorously hermione turned to him and bit her lip honestly ron smiled no falsely hermione rolled her eyes and smacked him but she couldnthide her smile this was a sign everything was going to return to normal ron laughed there my mione i ve been missing never stops being a know it all he teased she laughed and you never stop being an insufferable prat yes we ve all heard that line before a strange voice said hermione and ron both spun around dumbledore stood in the doorway his blue eyes twinkling those eyes hermione fought back tears there had only been one time in her life hermione had known those eyes without that twinkle it was more powerful and reassuring than anything else hermione could think of if his eyes could stay hermione knew that everything would be all right caught up with emotion and not even thinking twice she approached her headmaster and hugged him tightly dumbledore was surprised but obviously touched as he hugged her back much like a father would hug a daughter ah ms granger dumbledore said so good to see you you too professor hermione said as she stepped back and wiped at a tear that had somehow managed to leak from her eyes professor ron said as he approached dumbledore his hand outstretched mr weasley dumbledore said fondly accepting ron handshake and placing his other hand on top of their hands i afraid it has been much too long since i ve seen you both i agree ron said giving hermione a sideways glance she nodded ah yes well why dontyou two come in we have much to discuss i afraid hermione looked nervously to ron who took her hand and led her inside dumbledore followed and shut the door behind them the wide parlor had somehow been transfigured into a study one that looked so similarly like dumbledore office back at hogwarts hermione had to wonder if maybe somehow they d been magically transported back to hogwarts it took her a moment to remember that hogwarts had collapsed that knowledge made being in the room almost painful i find certain things very comforting in these troubled times dumbledore said as a way of explanation as he crossed the room to his desk where he sat behind it please sit down he said gesturing to the two chairs that were opposite his desk pushing down the lump in her throat hermione nodded and sat down into the chair on the left dumbledore nodded at them as if approving the situation and then sighed taking off his half moon spectacles and rubbing his head all this he did in complete silence and hermione suddenly wondered if maybe this wasntgoing to be a happy discussion after all putting his glasses back on he looked at directly at ron and hermione who couldnthelp but stare at him expectantly they had no idea why they were there i sure you both are wondering why you re here dumbledore said trying to keep his voice casual and light but failing miserably but i surprised that you two arentused to it for years you both have been called to my office to discuss certain issues and tonight is no different unfortunately the things we must discuss are of grave importance and your answers could change this war and the outcome of many lives so before we begin i want you both to promise me that you will answer all of my questions honestly and with as much information as you can provide dumbledore said this all with such a serious tone it made hermione uneasy looking to ron he looked just as nervous and scared as she felt dumbledore paused as if to give them the opportunity to say something hermione wasntquite sure what to say apparently ron had nothing to say either sensing this dumbledore continued first of all i not sure what you ve been told but for the past two or three days hagrid and i have been out in invisibility cloaks searching for harry we have yet to actually find a body but when word came in that you two were safe and very much without harry i thought it would be wise to talk to you to see if maybe you knew anything hermione could actually feel her stomach dropping to the floor i dontneed to explain to you how important it is that we find harry dumbledore said quietly i also want to find him for personal reasons besides the obvious i believe hagrid and i will be able to use any information you two can give us i know much you both care for him hermione head spun this was getting so old she hated having to be the one to crush people hopes she hated having to tell this horrible story over and over again she hated watching people crumble their hearts crushed she hated to be the one who was challenged as to why harry had to die didntpeople realize that she missed him just as much as they did maybe even more she missed harry with every fiber in her body and would give anything for him to come back but he wasntcoming back and there was nothing for anyone to do she turned to catch ron eye he was withering inside professor hermione paused taking a deep breath we know more about harry than you probably want to know dumbledore smiled i was hoping so miss granger please tell me everything hermione hesitated and looked to ron for support one look in his eyes gave her all the reassurance she needed and with that hermione took a deep breath and looked dumbledore straight in the eye professor harry dead dumbledore appeared to have not heard her correctly he simply sat there not blinking not responding hermione wasnteven sure if he was breathing utter silence filled up the reasonably vacant room and it ate away at her all she felt right now was pity for the man harry had thought of as father for so much of his life but finally dumbledore closed his eyes as if in retaliation to the heartache hermione words had given him when he spoke it was a hoarse whisper a voice hermione had never heard dumbledore use before and you re sure of this he asked hermione nodded slowly we saw it professor ron and i were that makeshift prison our cell had a window and we had no choice but to simply watch v voldemort dumbledore seemed to sink even lower into his chair with each word she spoke she nodded gravely yes he had harry up in the air he could hardly breathe then he said an incantation there was a flash of light and he was gone dumbledore eyes flashed do you think it was possible for harry to have gotten transported somewhere ron finished for him hermione could only stare at him in shock interrupting the headmaster like that no ron said completely unfazed because much later on voldemort put harry corpse in our cell with us as means of torture we checked him thoroughly he was as dead as dead could be i see dumbledore nodded his understanding he was quiet for a moment or two i trust you both wholly so i believe everything you are telling me is indeed true we wouldntlie about harry like that professor hermione said quietly at that dumbledore eyes seemed to fill up with tears instantaneously i know miss granger i know silence filled the room again dumbledore wiped at his eyes and then began to pace i i ll admit that wasntthe news i was expecting to hear now the task at hand is defeating voldemort ron interrupted again without harry dumbledore finished well now that finding harry is no longer an issue i must confess i have another reason for calling you both here i not sure how this will come into play with what we must do tonight but it regards some of your friends if dumbledore had ever wanted their undivided attention he had it now who ron asked his fingers clenched preparing for the worst dumbledore leaned against his desk so that he was facing the two directly three of them to be exact who hermione echoed ron her heart clamoring i believe that before you two were transported here you left two very good friends behind in voldemort hands seamus and lavender are they alive ron asked jumping to his feet instantaneously a grin stretched out along his features unlike ron hermione sat still she barely moved seamus and lavender but they were dead they had to be there was no way they could have survived her heart was aching she needed to know and she needed to know now if they were alive that would mean no mr weasley i afraid they are no longer alive dumbledore said quietly ron face crumbled and his body shrank back it was a horrible thing to watch as ron wore his expressions on his sleeve for them to see they re not ron asked weakly no i sorry i hadntmeant to get your hopes up like that dumbledore said apologetically ron simply shook his head too caught up in his thoughts and pain to say much more professor what about seamus and lavender hermione asked trying to keep her voice even she didntwant to give away how crushed she was how her heart was bleeding all over again for their two good friends and guilt once more settled down into the pit of her stomach while invisible hagrid and i saw them trapped on top of the pile of debris that used to be hogwarts we snuck closer to have a better look voldemort was challenging them asking them to confess who they were with because he and his followers had definitely seen two others with them oh god hermione shut her eyes painfully they wouldntconfess and refused over and over again voldemort and the death eaters tried anything short of death to get any information out of them tortured them time after time stop hermione found herself whispering please stop dumbledore gave hermione a sad look and said no more on the subject finally voldemort had no choice but to extract their memories and then he killed them both he said softly with dumbledore final words hermione found herself shaking that was more than she wanted to know sure she d played over through her head how seamus and lavender might have died but that she wrapped her arms around herself it was too much they actually died for us she thought they died like neville parents did even lavender didntsay a thing and with these thoughts the deepest kind of grief came washed over hermione they re heroes she thought liking the idea of seamus and lavender one day being rallied as such as tragic and awful as their deaths are however the crisis on hand is that voldemort now has their memories he now knows that you both are alive and probably safe and he knows that there are other students still alive to help you the price on your lives has never been higher remember he knows now that you escaped dumbledore explained his face contorted into one of great urgency uh oh ron voice came hoarse but scared yes mr weasley things are bad and now he also knows that professor lupin and myself are alive hagrid too your family but most importantly he knows that there is still an order trying to fight him he angry very angry and will do anything to get revenge on us do we know what he planning to do ron asked dumbledore nodded gravely we know that he took a day yesterday to re evaluate with his death eaters how to wipe us out and tomorrow they re leaving leaving hermione asked confused but where are they going dumbledore gave her a look and suddenly it all made sense her heart began to pound and she felt herself go weak of course she whispered despite herself bulgaria bulgaria ron cried obviously surprised but why viktor hermione replied her mind recoiling against her own words he going to kill viktor ron face went white no h he can t b but what does that accomplish i believe he thinks you foolish enough to come rescue him and if not viktor is an easy target one that he knows will weaken you both either way voldemort sees it as a perfect opportunity to strike b but professor we cantlet him do this viktor in a muggle neighborhood he ll be killing hundreds of muggles precisely ron dumbledore said sadly and when he returns he expects we ll give him a battle to fight voldemort is no longer going to stop terrorizing the wizarding world remember his goal is world conquest he stopping at nothing now with harry out of the way after harry defenseless muggles are a piece of cake it was hermione turn to go white professor we cantlet this happen she said her thoughts resting on the muggles and viktor not viktor her mind screamed he helped us when we needed him most not him of course we ll try to stop it miss granger that has always been our job but i just dontknow what to do without harry if we have any shot at taking voldemort by surprise then we d need to attack tomorrow tomorrow ron echoed not believing his ears yes dumbledore said sadly otherwise we ll have the lower hand to begin with and with our numbers we frankly cantafford it but professor what about the prophecy is it even worth it to try to fight back now with harry dead dumbledore looked at her for a moment and hermione wondered if she d said the wrong thing but then dumbledore chuckled to himself and the twinkle returned to his eyes hermione relaxed not fight back you say dumbledore smiled miss granger we ve all suffered terrible losses in the past few days our hope is dead with harry dead he of all people fit the prophecy but you are forgetting that he had a power the dark lord knew not harry himself looked over this line many times frankly i do no know what power he possessed that we re not aware of but i believe its fair to assume it still with us with or without the prophecy i believe you agree with me that we need to fight this battle but i also believe that this is our last chance life rarely grants a second chance at things and i do not think we would want to miss this our only hope in restoring the world back to normal is in defeating voldemort and his followers the world is counting on us to fight back again without this evil will indeed take over the world and in that i dare not think about what would happen so yes miss granger i do believe it worth it to fight tomorrow it worth it because this war is personal now you can fight for seamus and lavender you can fight for harry i believe they will be the ones to bring us to victory their sacrifices will bring peace to this world but of course the real question here is are you willing to fight again are you willing to face the fears you ve made in the past few days are you willing to face death in the face after only just leaving him willing to sacrifice your life and join those who have already it all up to you this is our last chance we have to put everything we have into it or else the world as we know it will be no more silence followed and then we re willing ron and hermione said looking at each other dumbledore smiled i knew you would be a n teehee and we have another war on our hands let me know what you think hugs haystack a n well here it is sorry if the update took a little longer but with christmas just around the corner i frantically rushing around town trying to buy gifts for everyone plus finals are closer than i would like and my teachers are being ruthless thanks again for the reviews from chapter five and i hope you like this chapter bhekie thanks for your constant reviews i agree seamus is a git but i really like him anyways lol shimmeringevil you ve given me a challenge now try to beat chapter four hmm i ll have to think about this lol no seriously thanks so much for reviewing legofiance my problem is that i really want to move the story along and it very hard to do that when things are awkward between r hr so you ll see a pattern in my writing from now until my third big plot point where things are awkward with r hr but get better then get awkward again and so on it somewhat annoying but i think once i past that third plot point things ll just flow from there thanks so much for reviewing amychris dontworry about reading when i update i understand how life catches up you it meant a lot when you said this story was one of the best on the site because i ve read some really great ones thanks so much xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx chapter six midnight rain ron sudden new interest in eggs wasntjust a one time thing he ate his eggs every morning now something that confused hermione greatly and there were other things she d noticed about ron that were different hermione was forever scolding him of walking ahead of her he claimed it was his longer legs but now suddenly either his legs had shrunk which hermione doubted greatly or he was making an attempt of walking side by side with her she no longer could shake her head and lecture him on taking his own notes before giving him hers because suddenly ron was taking his own and the big change happened two days later after throwing his typical insults that usually made ron pummel him into the ground draco malfoy waited for a reaction of some kind instead ron just turned his back on the slytherin much to the gaping looks from not only malfoy cronies and malfoy himself but harry and hermione as well it was then that she knew something was up hermione was well aware that many times she misjudged ron thinking less of him than she should but no matter how great she thought of him now it wasntenough to explain this it was unlike anything she d ever seen before and it intrigued her ron seemed not to notice and harry sat there fuming at him for some unknown reason to her every time now that ron would place the eggs inside his mouth harry would narrow his eyes staring at him chew dribbling his fingers on the table as though trying to annoy rom enough to make him spit them out obviously harry found something terribly wrong in ron change hermione herself couldntdetermine her feelings towards it and so here she found herself walking about the grounds at midnight in the rain so many people disliked the rain but to hermione it was the most beautiful and precious thing a person could witness the tiny beads of water that fell from the heavens only to disappear the moment something hit them rain just seemed to make everything seem less complicated and so good even the most evil thought couldntseem to have effect on her if the cold droplets were hitting her skin because the rain washed all wicked thoughts from her mind and she concentrated on the miracle she was witnessing and then she would get this bubble of joy that would burst from inside of her making her laugh and throw her arms up to the skies sometimes she would dance about like she was doing now and other times she would simply sit and close her eyes and relish in that calm aura that seemed to drown out any other feeling she possibly might have been feeling before once she finished her little dance she decided to walk around the lake and so she set off determined to keep her mind blank for as long as possible because if she didn t then the thoughts would come crashing down upon her like a hurricane washing her away from everything she knew and eventually drowning her xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ron weasley wasntsure why he had awoken especially since he d been told he slept like a dead tree well maybe it hadntbeen those exact words he thought to himself but there had definitely been something dead in the sentence rubbing his eyes and sitting upon the edge of his bed he looked around the dormitory to see if possibly there was some explanation to his awakening nothing met his eyes but four dark figures lying in their respectable beds he sighed and looked out the window it was raining since he was wide awake ron just decided that he might as well sneak down into the kitchens to get a glass of milk throwing some jumper he couldnttell which since it was dark over his head he tried to walk as carefully as he could across the wooden floorboards instead he tripped over someone trunk and fell with an oof but no one stirred strange ron thought that the rain makes them all sleep soundly while it the reason i awake shaking his head he continued down the dark staircase and into the common room the only light coming from the fireplace but as he passed by the large bay window something caught his eye moving closer to the window to examine the thing better he realized with a start that it was a person a girl she was too far away for him to tell who she was except that she had rather long hair entranced he watched as she walked arms wrapped around herself across to where that large oak tree was she mental he screamed inside doesntshe know that lightning strikes trees that those are the first things you re supposed to avoid in a storm but apparently there were quite a few things this girl either didntknow or didntcare about because then she lifted her arms to sky and began to twirl and skip about she laughed to herself and continued in her carefree blissful dance and ron weasley felt his heart constrict the way she gracefully moved about the innocence that was clearly a quality in her because who else but those child at heart liked to go for walks in the rain and the happiness that was radiated from her in such a way that ron could feel it from within the thick castle walls absolutely captivated by this mysterious girl he sat there his head almost touching the cold glass his thoughts racing about her identity for this was the kind of lass that blokes only imagined about in their minds she was too perfect for ron to think about he had to know who she was his warm glass of milk that he had been looking forward to with such enthusiasm now suddenly seemed like the last thing on his mind daring himself to rip his eyes away from her he raced through the portrait hole and down the corridors leading to the grounds he couldntlet her get away tearing open the heavy mahogany door he stepped into the last corridor that really wasntmuch of a corridor so much as it was shelter from the rain and there she was so much closer than he felt privileged to be she hadntnoticed him yet hadntheard his ragged breaths or pounding heart hadntsensed his presence and ron was grateful for that moving a bit to get a better view of her he feasted his eyes upon her in some desperate attempt to remember her features so that he could find her again with the rain her hair was damp so it was too hard to see the natural color of her hair but ron suspected it to be a darker color not blonde he was still too far away to see her eye color so he tried less obvious features she seemed like she could come up to about his shoulder probably an inch or two higher than that but not more she was over all petite and walked with an air about her not an arrogant one mind you just an air that she knew things you didn t it the same feeling i get around hermione sometimes ron thought to himself as he snuck even closer to her there now now he could see her lips her dainty nose her rosy cheeks the faint tiny freckles that looked as though they had been splattered on her face her wait ron heart stopped beating she looks just like hermione ron asked so much surprise and confusion in his voice that he didnteven bother hiding it the girl whipped her head around at his voice ron she shrieked what are doing out here he asked now simply more confused than anything where was that girl and what the bloody hell was hermione doing out here in the cold i i was just walking around she said still staring at him with those gorgeous wide brown eyes at midnight he inquired forcing himself to concentrate on the situation at hand instead of staring lovingly at her eyes yes she blushed i couldntsleep in the rain i love the rain oh ron said taking a moment or two to study her the way her hair had flown when she d whipped her head around to see him it was the same way that girl hair had flown when she twirled around but no it was impossible that would be suggesting that hermione was that beautiful mysterious innocent exotic girl the one that made him react the way he did to veelas the one who he had just sprinted here to see afraid she might leave the one who took walks by herself in the rain at midnight the one who looked so innocent and carefree the one who danced in the rain and then it hit him hit him so hard the wind was almost knocked out of him of course it was hermione he should have suspected from the beginning she was the only girl he d ever known who could make his stomach perform those tricks the only who gave him that warm feeling like he was floating upon air it always had been and it always would be hermione he d realized before that he was in love with this wonderful girl standing in front of him but to ron his love for her had never been so strong she was everything he wanted and admired and he wanted her to be his but she couldntbe hermione was his best friend nothing more and understanding that made his heart sink ron you there hermione asked a dazed out ron yea sorry he said clearing his throat trying to clear his face of the emotion he d just felt what are you doing up i really am surprised you usually sleep like a dead log during thunderstorms that was it she was the one who always said that a dead log i ll have to remember that for later he thought shrugging he ran a hand through his red hair only to find it sopping wet i dontknow actually just couldntget back to sleep he said now giving his head a shake to rid his hair of the water unfortunately since it was still raining all he did was splatter water everywhere ah ron you re getting me wet she laughed who cares you re already more wet than if you d gone for a swim in the lake suddenly he laughed when he saw her reaction to the evil grin he had currently spread across his face in relation to his brilliant idea ron no she cried trying hard not to smile oh yes miss granger i think you fancy a swim ronald weasley you will not toss me into the lake she tried to sound stern but both could tell she was failing miserably i never said anything of the sort he said triumphantly ron please ah she screamed as he easily scooped her into his arms running as fast as he could to the lake edge ron put me down this instant alright ron remarked childishly throwing her into the ice cold lake he waited for a few moments for her to resurface ronald weasley he heard her scream a laugh dancing throughout her words he beamed yes poppet help me up this instant of course he said bending over and offering her his hand and as he did hermione yanked his arm as if to pull him in as well but unfortunately for hermione ron had seen that move coming and quickly backed away pulling her out with him but the way physics worked out hermione wet form ended up on top of ron s it took both of them several moments to play back in their minds what exactly had happened and how they had ended up in this position both looked at the other uneasily ron senses currently on overdrive not sure where to carry it from here ron hermione asked softly yea he replied can i ask you a question sure he said nervously can you give me an honest answer she asked readjusting herself to that her legs were no longer on ron s but rather on the side her hands supporting her up i i ll try why do you suddenly eat your eggs my eggs ron repeated unable to comprehend that after that serious introduction they were going to talk about what he ate for breakfast yes well i i not exactly sure i think you are why would you say that miss granger because it not just the eggs ron it taking your own notes not walking ahead of me here she paused and not fighting with malfoy everything i usually scold you for ron sighed and his stomach twisted she had noticed did you ever think that just maybe all of your constant nagging finally got to me all of that in one week how do you know my taste buds didntjust change that i was sick of waiting for you to catch up to me or that i d greatly matured and decided that malfoy was a bag of dragon dung not worth looking at he smiled hermione sighed and got more comfortable on the grass leaning against ron more i serious why does it matter to you so much anyways i d have thought you d be beaming so did i she mumbled under her breath what was that i hermione paused not entirely sure if she really wanted to say aloud what she was thinking deciding to keep her mouth shut she turned away from him and moved over never mind ron heart sank as her warmth left him sitting up and scooting over to her he sighed and said softly look did it ever cross your mind that maybe i wanted to make you happy well he thought to himself wanting to impress you is somewhat along those lines make me happy she repeated but why would you think you re always nagging me about things like that i just figured it d probably get old saying the same things over and over again for seven years so i decided to put you out of your misery put me out of my misery yes oh she replied looking at the wet grass with mock interest isntthat what you want her bottom lip trembled and she was silent for many moments trying quiet the sob that was occurring inside her of course it is why wouldnti want that ron studied her face carefully that what you want that what i want she declared proud of her seemingly strong voice you know hermione ron began still watching her when people get things that they want arentthey usually happy i happy she said stubbornly you dontlook happy well i am she cried out defensively no you re not ron said so softly it could have been considered a whisper look at me no why not b because because you re about to cry and you dontwant me to see that it isntit not trusting herself to speak she nodded why are you crying he whispered placing a hand on her shoulder but refusing to do anything more than that for fear that he wouldntbe able to handle it could it be that maybe it not what you want again she nodded ron smiled sadly i thought so i dontwant you to change for me she suddenly burst out her voice only wavering a little why not he asked staring deeply into her eyes because i like you the way you are ron she said seriously placing a hand on the side of his face making ron pulse go into overdrive and as mental as this may sound but i enjoy reminding you about little things like that why because i a bossy know it all who likes to be in control of things she joked no you re not he said defensively she shrugged i know it true and i know that what a lot of people say behind my back i just a silly bookworm frizzy haired muggleborn impulsively before ron understood what he was doing he quickly placed a hand over hermione mouth instantly shutting her up his eyes were burning with anger and he knew it dontyou ever say that about yourself he said in a low voice hermione looked at him strangely ron i distinctly remember you saying those exact words in first year well i was a thick headed prat who couldnttell right from left he said angrily please he softened his voice dontever say that about yourself again you re so much more than that and you know it hermione opened her mouth in order to respond but her voice seemed not be working she was looking at ron in a way indescribable eyes filled to the brim with unshed tears i mean you re the smartest witch to have passed through hogwarts you re responsible trustworthy brave a great friend beautiful car you think i beautiful she interrupted a slightly confused look on her face obviously ron thought no bloke ever told her that and for a moment ron was mad at all of the boys who talked all about her raving about how pretty she was but never once bothered to tell her well you shouldntbe talking
