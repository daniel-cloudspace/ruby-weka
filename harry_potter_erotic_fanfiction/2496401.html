 he knew about sphinxes despite most peoples opinion he had actually gleaned something from 6 odd years of schooling he couldntgive you the exact quote from fantastic beasts and where to find them but he knew enough not to run away screaming at the sight of the beasts that was a sure way to get your head sliced clean off your body by a huge cat like paw he stood frozen there was a huge metallic door in front of them the blue flames of the torches cast weird dancing reflections onto its ornately carved surface one of the massive monsters slowly blinked her almond shaped eyes and turned her gaze towards the four paralyzed teenagers in front of her you may hear our riddles or you may back away now she said her voice was low and rumbling and caused the hairs to prickle on the back of draco neck cantwe hear the riddles and then back away asked potter uncertainly no replied the other sphinx flatly potter turned slightly green the trio exchanged significant glances potter looked at him surprise at the consultation draco merely shrugged what the hell why not getting sliced to bits in here or going outside and getting blown to bits by death eaters he d take his chances ok said potter drawing a deep breath he looked scared but determined draco knew that expression all too well could potter be human nah the sphinx voice resonated at a low purr as she spoke her voice rising at a rhythmic hum that seemed to fill the entire cavern what blossoms in the morning bears fruit in the afternoon and wilts in the evening but lives and breathes without petals or leaves they were all silent for a moment then granger stepped forward who else thought draco he might have sneered but he was a little too terrified at the moment a woman she said clearly her voice pierced the stillness of the cave echoing off the many faceted walls maiden mother and crone correct said the first sphinx her beautiful impassive face showing hints of what could have been a smile you may step beyond the doors creaked open revealing a rectangle of inky blackness in the space beyond granger walked forward and stepped over the threshold of the door the rest of them moved to follow her but the second sphinx emitted a low growl which froze them in their tracks she has proven herself she alone may pass it fixed them with an icy stare you may not granger looked as shocked as they did draco could almost see what she was thinking reflected in the terror in her eyes they were all quite unlikely to be able to solve the riddles without her aid conceited as it sounded without warning the second sphinx began speaking again what can run but never walks has a mouth but never talks has a head but never weeps has a bed but never sleeps draco tried desperately to stay calm potter and weasley looked as though they were thinking very hard or possibly like they were in immense pain perhaps both thinking probably didntcome naturally to them potter looked ready to open his mouth draco felt a thrill of terror a wrong answer would get them all sliced to ribbons it a river said draco loudly cutting potter off i was going to say that said potter indignantly correct draco couldntsuppress a smug grin as he strode forward and stood next to granger side granger looked stunned she was giving him that look again like she had never seen him before which was ridiculous she had seen him almost everyday for the past six years why did she have to look at him like that with a look that wasntexactly the look of seething contempt she usually threw at him she hadnt really been any kinder to him recently should she be why did he even care and why why did he kiss her or maybe she kissed him yes that must have been it she kissed him because she was a filthy mudblood harlot yeah that was it he was confused and grieving and she took advantage of him she was horrible draco sighed yeah right potter and weasley were looking nervously at each other again the first sphinx had already asked another riddle what does man love more than life fear more than death or mortal strife what the poor have the rich require and what contented men desire what the miser spends and the spendthrift saves and all men carry to their graves potter looked at weasley who nodded reassuringly another misguided attempt at chivalry no doubt idiot nothing said potter exhaling sharply the answer is nothing at all correct the first sphinx nodded again the second sphinx turned his piercing gaze onto weasley who looked rather pale i have a head but not a face with crooked teeth but not a mouth i can take you any place with the twist of my head and the grasp of my brow what am i well er weasley grasped the back of his neck with his hand shuffling nervously from beside draco granger looked as though she were quite ready to explode and scream the answer at the top of her lungs weasley furrowed his brow then slowly a look of comprehension crossed his face you re a key said weasley brightly it a key he looked surprised the second sphinx nodded and bowed its large head weasley stepped forward through the doors and joined his friends looking immensely relieved they all immediately took off down the passage draco could hear the metal doors grating against the stone as they swung shut behind them that cheating you know weaselbee draco hissed superiorly in his ear weasley looked thoughtful for a moment sod off malfoy he grumbled 000 they walked for what seemed like ages the torches were much sparser in this stretch of cave making it even darker and more unsettling than the rest of the tomb hermione looked at her watch they had been traveling since early in the morning do you want to stop for awhile and rest she asked them feeling rather like a mother hen ron and harry were embroiled in a debate about quidditch and malfoy was skulking silently along in front of them harry looked thoughtful well i suppose it wouldntbe a bad idea he said do you think it safe asked ron uncertainly he gazed around at the walls of the cave as if expecting acromantulas to start pouring out of every crevice in the rock we could take turns taking watch or something he offered i dontthink that necessary said hermione shaking her head nothing in here is free roaming locations are specific we should be fine alright shrugged ron they all conjured pillows and settled down she harry and ron slept on one side of the narrow strip of passage through the cave while malfoy slept on the opposite side hermione felt odd sleeping inside a cave let alone a cave that was also an elaborate tomb but she was rather exhausted and decided it didntmatter she felt safe with her friends by her side she curled up against her pillow and closed her eyes she could almost hear the cave whispering to her as she drifted off to sleep hermione was standing in the window of a high tower overlooking the hogwarts grounds the rolling hills and trees she was used to seeing seemed different somehow but not unfamiliar she extended her hand forward and a large white eagle fluttered down onto it steely talons glinting in the sun her hand was different too slightly paler than usual with long graceful fingers and adorned with a billowing dark blue sleeve she turned and surveyed her chambers as a sharp knock sounded from behind her the room was decorated in rich shades of deep blue and bronze with lavish velvety hangings and golden finish there were books and papers littering every available surface maps arithmancy runes telescopes history texts potions books every discipline imaginable she turned to a mirror and caught sight of her face it was white and smooth with dazzling blue eyes a sheet of jet black hair cascaded down her back in loose silky waves come in called a feminine voice that like the body was not her own the door swung open a man entered he had black hair and pale skin as well though his eyes were cold and black the robes he was wearing looked exquisitely expensive and were deep green trimmed delicately with silver rowena he began hermione turned haughtily towards the window waving her hand so that the eagle swooped gracefully away rowena please he said irritated you know i would never i dontknow what to believe she said sharply not looking at him the man slipped next to her from behind wrapping one hand slowly around her waist and running his other hand seductively across her neck she gasped i want you back he said silkily we were happy together once dontlet the lies of those simpering fools drive us apart one of her lily white hands closed on his godric said she began is a soft voice turning her head to meet his eyes gryffindor is a liar he spat his voice rising in pitch a muggle loving sympathetic fool something flashed in her eyes and she snapped her head back out the window fine she said icily if that how you feel what do you mean by that he snapped you you hate muggleborns she said her voice shaking slightly you think they re unworthy they are he said fiercely you i salazar i she looked desperately around the room i muggleborn the silence seemed to fill the entire room you re what he hissed you heard what i said she said viciously i forged my lineage the ravenclaws from glen are wheelrights and occasionally scholars they have been for centuries until me he pushed her roughly away stepping back away from her as if she were infected you lying whore he yelled i never lied to you she screamed back matching his volume i am a witch you are a liar and a whore he hollered get out get out of my chambers she pointed furiously at the door fine he said his voice dropping to a low growl arentyou a clever little girl she fumed at him hermione could feel the blood screaming in her ears godric was right about you her voice trembled did you the lacarres last week someone did you kill them the anger drained from her voice somewhat and she simply looked frightened yes salazar dark eyes blazed madly a very ugly look crossing his features they were unclean unworthy of this place hermione swallowed the bile rising in her throat get out she screamed she grabbed a vase and threw it at him an explosion of blue and white fragments skittered across the floor you are a monster get out of my chambers he backed away his face livid his black eyes icy you re as unclean as all of them you foolish whore you ll all die i shall have my revenge even if it takes a thousand years out i never want to see you again she threw something else a delicate silver instrument that had been clicking softly on the table it shattered noisily against the door get out hissing darkly under his breath he turned and swept out of the chambers his deep green cloak billowing behind him the door slammed shut and hermione sank down onto her knees her back leaning heavily into the wall just below the window she began to cry 000 draco was walking down the halls at school wearing his usual uniform his robes were stuffed haphazardly into his bag the halls seemed bright but deserted he heard a dull clapping sound on the stone floor footsteps ahead of him he sped up trying to catch up with the person in front of him it was a girl she turned a corner out of sight he broke into a run she was close to him now a schoolbag slung over her shoulder he lunged forward spinning her roughly and pinning her to the wall hermione stared at him evenly through intense brown eyes she raised an eyebrow yes she asked folding her arms expectantly what do you want he paused for a moment cocking his head slightly then he answered the word slipping through his lips before he could stop it you he grabbed her roughly and kissed her she wrapped her arms around his neck and returned the favor loosening the tie around his neck with one of her hands draco woke up gasping and for the life of him couldntget back to sleep he stared wide eyed at the ceiling refusing to look across the cave 000 the next passageway is the reason the dark lord cannot enter the cave explained the instructions regulus had written dontworry sirius it wontaffect you hermione could only assume it wouldntaffect any of them either but cursed regulus again for being vague it seemed he could be nearly as brash as his older brother when he wanted to they were walking again in the long and seemingly endless tunnel hermione was haunted by her dream last night usually she rarely remembered dreams they faded like smoke as soon as she opened her eyes this one was different however she remembered each sight each sensation quite vividly it didntseem like a dream at all more like a memory only it definitely wasnther own you think they ll ever catch snape ron asked harry not if i catch him first said harry darkly ron didntspeak for a moment so said ron ginny is looking forward to seeing you at the wedding harry turned slightly pink er me too he said nervously if you break her heart i ll kick your arse said ron seriously harry grinned so i ve heard malfoy rolled his eyes he cast a quick glance at her paled slightly and looked away oh merlin what was his problem now the passageway spilled out into a lofty vaulted chamber there didntseem to be anything particularly interesting about the chamber except for the stone effigy of a snake perched atop the entranceway as if it were slithering out of the rock hermione eyed it warily the idea of ravenclaw having a serpent effigy in her tomb was rather baffling especially after what she had just seen still regulus hadntelaborated much about it so she could only assume they should ignore it as well harry and ron were laughing behind her then harry suddenly stopped what wrong mate asked ron harry opened his mouth but the only thing that came out was a series of low hisses at first hermione was confused but she quickly realized parseltongue er you do know i dontspeak parseltongue right said ron slowly sounding perplexed you re a freak potter if i haventmentioned that lately pointed out malfoy folding his arms and leaning casually against the wall harry whirled around to tell malfoy off but again all that came out was another bunch of unintelligable hisses harry was starting to look panicked he turned to hermione and continued to hiss frantically waving his arms and jabbing madly at the air which didntdo much to make him any easier to understand hermione frowned her eyes falling on the snake effigy she watched its gem stone eyes light up with an eerie green light every time harry opened his mouth and suddenly she understood she grabbed the still panicking harry by his shirt collar and dragged him backwards into the stone passage they had just traveled down ron followed by his friend side malfoy sighed and followed reluctantly pushing idly off the wall the glow of the effigy faded as harry and hermione crossed the threshold of the chambers ssss hssss eeehhhh ssss hhhhhsss the hell is going on demanded harry oh merlin he panted placing his hand on his chest and looking strained what was that that i believe said hermione is ravenclaw way of keeping salazar slytherin from disturbing her eternal rest but i not a slytherin said harry looking highly affronted yeah he the git in snake breath house said ron pointing accusingly at malfoy hey protested malfoy no offense harry said ron none taken i offended complained malfoy good said ron cheerily no one cares oh stop it ron said hermione look it the parseltongue not the slytherin ness that must be why voldemort couldntenter the cave himself why did she hate slytherin so much asked malfoy curiously because he was a git offered ron snidely malfoy scowled at him actually said hermione delicatlely ravenclaw and slythering had quite a falling out when slytherin left i thought all the founders were fighting said harry confused yes she felt a blush creeping into her cheeks i think they were lovers ron let out a low whistle betcha wontfind that anywhere in hogwarts a history she was muggleborn added hermione quietly malfoy hand slipped ungracefully off the wall and he had to stumble to catch his balance she was what he said in disbelief how do you know that she shrugged looking away i i dontknow there just something about this place that saying i saw it just now in a dream was a very un hermione like thing to do she told herself and she wasntabout to start that anytime soon um right said harry diplomatically he glanced at the cavernous room before them how can we fix this he asked after a pause there only one thing i can think of she said sighing she strode out into the passage into the cavern and leveled her wand at the effigy reducto she screamed the light that burst from her wand was deflected by a shield charm ricocheted the curse ricocheted off the walls tearing an extremely large hole in the ceiling above her as she scampered back to her friends the only plan hermione can come up with involves violence said ron sarcastically i d say were doomed harry paled slightly it not coming off is it hermione shook her head her lips drawn you all have to go on without me he said heavily harry said hermione no way mate said ron shaking his head we re in this together remember we re not in this at all if you dontget the horcrux said harry resolutely i ll go back alone no you won t protested ron we ll all go together hermione bit her lip trying to be pragmatic they had come this far someone had to go ahead or everything they had done so far would be useless i going back said harry firmly the rest of you have to go ahead without me if you re going back i going with you said ron harry sighed ron this is not open to debate he replied you cantgo back alone but then harry looked at hermione and malfoy hermione looked at him and smiled trying to be strong i ll be ok she said you cantgo alone either said ron looking even more alarmed i not alone said hermione looking at malfoy oh no said ron no i need him to read the diary she said shrugging helplessly malfoy was leaning against the wall again his face impassive harry and ron suddenly grabbed him and dragged him farther down the passage out of earshot of hermione 000 potter and weasley pushed him roughly against the wall glaring at him in the distance granger sighed and tapped her foot impatiently if anything anything happens to her i will personally kill you said potter coolly not if i get to him first growled weasley do you understand me said potter yes said draco quietly i still donttrust him said weasley eyes narrowed draco sighed i swear on my family honor i wontlet any harm come to her oh the honor of the malfoy said weasley sarcastically now i feel better well i wouldntexpect you to know anything about pureblood honor you bloodtraitor snapped draco that enough said potter sharply weasley shut up but still looked irritated do you swear i do he said fine said potter weasley turned and jogged over to hermione wrapping her in a hug and saying goodbye potter moved to follow him you draco began quietly he shoved his hands in his pockets and shifted uncomfortabley she means a lot to you doesntshe potter looked at him strangely of course she does oh i well he nodded on my honor he swore again not sure why he felt so obligated potter nodded as well and then walked away 000 hermione blinked back tears as she hugged her friends goodbye i wontbe long she promised come back safe harry squeezed her so hard she was having difficulty breathing we couldntdo this without you you know she smiled i know if malfoy is mean to you let me know said ron seriously i ll kill him for you she chuckled hugging him i know you will she handed harry the crest that the vampire had given them be safe she said i ll see you on the other side they turned and walked away if you get into trouble just turn around called harry over his shoulder we ll find another way in her heart hermione knew there was no other way she would either get the horcrux or they would never defeat voldemort dumbledore was gone there was no one else to save them you can use malfoy as a human shield if you need to added ron bite me weasley retorted malfoy she waited as they walked away down the tunnel refusing to continue on until they finally faded away into darkness well she said briskly covertly wiping a tear from her face shall we malfoy shrugged sure hermione moved uncertainly forward malfoy smiled his usual cocky grin but it seemed less tinged with malice than usual you know the way go ahead he said casually i ll follow you wherever you think we need to go i ll follow you to where you re going to the ends of the earth hermione nearly dropped the diary in her hands nodding weakly she set off into the darkness malfoy close behind her 000 an thank you all so much for reading and reviewing i ll try to post again soon i ve been having a very bad week my grandmother passed away i hope everybody liked this chapter i hope the founders drama wasnttoo out there lol i a little too tired to respond to reviews maybe next time i do appreciate them though thank you hermione awoke in darkness but it had a hardness to it a firm reality that you never notice is missing in dreams until you wake up again she coughed as coldness seeped out of her lungs and was replaced with the moist air of the cave she stood up slowly dizzy and disoriented darkness was all around her in blackened clouds that ebbed and flowed at her feet like liquid she was sitting on the cave floor but the ache in her limbs told her she had probably landed there after falling from somewhere quite a bit higher up she looked around her stomach sick with sudden alarm where was malfoy had he been well actually she had no idea what the boggarts would do to him according to popular theory a single boggart that has properly subdued a victim moves on to feed on their fear until the victim is completely drained of energy and feeling cases that extreme were rare but it did beg the question as to what thousands of boggarts would do and if she had to guess she decided it would probably be quite fatal draco she called she took a tentative step forward she marveled as the cloud parted allowing her to pass through along an empty stone floor she couldntsee him everything was obscured by dark clouds and glittering eyes draco can you hear me where are you no answer her voice echoed uselessly around the cave she cursed silently what now she had no idea what spells to use in fact her instinct told her it would probably be best to get out of this cave as soon as possible she continued to wade around in the heavy dark fog finally her eyes settled on a flash of silver in the corner there was a cluster of the wretched little creatures pulsing and piling on top of each other she lit her wand and moved closer in the silent rustle of dark cloudy bodies she heard someone gasping she whipped out her wand perfringo she cried the cloud shook and separated for the most fleeting of seconds but it was long enough for hermione to catch sight of draco pale terrified face his eyes were screwed shut and he was flailing around in the darkness in terrified spasms a terrified expression on his face the darkness seeped back into its former place concealing him from view hermione frowned only one option struck her it was not a pleasant one she shivered as she remembered the nightmare she had just broken free of and she did not relish another but she gripped her wand in her outstretched hand and uttered the spell anyway librum memoria she cried aiming at the spot she knew malfoy to be she was rushing though a dark whirling tunnel she realized she had no one to guide her through it draco she screamed can you hear me where are you her feet slammed on solid ground or at least what could be called solid in the strange ethereal world of thoughts and memories she looked around she was in diagon alley though like in her vision everything was dead and deserted the streets were littered with the bodies of the fallen even the air seemed thick with fire and destruction a dark figure in a cloak turned towards narcissa malfoy emotionlessly he raised his wand and killed her she fell to the ground hermione gasped in horror narcissa malfoy rushed forward the hooded figure raised his wand she fell to the ground again and again and again hermione watched the scene repeat itself over and over again in an unbreakable recursive loop one moment of perfect agony hermione turned around and saw something she hadntnoticed before there was another figure huddled on the ground watching the scene play over and over and shaking with terror hermione raced over to him draco she said gently he wasntlooking at her he was staring fixedly at the scene in front of him with wide terrified eyes draco look at me she pleaded she knelt down beside him and grasped his hand please we need to get out of here no he finally tore his eyes away from the scene and looked at her i always here this isntreal she said insistently you have to get out it is real he whispered it not she countered please believe me it an illusion it just your fear it not real no he looked at the hooded figure you dontunderstand it real it real i cantleave because i ll always be here it me hermione wasntsure what he was talking about but she was sure she didntcare they had to get out of here now she raised her wand occludo mentis nothing happened hermione looked back at draco he was still gazing fixedly at the figure muttering in terror draco look at me she said more harshly this time please her features softened please i cantdo this by myself she gazed seriously into his eyes you have to help me you have to want to leave he finally looked at her but didntspeak do you want to leave he nodded slowly take my hand he extended his hand and she grasped it gently repeating the spell she felt a sudden jolt and she was suddenly back in the boggart infested cave hermione was standing and draco was on the ground next to her she was still holding his hand which she quickly let go of feeling uncertain and seeing the potential for more awkwardness he didntseem to notice she looked at him he was still huddled on the ground hermione felt a pang god she thought he looked so broken all the swaggering and smirking she was used to seeing from him seemed like they had come from a different person now no dontlet him fool you he still a jerk a big pathetic jerk in a pathetic heap on the ground oh dammit malfoy she began draco he looked at her with tear stained eyes and then quickly looked away facing the wall are you happy now you are arentyou everyone wants to see me dragged in the dirt get away from me granger he said in a strangled voice burying his face in his hands he was doing something to his arm that she couldntsee hermione felt her throat constrict she was in a freezing cave now trying to work through an extremely traumatizing boggart attack and trying to find a piece of the soul of the darkest wizard in the world oh yes she was happy she was bloody ecstatic no i am not happy she said curtly i m i a monster he replied gritting his teeth he sounded distant he said it was perfect he lied everyone lied to me all along this is your birth right my son my son mine forever no you re not a monster stop being so dramatic she protested softly she knelt down next to him oh lord he gone completely crackers hasnthe i suppose it had to happen sometime i am he said i tried to deny it i tried i got lost i donteven know what i want i thought i could have it both ways but i can t it blood it runs in your blood and there not escaping your destiny he ran his hands through his hair gripping handfuls of blond as he went destiny she said dismissively what is it with wizards and destiny destiny is just a silly excuse for people who dontknow what to do with their lives she argued her practical protests sounded strangely out of place given the situation malfoy shrugged no protests no attitude no snarky remarks he just sat there looking empty and lost he was a mess he was still scratching at his forearm what are you doing she demanded her voice somewhat sharp she pulled his sleeve away to get a better look at his arm and gasped there was a series of long scratches over the dark mark on his arm as if he had been trying quite ineffectively to remove it stop that she said in alarm he didntseem to be listening cantgo both ways he muttered hermione wondered if she had done more harm than good forcibly pulling him out of his nightmare he seemed quite confused it there or it isn t and if you re marked you have something to live up to stop she repeated shrilly grabbing his arm he pulled away violently get off me granger he yelled angrily i going to get rid of it you cantstop me leave me alone no she said her voice shaking you have to stop that you re you re hurting yourself it hurts worse having it on there he said wildly i can t i cantstand to look at it for another second fucking thing i hate a spasm of fear flickered across his face no no no no once it gone he looked desperate you dontunderstand they told me it would be easy just like riding a broomstick hahaha i have to get rid of it he struggled against hermione grasp for a moment finally throwing her off in a show of strength that caught her somewhat off guard she landed on her butt hard falling against the wall ouch stop it right now she imagined her voice came out a little more harshly than she intended in light of her now very sore arse to her surprise he actually listened look draco she snatched up his arm and laid it down gently on his leg but kept it pinned there with her own hand it doesnthave to mean what you think it s she brushed her fingertips softly against his somewhat mangled forearm and winced despite herself it just a scar what the hell would you know about it he began his voice harsh but cracking slightly hermione stretched down the collar of her t shirt to reveal an area of skin near her heart a few inches below her collarbone there was a faint series of circular marks like an ancient healed burn it a scar see i was in the department of mysteries last year and i was fighting and i got hurt but i healed it a scar it there because you re fighting draco looked at the ground against you he muttered sourly oh come on there more to you than that mark on your arm she told him what was she saying did she really honestly believe all this or was she just trying to help him did she even know herself he hung his head again i think i think i going mad i mean he clenched his hands in to fists and put them over his face for awhile all i had was hate and i thought i could live with that because it was easy and simple and familiar and oh bloody hell and now i canteven hate you properly anymore and fuck i terrified all the time i feel like i going to die every second of every day and then and then it changed when i he offered me freedom and i just stood there he offered her freedom and i i maybe i dead already i just haventnoticed yet big damn difference there is he wiped off his face with the corner of his sleeve and swore quietly she had never seen him genuinely in pain before not really she had watched him snivel and whine quite a few times to emphasize the onset of minor injuries but now it seemed he was really truly miserable and it was etched all over his face at that moment hermione realized he didntreally look like a spoiled child anymore to her he was suddenly more human if he was this messed up in the head then he hid it surprisingly well how could someone be this torn apart inside and still walk around like everything was normal still throwing around insults and spells and snide remarks come on she said pulling him up to a standing position she was feeling quite uncomfortable from his outpouring of emotion in all the years she had known him she felt guilty he was still a person wasnthe a bigoted sniveling miserable attractive snob of a person we should keep moving he nodded numbly and followed her as she walked the boggart swarms parted like the red seas as she passed through them draco in her wake the farther they got from the cave the more like his old self he seemed to become he looked a lot calmer perhaps even a bit more confident at least he had stopped shaking had her words actually helped him did he actually care about what she had to say draco she bit her lip curiosity was gnawing at her who was that hooded figure he laughed bitterly but didntspeak it was an illusion you know that she said gently he looked away shoving his hands into his pockets she sighed you dontthink so do you he looked frustrated how can i he demanded venomously i just i ve worked my whole life for he looked at his mangled forearm this and now i have it and he clenched his fist causing more blood to ooze from his arm it here it real i dontlike being this way nothing makes sense anymore and i m trapped you re not she said shaking her head you always have a choice that easy for you to say he said with bitterness in his voice they passed out of the cave and paused within the next passage dontget hostile she said smoothly it a poor defense and she wasntexactly sure what was wrong but she had an idea look draco i know that harry and ron and i arentreally a good example of this but you dontalways have to turn into your parents i mean she held up the diary look at regulus and sirius she grasped his hands maybe you have a different path ahead of you i think so he laughed hollowly i thought you didntbelieve in destiny i don t she responded but i do believe in people it never ever too late to change you really believe that he asked sneering but there was a hint of wanting in his eyes you think that people can actually change how the look on his face stunned her but she hid it was he looking to her for reassurance for a way out they change because they want to she said emphatically she looked squarely into his silver eyes you have to make a choice malfoy stared at her seriously no longer moving forward looking pensive she turned and continued slowly on without him giving him some time alone with his thoughts centuries of deeply ingrained prejudice didntreally excuse his actions for the past six years but did he really want to change he had a lot to deal with maybe even as much as harry only his problems were more within himself than without he was struggling internally with something just as heavy and dark and all consuming as anything and that fact that he was at least trying to fight it to find his own way despite pressures to the contrary meant everything she didntquite understand it but she really didntlike to see him suffer this way former death eater or not and she lied lied to him she hated lying she was just trying to make him feel better because it was what he needed to hear she wanted to believe people could change she did believe it but the realist in her told her that sometimes they couldn t not totally some people would always no matter how much they tried retain something inescapable within themselves hermione was always very intuitive she could practically tell what people were thinking before they could malfoy motivations however had eluded her lately now she could see it all realization crashing down upon her like a tidal wave there it was glaring her right in the face wretchedly obvious after all this time she didntknow why but it had hit her very strongly the last time she had looked him in the eye there was something there mostly when she looked in people eyes she saw well eyes pupils and retinas nothing romantic or interesting in the least but now she felt like she could see right through him right past that liquid silver into the howling void inside him dark ice cold and screaming silently it was quite a lot to ask of her even if he wasntdoing it intentionally she wasntsure she was capable of being responsible for his soul to be honest it terrified her terrified her because it was dark and empty and ran much much more deep then she had ever suspected she had always seen a pretentious spoiled child when she looked at him nothing but a loudmouthed bully but now she saw something darker something frightening and she worried that if she stayed close to him she would be sucked right into that cold void inside him as well she suppressed a shiver because somewhere in the back of her mind she had to wonder if it was too late to escape for both of them 000 he caught up to her thank you for that he said in a hoarse voice back there i guess i owe you one again he narrowed his eyes but dontthink this changes anything between us granger he added in a quick harsh tone anything between us she asked incredulously raising an eyebrow what exactly is there between us malfoy nothing he said immediately cursing inwardly she sighed exasperatedly and dontthink there ever will be i still hate you hmm she said in an extremely unconcerned voice she sounded unconvinced damn her did she think she knew him now damn her damn her for being in his life and damn her for being in his head damn her for seeing him when he was crying like a goddamn child damn her damn her for being unconcerned damn her for telling him off damn her for not being afraid of him well you donthave to owe me anything she said dismissively i did it because it was the right thing to do damn her stupid sense of self righteousness damn her for saving his goddamn life when she could have just let him die on her stupid front yard he could have been spared all this goddamn misery and confusion damn her for saving his goddamn life again damn her for making it so he couldntjust hate her like the filthy mudblood she was damn her for being her what couldnthe hate her hate was one thing he was particularly talented with she was driving him crazy he shrugged well i do anyway i said i d protect you he shoved his hands in his pockets again fine ruddy job i did of that one too he grumbled great job draco way to be worthless how does it feel to be saved by that goddamn mudblood again centuries of family honor down the bloody drain and the truth was he lied to her he was the monster it wasntjust an illusion he had done more sunk deeper done worse things than she probably suspected no matter how smart she was there was an innocence about her she didntreally know him yet she couldn t he had grown up in a world that was far more dark and complex than the world draco had seen in the granger living room her world his world was full of pain and power and the dark arts his father had taught him since he was old enough to hold a wand and he had liked it it was fascinating to him it always had been he practically had a special talent for it his family had been breeding him quite literally for this life for hundreds perhaps thousands of years he liked controlling people manipulating them he liked watching them get hurt he actually enjoyed it how could she possibly understand that how could she possibly understand him the last few minutes had been a dark blur he couldntremember the details exactly expect that he had been trapped in some kind of intense nightmare and she had pulled him out the nightmare he remembered quite vividly but everything else he remembered seeing her helping him talking to him trying to pull him back from the brink he was teetering on and why he wasntsure what exactly he had said to her probably something he shouldnthave why did she have to do that he wished things could be the way there were before simpler more divided into her kind and his kind with no exceptions and no guilt hermione rolled her eyes i told you before i dontneed you to protect me yeah i know granger he said his mouth twisting into a small grin that looked suspiciously like a smirk a little bit of his usual personality showing through the melancholy air surrounding him you only need me to save your arse some of the time i ll have you know i had that situation completely under control she countered playfully raising her chin in mock defiance oh right he said skeptically sneering at her but without malice he was actually enjoying himself a little bit this felt more normal for the first time in the past few hellish hours he started to feel more comfortable and less like he was on the verge of falling apart were you going to win that fight before or after you got flattened by several tons of stone wall i was going to wait till i was flattened lie in wait for a few hours then spring up and finish him off she explained in mock sincerity the element of surprise is everything maybe several tons of masonry falling on your head might be a good thing he said innocently could be the only force on this earth powerful enough to make your hair lie flat she glared at him looking slightly outraged for a moment but quickly cooling off nothing is that powerful she replied a small smile playing on her lips but maybe you could lend me some of your hair gel you seem to be wearing enough on your head everyday to coat the entire kingdom of britain several times over he smiled in a self satisfied way oh yes definitely back to normal but what was normal for them anyway her slapping him across the face him saying deliberately hurtful things to her maybe if you ask nicely was his smooth reply 000 hermione inhaled slowly as the reached the end of the tunnel stopping in front of the entranceway before them this is it she thought to herself trying to calm her frazzled nerves is this the end asked malfoy looking around in confusion hermione could understand his puzzlement they were standing in front of a solid wall it was covered with an arch like pattern of strange symbols and designs but nevertheless it was completely solid yes she said inching closer to the wall but still to uneasy to touch it um right then he said crossing his arms how do you propose we get through it hermione glanced at the wall apprehensively we eh jump she offered i see he said looking at the wall with a raised eyebrow and what the point of this lovely little task the point well according to regulus it the final door it supposed to take us right into the tomb i believe it meant to be a sort of a test of will you have to believe you can go through or you ll crash right into it that doesntsound too horrible he said seeming pleasantly surprised it not she said it was fairly easy how many times had she passed through the barrier to platform 9 and 3 4 s i suppose it meant to assure that anyone who comes here even muggles would have at least a cursory familiarity or understanding of magic i suppose she didntwant just anyone wandering in here no matter how clever they were she said thinking aloud she threw a sideways glance at malfoy who was smirking dontsay it she warned him i didntsay anything he protested the smarmy grin still adorning his pale features no but you were going to she assured him turning away he was still grinning ok she backed away from the wall and faced it squarely balling her hands into fists ready she said under her breath one two malfoy stepped up next to her grabbing her arm gently just above the elbow three he finished they both ran at the wall and jumped hermione felt a slight pressure on her skin as they passed through then she felt herself tumbling onto a cold stone floor they were in a beautiful room with a high vaulted ceiling though the room wasnthuge hermione had to crane her neck to see all the way up to the top there was a cluster of softly glowing spheres of light bobbing gently in the air where the ceiling reached it highest conical point which filled the entire room with a warm white light the floor was marble and as reflective as glass it looked like the serene surface of lake in the winter icy deep and black as midnight hermione could see her own face staring back at her from the opposite angle bright eyes glaring out determinedly from an uncharacteristically pale face her eyes fell on the monument in the center of the room it was a large tomb hermione climbed to her feet and approached it slowly it was constructed out of the same smoothly shining material as the floor though the edges were decorated with stone flowers beautifully carved heavy white petals that shimmer opalescently in the soft light in front of it was a ledge elevated like a pedestal and sitting on the ledge hermione breath caught in her throat was a bronze chalice inlaid with smooth blue stones is that it asked draco lazily in his usual drawling voice yes said hermione barely able to contain her excitement ravenclaw chalice a fascinating object tainted by voldemort or not the chalice had been around for over a thousand years ravenclaw interest in alchemy had led her to research in the principles of exodus that is creating a philosopher stone the chalice was the fruit of a lifetime of labor though not the key to actual eternal life the chalice had the power to restore youth the only stipulation was the chalice magic couldntwork more than once on the same person however hermione thought to herself it was still an amazing device the existence of the chalice had actually created the first rumors and later the widespread muggle legend of the holy grail regulus had included some of this information in his diary and some hermione had gathered on his own it was all rather fascinating can we just you know he said shrugging go get it yes said hermione again we should be able to simply pick it up and leave no more obstacles about bloody time said malfoy he strode boldly forward extending his arm toward the chalice but he stopped suddenly his face confused ahh he muttered gripping his forearm what is it asked hermione rushing forward in alarm nothing said malfoy his brow furrowed it just ow he cursed under his breath pushing back his sleeve to reveal the dark mark on his arm it doesn t i mean it burned a few times since i left it always does but he shook his head he extended his hand forward again apparently deciding to ignore the pain hermione gasped the mark was burning actually burning with a curl of smoke rising from it it glowed red draco inhaled sharply what the hell he began but he didnthave time to finish the tomb emitted a sudden sphere like aura of light there was a cracking sound and malfoy was hurled backwards through the wall of the tomb disappearing through the wall with a yelp there was a faint rumbling from within the room hermione was standing in the tomb glowed again determined hermione lunged forwards and snatched the cup into her hands the rumbling stopped another apparition appeared floating above the tomb it was a woman pale and transparent as though made out of colored smoke she was wearing a deep blue dress and had bright blue eyes and flowing jet black hair merlin ghost exclaimed hermione under her breath startled the woman turned her gaze down towards her cocking her head and looking perplexed no she said regally not quite 000 draco landed upside down outside the tomb still cursing wildly he scrambled to his feet and threw himself shoulder first back into the entrance to the central tomb it was probably good that he ran at it shoulder first because his shoulder collided painfully with the wall and he found himself sprawled on the ground once again bloody fucking he grumbling standing up and holding his throbbing shoulder he was now officially stuck dammit hermione he said angrily kicking the wall helplessly what now 000 you re not a ghost said hermione slowly staring at the apparition no i not said the woman not really neither soul nor spirit but enough memory and feeling and magic to watch for all eternity she stared at hermione through narrowed eyes who are you she demanded my name is hermione granger she said trying to appear calm what brings you to this place are you the one who defiled my chalice she pointed accusingly at the cup in hermione hands no said hermione quickly no i would never then what brings you to this place she asked still looking suspicious what do you want with my chalice youth i sincerely doubt you need it a sick mother perhaps grandmother no said hermione i actually she sucked in a breath i here to take it and destroy it destroy it said the woman incredulously she looked angry the walls trembled again i sorry apologized hermione probably should have kept her mouth shut she did have that problem occasionally i a student at hogwarts she blurted out the rumbling stopped are you she asked brightening in curiosity which house i in gryffindor said hermione oh said the woman looking disappointed i was almost in ravenclaw divulged hermione but i opted for gryffindor instead the hat seemed quite insistent but i made up my mind you must be quite bright to make it this far said the woman there a bit of me in that hat did you know that but i suppose if you made up your mind there really no going back is there er no said hermione this conversation seemed rather pointless maybe she should make a lunge for the door but on the other hand this spirit thing whatever it was seemed to be controlling the cave why did you throw my er friend out of the cave she asked friend said the woman in disgust he bore the mark of a serpent a cursed mark of a serpent full of dark magic i donttolerate certain things especially after the first one came in here he returned with my chalice defiled regulus though hermione there s a very dark wizard in our era began hermione it was so complicated it sounded odd boiled down into this form he been trying to cleanse the world of muggleborns and muggles we ve been fighting him for a long time years he slytherin heir the woman eyes flashed at the mention of that name he a bit obsessed with hogwarts so he when he made his horcruxes he used things from the founders slytherin locket your chalice horcrux es she said in alarm as in more than one division of the soul that s he terrible i sorry i had to disturb your rest said hermione again the woman shook her head do not apologize for such a justified action oh ok she said not quite sure how to respond thank you er lady ravenclaw the woman nodded regally it takes great courage as well as cleverness for a witch to fight she said godric always told me that erm lady ravenclaw hermione bit her lip she shouldntask should she maybe it was just a crazy dream still are you muggleborn she looked shocked i i sorry said hermione quickly i never told anyone she said slowly only one man i was just curious said hermione because well i am too ravenclaw smiled at her curiosity is a virtue but it can sometimes be a curse tell me about it said hermione smiling nervously have i been exposed in the future she asked how did you know i uh i saw it in a dream said hermione going slightly pink while i was in here i mean usually i think that stuff is absolute drivel but i feel very connected to this place so well said ravenclaw gently perhaps you are i have stored much of my memory thought and feeling in this place magic is a very curious force there is much even the most learned do not yet understand of its mysteries hermione nodded and the chalice she asked softly holding it aloft in her hands it glittered dully in the soft light you have done what is necessary destroy it you have my blessing thank you said hermione i appreciate your help but i really must hurry my friends are waiting for me then good luck hermione granger said ravenclaw go the way is open for you she pointed to the door with another final backwards glance hermione closed her eyes and leapt through the wall 000 draco slammed his fist against the wall for a third time suddenly there was a dull scraping sound next to him a hole opened up in the sloping wall next to him it quickly formed into a long stone staircase sloping up into the wall above him and disappearing then he saw it sunlight a gorgeous golden shaft of it cascading down the newly formed tunnel and pooling at draco feet finally freedom from this accursed hellhole he looked around dammit now he just had to find someone flew through the wall in front of him knocking him to the ground they tumbled a few feet across the dirt floor of the cave a tangle of limbs and hysterical shouts draco struggled free and leapt to his feet granger he yelled bloody hell woman hermione laughed at him rolling over so she could climb back onto her feet draco gave her a hand i found a way out he said importantly how very clever of you she said in a saccharine voice look what i found she held up the chalice draco smiled the horcrux the key to the dark lord downfall that bastard was going to pay for his mother death hermione walked towards the newly formed stairs let get out of here shall we draco nodded and followed her as she headed into the promise of sunlight 000 an whew sorry it took so long to update i kept messing around with this chapter it was never quite the way i wanted it i think i got it pretty close to how i wanted it so all well hope you all liked it ok yes you were all right i dontknow where i got the idea for the billions o boggarts wait actually i do i was at work and i was really bored for 5 hours so i stared off into space and wrote fanfiction in my head the tons of boggarts donttake the form of whatever frightens you the most they suck you up and launch you into this uber involved realistic nightmare in which all your worst fears are realized in a realistic way and it is of course terrifying spooky music plays ursh yeah i totally overdue it with the british slang but what can i say i an american fanfic author lol and the molar thing sorry i thought the alliteration sounded funny together also i have no idea where florence is in italy i a very lazy person but thank you for the info foxeran and everybody else who mentioned this yes i sorry i had to separate the trio for a few chapters it dmhg what am i supposed to do hehehe tristana omg my microsoft word expired and i had to type in wordpad oh the evils of wordpad mostly the problem is it has no spellcheck i need spellcheck calms down so sorry about any errors renyun i totally fixed that error when i saw your review damn wordpad thanks though another note ravenclaw is dead she has no horcruxes the ghost was just a compilation of leftover thought and memory that she left to animate the cave it was just a cup she stared at it as she ascended the stony steps out of the cave shiny symmetrical sort of pleasant in a purely aesthetic sense still hermione carried it with her shirt sleeve afraid to have her skin in contact with the metal for an extended period of time after all however innocuous it may seem it did contain within it the soul of the most evil wizard of all time she leaned her head back and closed her eyes smiling as the walls of the tunnel receded and sunlight bathed her face for the first time in days ah gentle breeze rustling leaves everything that made her love being outdoors usually in the summer she spent most of her day outside lying in the grass and reading the mild warmth of the soil rising up to greet her in gentle waves and the smell of the freshly cut grass wafting about her senses that ladies and gentlemen was summer for hermione granger and she missed it fiercely thump hermione squeaked in surprise as she was all but tackled by two tall figures and wrapped in and bear like hug you re alright you are alright arentyou you look alright did you get it did malfoy do anything should we kill him the offer to torture him for no reason hasntexpired yet has it what are you talking about there are plenty of reasons to torture him no she managed to gasp as the air finally went whooshing back into her lungs ah the hazards of having two rather large male teenage quidditch players for best mates no torture here she held the cup aloft and both harry and ron stopped gibbering and stared at it hermione you re amazing said harry sincerely she blushed and handed the horcrux to harry he accepted it slowly and turning it gingerly in his hands examining the dull sheen of its surface wow breathed ron staring at it with wide eyes shit i cantbelieve that s what that actually is shit harry nodded in agreement four down said harry softly three to go finished hermione though the real problem that was about to present itself she realized was how they would actually go about destroying it she had been wondering about dumbledore withered hand ever since harry had first mentioned the horcruxes and the ring we can walk back towards town and apparate home said harry decisively without breaking his gaze on the chalice we ll decide exactly where home is on the way they nodded in agreement malfoy meanwhile had climbed out of the cave directly behind her and begun dusting himself off he stood a little behind them mostly ignoring what they were doing they were all rather smudged with dirt and it was particularly noticeable on malfoy complexion the amazing albino boy he looked irritated and began performing cleaning charms on himself waving his wand rather vindictively at the accumulated filth as if it had insulted him on a very personal level oy malfoy called ron turning his gaze from the horcrux if you re done preening like a little girl we should probably get going fuck you weasley replied malfoy my family likes to practice a little thing called hygiene i dontsuppose yours has even heard of it ron got a little red and opened his mouth to say something oh stop said hermione exasperatedly just what they needed another sniping bicker fest besides ron would probably lose oh dear did she really just think that they began walking hoping to at least reach a road before sundown if they could get their bearings they would have less of a chance of splinching going to a strange place was one thing but going back home via apparation was actually quite simple if one takes the proper precautions of course not the dursley s said ron no offense mate but those people are repulsive hermione stepped down over a rotted tree stump and steadied herself as both feet hit the firmly packed dirt of the robe they were discussing possible places to stay none taken well said hermione thinking carefully pretty much our only possibilities are our homes or hogwarts i suppose that still a problem said harry frowning anywhere we go we re putting our families in danger malfoy looked at him but didntspeak going to hogwarts would make us a lot more conspicuous pointed out hermione rita skeeter is practically living in hogsmeade now it a media circus so where the hell are we supposed to go demanded ron should we just keep moving that almost as dangerous said harry shaking his head he sighed so where should we stay an inn i have an idea said hermione quietly what is it asked harry well i wouldntmention it if we had any other options her expression was apologetic why not he said quizzically because i dontthink you re going to like it 000 a little over half an hour later they were standing in the middle of the sidewalk staring at a large empty space between two muggle houses great an empty space charming how do we get in asked potter he did not look too excited at the prospect of getting in to wherever the hell they were going granger looked at the space uncertainly we all know where it is she said slowly she looked at draco except for him the secret keeper is gone said potter softly so what does that mean is the charm broken they were looking at granger they were always asking her something merlin was the girl supposed to know everything i not sure she said but i do know that sirius transferred ownership to you harry she looked a little more confident there are a lot of security measures on the house outside of the fidelus just call for it uh right said harry he looked at the empty space gesturing uncertainly with one hand i pretty sure that number 12 grimmauld place is right here he said in a loud voice nothing happened instead of looking back at granger he began to look irritated hey he said a little louder this is my house i want to see a house right here now fuck that granger did know everything there was a building appearing between the two houses inflating quickly into existence and pushing the houses aside number 12 grimmauld place at least that what the plaque on the side of the large run down house from the outside it looked as though it had been abandoned for several decades it was coated in peeling black paint it looked like a traditional wizarding home however dilapidated it was draco would rather stay in there that any of the other places that had been offered actually he would rather stay at his own house but he had no idea what had become of it eh crap said weasley staring dejectedly at the house potter didntlook very pleased either what was weasley complaining about thought draco this ramshackle piece of junk was probably a palace compared to the shoe box the weasley family most likely lived in hey why hadnthe said that aloud maybe he was going soft they moved forward along the front walkway towards the battered black door there was a curled silver serpent serving as a knocker draco smiled now that looked welcoming hermione reached forward and grasped the doorknob she made a motion to turn it but there was a sudden zapping sound and she withdrew her hand with a sharp intake of breath ow she yelped she muttered angrily under her breath about prejudiced security systems harry would you potter grabbed the handle and pushed the door open with a creak it opened to reveal an expanse of shadowy sinister looking hallway they walked inside a thick layer of dust seemed to have taken up residence on every available surface ugh it become even more repulsive if that possible said potter in disgust i dontknow said draco shrugging i kind of like it it just needs cleaned up a bit he was greeted with three incredulous stares and an oppressively lengthy silence you re a psycho said weasley finally draco walked away rolling his eyes did anyone else notice he a psycho well said granger evenly i guess we can make ourselves comfortable potter snorted yeah right draco wandered around in the hall noticing a showcase of portraits covered in thick velvety curtains he peeked under one only to be greeted with the vision of a very wrinkly quite mad looking old woman wearing a rather ugly bonnet she appeared to be dozing but her eyes snapped open when the curtains parted who are you she demanded in a shrill voice draco malfoy he responded calmly malfoy the woman narrowed her eyes thoughtfully my sister had a daughter that married into that bloodline excellent family quite respectable that me said draco puffing himself up importantly finally some recognition i am the only son of narcissa black and lucius malfoy cissy black my niece respectable girl beautiful and what a handsome son she bore tell me child where is your mother is she here draco swallowed she s he heard footsteps behind him the portrait seemed to forget him its eyes bulging wildly as it launched into a tyrannical series of crazed shrieks mudblood shaming the house of my fathers get out get out get hermoine pushed past draco and with some exertion managed to pull the curtains shut she turned and leaned against the wall panting what are you doing she hissed in a low urgent voice do not disturb the angry portraits of sirius crazy relatives fine said draco not really caring either way she held a finger to her lips and they both walked quietly out of the hall into the living room you know granger he said thoughtfully i think that might have been my great aunt she stared at him brilliant she said flatly just bloody brilliant 000 they were discussing the next step hermione had the diary open on her lap mafloy naturally was next to her she could feel the hot prickle of his eyes staring at her boring into the side of her head but she refused to look at him that made her feel somewhat guilty problems needed to be met head on but right now she was too preoccupied at least that what she kept telling herself she was skimming down regulus list of horcruxes though he attested that there was an incredible amount of secrecy within the ranks of voldemort lieutenants regulus managed to find out a fair bit of information most of it he was probably not meant to know he knew there were more than five though he only saw three with his own eyes said hermione without taking her eyes off the page a chalice a ring and a locket so he didntknow about the diary said harry furrowing his brow there are seven total right said ron not counting the er bit that in him so that means that there are only six said harry wisely seven said malfoy merlin and agrippa seven horcruxes he shook his head it was a great deal to contemplate a part of hermione wished she could read more about them but a part of her was also repulsed at the thought of learning about something so terrible the division of a human soul when you actually thought about it it was a monstrous concept i think the real question is said harry should we destroy this one first or should we go after the rest of them i vote we destroy that thing right now pitched ron in fact i think yesterday was a little too late we dontknow the consequences of that said hermione warily dontyou remember dumbledore hand here wait she flipped pages until she found what she was looking for it was one of the last entries i plan to take the locket of salazar slytherin and destroy it the moment i lay down this diary however destroying a horcrux is no simple matter it takes a tremendous amount of power leading theory states that only the creator of a horcrux meaning the one in which the other piece of the soul resides will be able to destroy the horcrux without suffering devastating damage it would take an extremely powerful wizard to destroy one without dying himself which is why by the time you read this i will probably be dead either way it will be by the hand of the dark lord hermione lowered the diary and sighed it still didnttell her everything would voldemort be able to sense it the moment they actually destroyed the thing did it matter would one of them have to give up their lives to destroy it and the bigger problem was that she knew harry would volunteer unhesitatingly to sacrifice himself and she couldntlet him not yet there had to be another way ok said ron so your best bet is to get the fucking things together before the dark lord notices and comes and slaughters us like cattle drawled malfoy crossing his arms and hunching down into his chair and before golden boy there can throw himself into the dragon mouth and die for the good of bloody humanity because that probably what it ll take hermione tried not to look stunned no they were not thinking along the same lines that would be insane they weren t ok merlin a anyway she said finally she mentally ran through the list of horcruxes riddle diary destroyed by harry the ring on dumbledore finger last year apparently destroyed though the consequences were apparent on dumbledore hand if anyone could destroy a horcrux and live to tell the tale it was him the locket theoretically destroyed by regulus and replaced with a fake one it was strange to think he might have been writing these words in this very room the chalice was glittering dully on the table next to harry armchair there was also a mystery horcrux which no one seemed to know the identity of by hermione calculations it should be something that belonged to godric gryffindor however hermione had no idea if voldemort had actually managed to get his hands on something that belonged to gryffindor and apparently neither did regulus according to harry and dumbledore there was a cup that belonged to helga hufflepuff regulus had no idea what or where it was it had not been given to him to hide probably a wise strategic move on voldemort part showing all your proverbial cards to one man was not exactly a prudent strategy all that regulus knew was that another horcrux had been given to the dark lord favorite his most loyal servant which could be a lot of people she supposed two horcruxes had been given to lieutenants for safe keeping but the aforementioned was something from the dark lord youth so she naturally ruled it out as the diary that of course left voldemort himself assuming harry and dumbledore theory about seven was correct since he might prove a teensy bit more difficult to destroy than a series of inanimate objects hermione thought they should probably save him for last so they actually werentdoing too bad according to what we know so far there are three that are already destroyed two that we haventfound yet one that sitting on that table and one that walking around murdering innocent people how can we find the other two asked harry his expression forming into his determined face i dontknow yet hermione shrugged helplessly neither does regulus i afraid if we want to go forward we have to gather our own information how are we supposed to get information on death eaters demanded ron throwing up his arms in frustration they all looked at malfoy hey dontlook at me he said angrily they dontlike me they re trying to kill me remember besides i gave you that ruddy diary what else do you want we re asking for your advice said hermione there it was a useful ally who could we go to malfoy looked as though he was considering being smug about this for a moment but he quickly sobered up and looked thoughtful you re not going to find a reliable mole in the dark lord ranks not right now anyway i sure i ve lost my allies within the organization but he was so calculating thought hermione he knew the consequence of every relationship every moment there are a few people on the outside who i might be able to persuade a little bit of information from he finished where asked harry in a very to the point tone how quickly knockturn alley i suppose replied malfoy evenly and i dontsee why i couldntgo right now right said harry we ll all i ll go alone potter snapped malfoy i dontneed you to be my fucking babysitter how do we know you ll come back asked ron accusingly should they care if he came back they didntreally need him to read the diary anymore well i guess you dont do you weasley he said harry frowned he clearly felt it was wrong to let him go alone here said harry he popped a trunk out of his pocket and restored it to his normal size take this he pulled a long stream of silvery fabric out of his trunk and handed it to malfoy try not to get killed before you can bring us back information alright wow thought hermione could it be that actually passed for civility harry ignored the fact that ron eyes were popping out of his head malfoy stood and walked towards the door he would be back hermione despite everything she had ever known was inclined to believe him 000 an invisibility cloak it figured snape had mentioned him having one before but to be honest snape tended to be a little nuts draco smiled inwardly as he glided along the london streets invisible weasley was right he could leave if he wanted to but he already knew he wasntgoing to he just wasntsure why they didntreally need him potter the bloody golden boy would probably kill the dark lord one way or another could it be he actually wanted to help he liked the way granger had looked at him just then as he left like he wasntpitiful or helpless or arrogant or scum like he was person and merlin help him he got more satisfaction from that one glance than from anything in a long while he slipped soundlessly through the dismal atmosphere of the leaky cauldron he had considered using the floo network but he was fairly sure it was being monitored by both sides he sighed turning left into an alleyway the route was familiar as soon had thought about it draco realized there was one reliable source of information he could exploit no matter what borgin borgin had his ear to the proverbial ground he knew what was happening in the world of the dark arts it was his trade to do so of course draco believed his value was underappreciated he knew a great deal more than most outsiders did but he was dismissed and ignored as being little or no threat draco couldntblame people for thinking that way the man was such a simpering little wimp all draco had to do was wave the dark mark in his face and the man practically pissed his robes he smiled to himself again this was going to be easy 000 the bell on the door tinkled softly in high dissonant tones draco stepped gracefully through the eerie atmosphere of the shop watching as borgin wrote in his logbook his large feathery quill wobbling back and forth in the dusty air he set the quill down on the counter and turned around rooting through suspicious looking bottles draco approached the opposite side of the counter he leveled his wand at the back of borgin head and pulled of the cloak with a whooshing sound mr borgin he said in a voice of deadly calm borgin jumped about a foot in the air and whirled around flattening himself up against the wall y young master malfoy he stammered what brings you here his fingers edged towards the shelf if you move your hand any closer to the wand you keep stuck under that shelf mister borgin said draco pleasantly i will blow it off do you understand me borgin paled slightly and swallowed nodding he surveyed draco for a moment then seemed to come to a conclusion master malfoy said borgin puffing himself up with a little bit more confidence it is known in the circles i travel in draco snorted inwardly as if he actually traveled in those circles more like licked their boots that you have fallen out of the favor of he who must not be named so he allowed himself a small smug grin you will forgive me if i am disinclined to feel threatened by a if you are going to call me a child mr borgin said draco keeping his light pleasant tones you would be very much mistaken you should recall that i am legally an adult now and all the threats i have made over the past year still stand borgin shifted uncomfortably his grin fading furthermore if you are truly as well versed in current information as you claim you would realize that i am in quite an uncomfortable position i am a man mr borgin a very desperate man at that you see i have no allegiance left to anyone which means he raised the tip of his wand slightly if i were to kill you right now it is simply because i feel like it and i will be in no lesser or greater trouble for no one gives a newt eye for the state of your health and well being mr borgin and you very well know that borgin retreated backwards leaning into the solid wall of shelves behind him all but cowering what do you want he asked his voice almost a whimper information said draco something you claim to have an abundance of it seems borgin crossed his eyes in an effort to get a more holistic view of the wand tip thrust into his face he swallowed yes sir he said in a weak voice good draco smiled what do you know about horcruxes borgin 000 malfoy returned a few hours later slamming the door behind him he looked furious he stormed into the living room and threw the invisibility cloak onto the couch next to harry no luck said harry looking disappointed malfoy let out a stream of expletives before responding coherently erm i found out plenty he said throwing himself down onto the couch he folded his arms and scowled are you gonna share or should we just bloody guess malfoy said ron throwing him a look of enmity well malfoy related slowly it depends i talked to borgin he heard a few things over the past few days such as inquired harry the dark lord is holding a celebration in order to venerate the triumph of his most loyal servant said malfoy through gritted teeth harry eyebrows raised most loyal he pressed hermione interest was peaked as well but it wasntnecessarily the answer they were looking for after all voldemort favor had probably shifted across the decades hadntit snape snarled malfoy i pretty damn sure it for snape hermione considered carefully she felt incredibly betrayed as she thought of her former teacher it was something she could never quite reconcile in her own mind dumbledore had trusted him he always had though no one else understood why he had trusted him and snape had betrayed him he had betrayed him to his death did that mean snape loyalties had always lain solely with voldemort was he the most loyal favorite servant that regulus had spoken of if so that would mean there more said malfoy his hands clenching convulsively this part is mostly rumors whispers rather unfounded because it kept so quiet what the rumor is that the loyal servant is returning something of value to the dark lord something that he has been keeping for years something that the dark lord now believes is in great danger harry eyes widened a horcrux most likely said malfoy hermione drummed her fingers along the surface of the currently blank diary whether the horcrux was in snape possession or not if it was going to be moved to the celebration it was the perfect opportunity to steal it what kind of celebration are we talking about here asked hermione could we sneak in malfoy continued to look angry his pale face contorted with rage the way i understand it it a kind of ball a tradition amongst purebloods for centuries dancing all that bullocks for a special occasion a special occasion the death of albus dumbledore the thought of a celebration for such an event made hermione feel sick to her stomach she ignored it malfoy continued i pretty sure we could sneak in he said venomously i know the location fairly well it a house with a huge formal ballroom in the basement perfect for such functions in fact it housed ministry formal events for centuries and with the owners gone it even more convenient so i dontthink we re going to have trouble sneaking in or navigating even though security is nearly impenetrable ron looked rather bewildered so where is it draco eyes flashed he spat the next words with such venom that it sounded to hermione as if he were uttering a dark curse malfoy manor 000 an ah ha ha can you tell i love to torture draco it because i love him hehe he so awesome rachel yes it totally buffy spike the x c was just the one kiss thanks to everybody who reviewed i love to hear feedback it keeps me on the right track for example if the story is starting to get boring or drag let me know and i ll try to spice it up a bit next chapter hermione and draco go dancing mmm sexy sexy dancing review if you were born to honor show it now if put upon you make the judgment good that thought you worthy of it william shakespeare 000 it what asked potter bleakly his emerald eyes flashing in sudden alarm your mother necklace repeated the werewolf evenly it rather distinctive turn it over potter spun the necklace in his hand flipping it gingerly to reveal the tiny letters carved into the gold plating on the back l e p merlin wand and whiskers muttered weasley it was a finely crafted necklace in draco opinion perhaps even something too nice for the average well mudblood to be wearing no matter how clever or beautiful or exceptionally talented she was he stole a sidelong glance at granger who was staring fixedly at the necklace and felt his face go slightly hot what was going on maybe this civility garbage was going to his head so she gave that to him granger asked the half breed draco could almost see the gears spinning in her head as she watched the smooth pendant glitter in potter hand voluntarily what said weasley in horror no potter practically yelled in reply charm like that mate said the pink hair trollop looking apologetically at potter whose eyes immediately bulged out it likely that she did why he cried maybe she thought she could trust him offered weasley he tricked everyone before he said this slowly as if it pained him or perhaps it was just the agony of straining his single lonely brain cell into producing something useful to say this seemed to give potter hope or at least he frowned gravely and looked thoughtful or maybe she was having an affair with him draco looked at him and smirked it hard to resist that socially retarded devastatingly greasy charm just think potter your real father could still be in under three seconds potter had bounded over the table knocked draco to the ground in a flurry of clattering chairs and wrapped his hands so tightly around draco white throat that he could only emit gurgling sounds in protest draco throat ached severely for several hours after the werewolf had pried them apart but the look on potter face which had at the time turned an interesting shade of magenta was really more than worth it draco pulled himself back into his chair rasping and coughing weasley still hadntstopped laughing hysterically granger was frowning and shaking her head the pink haired girl tocks tak tink maybe it was tink was sniggering quietly the werewolf looked exasperated and potter was gibbering out a string of incoherent but hysterically upset psycho babble regarding his parentage yes harry sighed the werewolf forcing him down into a seat where he continued to mutter and glare at draco it striking how you look exactly like snape only you have your mother eyes harry paused his muttering and stared up at the werewolf who raised an eyebrow and gave him a small smile ah said harry looking at the ground then back at the werewolf but lily was a very kind person and she cared for everyone regardless of who they were said the half breed seriously but she would have never never been unfaithful to james especially not with snape blurted out tink disgusted especially not with snape he agreed nodding potter finally nodded some of the color returning to his sheet white face lupin so what could they possibly have he asked the werewolf shook his head harry i couldntpretend to have the slightest idea lily gave james a right earful when she saw his picking on snape but she did that when he was rude to anybody no matter who they were snape never seemed to be terribly grateful for her intervention potter didntlook pleased but this information every time i move the slightest bit forward i get knocked back even farther behind and now i canteven kill snape without questioning him first he stared glumly at the tabletop ugh what a whiner the pick haired girl stood up and began offering potter words of encouragement while weasley nodded in vehemently in agreement the werewolf looked rather exhausted but everyone else seemed too preoccupied to notice and draco was finding it difficult to care was the full moon coming up it was wasntit damn when were they leaving was it soon soon would be preferable right this second would be even better draco stole another glance at granger who was chewing on her lip her eyes distant 000 he tricked her she owed him something no not enough she asked him for something he owed her something but what no that couldntbe it there was more to it but how could they possibly reconstruct a past that no one alive or probably untrustworthy had witnessed she needed to get rid of the necklace and he offered to hide it but why it was just a necklace he needed the necklace for something for what to match his earrings it was still just a necklace it was a token of something friendship love hatred they got into a desperate scuffle with death eaters and lacking a suitable offense she threw it at snape head she lost a bet playing strip poker arg hermione fought the urge to bang her head on the table this was rather frustrating there werentmany books written such subjects unfortunately because her first instinct was to dive into the nearest library and burrow into a stack of books lily was secretly a death eater no that was ridiculous but she did get a fleeting and rather comical mental picture of harry head spinning around and exploding all over the walls lily and snape were secretly lovers no eww plus lupin didntthink so she didntknow harry parents personally but any two people who could produce a son with as much courage kindness and integrity as harry couldnthave been anything less than wonderful there had to be more to these things that they didntknow but no secrets snape was holding could be trusted could they hermione she snapped out of her daze and fixed her eyes on ron who was staring at her what do you think such a very simple question with so many very complicated answers she opened her mouth but it took a moment for words to form i think this complicates things quite a bit she said slowly genius said malfoy dryly now we all know why you re at the top of our class she silenced him with a glare which she was becoming disturbing adept at and turned back to harry he did didnthe he listened to her life debt perhaps or was the little berk finally starting to respect her not that it mattered hmph jerk he obviously wanted your attention harry she said which i d say he got piped up tonks folding her arms and giving them a quirked smile right said hermione he wants something more from you than just killing you would accomplish which could be connotative of something even more horrible though i dontknow what you re like a walking ray of sunshine granger malfoy offered sarcastically that what i like about all of you bite me malfoy snapped harry that it said malfoy in a mocking tone as if suddenly enlightened he wants you for your stunningly witty and cunningly original comebacks potter lupin cleared his throat loudly and malfoy and harry both shut up harry he began in his usual kind tones whatever the mystery is i sure you ll get to the bottom of it you always do and dontforget you have many wonderful resources around you he looked between ron and hermione ron smiled and hermione blushed whom i sure will be able to help you no matter what the task his eyes fell briefly on malfoy as if to silently question why on earth he was still here or if he could be of any use malfoy opened his mouth as if to inform him or possibly just insult him hermione kicked him hard under the table ow yelped ron sorry apologized hermione swiftly wincing at her mistake the kick however still had its desired effect as malfoy was now too busy cackling at ron pain to insult anyone anyway continued lupin who looked as though he were desperately trying to hide his amusement as i said i sure it will work out his expression sobered slightly and he looked at his watch tonks and i will always be here if you need anything as an auror i can get you an excellent deal on fanged frisbees should you need a few particularly vicious ones to chuck at snape head tonks informed them with an equally serious though somewhat playful expression on her face that is most assuredly not what i was referring to protested lupin tonks smirked mischievously at him yeah yeah you d like everyone to think that would you lupin rolled his eyes the looked back at harry i sure fred and george would be happy to donate to our cause said harry brightly that the spirit said tonks hermione wondered briefly if lupin was ever going to finish what he was saying but he went on ahead anyway harry i believe it your birthday in two days is it not he inquired harry nodded almost surprised hermione felt a sinking feeling in her stomach had a month already flown by since they left school two days well one really since it was a little past midnight i regret that i will be preoccupied at that time malfoy scooted his chair away from lupin in alarm as if he thought lupin was going to suddenly sprout fangs and rip out his jugular at any moment huh not that he wouldntdeserve it bigoted git oh that was a little harsh but we ve brought you a present in advance tonks pulled out a rather large wrapped package from nowhere and sat it on the table in front of harry happy birthday she chirped wicked said ron what is it it a surprise isntit said tonks winking at him dontopen it until tomorrow well we re on our way she stood up grabbing lupin arm goodbye said lupin as he was dragged out of the room good luck contact us if you need anything bye called tonks from the other room out of sight hermione heard a clink as the vase of floo was taken off the mantle come on she said a lower voice obviously talking to lupin it late let get you into bed but i still feel fine said lupin almost indignantly as if she were insulting his obviously precarious health just a little exhausted i dontneed bed rest for goodness sakes that is so not what i meant hermione could almost hear evidence of a smirk on her face lupin coughed loudly into his hand tonks called out an address and a crackling roar indicated they had both disappeared the look of disgust that appeared on malfoy face at tonks last remark still had not faded those two he informed them are absolutely revolting i think it cute protested hermione fondly he looks very happy with her offered harry in agreement malfoy snorted you d be happy too if you were an old man shagging an attractive young woman 20 years your junior she charlie age i think said ron who was still staring at the package on the table seemingly forgetting the fact that it was not actually his birthday at all there see she only thirteen years younger than him snapped hermione and he not even that old and you re a pig malfoy are you going to open this ron asked harry i think she said to wait until tomorrow shrugged harry ron looked crestfallen i going to bed said hermione irritated and stormed up the stairs 000 hermione ron was down on one knee clasping her hands warmly in his gazing up at her with adoration she barely concealed a smile a flush of delight sweeping warmly across her face hermione i ve loved you since before i even noticed girls you re the most perfect woman i ve ever known there was a soft breeze blowing somewhere she was wearing white they both were it just seemed like the right color for such an occasion and they were standing on a beach or at least she thought they were it could have been any body of water she supposed perhaps even the lake at hogwarts she would like that probably ron fished something out of his breast pocket fumbling it slightly in his freckled hands before holding it aloft before her i cantgive you the world but i know you dontwant it sincerity sparkled in his eyes and in the tiny diamond before her all i can give you is my love forever hermione he sucked in a breath will will you will you marry me oh ron she said her eyes misty of course i will she kissed him wrapping her arms tightly around his neck when the scene suddenly froze hermione sighed happily and lifted the remote to pause the program she was watching she looked quietly around the room hoping she was alone so she could watch it again her favorite dream of all time over and over it wasntthat large of a room but it was cozy she was sitting on the edge of a bed watching a television mounted on the wall the television was large and flat and encapsulated in a gilded golden frame as though it were an aging portrait she clicked the remote again hermione hermione i ve loved you since before i even noticed girls you re the most perfect woman i ve ever known i cantgive you the world but i know you dontwant it all i can give you is my love forever hermione will how many times are you going to watch that drivel drawled an exasperated voice from behind her she gasped and swiveled around in the bed the remote flying from her hands draco malfoy was standing on the opposite side of the bed arms folded staring at the now blank screen with an expression of disdain he was wearing a crisply fitted pure white suit which in combination with the white walls and his pale features gave him an almost ghostlike effect i she waited for her heart rate to decline she scowled at him what are you doing here you re not supposed to be here i got an invitation he countered gleefully holding aloft an envelope besides these things just happen ha i bet you invited yourself let me see that she bounded forward on the bed snatching the envelope with a swipe of her hand but as she attempted to tear it open it simply faded away to nothingness in her grasp arentyou sick of watching that by now demanded draco in an annoyed voice why arentyou living it if it means that much to you his eyes fell on the sleeping boy in the bed or at least imagining it properly hermione followed his gaze ron was asleep in the bed behind her curled up and breathing steadily on top of the perfectly undisturbed sheets he looked surprisingly peaceful it was an odd thing watching someone sleep like being with them and yet being quite undeniably alone at the same time he asleep she informed him haughtily as if it werentobvious he a bit useless isnthe then said draco quirking his head slightly and raising an eyebrow at the motionless ron he ll wake up eventually countered hermione defiantly she moved her hand as if to touch his shoulder but drew it back ron naturally did not notice at all if you say so draco snorted looking dubious his eyes roved around the room it was strikingly white though the sheets of the bed were a deep crimson it was completely devoid of furniture though there were several portraits adorning the walls hermione looked at the pictures as well they were arranged along the wall in a straight line all different sizes each one in an ornate golden frame to the far left there was a small boy with light hair who continually threw terrified looks at hermione next to him was a similarly sized portrait of gilderoy lockhart who was continually preening and flashing blinding smiles at everyone who foolishly made eye contact with him next to him was a sullen portrait of victor krum quite a bit larger than the other two to the right of krum sulking self was an empty canvas framed beautifully it was staggeringly larger than the other portraits in the room stretching almost from floor to ceiling who goes in that one he asked curiously nodding his head towards it hermione flushed looking away from him and allowing her eyes to fall back on the sleeping ron i haventdecided yet she mumbled it takes up an awful lot of space doesntit he observed well he s he very important to me she answered quietly where potter he in a different room said hermione now irritated she stood up and slipped out the lone door making her way down the hall she turned when she heard footfalls behind her why are you following me draco she demanded i dontknow he shrugged looking honestly bewildered that the big question isntit well stop it she stomped her foot in frustration he stared up at her almost sadly his eyes glittering pale and cold in the empty hall i can t he said softly 000 draco was actually having a rather nice dream thank you very much he was back at the manor sitting idly on a gilded throne that had somehow miraculously appeared in the living room several scantily clad veela were clustered around him feeding him grapes and giggling stupidly with a seductive grin one of them pulled a red hot poker from the roaring fireplace and pushed it hard into draco forearm ow he yelped struggling to free himself stop that the woman shrugged you know i not the one doing this she said idly pushing the poker harder against his arm his skin hissing in protest no that was true he realized as something resonated in the back of his mind sweeping him away into a vortex of not so long forgotten memories draco was dreaming of the past as he moved forward the shadowy figures beside crystallized into the presences of a recent memory and the hallway around him spilled into a sickeningly familiar stone cavern he drifted forward detached and knelt briefly before the dark lord throne before shuffling backwards his heart quickened in his chest he had never been to this place before and he had never stood in the presence of the dark lord without his father school was out in this moment in time fifth year had ended it was late june his mother stood beside him in the front of the small crowd with the other servants who had managed to escape they seemed to number exactly one bellatrix black she looked shaken and the mad gleam in her eyes was more pronounced than usual a sort of hysterical desperation to cause pain that was so unique to her a crowd of others stood clustered against the back wall the dark lord was speaking in an angry hiss rattling off names that draco couldntseem to focus on a list of the captured but they didntmatter they werenthere to bear his wrath and furious he was indeed seething raw and furious emotion that was pounding into draco skull almost like a physical force terror consumed draco but he did not move a single muscle even though every fiber of his being was screaming at him to run lucius malfoy he finished his burning red eyes boring into draco and his mother his mother grasped her cloak tightly in a white knuckled fist but did not speak lucius whom i specifically charged with this task lucius whom i entrusted with a most vital responsibility his eyes narrowed strung together like idiot children by that muggle loving fool albus dumbledore and thrown in azkaban like common thieves all of my servants useless to me crucio with a suddenness that made draco jump he flung his wand to the side towards bellatrix for what was probably not the first time in several days she was writhing on the floor and screaming he withdrew his wand all was silent though her screeches echoed shrilly around the room sending shivers up draco spine my lord please please forgive me she wailed bowing before him i was weak i deserve it draco fought hard not to curl his lip in disgust despite the terror that enveloped him how could she whimper at his feet begging for mercy like a kicked dog where was her sense of dignity had she no pride in the blood she was fighting for this is not your fault bella said the dark lord though your incompetence will not go unpunished and albus dumbledore must be killed immediately i will deal with later he looked at narcissa this is lucius fault lucius has proven himself unworthy he has cost me my servants lost me an important battle and humiliated me before my enemies his crimson eyes flashed his voice slowly building to a crescendo he didnthave to scream to be terrifying he was more terrible than anything else on earth i have lost once more to that brat potter a mere child the prophecy has been irrevocably destroyed and oh yes my return has been announced rather publicly to the entire wizarding world his voice echoed in a screaming hiss around the cavern he swiveled his head towards draco mother twisting his neck like that of an angry cobra his white nostrils flaring narcissa malfoy he said as if her name was a foul taste upon his tongue draco could feel his mother shaking next to him but she held herself with dignity that was more than could be said of her mad whore of a sister at least two catlike pupils focused on her regal form yes my lord her voice was barely above a whisper as she knelt before his throne only her eyes betrayed her fear draco started forward instinctually but bellatrix clamped a claw like hand down in his arm stopping him i warned lucius he slowly raised his wand draco could see the breath catch in her throat that the price would be terrible if he failed me he aimed between her eyes both misty blue and wide as galleons i ll let him know if he ever escapes that you died screaming i think that will be a suitable deterrent against future failures assuming of course that he survives captivity bella snickered softly though looked at narcissa with a kind of nostalgic sullenness no p draco almost slipped malfoys do not beg i ll do it i ll kill him he strode forward out of bella grasp and stood in front of his mother my lord i ll do whatever you wish anything spare her life the dark lord stared at him as though not quite sure if he should be furious or amused how old are you young master malfoy sixteen my lord since june not a very nice birthday hearing your father has been arrested but it served its purpose one year older harry potter age are you not i am my lord the dark lord leaned forward slightly on his throne some of the feeling returned to draco knees as his wand finally lowered slightly and you wish for the chance to restore your family honor yes i will do anything my lord he said he couldntbelieve what he was saying he felt like he was having difficulty breathing it will not be a small task young master malfoy your father has shamed himself and his blood deeply and it will take i think white lips curled into a smile a very great success to dismiss such an egregious offense draco mother made a whimpering noise next to him he did not look at her but at the floor bowing deeply before his lord i will do whatever is required of me my lord anything the dark lord paused then quietly you will kill albus dumbledore he said lightly as if he were requesting him to fetch a cup of tea narcissa malfoy gasped draco could feel her wide eyes boring into him i think that shall be sufficient draco clenched his hands he could feel his nails biting relentlessly into his palms something you would like to say draco another mocking smile that was the first time he had used his name no my lord he looks up at the dark lord his grey eyes blazing it shall be done as you wish you will enter my service then his eyes bored into draco s but draco refused to look away it was like some weight was crushing his head his eyes just as he felt close to blacking out clear the unmarked from the room he ordered the pressure released leaving draco feeling dizzy draco was not familiar with the small crowd of people in the back of the room he could hear his mother from behind him her breathing ragged she let out a muted whimper as someone dragged her harshly out of the room struggling vainly to catch another glimpse of draco the door slammed behind them come draco he beckoned draco moved closer to the throne and bowed before him give me your arm draco extended his arm the dark lord bent forward and wrapped his long white fingers around his forearm gingerly pushing up the sleeve of his shirt to reveal the soft underside of flesh above his fist he ran a finger across it smiling lovingly as if her were an artist faced with a fresh pure white canvas a circle had formed around them all wearing masks draco smiled a little bit as his arm was examined he had imagined this moment for a long time but his grin faded it wasntlike this it wasntdesperation that drove him here he wanted to own this moment he wanted to choose it at least the dark lord pulled out his wand and jabbed it onto the flesh of draco forearm morsmordre he hissed first it was just a prickle then stinging then burning the sensation consumed his entire arm in a pain that drove him to his knees but he did not cry out silver sparks danced in front of his eyes the world seemed to contract violently for a moment and then silence the world slid back into focus the wand was drawn back and draco rose shakily to his feet the dark lord leaned in close to his ear if you fail young malfoy he hissed without a touch of amusement in his voice i will kill both of them there is nowhere you can hide from me nodding dizzily draco backed away his knees felt like rubber and he was painfully aware of the burning sensation on his forearm a sharp ache as though a knife had been driven into his flesh sweat was making his shirt cling to his neck the dark lord rose to his feet and his servants immediately collapsed to the floor draco was actually rather grateful for that at this point he strode forward as words of veneration were murmured from all around him and stopped in front of draco draco leaned down and kissed the hem of the dark lord robes master he looked up at him you are in my service now until you die yes my lord you will obey my wishes without question yes my lord you will follow your brethren gathered around you and all of their aid will be at your disposal as you attempt to fulfill your task yes my lord the dark lord smiled good draco was dismissed quickly warned to tell no one of his mission bellatrix flashed him a rare albeit depraved smile as he left he knew what she was grinning about congratulations boy now is your chance at honor at glory she was right he supposed honor glory a chance to restore the family name he had looked forward to he supposed but there was also a tremendous burden to placate the dark lord so that she would have to pay the ultimate price and his father was he safe within the walls of azkaban draco shuddered involuntarily nowhere nowhere was safe the dark lord power was boundless his mother was outside on a bench shivering though the warm air of midsummer was all around them she whirled around when she saw draco emerge from the chamber and raced to his side draco she murmured her voice choked she looked furious and at the same time more heartbroken that he had ever seen her you should have let me take care of it oh yes snapped draco anger bubbling within him he felt as though he were dangling by a dangerously frayed thread your plan to die horribly for father mistakes was absolutely brilliant inspired really she dropped to her knees before him shaking her head it should not have been you why did you do that are you mad you re still still a child he looked at her dully still rather unable to process just what had happened his shirt was still rolled away from his arm and her eyes were drawn to the black scar on his pale skin i suppose i am not a child anymore he said tonelessly he ll he could kill you her hands clenched convulsively he a doddering old fool but but oh no thank you so much for the vote of confidence mother he hissed i ll do it i will and then we ll be honored above the dark lord other servants she shook her head miserably you you have no idea what you re getting into and how could you you ve you ve never this is his mother expression finally cracked into a mask of desperate misery she had put on such a brave fa ade for him when he returned from school but he could tell how heartbroken this whole dreadful affair had made her the fact that he came home off the train looking more like a slug than a boy oozing from a cadre of nasty jinxes had not exactly helped my son my only son her whole body shuddered and she pitched forward throwing her arms around his midsection and gripping him tightly her whole body shaking violently tears poured silently down her face he rested a hand on her shoulder and raised his arm blankly to get a better look a jet black scar skull and snake he had doodled them in the margins of his potions notebook for years the pain had faded to a dull ache though there was still a hint of red around the puckered edges for what seemed like forever he couldntdo anything but stare in silence while his mother shivering mournful wails spilled forth and echoed around the room 000 you did what screamed granger voice drifting up from the downstairs level of grimmauld place keep your voice down hissed weasely in alarm this is supposed to be a surprise draco now quite inexorably awake stared in boredom at the ceiling unconsciously rubbing his forearm bloody hell after a few moments of careful preening in the bathroom he made his way downstairs it was morbid curiosity really that made him decide not to stay upstairs also he was hungry and there was the added bonus of watching granger scream at weasley heh that was always worth the trip this is a blatant abuse of elf labor said granger furiously gesturing madly as if words alone werentenough to express her indignation i cantbelieve you he wanted to help countered weasley you know him he loves harry bloody mad about him it right creepy sometimes you re exploiting him she countered point a finger accusingly in his freckled face exploiter i am not explating him said weasley defensively she said exploiting you dullard said draco he was sitting at the table with his head resting on his chin watching them lazily is if they were a particularly hostile quidditch match they both jumped slightly when he spoke whirling around to face him as if they had forgotten everything else in the world except screaming at each other what are you two on about anyway ronald here granger stared at him with narrowed eyes decided to contract dobby to make a birthday cake for harry completely exploiting his generosity and affinity for harry it absolutely disgusting he wanted to help roared weasley you are completely bonkers draco rolled his eyes theatrically then why dontyou pay the bloody wretch if that what you re on about merlin you re giving me a headache how does potter put up with this shit all day long they both stared at him blankly silent for a moment and then looked at each other well that a good idea sounds fine to me good that would be fair fine i will fine great this was followed by more silence speaking of where is potter anyway i dontsee how could have slept through the racket you two were making asked draco at that moment potter wandered down the stairs and into the kitchen looking around at the assembled crowd morning good morning chirped granger as if she had been perfectly cheerful all day and had not in fact been screaming like a mad banshee at weasley a few minutes ago happy birthday mate added weasley thanks said potter smiling good lord potter said draco who had jumped back in alarm the moment potter had entered the kitchen what the hell is on your head potter looked upwards my hair he replied staring at draco as if he were quite mad draco curled his lip in disgust does it always look like that in the morning he asked in horror the jet black disheveled mass on potter head looked like flock of angry seagulls had all tried to nest in the same place gotten into a terrific fight over it and all flown away leaving a mass of unruly tangled devastation in their wake the only thing the hair style was missing was several twigs sticking at odd angles stop staring at my head malfoy grumbled harry draco just shrugged resolving not to look directly at potter head until he at least tried to comb his hair the sight was liable to make him go blind do you want to open your presents now asked weasley excitedly i opened lupin and tonks already said potter brightly it was wicked do you want to see he darted out of the room for a moment and returned with a box the lid open and flapping in the air he set it down in the table you opened it already asked granger in a small voice looking somewhat upset without anyone there on your birthday potter looked up at her suddenly confused he paused as if it had never occurred to him not to well i i mean i always open my birthday presents alone he said slowly i very sorry he added seeing the heartbroken look on her face i didntreally think about it of course you didn t she said with passionate sympathy throwing her arms around him and hugging him tightly dontapologize oh harry happy birthday she continued to squeeze him her eyes over bright until he protested in a strangled voice that he was starting to have significant difficulty breathing granger released him and backed away draco mockingly pantomimed crying over potter lonely childhood from behind the table but no one noticed what in the box asked weasley peering at it curiously potter reached in and began to pull things out spreading them out on the table there was a black dragonhide jacket gloves sunglasses a rather dorky looking helmet and a pair of silver keys the last thing he pulled out was a letter which granger accepted and began reading pausing occasionally to comment worriedly harry happy birthday from both of us i know some of these objects may seem rather odd but i assure you they all serve a purpose sirius brought it to my attention several times whilst we were staying at grimmauld place that there was a perfectly good flying motorbike gathering dust in the attic oh no please tell me he didn t and no one was using it to wreak havoc on the wizarding world he seemed adamant that you should receive it naturally i tended to blame this aspiration on cabin fever but i digress now that you are of age you can freely ride within reason anywhere you wish without ministry restriction the clothing included also belonged to sirius he insisted that no self respecting cyclist should be without a good leather jacket and i assure you the girls at school had no objections so i imagine he intended for you to wear them in conjunction with the motorbike should you choose to accept it i have included the helmet that goes with the bike though tonks assures me that there is no way in hell any teenage boy in their right mind would wear it i felt it prudent to at least include the option you really ought to wear it harry so in conclusion we wish you the very happiest of birthdays and hope that you enjoy your present someone wrote as responsibly as possible and it looks like someone else scratched it out sincerely remus and tonks it really is up in the attic said potter in satisfaction i just checked wicked said weasley clapping his hands together his eyes alight draco mind briefly formulated a plan to convince weasley to ride the flying bike into the side of a building but he dismissed it oh harry said granger nervously are you really going to use the bike it probably so dangerous that the point of it isntit said weasley as if it were obvious are you at least going to wear the helmet she asked in an almost pleading voice potter looked at her guiltily i ll er think about it he offered weasley made a face granger looked a little bit relieved are you going to wear this asked weasley picking up the jacket and examining it this is a nice jacket must be dragonhide fred and george just bought a pair ginny would probably appreciate it said granger with a slightly twisted smile potter and weasley reddened the female weasel wasntpotter dating her most people in slytherin seemed convinced she was some sort of mad little tart plus those skirts she wore were a bit too short for her propriety to remain wholly intact not that he ever noticed her of course draco sneered the famous harry potter covered head to toe in leather i sure gaggles of girls will chase you right down the street well the ensemble wouldntbe complete unless i borrowed those dashing leather trousers you were wearing earlier malfoy he retorted weasley snickered though i imagine you destroyed them the first chance you got draco leaned backwards casually in his chair and folded his arms actually they re upstairs weasley goggled at him you kept them squeaked granger who had gone beet red to be honest draco had considered destroying them as a sign of the humiliation granger had put him through however he was unable to reconcile wiping the trousers from the face of earth with how gorgeous they made his arse look and kept them if you re quite done fantasizing about me in leather trousers you can borrow them sometime potter he smirked unabashedly 000 malfoy wearing leather trousers no malfoy wearing leather trousers is repulsive she scolded herself here said hermione brightly racing to the side of the kitchen and picking up a package she sat it down next to the biker ensemble happy birthday how many times do all of you have to say happy birthday in the span of five minutes i think he gets it sighed malfoy everyone ignored him it was his birthday after all ron disappeared from the room for a moment and quickly returned placing another box next to hermione s harry after a bit of encouragement and still looking slightly bashful opened them hermione had bought him a book she knew of course that harry did not read quite as often as she did but she stubbornly believed that anyone could appreciate the gift of literature so long as they received the right book she had bought him grindewald defeated and legacy of greatness the life and times of albus percival wulfric brian dumbledore she had actually read both books cover to cover while standing in the store and debating whether or not to buy them the dumbledore biography had come out practically the moment his funeral ended she recognized the author melvin remington as the keynote speaker from the funeral the book was an interesting read of course dumbledore had lived a fascinating life but the book lacked fundamentally the qualities of warmth and enlightenment that the headmaster possessed it was a shame because in hermione opinion those were the qualities that had made him truly great what she had really regretted was that dumbledore had left behind no written memoirs no autobiography for the ages to remember him by he didntseem like the type to write things down observed ron he had been in the bookstore with her as she complained about this particular issue trying to discreetly hide the copy of wicked witches in short skirts he was looking at he left behind his actions for everybody to remember that was his legacy of greatness or whatever is in that book ron had bought him a set of fingerless quidditch gloves no more slipping off your broomstick no matter what the weather guaranteed made from black leather and trimmed with a thin line of gold they would compliment his uniform rather nicely in hermione opinion harry seemed genuinely grateful for both gifts but hermione rather regretted that neither of them had managed to buy him something really amazing like a shield that could repel curses or a nice wristwatch that would make him invincible you know something practical malfoy was looking boredly at them finally someone else noticed how often potter goes tumbling off his bloody broomstick harry glared at him malfoy stared back at him you can stop staring at me potter he said smoothly i didntget you anything if you would just shut the hell up said harry it would be the best present ever fine said malfoy for ten minutes i wontsay anything nasty they looked at him slightly bewildered for a moment before continuing their conversation thank you for the presents guys said harry sincerely they re brilliant really i hope quidditch starts up again sighed ron i going to miss the games it figures weasley that the only thing you miss about academia is sports snorted malfoy that was definitely not 10 minutes malfoy harry informed him that was more like two you just cantstand not to be the center of attention can you snapped hermione i said i wouldntsay anything nasty he clarified i didntsay i would stop saying things that were true they all stared at him well he looked around at their indignant faces if i wanted to be nasty i would tell weasley that his face looks like a go read hermione cut him off jerkily she picked up a book and slapped it against his chest somewhere else grumbling about sappy gryffindor gits malfoy slunk off into the living room we need to get rid of him said ron frowning you mean kill him asked harry his eyes widening no i dontmean kill him countered ron he seemed to ponder this for a moment but since you brought it up i mean we cantkill him pointed out hermione feeling as usual like the only sane person in the room it would be unethical you and your ethics muttered ron look sighed hermione let not worry about what to do with him now today should be fun i know we ve hit a bit of a sticking point but it not really a dead end and we ll never give up will we so maybe for one day we can forget that there a piece of voldemort soul and a diary full of dark magic hidden in the living room next to a former death eater and just i dontknow do something fun hermione said ron in a mock scolding tone how very unpractical of you ha ha she countered dryly you called him a former death eater said harry softly hermione looked up in surprise do you really think that true hermione twisted her hands i dontknow she said truthfully since when did i become the expert on malfoy you did save his worthless life pointed out ron come on hermione said harry throwing her a small smile you know everything hermione shook her head i dontknow not everything is written in books they were all quiet for a moment we donttechnically need him anymore said ron we got what we needed out of the diary didntwe he looked from harry to hermione i think we did she said but he knows what we re doing said harry with a touch of urgency in his voice what if he goes running back to voldemort and spills his ferret guts to him i dontthink he will hermione said he not exactly pleased with the way voldemort treated his family and all that bullocks about pureblood family honor is all he talks about it really quite annoying so he hates voldemort more than he hates us right now is that it asked ron basically yes i think so huh said ron contemplatively that a new one but that doesntchange who he is i never said that it did she responded evenly but he would sell us out if he felt threatened said harry harshly staring at hermione as if he expected her to disagree perhaps she said fairly so i think if we are going to separate from him we have to find him some place to hide ron made an exasperated huffing noise i think we owe him at least that we dontowe him anything growled ron yes we do snapped hermione how else would we have gotten into malfoy manor for goodness sakes he an ass but he been helpful and it not fair to him to leave him to get blown to bits by the same people we are trying to fight ron and hermione both looked harry as if he could cast the deciding vote harry raised an eyebrow at both of them fine he said after a pause we ll find him a place to stay that sounds fair but we have to make sure he doesntstart spilling our secrets to the wrong people 000 granger the mad bint had given him a book of muggle psychology it was thick and ugly and smelled like chemicals muggle books always smelled odd so did muggles for that matter in his opinion draco slammed the book shut on a full page detailed picture of a human brain it looked squishy despite the strange renovations that had seemingly been perpetrated on the house he still felt more at home here than he did elsewhere it was an old wizards house and the fact that it might in some remote way belong to him was rather comforting he sunk further into his chair and sighed much as he was loathe to admit it draco often did feel like his life was spinning out of control he realized with some degree of astonishment that the world he had lived in for the past 17 years was not in fact anything at all like the world he was currently living in he felt as though he had missed something had he really been that sheltered the events of this past year had more or less thrust him to the brink no privileges no help no nothing just cold threats it made his head spin he could barely reconcile this chilly current reality with his perception he felt as though he should be able to tap someone on the shoulder and say excuse me are you sure this is the real world because it seems to be broken is there anyone i could talk to about fixing it i am after all a malfoy and thusly am entitled to certain special privileges draco was still wallowing in self pity when a loud pop sounded in front of him startled he whirled around in the chair wand out happy birthday harry potter sir squeaked a disturbingly familiar voice draco gaped it was a house elf and not just any house elf his old house elf and that wasntall the elf was surrounded by floating cakes twisting and bobbing in the air around him draco continued to stare blankly at the elf who finally caught sight of him in return and shrieked as though he had been trodden on master draco squealed the elf in alarm without missing a beat the elf began running in panicked circles wailing and banging his head against things stop shrieking you little worm said draco annoyed the elf looked at him as if conflicted master draco cannot order dobby around anymore said the elf defiantly his voice trembling slightly he spread his skinny arms wide dobby is free he sounded pleased with himself if what you do with your freedom is run around shrieking and banging into walls it little wonder that you re all enslaved is it draco replied lazily the elf stared at him slightly abashed dobby enjoys his freedom dobby can do as he pleases at least he had stopped shrieking i really dontcare what you do said draco honestly dobby is looking for harry potter sir the elf still had trouble looking directly at draco draco sighed he in the kitchen draco stood up and left the living room pausing at the door of the kitchen to listen in fine potter was saying we ll find him a place to stay that sounds fair but we have to make sure he doesntstart spilling our secrets to the wrong people i can give you my word said draco they all whirled around to stare at him that plenty must you eavesdrop all the time said granger exasperatedly there a mad house elf in the living room draco informed them folding his arms he very annoying dobby said weasley brightly dobby come in here he called loudly granger cleared her throat loudly please a moment later the elf appeared in the doorway still surrounded by the floating cakes that jostled against the doorframe dobby has baked 17 cakes for harry potter sir he squeaked excitedly one for every year you know said granger staring weakly at the cakes which floated down and crowded onto the tabletop candles usually suffice you only baked me one cake on my birthdays huffed draco one cake never mind the fact that it was three feet tall and iced with several dozen tiny serpants that because master draco was mean said the elf shrilly its tiny eyes bulging you little said draco advancing on the elf it squeaked and scampered behind potter legs if you threaten him again i going to turn you into a slug said granger a glint of hysteria in her eyes she pulled her wand out and pointed it at him you re all completely mad draco threw up his hands and backed away from the elf there are 18 cakes here dobby said weasley wow weasley i didntknow you could count said draco sounding impressed the last cake is from kreacher the elf looked uneasy dobby told him he should make his master a cake on his birthday but dobby is not sure what kreacher put in the cake weasley poked the cake on the end of the table with his wand it was frosted jet black and the surface squirmed and pulsed slightly as if the inside were full of something writhing and slimy let me guess said weasley floating the cake into the rubbish bin with a disgusted grimace kreacher maggot surprise eww said potter he just a little unbalanced said granger worriedly he old draco stared blankly at her he put maggots in a cake that not unbalanced that purposefully disgusting crazy bint 000 poor kreacher hermione glared at malfoy he was just old and senile and bitter he had been exposed to a lifetime of abuse and forced labor it wasnthis fault dobby must be going if harry potter does not mind piped up dobby staring up at harry of course dobby said harry kindly thank you for the cakes dobby wide eyes brimmed with tears harry potter is so kind he cried in a wobbly voice he threw a pair of tiny arms around harry legs and hugged him dobby hopes harry potter has the very happiest of birthdays he backed up still sniffling with emotion and disappeared goodbye after a moment pause the general consensus seemed to be that they should dig into the cakes hermione helped herself to a slice of strawberry torte and found herself slightly traumatized at the sight of three teenage boys consuming cake as if they had survived a several year famine well two at least harry ate about two thirds of a cheesecake and ron finished off an entire carrot cake malfoy ate about half of a chocolate layer cake before he started to look bored and pushed it away watching ron eat cake was a very distinct sight she had no idea how someone so skinny could eat so much so quickly it was one of the mysteries of the universe she supposed harry ate the way he always did when he was consuming something delicious particularly anything with sugar in it quietly looking around everyone and awhile as if he expected someone to come scream at him and snatch it away malfoy ate very slowly with dignity as if were some sort of important preoccupied foreign dignitary bill and fleur wedding is in two days said hermione breaking the silence associated with stuffing cake in one mouth mum will murder you if you dontshow said ron to harry very matter of factly i was planning on going you know said harry shrugging she expecting us to stay over the night before added hermione pointedly harry looked at malfoy malfoy he raised an eyebrow arms folded yes potter we re leaving here soon for a few days we wontforce you to leave no if you say anything stupid right now i am going to punch you you can stay here if you d like you need somewhere to lie low for awhile we understand you could have walked away from us a dozen times but you didn t but now i want assurance that you arentgoing to tell the death eaters what you know bullshit hissed ron cantwe just modify his memory it not enough if he wants to betray us he will said harry flatly well malfoy i really dontlike you potter said malfoy he and harry were both standing now i cantexactly claim to be fond of your stupid arse either malfoy replied harry but i give you my word he extended his hand forward and harry took it by my honor as a wizard i will keep your confidences his eyes roamed away from harry and he locked gazes with hermione if you will keep mine ron mouth was shut very tightly he clearly did not agree with harry but he was not about to disagree with his friend when he had made up his mind in ron eyes hermione knew malfoy had no honor but she had learned over the course of time that there were different types of honor and odd as it seemed draco was likely to throw himself off of a cliff before dishonoring a vow even if he was still a rude smarmy little git 000 an ah yes i love lupin but every time i try to bring him into the story he runs away dammit now i know why he always at the fringes of the story though that doesntmean i not disappointed here how it usually goes authoress lupin harry needs your help lupin ok shows up helps

other rabid fangirl want to know well usually i read meaningful works of literature and contemplate them then i brood about the fact that my life is a swirling vortex of doom in which everyone i love

tonks well i happy authoress yeah i guess but i dragging your tragically heroic ass back here sometime soon so get used to it yeah it exactly like that hehehe wow that flashback was so angsty draco torture ah well he ll have to share that little story with hermione eventually wontthat be interesting sorry there wasnta lot of action in this chapter just a lot of chatter hopefully it was amusing chatter ps this is the longest chapter i have written so far so much for the shorter chapters thing i just couldntfind the right place to end it next time draco is bored everyone eats more cake horrible doom looms in the distance families are united and reunited there is more dancing and ginny and hermione discuss boys heh heh explanations comfort us by giving the impression that there is an order in things mason cooley 000 cake hermione was quite certain was not an acceptable breakfast food nor was it acceptable to eat cake for lunch immediately following several hours later with more cake for dinner in fact if she saw one more piece of cake she was fairly certain she would end up being violently ill in the middle of the kitchen i hope you all know that we cantkeep eating cake every day especially not for breakfast she informed her companions at the table she was immediately rewarded with several blank stares fwhy noot inquired ron in bewilderment through a thick mouthful of chocolate cake apparently it had never occurred to him that cake was indeed not the breakfast of champions i erm i dontknow said hermione lamely it just felt instinctually wrong on some fundamental level it very good cake offered harry diplomatically which hermione couldntargue with do you think you d be able to conjure up something better asked malfoy in a tone that wasntentirely cool or accusatory he almost looked hopeful though he had dutifully been devouring cake for the past day and a half oh no she said blushing slightly i not a very good cook granger isn t good at something stammered malfoy in mock surprise oh merlin i think the universe is collapsing in on itself hermione found that ignoring him was usually the best course of action hermione had actually tried to teach herself how to cook in her fervor of spew related activities fourth year finding it unacceptable to be eating food that had been prepared by slave labor and it wasntthat she couldntperform food spells it was just that they required a little more creativity than procedure and it wasnteven a logical sort of expansion of theory she had no trouble with that sort of thing of course it was just messy messy and indefinable and everything she conjured ended up tasting like pineapple she rather liked pineapple you know but there was something unsettling about spending a week eating meals that did not remotely consist of any sort of tropical fruit whatsoever and having then taste exactly like pineapple much to her own dismay she broke down and returned to the great hall devouring the food of the oppressive class system with a grateful longing that filled her with guilt but at least guilt didnttaste like pineapples yeesh hermione stared at harry and ron as they devoured the cake they were doing it quite cheerfully too as if it were a rare delightful surprise that they were eating cake at this very moment and they had not in fact been eating nothing but cake for over a day so cake it is said ron as if that resolved it nothing wrong with eating it yes there is countered hermione indignantly like what well it not and what about and i dontknow my parents are dentists she finished desperately her voice rising they stared at her cake offered harry politely passing her a plate she slumped down in her seat defeated eyeing the assembled legions of evil evil pastries with a resolved kind of misery she sighed pass the strawberry torte would you ron 000 draco poked tiredly at his slice of cake he was very sick of eating cake but there was absolutely no one to complain to about this issue at least no one who would be in a position to resolve this crisis so he continued to consume the cake in a resigned if not slightly embittered fashion the golden trio was leaving in a few hours to go to the wedding which would effectively leave him alone in the house it was a bit of a relief to be honest he had been longing for some peace and quiet well not that his housemates were loud or raucous really actually he was fairly sure it was just the idea of them there that made him feel suffocated yesterday had been an interesting day weasley had gotten it into his head that they needed to do something fun for potter birthday other than stand around and hug and wish him a happy birthday they did in fact wish him a happy birthday approximately 57 times if draco calculations were correct weasley disappeared for an hour and returned with a set of black and glass metal boxes the origins of which he would not share with granger despite the hysterical tone her voice took on when she caught sight of him with the contraptions weasley identified them to be a tellyvibbon and vid thingy it took draco a moment to realize that he probably meant a muggle television which confused him briefly because it looked nothing like the television in granger house after a terrific shouting match involving ecklecticity wires and the ethics of using stolen borrowed i borrowed it property they eventually settled down in front of the television to watch a muggle movie about spaceships the movie consisted mostly of people running around and screaming whilst things exploded the explosions were kind of neat in draco opinion but he had a hard time understanding why muggles were so fascinated by the idea of killing each other with shiny metal sticks or big glowing swords for that matter it seemed to lack artistry a real battle required wits and cunning and power not a metal rod that shoots out what are those things again draco had asked lasers said granger it a laser gun what a laser i thought muggle wands spewed out little bits of metal that was in draco opinion even sillier but those were muggles for you muggles dontreally have laser guns said granger not taking her eyes off the screen it a special effect what a would you shut up and watch the movie already fine whatever as if he cared about silly muggle things anyway the hero of the movie was self righteous and kind of whiny draco found himself reminded of potter tap tap tap draco was pulled from his series of not so fond memories by noise that sounded like it was coming from the window he looked up from his cake weasley had heaved open the window allowing two solemn looking owls to soar into the room and make a few slow laps around the ceiling before dropping two packages of letters onto the table potter lifted one of the four letters and stared at it for a moment a slight frown tugging at the corners of his mouth they re from hogwarts he said finally are they granger eyes lit up almost hungrily and her hand darted out to snatch up one of the letters ooh i she paused when she saw the rather closed look on potter face wasntplanning to go back anyway of course but you know she trailed off with a nervous laugh and the somewhat awkward silence was broken by the sound of her eagerly tearing open the envelope in her hands 000 dear ms granger said the letter in blank overly formal script the text was squeezed onto the first two inches of parchment leaving a vast empty space on the rest of the paper full of unanswered questions in light of recent events the board of governors for hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry has unanimously elected to indefinitely suspend all academic pursuits for this matriculating year no students will be permitted onto school premises until certain issues have been resolved sincerely headmistress minerva mcgonagall she stared blankly at the paper rereading the same phrase several times without looking up it didntmatter of course not to her not to any of them but there was something meaningful in knowing it was there waiting for them to return that the halls were alive and full of students that they werentcold and dark and empty and hopeless too many places in the wizarding world were it seemed nowadays guess we wontmiss anything eh said ron optimistically but his encouraging look quickly faded when he locked gazes with hermione it gone she said in a small voice he took it it not gone said harry probably with more fierceness than he intended for hermione almost started at his sudden outburst he has not taken it not really that what counts he seemed satisfied in this knowledge his eyes burning with a restrained heat ron nodded supportively and said something else to harry but hermione wasntlistening i have to go finish packing she said in a slightly strained voice standing up are you ok asked ron a look of quizzical concern on his freckled face you look a bit bothered yes she forced a smile i just dreading fluer wedding vows ginny said she wrote them herself and they re dreadful ron winced urg she grabbed her not entirely empty envelope and still clutching the letter in a fist hurried out of the room as quickly as possible without seeming suspiciously upset 000 i want you to keep this ms granger merlin knows you deserve it and i can only hope that it will be here waiting for you when you return in times like these we all do as we must and i believe you are called to do very great things indeed i know that you have answered that call at great personal cost but the bonds of friendship are often the most complicated and rewarding connections we make in our lives and i am quite certain that you do not take such commitments lightly please believe me when i tell you that you are one of the finest students i have had the pleasure of instructing in some fifty odd years of teaching and i do not give such compliments lightly good luck to you ms granger in all of your pursuits yours sincerely minerva mcgonagall the second letter was folded neatly behind the first letter both signed neatly by the school acting headmistress sitting cross legged on the floor of her bedroom and leaning on her trunk she carefully set both letters down on her leg the envelope was empty now except for the hefty weight of something stiff and uneven stuck in one of the corners she tipped the envelope into her palm and something shiny and golden spun in the air and landed in her hand glinting in the shafts of early morning sunlight that were cascading through the window she turned it slowly in her hand feeling its cool weight watching it glitter in the light until she could read the lettering a part of her already knew what it said but her heart skipped a beat anyway head girl it was practically worthless an empty title to go with an empty building and yet it was absolutely everything she managed a tiny sorrowful smile blinking furiously to disguise her own silly sentimentality from the empty room how tragic the school closes and you have no way to indulge your desire to boss people around surprisingly selfish of you granger malfoy leaned casually against the doorframe arms folded he was often in that position she noticed defensive though he leered superiorly as if nothing bothered him at all as if you re a remotely appropriate person to lecture me on the evils of indulging in selfishness she snapped back wiping her eyes sourly with her shirt cuff you dontknow anything about me you keep saying that he shifted tilting his head in such a way that the shafts of warm sunlight reflected in faint pools around his lean frame he was so pale he seemed to mirror the world around him she noticed in the daytime his light complexion and white blond hair seemed as if they had been engraved out of gold but at night he shone silver silver and cold you re upset that you ve lost another bit of territory to the dark lord she frowned harry said she began defiantly bullocks on what potter said malfoy interrupted her sharply silvery grey eyes flashing you know the truth he doesnthave to invade the school with dementors or death eaters he doesnteven have to burn it to the ground to destroy it utterly it already gone that school is his now so is half the wizarding world by those standards he in every deserted street and alley in hogsmeade in diagon alley everywhere as long as people are afraid of him he ll keep winning no one has a chance and you know it potter doesntsee things that way he doesntunderstand like you do she stared at him for a moment utterly shocked by his insight and horrified at its similarity to the tiny cynical voice in the back of her own mind she tightened her fist around the badge in her hand closing her eyes so you re not she asked finally not what you re not afraid of him she clarified opening her eyes and fixing her gaze upon his slim frame is that why you re willing to fight him i never said that he said his eyes narrowing you would have to be a fool not to fear the dark lord i think people are right to cower in their homes but it only delays the inevitable you think defeat is inevitable she set the badge down on her trunk with a soft click i thought you must as well he said looking almost puzzled in his bitterness surely you can see it able to see so clearly and yet blind at the same time it wasntvictory that was important in these situations at least not to her if you believe defeat is inevitable she pushed the lid of her trunk closed and used the surface to pull herself up off the floor then what are you doing here with us surviving he said in a flat voice shrugging with an air so casual it suggested it had been forced i not fighting to win granger i here because i have no choice so bullocks to potter and his grand plan i sure he ll die believing in whatever cause tickles his fancy you always have a choice she said firmly refusing to break the eye contact that spanned the air between them with an almost electric force he stared at her for a long moment eyes critical and still narrowed as if he regarded her words with the utmost suspicion perhaps words which he was so artful at manipulating were the most treacherous things of all to him and believing in anything that sounded compelling was a sure way to end up in the worst possible of situations and then without another word he disappeared out of the doorframe and down the corridor having never actually stepped into the room 000 draco stole quickly down the hall suddenly wanting to distance himself from granger as quickly as possible not that it was the first time he had such an impulse his own hogwarts letter was tucked hastily within his pocket he had not actually bothered to open it entirely unsure as to what he d find inside quite possibly some sort of nasty hex he d read weasley letter over his shoulder and was satisfied enough with that weasley didnteven notice him looking which filled draco with an intense desire to swindle him at some sort of card game maybe goblin poker not that weasley had enough money to make him worth swindling he hurried into his own room and slammed the door hopefully right in the face of granger and her stupid intuitive advice 000 we re going to be late said potter in a concerned voice how can we be late asked weasley i dontrecall us ever giving them an estimate as to when we d arrive you know that a very good point potter said conciliatorily stealthy do you think hermione needs help packing her things asked weasley she been up there for awhile draco sat on an armchair watching them and feeling extremely bored head resting on his knuckles probably modeling that stupid badge in the mirror he though to himself sneering idly the thought of walking in on her engaged in any sort of narcissistic activity was rather amusing to him particularly because of all the new and exciting ways he could mock her as a follow up and he set off up the stairs without a word to potter and weasely they were busily engaged in a debate as to whether or not knocking on the door would violate some kind of girly boundary mostly because the stairs wouldntturn into a slide on knock them on their arses the minute they tried to walk up to her door they actually had to make the judgment based on their own decision making skills horror of horrors draco thought they were doomed in all instances if that was the case he also thought idly that the stairs to the girls dormitory in the slytherin dormitories made no such effort to keep boys out if there was one thing salazar slytherin was in favor of it seemed it was the conception of pureblooded children draco ignored potter and weasley as he went up the stairs and they ignored him this was part of the silent contract they seemed to have made when they decided to trust or at least tolerate each other it was rather boring sometimes but if he was really bored and wanted to torment them for his own amusement it wasntas if the option was closed they were within hearing distance of his mouth after all he made his way down the hall knocking on granger door no one answered still admiring that stupid badge he smirked he pushed lightly on the door and it swung open with a rather vocal creak granger he said questioningly he stepped inside his eyes sweeping the room until he spotted her sitting on the bed knees pulled glumly up to her chin her head snapped towards him but she looked rather cross when she recognized him oh she said in voice that was tired and strained but not entirely disdainful it you you flatter me he said dryly try to contain you excitement her eyes were red and swollen she looked as though she had been crying what do you want the rest of your merry little band is downstairs growing rather restless he informed her evenly are you actually going to leave or are you going to sit here all weekend because honestly i sort of had my hopes up that i would be rid of all of you for awhile he smiled charmingly oh she looked around the room probably for a clock did they send you up here oh bother no he said looking around idly i just came he ignored the sudden rather perplexed look on her face so what have you been doing up here he inquired i thought you might have spent the past few hours admiring your reflection in that badge he smirked after all that was what he had done with his first prefect badge he was so enamored he almost forgot to go down for supper a pang of sorrow seemed to cross her face as he mentioned the badge and she turned away from him gazing out the window and partially hiding her face is this about school he asked finally there was a terrible battle going on inside of draco part of him naturally wanted to laugh in her face and the other part wanted to stop looking like a giant had just eaten her pet cat but he had promised to be civil towards her and civility probably meant that he should not laugh in her face while she was in no state to tell him off however amusing it might be she paused for a moment sinking down further behind her knees and drawing her shoulders closer to her face yes she said in an even voice not looking at him he didntsay anything arentyou going to tell me everything is going to be alright she asked softly the barest hint of bitterness whispering at the edge of her words that we ll all go back someday together and everything will be fine no he said lightly shrugging that would probably be a lie it might not be she looked at him then looked away again that what harry or ron would say i think you ll find that i am neither potter nor weasley he said wrinkling his nose in disgust and what an unflattering comparison do you have some aversion to lying that we re all unaware of she asked him her voice still tired she quirked an eyebrow at him i dontlie he informed her arrogantly though i do on occasion omit certain things why not i should think that was obvious he grinned self satisfied and wicked why bother lying the truth is so much nastier or what you believe to be true she said more to herself it seemed than him it a highly functional system when you re always right he pointed out imperiously her lip quirked for an instant and something amused flashed briefly in her eyes but she didntshare whatever she had intended to say probably something quite cheeky draco found himself feeling rather cheated bickering with granger was sort of entertaining you know sometimes she looked away frowning why are you still here he didntanswer her he really wasntentirely sure he owed her an answer that was far more than he ever promised why are you i not the one who running late that was not an answer she pointed out why do you keep doing that he leapt to his feet suddenly wanting to be as far away as possible from her and those damn eyes staring so calmly at him why do you always have to know everything it bloody unhealthy he paced in a quick circle around the room throwing up his hand so he wouldnthave to look at her placid tearstained face here you are sitting here and he made an exasperated noise he could still feel her eyes boring into him he caught sight of the door on one of his rotations about the room and practically lunged towards it i leaving he said in the same sputtering breath you think that you owe me something but you just dontknow what you want things to be even between us again so you can stop thinking about it she spoke softly and he froze on his trajectory towards the door some sort of conciliatory form of honor that you ve fallen back on because of all the things you ve ever been taught it the only thing you have left right now he was able to turn slowly and look at her because her gaze was turned away staring out the window into the soft warm light of the late afternoon i upset and you think if you can fix that you donthave to worry about your obligations in this whole ridiculous situation anymore because i did the same for you in that cave the only difference is you were trying to do it without lying to me she gave a small bitter smile maybe that why you arentsucceeding lying to him of course why not his eyes were narrowed and calculating again if you know already he said his voice as taunt as a plucked string then why bother asking she hugged her knees toward her chest staring glumly at the bed spread it not my place to know everything she admitted quietly besides it could have been any number of possibilities it didntfit at first oh he said though gritted teeth that bitch he hated her he remembered now and why is that because when i try to think of you as a person motivated by say an iota of human empathy it rather hard to make sense of things she said she stared down with something that could have been shame but her eyes flicked up towards him for an instant he could see in her face that this was her attempting to be honest with him but in that instant he was too angry to care he had been taught to hide his anger to push it away into something constructive like tormenting longbottom but here he had nothing to channel it into it occurred to him that it had been a very long time maybe most of his life since he had felt strongly anything that wasntanger or fear or jealousy and he realized just now that he had been lacking those feelings only slightly until this instant he turned and stalked out of the room furious and slammed the door with a resounding bang that rattled every doorknob in the hallway 000 do you need any help with that asked harry as hermione trotted down the stairs a few nights clothes and a bridesmaid gown stuffed into her school bag and slung hastily over her shoulder no i alright she said evenly the bag could fit quite a lot of things in it and rather easily she had put an internal expansion charm on it following the several occurrences of it bursting and its contents spilling out all over the corridor during third year she reached the bottom of the stairs and paused are we flooing in yeah said ron ready yes she said sorry it took so long i was reading and i got distracted typical hermione said harry grinning at her she gave him a weak smile in return they walked over towards the fireplace extending her hand slowly she picked up a quantity of floo powder from the jar by the mantle and slowly enclosed it in her fist because she was perfectly capable of picking it up herself just like she picked herself off the bed upstairs and forced herself to stop being silly and come downstairs and she did it all by herself and without encouragement because when you know the truth about almost everything it very easy to debate things without anyone else opinion restating what you ve already considered and she knew that it was sometimes lonely not to need anyone like that but it had worked fine before and it wasntas if she wasntclose her to friends she loved them fiercely it was merely the nagging idea of connecting to someone who though he seemed to understand what no one else she knew quite could still had so much growing up to do it was really the problem of comprehending everything about certain important matters except for your own feelings and then perfectly autonomously she threw the floo into the fireplace and called out the name of the place that had become like a second or even first home to her over the years and in a flare of green she was gone the burrow 000 an i know i promised that this chapter would contain many more things but i really busy with school stuff and i wanted to get something posted before you all think i ve dropped dead i intended for it to be much longer and take place at the burrow but er think of this as a two part chapter ok yeah all the stuff i promised will pop up next time the wedding ginny the weasleys fluer weird family lupin tonks and all that good stuff coming up next i promise yay ps sorry to leave you on that angsty note lol dear hermione ron and i will be coming over tomorrow are you sure you re all right yes i ve been having a good time at the burrow ginny avoided me for the first day but i think she got over it yesterday she gave me her favorite necklace she made me promise to come back safely she said that she would wait for me no matter what i told her not to but she just shook her head the necklace is a little golden heart she got from her great auntie muriel when she started hogwarts i ve been wearing it under my robes i dontwant to tell ron because he ll probably make fun of me it a pretty damn girly necklace there a picture of me and her in there it a fairly old picture i asked her how long it been in there but she blushed and wouldntanswer are you sure you re ok you sounded a little worried in your last letter and whatever it is i promise i wont overreact see you soon harry 000 draco sat huddled on the couch a blanket swathed defensively around his shoulders he occasionally threw aggravated looks over at the golden trio who were clustered on the opposite side of the room they were throwing disapproving glances at him in return with equal frequency they were probably whispering but draco couldnttell the moment the trio had sat down a mysterious buzzing in his ears had made him mostly deaf he strongly suspected that his deafness could be blamed entirely on potter he wiggled his finger in his ear and threw another angry look across the room potter sat quietly on the couch looking deeply pensive he was staring mostly at draco which did not raise draco comfort level next to him the weasel and granger seemed to be having some sort of quickly escalating argument those two were always arguing he couldntfor the life of him figure out why someone as smart as granger would waste her time arguing with weasley who had the approximate intelligence level of a flobberworm did he really just think that 000 i cantbelieve you took him in said ron grumpily his freckled face somewhat flustered i told you said hermione exasperated he was hurt i brought him inside what else was i supposed to do ron eyes bulged slightly indicating that he had a quite a few suggestions as to what should have been done to malfoy i dunno said ron in a mockingly thoughtful voice maybe leave him outside he would have died said hermione she could feel the color rising in her cheeks ron was her best friend but he was so infuriatingly ignorant sometimes particularly when it came to relationships she had been so jealous when he was with lavender she thought she would burst but when he held her at dumbledore funeral she thought it was everything she wanted but when she knew it was hers finally she wasnteven sure she wanted it anymore not the way she had something had grown within her gotten older more complicated they were such good friends she valued that more than anything and she loved him and harry both with all her heart should she jeopardize that was it even worth it so said ron as if this was an extremely favorable option he a death eater ron scowl deepened he tried to i know what he tried to do said hermione cutting him off touchily i just i mean i couldn t for someone so smart you re awfully stupid sometimes said ron harshly i cantbelieve hermione flushed furious well that just fine ron she shouted angrily let just let people we dontlike die if we do that i mean then what is it that separates us from the death eaters anyway ron quickly shut his mouth his face now as red as hers for a moment neither of them spoke harry turned his head from looking out the window and broke the silence hermione right ron he said quietly we cantjust abandon people who need help ron who now looked even more flummoxed still did not speak something flickered deep within his harry emerald green eyes he looked so thoughtful wise for a moment hermione was eerily reminded of dumbledore she looked into his eyes surprised she smiled inwardly harry had matured more than she thought i donttrust him said ron finally stubbornly crossing his arms and leaning back on his chair he probably trying to trick us i suppose that a possibility said harry casting a shrewd glance towards draco or a likelihood he frowned which does beg the question just what the hell do we do with him we could chuck him off a cliff said ron brightly harry turned to hermione smoothly ignoring ron you said he had information he does know something that why he ran and that why they attacked him so it ought to be something important hermione shook her head and sighed i cantget anything out of him though they modified his memory so we ought to torture him then asked ron eagerly pulling out his wand no torture ronald said hermione scoldingly we canttorture him we cantkill him said ron his voice somewhat playful geez hermione what can we do you can shut up suggested hermione sweetly ron was kidding of course you know probably there were other methods she had read about that might help revive his memory but she didntfeel comfortable trying them without her friends there it was a diary said malfoy suddenly his temporary deafness causing his voice to be much louder than necessary they turned to look at him i just remembered when i was asleep a diary said harry in bewilderment what asked malfoy loudly squinting at him rolling his eyes harry flicked his wand and released the spell on malfoy hearing they crossed the room and huddled around him again hermione frowned oh sure he remembers now that harry and ron are here to threaten him she thought that she had been quite intimidating thank you very much what diary demanded harry that the part i cantremember he admitted malfoy now looked distinctly uncomfortable which made hermione felt a little bit satisfied and only slightly guilty what do you remember said hermione impatiently you said you remembered more just now she added trying not to sound bitter whatever was in the diary that the part i lost but he furrowed his brow ron rolled his eyes theatrically how did you get the diary asked harry hermione could tell it was taking a great deal of his newfound self control not to reach out and slap malfoy right across his pale face a house elf said malfoy disdainfully nasty little ugly thing it was too my mother was always saying they should get to killing them when they get that old hardly useful anymore he trailed off when he saw the livid expression on hermione face killing them that little brat how would he like it if he was forced to do manual labor for his entire natural born life without 000 granger looked like she was ready to explode when he started talking about house elves what the hell was wrong with her anyway who cares about those little pests crazy long molared mudblood the trio looked about ready to chuck him out the door on his arse which was definitely not a good sign he had to throw something else out anything what else did he remember the elf told me its name he blurted out trying not to sound desperate they turned staring at him expectantly it was uh something stupid treeture teecher catcher beecher keycher that sounded about right i think it started with a k he said slowly er it sounded kind of like keycher potter and weasley looked puzzled as usual thought draco ruefully idiots he had no idea how they had survived this long probably because of granger he looked at her her lips were drawn tightly together and she was looking straight ahead she turned to him her face paler than usual kreacher she said her voice barely above a whisper was it kreacher yeah replied draco stroking his chin thoughtfully that sounds about right the trio shared a significant shocked look good things were definitely looking up that is until potter grabbed him roughly by the shirt collar whose diary was it he said sharply oy protested draco hands off you git draco had half expected him to yell but his voice was almost deadly calm this was not a very welcome change because the tone was making him feel slightly frightened though he would never admit that to the scarhead shut your gob malfoy snarled weasley let him go harry said granger harry pushed him roughly backwards scowling great the mudblood was saving him again not that he was in any danger potter was not scary no matter how chosen he was hmph i didntget a name said draco straightening his robes they were hopelessly wrinkled from four days of paraplegia on the couch just initials well that something at least said hermione sighing what were they draco paused for a moment their eyes bored into him hmm making them wait was sort of amusing i think wait oh right he smirked r a b draco had hoped to be rewarded for this information or at least thanked politely or even ignored he had not however expected to be slammed roughly against the couch again by an angry potter this time even granger did not protest if you re lying to me he said his voice dangerous i not snapped draco oh if he had his wand potter would be on the ground begging him for mercy potter dropped him and began pacing the room wildly the color had drained from his face 000 hermione meanwhile was silent her agile mind working furiously she had been trying to look up r a b for weeks with very little success it had to be someone important or powerful or at least clever to do what he had done he had defied voldemort which wasntsomething many people tended to attempt he had stolen a horcrux and theoretically destroyed it if the diary said r a b whatever was inside the diary was probably very dangerous to voldemort if draco had read it it stood to reason that voldemort would not be pleased so they tried to kill draco and he ran despite herself hermione was actually impressed she vividly recalled facing down a roomful of death eaters last year and it was not an experience she relished repeating and malfoy had escaped with his life unless it was a trap which was possible he could have been a plant for some reason she doubted it she wasntone to rely on instinct logic was far more dependable but for some inexplicable reason she felt that draco was telling the truth or at least she suspected there was more to the story that he wasnttelling them kreacher presence opened up a vast new realm of possibilities very interesting possibilities the diary had probably come from the black house kreacher had salvaged it for one reason or another he probably saw an opportunity when dumbledore died the diary had belonged to someone at grimmauld place she could have slapped herself r a b b for black so someone in the black household had actually tried to defy the dark lord as most of them so lovingly referred to him well sirius hadntfollowed voldemort he had fought him she supposed it wasntimpossible hermione said ron loudly he waved his hand in front of her face hello is anybody home she looked away from the patch of carpet she had been staring fixedly at several moments oh she murmured shaking her head you dontthink hermione locked eyes with harry who immediately stopped pacing and stared back at her with equal intensity r a b her eyes were as wide as harry s what said ron eager for an explanation she licked her lips nervously regalus alphard black 000 granger was holding his chin with her disgusting mudblood hands and staring through his eyes so intensely draco wondered if she was trying to see his brain she frowned her face thoughtful and pulled out her wand i have an idea she said i dontthink i going to like this idea said draco eyeing her wand apprehensively hermione smoothly ignored him talking instead to potter and weasley there a spell that will allow me to go into his memories and maybe break through the memory charm she explained does it involve torture asked weasley eagerly brandishing his wand draco leaned away from the deranged weasel and his wand no ron it does not involve torture she said irritated draco felt relieved granger wouldntreally let weasleby the poor torture him would she then again she didnthave much of a reason not to it not like a pensive said granger now launching into some long winded explanation of something complicated and boring stupid know it all the memories are more volatile in the mind less orderly and harder to deal with this is going to be difficult and the incantation is rather complex hermione said potter i can oh he was such a little hero wasnthe gryffindors draco rolled his eyes dontworry harry said granger smiling knowingly i can handle it i can handle it dearest harry dontworry your tiny disfigured head over me yay friendship oh they made him so nauseous granger wand was now pointed directly between his eyes librum memoria she cried 000 it felt like and looked like rushing down a very dark tunnel with long streaks and flashes of multicolored light flashing on the sides of the tunnel hermione looked to her left malfoy was rushing along beside her his face a mixture of anger and confusion what the hell is this he yelled though the tunnel was relatively silent i told you said hermione impatiently we re going into your memories oh muttered malfoy annoyed of course try to remember what you can about the diary she instructed him as if she were talking to a small child muttering mutinously malfoy closed his eyes and obeyed 000 draco snapped the journal shut and cast a terrified look at the door to the throne room his hands were shaking next to hermione malfoy squinted and surveyed himself critically this is he said slowly your memory she finished hermione stood next to malfoy and they both watched the memory play out it was sort of odd seeing two malfoys and certainly not something hermione would have wished for one was quite enough unpleasantness the door clicked open a figure walked out the scene suddenly flickered and began to fade into darkness obscured by fog what happened asked malfoy frowning you have to concentrate said hermione try to remember with a flick of his wand draco levitated the journal in front of him and made it disappear you vanished it said hermione watching his wand movements and imitating them carefully we should be able to call it back then at least it wasntdestroyed he walked into the throne room cackles of barely muted laughter echoed around the cavernous stone walls around him he faced the dark lord again his face pale face tinged with embarrassment but also hard with resolve the dark lord smirked at him draco after much deliberation i have decided his face contorted suddenly his red eyes hardened in suspicion what do you he stared hard into draco eyes occlumency asked hermione knowingly malfoy ignored her it really wasnta question anyway the dark lord did not speak for a moment but his expression was darkening he raised his wand change of plans master malfoy he hissed eyes wide draco pulled out his own wand a hush fell over the room for a moment and then suddenly there was chaos obliviate snarled the dark lord prote ahh draco attempted to defend himself but a curse from his left side send blood splattering from his arm he flew sideways from the force of the curse the memory charm hitting him at an odd angle the room erupted curses flying towards draco he flung himself out of the way and returned the favor ardently but far too many curses hit their mark accurately though she was impressed at his survival ability hermione cringed in horror as she watched malfoy blood spilling freely onto the floor no one deserved that no matter how much of a git they were he stood beside her not saying a word misfacio he screamed he screamed again as another curse raked across his chest the dark lord stood his face livid with rage and raised his wand hermione looked at malfoy he was shaking like a leaf the color completely drained from his face this was quite a feat considering he was usually about as tan as a snowdrift malfoy she whispered but he didntseem to hear her he stared straight ahead shaking his head watching the scene in horror draco she said a little louder she tentatively touched his hand we have what we need you can stop now draco his entire body was trembling no he choked no screamed narcissa tearing herself free of bellatrix grip cissy said bellatrix impatiently from the back of the room completely unperturbed by the chaos narcissa hurtled forward towards her son he head swiveling wildly around stop stop stop she screeched this is a jet of green light slammed into her chest she fell backwards frozen her blue eyes wide with fear no screamed both draco simultaneously draco raced forward to his mother side the room immediately hushed draco clutched his mother hand unable to tear himself away from her body though he was quickly being surrounded someone grabbed his bleeding arm and pulled him roughly to his feet he snapped suddenly back to reality and howled like a wounded animal he pushed the person holding him away with a swift kick to the stomach and wrenched his arm free he lifted his wand and apparated away with a resounding crack draco stop she said her voice shrill that enough hermione seized malfoy arm and raised her wand occludo mentis the hurtled backwards through the dark tunnel for only a moment and then they were back in the living room 000 well said ron impatiently did you find it hermione looked at malfoy he was sitting on the couch silent white faced and trembling y yes she said she looked back at ron her stomach writhing with guilt she swished her wand left right left up envanesco the diary appeared and dropped into harry lap he flipped it open and began thumbing through the pages hermione caught sight of the first page journal r a b hey said harry his brow furrowing what the hell it all he flipped the pages rapidly beneath his thumb blank he glared at malfoy who was still shaking harry didntseem to notice what gives malfoy he snarled if you re playing us i ll i not he said fiercely his voice tight he stood up and walked quickly into the kitchen his hands clenched so tightly that his knuckles were white hermione realized she had forgotten to bind his legs but she suddenly wasntvery concerned about that anymore do you think he going to take off asked ron suspiciously no said hermione softly well why not asked ron in disbelief because visions of a cavernous stone room full of darkness danced before her eyes she stared at the kitchen door pity welling deep within her he has no where else to go 000 an ok i ll get to the flamel thing eventually i sorry i get overzealous sometimes also it is my goal to have draco come around slowly he pompous and racist and ignorant it gonna take some time but when it does it gonna be awesome professional widow hehe yes thank you for your observations about the leg locker curse the first time hermione came down the stairs she had him in a full body bind and then the rest of the time she just paralyzed his legs so he could talk and watch tv etc you are really observant i flattered thanks for reviewing just out of curiosity i was considering having another character make a brief but awesome cameo that fits into the plotline who would you like to see lupin lupin and tonks professor mcgonagall fred and george ps there will be no tonks without lupin lupin is awesome so there pps review or i ll explode draco malfoy was standing in the kitchen of malfoy manor watching intently as his grandmother prepared cookies being that he was only six he was still rather short and could barely see her from underneath the expansive edge of the marble countertop dobby prepared most of the food for the malfoy family but when his grandmother came to visit she would create elaborate cakes and cookies with her wand she seemed to enjoy it though draco did not understand why he didntcare either he liked those cookies they were much better than his mother cookies draco asked his grandmother in her rasping wheezy voice a few strands of frazzled white hair had fallen out of her bun and they billowed as she spoke what are you doing inside why arentyou outside on your broomstick i lost my quaffle said draco shrugging and eyeing the cookies hungrily father will get me a new one tomorrow and now you came in just in time to get fresh cookies asked his grandmother smiling knowingly what a fine coincidence yes said draco still rather focused on the cookies can i have one he held out his hand expectantly his grandmother lifted up a plate of cookies and placed them on the table draco clambered up into one of the chairs and began munching on them you know what your grandfather used to say to me said his grandmother wistfully there is no coincidence mariette there is only magic it protects us and guides us that is where our power comes from why we are so much greater than all other creatures who walk the earth she loving stroked draco silvery blond head you see draco she said pointing to the breast of his shirt over his heart magic is in your blood inside of you draco mostly ignored her still happily eating the cookies he was fairly sure that magic came from wands but he didntthink it would be wise to correct the old woman especially since it was far simpler to keep his mouth shut and full of chocolate cookies his grandmother smiled magic has a way of guiding you even when you yourself do not know the way there are no coincidences draco everything happens for a reason 000 they were walking down the busy streets of muggle london pushing their way through throngs of people hermione ron and harry were wearing muggle clothes so they blended in quite well malfoy on the other hand was dressed in his usual attire which was drawing him quite a few odd looks from passersby he was wearing a sweeping black cloak dragon hide boots and a silver studded belt his cloak was trimmed in silver and there was an ornate carved silver pin clasping his cloak together at the throat he would have looked quite stylish on the streets of diagon alley but the leaky cauldron was several blocks away and his attire gave off the airs of someone who was going off to the coast to battle invading hordes of normans in the middle ages also his outfit had been completely trashed by his attack and subsequent escape from the death eaters last week it was not wise for someone who was trying to hide from a large group of killers to stand out in a crowd as they walked hermione noticed malfoy seemed to be becoming keenly aware of the deficiencies of his attire as well in addition to the oddities of his appearance there was a long slitted tear running up his sleeve he was nervously trying to hide something on his forearm but his sleeve kept flapping open clothes said hermione suddenly what asked ron in confusion we ought to buy clothes she said quickly muggle clothes so we blend in but we do blend argued ron but hermione grabbed him and dragged him and malfoy into the nearest muggle clothing shop harry needs a better belt she said matter of factly she pointed to harry belt which formerly belonged to dudley the boy blimp and only fit his waist because he had punched about six extra holes in it with a screwdriver if he going to rush around with that thing on it godric gryffindor blade under a disillusioment charm of course was strapped to harry waist as if he were a mythical hero she shooed harry and ron off to the front corner of the store leaving her alone with malfoy clothes he said he folded his arms and stared at her a smirk playing faintly upon his lips yes clothes said hermione her tone businesslike you she pushed malfoy towards the back of the shop look like you were chewed up partially digested and spat back out by a hungarian horntail people on the street are staring at you and that not the best thing in the world when you re on the run and trying to keep a low profile malfoy opened his mouth to respond to this probably with copious amount of sarcasm but a young saleswoman strode quickly up to them her hands clasped together expectantly can i help you she asked yes said hermione her eyes glinting she gestured towards malfoy he needs an outfit 000 draco sat behind the curtain in the changing room livid with rage this was completely ridiculous the stupid muggle store worker woman had thrown a pile of clothes at him and manhandled him into this wretched little room expecting him to strip down and actually wear these muggle rags granger had threatened him with more bodily harm if he didnt try them on with all manner of haste imagine clothes that were made without individually measuring their future wearer how the hell would they know if it fit or not stupid muggles i not coming out fumed draco refusing to look in the mirror oh please i sure it not that bad granger huffed impatiently tapping her foot come on malfoy we really donthave all day i not trying on anything else this is idiotic he said angrily from inside the booth fine said granger irritatedly then you re going to have to wear whatever the bloody hell you have on just come out here and we ll leave grumbling he threw the curtain aside and stomped out hating granger even more if that was possible 000 hermione had to clamp her jaw shut to keep from gawking draco malfoy was wearing leather pants the salesgirl obviously had a rather insane sense of style but an excellent one in retrospect she probably should have been suspicious when she looked at what the salesgirl was wearing torn jeans far too much black eyeliner and neon green hair that would have made tonks proud hermione had given her only two specifications black and long sleeved malfoy stormed passed her only pausing to glare spitefully like a toddler who has been forced into eating steamed vegetables he was wearing a long sleeved black collared shirt and a pair of black leather pants hermione gaped despite herself had he always looked like that though not quite as tall as harry or ron he had grown up considerably over the summer he was not so much thin and short but tall and lean and muscular apparently all those years of quidditch had paid off and he was wearing leather pants harry and ron had found a suitable belt they were standing at the counter when malfoy stormed past harry and ron gaped as well though for a very different reason malfoy continued walking without stopping until he had left the store ron and harry immediately began snickering hermione sighed and paid for his clothes while he stood outside and sulked then she began giggling as well 000 how much for this one asked harry pointing to a bottle of jet black dust they were standing in the weasley wizarding wheezes searching for supplies for their impending journey they had decided it was best to stay on the move given the circumstances i told you harry said fred sighing in exasperation everything in the store is absolutely free for you finished george nodding in agreement harry looked embarrassed but placed the vial of peruvian instant darkness powder into his pocket hermione watched as malfoy sulked around the store eyes roving over the colorful shelves it was partially because of him that they were here his idea to use the weasley products offensively was actually rather ingenious however when the news that death eaters had used their merchandise in a mission to assassinate their favorite professor had reached fred and george they had been offended on an extremely personal level they glared hatefully at malfoy as he passed near them in fact said fred we would be deeply offended if all of you didnttake whatever you needed to do whatever you need to do said george malfoy approached a shelf and reached towards a package of soothsayer mints but fred and george immediately surrounded him and fred slapped his hand away with a rolled up stack of parchment before he could touch anything not for death eaters said fred in a voice one would use to scold a misbehaving puppy quite true agreed george in fact if not for hermione insistence that it would be quite dangerous for you to wait outside which doesntsound like a bad thing to me interjected fred you would not be allowed on our premises at all finished george so you re not allowed to buy anything or touch anything actually dont look at anything either it quite offensive they finished and their identical faces split into merry grins cheers enjoy your shopping muttering angrily and scowling which he seem to be becoming quite talented at lately malfoy shoved his hands into his pockets and skulked off to the back of the store hermione felt a pang of inexplicable guilt they were being awfully hard on him he wasntreally evil she reflected uncomfortably just complicated he lived in a world with a fair few more nuances and complexities than someone like ron could ever possibly hope to come to terms with ok maybe he was a tad bit evil fred and george whirled around and continued chattering as if nothing had happened here try this said george offering something that looked like a glowing blue cube to harry just developed it you know what is it asked ron peering over harry shoulder as the dark haired boy placed the box into his hand and examined it well it actually rather nifty said fred you see something began shrieking and flashing in from inside the pocket of george robes the twins sighed audibly i do believe we forgot to say no stealing said fred frowning that was an oversight said george he pulled the sneakoscope out of his pocket and pressed the top immediately stopping the noise the both craned their necks around one of the long aisles and looked at the end where malfoy was still examining things in a would be casual stance he was in front of a large stack of neon pink boxes he picked one up and peered inside that not a good idea said fred making a tutting noise with his tongue very true agreed george emphatically honestly if someone were just to say the proper incantation while he was holding that thing which is somnium by the way said fred loudly grinning wickedly the results could be quite entertaining 000 draco peered into the little pink box there was a small quantity of glowing electric pink mist floating inside resting on the bottom and swirling like thick london fog as he shook the box he stared at it curiously mostly because he was extremely bored and had nothing better to do he thought he heard someone shout something from the front of the store but he couldntquite make out what they said the pink mist suddenly shot out of the box and invaded his mouth and nostrils shooting straight through into his head it smelled sort of like a flowers only over concentrated to the point of inducing nausea sort of the way pansy wore her perfume he gasped as the shop suddenly faded away and was replaced by a very strange scene the smell of salt and breezy sea air assaulted his senses he was standing on the bowsprit of a ship which was tossing violently in choppy waves ocean spray splattered against his face wind whipped through his blond hair and his silky black dress whipped behind him as the ship rose and fell his dress he looked down at his clothes in horror what the hell was he doing in a dress the leather pants were bad enough considering he was fairly sure they had been made out of muggle cow beast or something of the like he didnthave time to ponder this for long however because he was roughly grabbed and spun around his shoulders pinned down to the wooden railing a large muscular man with a flowing mane of wavy brown hair had him pinned down their bodies pressed together in a very suggestive way his brown eyes were large and soulful and his lacy white shirt was open halfway down his torso revealing a tan broad shouldered muscular body ahh yelled draco furiously get the hell off of me the man ignored his protests oh my sweet dracohhw said the man pronouncing draco name wrong in a deep raspy voice he had a thick over exaggerated foreign accent do not spurn my love the fire between us burns with such passion such heat love me my sweet love me and i ll take you away from all of your worries he bowed his thick neck down as if to kiss draco neck augh screamed draco get off me you git are you insane he flailed wildly but he found his only weapon was the lacey white fan clutched within his gloved hand he promptly smacked the man across the face with it and wriggled free of his grasp the man clutched his stinging cheek smiling his eyes alight i love your fire he growled passionately kiss me i must have you now he lunged towards draco who immediately fled screaming bloody murder as he was chased across the deck of the ship 000 hermione sighed they were crowded over malfoy who was lying on the floor of the weasley shop serves him right said fred cheerily our testers had said these little things are quite fun if used properly that is said george shaking his head arentthey for girls asked ron looking at malfoy and snickering yes said fred yes they most definitely are unless you re into that sort of thing added george which we have nothing against clarified fred he certainly doesntlook like he having a very good time of it observed harry tilting his head and staring at malfoy he really didntseem to be happy noticed hermione he was on the floor rolling around and flailing his arms wildly and screaming as if he were being assaulted by a pack of rabid wolves they all stood idly by and observed this phenomenon in amusement for awhile until hermione interrupted really she said in exasperation stamping her foot isntthis a little bit mean ron blinked at her define mean he said slowly smiling innocently hermione frowned and pointed her wand at malfoy finite incantatem he immediately stopped yelling and sat bolt upright panting and looking deeply traumatized aww said the rest of the group in disappointment they proceeded to wander away malfoy let out a stream of expletives and hermione took that as her cue to walk away 000 their next stop was gringotts money was definitely an object hermione was carrying some muggle money in her pocket but as she gently reminded her companions while they ate lunch in the leaky cauldron they would probably not be getting free room board and food for the rest of their journey key hissed a wizened looking goblin from his perch high on the countertop harry fumbled through his pockets and finally extracted the key to his vault the goblin took it and examined it carefully through narrowed eyes very well he said handing the key back to harry with his long spindly fingers he turned his intense gaze towards malfoy ah he breathed young master malfoy what business draws you here on this day i wish to make a withdrawal grypkik said malfoy his tone casual yet businesslike hermione raised an eyebrow did goblin sentiments lie with pureblooded families after all it was convenient they held most of the wealth in the community and would therefore be the banks most valuable assets and he knew malfoy by appearance honestly they were escorted towards the back of the bank and loaded into carts as his unofficial make sure he doesn t run away babysitter hermione went with malfoy in one cart which happened to be quite a bit larger and lined with velvet whatever the hell that was about and harry and ron went in another malfoy face remained expressionless as they flew wildly around bends along the darkened track hermione gripped the sides of the cart feeling vaguely ill she had never ridden down into the bowels of the bank before her parents had always exchanged their muggle money directly upstairs at the counter she felt like she was on a roller coaster finally the cart screeched to a halt outside a pair of large ornately carved doors malfoy looked at her strangely glancing appraisingly at her green tinged face he grabbed her hand and helped her as she climbed shakily out of the cart are you all right he asked her cocking his head slightly i fine she said breathlessly once her feet were thankfully back on solid ground malfoy was still holding her hand they were both silent for a moment then suddenly they both retracted their hands rather quickly hermione blushed looking away at the vault doors what the hell was that about were all vaults this big she had nothing to compare it too of course the goblin who had been driving their cart hopped down and strode over to the doors with the brush of a silver key and the stroke of a long delicate finger the doors slowly creaked open malfoy quickly strode in apparently quite unimpressed by this phenomenon hermione followed behind him her breath catching in her throat when the contents of the room met her eyes bloody hell no wonder malfoy strutted around like he owned the school he probably could own the school if he wanted to he could buy it along with several small islands or perhaps he could buy a moderately sized foreign country the capital of which he could rename draconia if he wanted to the vault was at least two stories high with large vaulted ceilings and two rectangular rooms full of centuries worth of gold silver precious gems and strange treasures that nevertheless looked extremely valuable malfoy looked at the glittering stacks impassively he snatched a small drawstring bag from their goblin tour guide and disappeared into the second room something in the corner of the room caught hermione eye it was what else several large bookcases brimming with neatly stacked leather bound volumes of text she immediately flocked over to it skimming the spines with her fingertips dates and names were printed in tiny silver letters on the deep red covers spanning all the way back to 1069 when augustin baleine malfoy came to england from northern france she finally came to the very bottom of the shelf her fingers brushing against two volumes at the very end of the shelf lucius edric malfoy son of abraxas malfoy and cassiopeia derron and directly next to it draco lucius malfoy son of lucius malfoy and narcissa black she lifted it quietly from the shelf and opened it it was a short list of his grades throughout school which she already knew werentthat astonishing and his accomplishments school prefect quidditch seeker slytherin house the last page contained a very neat replica of his o w l results copied faithfully in flawless penmanship she should probably not be snooping through his things but she was too far in now and much too curious to quit she scanned down the page gawking at it o o o e e o e o o e o e how the hell did he manage that he had gotten as many owl as she had not nearly as many o s but still he had an outstanding in defense against the dark arts that was not fair at all she had never ever seen him study for anything and she ought to know considering she spent over half of her waking hours in the library how had he managed i test well drawled a voice from behind her causing her to whirl around in alarm malfoy stared at her evenly a sneer adorning his pale face he swiped the book out of her hands and tossed it violently back onto the shelf and i ll thank you to keep your hands off my things granger he said as he strode out of the vault face flushed hermione followed behind him 000 they were leaving diagon alley walking in a tight group as usual dumbledore death seemed to have increased people unease about going outside exponentially diagon alley and many of its shops were practically deserted suddenly harry stiffened he cursed under his breath but continued walking as if nothing was wrong what is it asked ron nervously we re being followed said harry in a low voice barely moving his lips hermione stomach twisted uncomfortably from within her pocket her hand tightened on her wand where she whispered fearfully not turning her head across the street said malfoy suddenly joining into the conversation his gaze flitted behind them for a split second both carrows yaxley sernab he frowned dontknow the other two harry looked at him in surprise though he barely turned his head duck into that alleyway he said sharply now they all hurried to their left as smoothly as possible crouched low to the ground nearest to the street harry peered carefully around the edge of the building he snapped his head back i dontthink we lost them said harry his face somewhat paler than usual well that hard to believe said malfoy sarcastically apparently unable to resist insulting harry regardless of the circumstances your plan to throw ourselves into a dirty alleyway was genius absolutely inspired harry glared at him as if considering whether or not to tell him off here he said thrusting malfoy wand into his hands they re probably here to kill you as well as us malfoy looked surprised for a moment then nodded we dontwant to be cornered in here said harry wisely on the count of three we go out together ready they all nodded in agreement one as hermione reflected on it she knew that being in an alleyway with death eaters advancing on you was not an ideal location somehow however it felt right two she felt a sense of rightness of absoluteness shoulder to shoulder with her two best friends no matter what the situation this was exactly where she belonged together until whatever end and she wouldnthave it any other way three they flung themselves out of the alley wands drawn to find themselves completely surrounded 000 potter and weasley had gotten pushed away from draco they were standing in front of sally second hand robe shop fighting four against two they were rather preoccupied in the conflict but seemed to have the upper hand draco didnthave much time to ponder this however because he was quite busy fighting his own battle terrance sernab who was hulking blond and somewhat obsessed with the cruciatus curse was towering over him a crazed grin on his face young malfoy he snarled rumors say you ve turned traitor malfoy sidestepped as a jet of red light soared past him ah well at least he had his wand back well they must be more than rumors sernab he said softly or you wouldntbe here trying to kill me cru predictable as usual idiot expelilaimus yelled draco cutting him off sernab wand flew in a smooth arc and landed in draco hand he pointed his wand at him suffoco sernab sunk to the ground gasping and choking until he lay sprawled on the ground unconscious but not dead draco whirled around his thoughts suddenly flying to 000 hermione was across the street from malfoy and even farther away from harry and ron struggling desperately against a huge dark haired wizard she was standing in front of ollivander wand shop long since abandoned the front of the shop was crumbling slowly from the sheer force of spells ricocheting off of it she tried everything she could think off but there was just no logic to well violence he was backing her into the wall he fired another curse at her she jumped sideways but lodged her foot in a freshly opened crack in the ground she struggled but was unable to free herself petrificus totalus she cried but the death eater dove out of the way and skittered around behind her she twisted around desperately her foot still trapped stupe she began expelliarmus countered the death eater a large angry cut appeared on her hand and her wand flew from her hand he leered at her as he advanced from behind she flailed wildly as he grabbed her bleeding hand by the wrist but froze as she felt the tip of his wand pressing against her head i could draw this out he hissed but i have other matters to attend to and very little time to spare for such entertainment so this was it she was stuck wandless and everyone else seemed otherwise occupied she looked above her carefully observing the angle at which the wall was leaning if someone hit it in just the right spot the whole thing would probably come tumbling down the death eater began to utter a curse avad fine if that the way it was going to be she would be damned if she didnttake this moron with her she thrashed suddenly knocking them both backwards she was still stuck and landed as such the death eater behind her slammed full force into the wall which let out a groan of protest before the entire stone front of the shop fell forward with an almighty lurch hermione shut her eyes tightly instead of feeling several tons of stone masonry shower all over her she suddenly felt something blasting her ankle free a voice screamed something and she lurched forward through the air landing heavily in someone outstretched arms her eyes still shut tightly she opened her eyes expecting to see harry or even ron but instead malfoy she gasped in disbelief his pale face was contorted with rage i suppose you think that was brave dontyou he said furiously malfoy she began but he continued ranting you gryffindors are all alike what the hell do you think you re doing malfoy she interrupted again for someone so smart you are an idiot you could have been killed why are you all so obsessed with heroics i swear draco she said loudly he stopped staring at her she was still in his arms her hands around his neck you you just you saved my life she said her voice a mixture of shock and confusion he gaped at her apparently the very same thing had just dawned on him he nearly dropped her setting her roughly to her feet on the ground yeah i i he stammered stiffening she was standing on her own gazing at him er now we re square i guess he said nervously staring pointedly at the ground several loud cracks sounded as the remaining conscious death eaters disapperated harry and ron were running towards them they were still staring at each other an uncomfortable silence building between them you got blood on my shirt he said suddenly examining his collar and scowling in irritation i did not she protested also staring at his collar and frowning you got blood on you shirt she pointed to a cut on his cheek which was dripping a small amount of blood down onto his neck then she looked at the cut on her own hand ok she agreed i may have gotten a tiny amount of blood on your shirt but who cares anyway it a black shirt just clean it she turned and raced off towards harry and ron still not sure she was going to be able to process what just happened 000 draco stared in surprise at the front of his shirt hermio er the mudblood had dripped her filthy blood the most impure part of her all over his collar he could still see a stream of it running down his neck she had been right though there was a cut on his face that was trickling down into his collar as well he stared at both streams his centuries old pureblood and her impure filthy muggle blood he marveled silently because quite honestly he couldntfor the life of him tell the difference between the two 000 an wheeeeee i sorry this chapter was sort of fluffy i notice a lot of reviewers are getting anxious for the romance to bloom i sorry i trying to be realistic here they re enemies things have to brew slowly there were a few things in this chapter right they re not just going to fall into each other arms and start kissing until next chapter that is whoops was that a spoiler dreadfully sorry hehehe my sister told me that the fantasy box was very very sick but also very funny i hope you guys agree lol it canon those things were totally in book 6 with the horny pirate and everything a note about draco owl s i always thought he was smart but never applied himself or whatever i know people mostly guys who never study or do homework but miraculously do amazing on standardized testing and it annoying but it happens so that how i see draco brain so there
