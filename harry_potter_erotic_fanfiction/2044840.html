arabella malfoy speaking thinking chapter one announcements and thoughts welcome back to another year at hogwarts greeted dumbledore with the special twinkle in his eyes i hope you all had an extraordinary summer vacation people in the great hall were buzzing and whispering about their journeys and new friends they met during summer about which you can talk later because i need to make several very important announcements at this all heads turned to the headmaster it was not a secret that the war with voldemort had begun and its outcome would influence the existence of the wizarding world as a whole parents of many present students were aurors and they saw the horrors of war with their very eyes everyone understood that this was not the war only between death eaters and the ministry of magic but between good and evil that why every drop of help counts firstly i would like to introduce our new defence against the dark arts teacher professor macbeth halflife the door behind the staff table opened and into the hall entered a tall well built woman she had shoulder length raven black hair and deep blue eyes with which she scanned the faces of the students as if wanting to penetrate into the deepest places of their souls her lips were thin and colourless and the only remarkable thing on her pale face were her eyes which attracted you with their mystery but beware you could easily drown in them she wore a plain black robe but it fitted her perfectly showing only as much as she wanted leaving some space for the fantasy after looking at the students she returned to the staff table eyeing every professor because she arrived only a few minutes ago and had not had the opportunity to see them the conclusion of her observation was the following everyone was rather pleasant and she would probably get along well with everybody except the man with greasy hair he was definitely a hard nut but certainly familiar unfortunately she did not remember where she saw him then she thought that it was not time for reminiscences right now and quietly sat near dumbledore i also want to speak about some precautions which were taken because of the current situation in the wizarding world continued dumbledore but this time no moans of dissatisfaction were heard forbidden forest is off limits like always and no walking on the grounds alone is allowed you must each have a companion with you all the time hogsmeade weekends will be once a month but quiddich training graphic will remain now for some good news nowadays you need powerful spells to protect yourselves form any kind of danger you will learn them on the classes of professor halflife but i thought that it will be interesting to have a magic talent show where you can amaze and entertain us with advanced magic and i mean very advanced the contest will be held somewhere in may so you have plenty of time to prepare now let busy some other senses apart from our ears let the feast begin the food appeared on the tables and everybody began to fill up their plates discussing the information they had heard everyone had his own opinion but we are interested only in the thoughts of our main characters the dream team were sitting in the middle of the gryffindor table my god last year and i will be free do whatever i want thought ron weasley famous for his laziness towards everything not connected with quiddich i am sure with him who must not be named on the loose we will sure have a great adventure this year the last and the most important year i am so happy i have made it i am a head girl i am sure you already know whose thoughts are these hermione granger of course i must pass the n e perfectly if i want to have a career i am going to tell ron and harry to begin preparing right away or they will fail without even starting they must be already thinking about new pranks they will play this year what a shame when will they understand that they arentchildren anymore now the war is coming and i am absolutely sure that you know who is planning an attack on hogwarts we must work hard to preserve the unity of the school then we will have a chance to face him who must not be named and win now we should travel to the most troubled mind the mind of the boy who lived just a boy who carried on his shoulders the heaviness of fighting with the evil each year of his schooling what will he face this year let find the answer in the trace of his thoughts i am glad that i am here again hogwarts is like a second home to me or more likely the only home i have here are ron and hermione who will always support me in my job to save the world again merlin i am so tired already from this danger on my hills but i am not alone they are the most important thing in my life hermione will give me wise pieces of advice and ron will retell a joke to take dark thoughts out of my mind and show the bright side of the ordeal this year voldemort has gained strength and more followers it cannot last any longer the more it lasts the more victims will suffer and i dontwant any of it this year i face him and challenge him to a duel but i need to prepare maybe even ask for some help from dumbledore i am sure he knows that this is my destiny and i cannot avoid it let just hope that in the right time and place i will be ready to deliver our world form this mad lord not very optimistic hah but who can be optimistic in a time like this when every day you scan the newspaper to see if your family or friends were hurt or even killed in another attack with the dark mark high above them but there were such people who understood the circumstances in which the war put them but still tried not to fall into despair and misery they thought that laughter and smiles could help to solve many serious problems in no time common tell me about your summer and i want details not something like i was there and then i was there with this phrase the conversation between ginny weasley and her friend della chatter began ok ok della put up her hands in surrender i was with my parents on the hawaii islands oh that something really interesting and it was i met a boy there and he was he was great just great when i say details i mean details ah he was so handsome and romantic a real gentlemen we spent all our time on the beach splashing around and as you can understand kissing it was wonderful like i was in the utter universe where there was only he and i did you love him ginny was really interested this time why in the past tense i still love him he lives in italy we promised each other to owl every week and maybe even more often i am really happy for you of course ginny was happy for her friend but also she was a little jealous like an every normal almost seventeen year old teenager she wanted to be loved and cared for to walk in the moonlight listen to the poetry about her unique beauty and just find pleasure in simple holding of hands or in other words she wanted to have a boyfriend a real one she had all rights to have a boyfriend because she was really pretty her waist length red hair was wavy and curled on the ends red hair the trademark of the weasleys but hers was special not like any of her brother s maybe it was the colour which was not plain red but had some golden sparks in it she still had her freckles but they faded a little so they were only on her nose and a little bit on her cheeks but still they complemented her and were part of her ginny didntpay a lot of attention to her appearance and didntuse makeup that why her beauty was pure and natural ginny had a lot of chances to have a decent boyfriend and she dated three or four boys but she needed a real feeling something completely different from just walking near the lake and snogging but who doesn t a quiet drone rose from the gryffindor table people talked about their summer and everything children like to chat about but no such luck on the slytherin table it was already common opinion that slytherins were the concentration of dark powers death eaters in training and any evil stuff imaginable prince of the slytherin that what draco malfoy was called the most mean and arrogant of all slytherins his housemates admired him for his power and money these two things were the key to the life of the great the dream of most seventh years was to be chosen in the ranks of voldemort to serve him and receive their precious power to rule the world no one could say if this dream haunted malfoy mind because he was secretive and distinct from everybody everybody thought that he would be a heartbreaker but no one was sure about that either because he had about eight dates a month and each one was with a different girl as if he didntwant anybody very close to him to know him to learn his secrets but he still managed to find a new candidate for the next date because half of the girl population of hogwarts were drooling over him and nobody can blame them he was really handsome his long silver blond hair hung in locks on his forehead hiding his grey eyes which were like steel shields to all his emotions and thoughts every bit of him his face features gait clothes cried aristocrat young students knew that it better not to mess up with him now he had his trademark smirk while watching the hall what did dumbldork came up this year a magic talent show that ridiculous i will be surprised if someone manages to make the dark mark hang above the professors this will be very advanced this fool doesntunderstand that voldemort will strike sooner or later and no stone will be left from this school but he did make those precautions it means he suspects something maybe there is something up i need to know about it in more details or father wontbe satisfied no more students so far we can break some rules and go into the heads of some professors in my fic everything is possible all professors had troubled expressions yesterday they talked about plans of increasing the amount of guarding spells on the castle and within it it was a long night but still there were questions which needed answers but nobody had them the order worked more then hard to gather information about planned attacks but all was in vain a few times snape was at the edge of an explosion but somehow and only he knows how he came out alive and with useful information and as i mentioned snape i think it will be interesting to pry into his mind what was he thinking the war is going on and he asks this girl to teach defence against the dark arts this subject is the most important one and he thinks that she can teach these stupid children to attack and defend themselves from all that awaits them behind this doors she looks so weak and helpless but i can feel power in her and there is also intelligence in her eyes but she has her secrets that i am sure about surprisingly she seems to be familiar but where could i have seen such a woman i ve already forgotten when i ve seen a woman except professors here it was alo o o ng time ago in the middle of the table sat as always the headmaster albus dumbledore he was not only the greatest wizard of the times or the only man voldemort fears but also the symbol of good strong spirit and wisdom yes he was all these but he was also human with his own fears and doubts another year another battle but this one will be final i need to unite the students against dark forces not only voldemort but also anger hate misjudgement and indifference i hope that harry will find strength to fulfil his destiny but still he needs some help i will discuss with him some advanced defence training this will be very useful the house rivalry is on its pick who could have thought that peaceful houses like hufflepuff and ravenclaw could hate slytherins so much i donteven say about gryffindor this has gone too far certainly everybody must choose sides but we need to defend our school not to break it from inside with this last thought dumbledore sighed and poked a potato on his plate with a fork his eyes had lost their twinkle and it seemed to have happened more and more often recently chapter two new lessons the first few days of the new school year brought only loads of homework after such misfortune common rooms were full of scraping and rustling noises tables were covered with walls of books and parchments were all over the carpet but some talking was also heard in the corner of the gryffindor common room right beside the fireplace the dream team were discussing their first dada lesson with the new professor i think she is cool ron said with characteristic enthusiasm professors cannot be cool they can be wise strict just merciful but cool it pathetic corrected hermione but she is she cast such curses on that guy as she didntwant to defeat him but to insult or humiliate do you remember that spell that made his tongue stick to his forehead or that curse that put worms in his hair this was sooo cool i ll certainly learn it it wasnta guy it is our training dummy which we will use to practice our spells on oh yeh i ll blow him up oh yes you certainly will but not before it blows you up me but it is a dummy it cannot do anything by itself yes but if it has some help then everything can happen hermione now you sound pathetic i ll see who is pathetic when you blow up to the ceiling and back ok but you will be first guys guys what are you talking about i dontwant anybody to be blown up harry cut into the conversation i think this time dumbledore found a real dada teacher she will really prepare us for the battle with voldemort ron and hermione again shivered at the sound of the name only one look at her and you know that you have a worthy opponent flashback the class was a buzz seventh year gryffindors and slytherins were waiting for their dada lesson to begin and such mixture means no good the insults were thrown back and forth wands must have been raised to throw hexes and curses but all shut their months at the cry silence back to your seats these were the first words which they heard from their new dada teacher professor halflife she entered through large oak doors which opened on their own accord she wore plain black robes which were from a soft but strong material that made the robe to be perfectly suited for any training she went to her table and begun her welcoming speech hello to everybody i am professor halflife and i will be teaching you defence against the dark arts during the larger part of the lessons i will teach you to duel because this is what you will need soon under the circumstances she ran hers eyes over the students before her with her special penetrating look then did a movement with her wand dumtraino after that a dummy appeared before her this is a dummy you will be training your spells on from now on you can make such a dummy appear everywhere you want preferably in your common rooms now i would like to show you some hexes i simply like to try on my opponents this was certainly an uncommon thing to say for a teacher and there was an appropriate reaction from students but nobody commented then the show began she cried some hexes towards the dummy and strange things began happening firstly its knees started to tremble like it was afraid then fingers of both hands intertwined with each other after that like ron mentioned worms started to crawl out of its hair and its tongue stuck to its forehead and its apple eyes became much larger than they should be the sight was really horrible or better say disgusting but this didntaffect the professor in the slightest in her eyes little flames were dancing as if she was the devil himself then after a second all became normal the dummy disappeared and professor halflife became composed and serene students were in shock if not to say dumbstruck but couldntavert their eyes form the professor i would like to check your duelling abilities to see what spells and curses you will need to learn are any volunteers students looked at her as if she was crazy who would in his right mind duel with her after she showed what she liked to do with her opponents i would like to a calm voice said from the back seats ok come here she was a little surprised because she didntthink that anybody would dare to duel her after her little show she did it on purpose like a part of a teaching strategy from the back of the classroom with the sides of his robe floating behind him the infamous draco malfoy began confidently walking towards her always making a grant entrance grunted ron under his breath well take your duel position and we can begin said professor halflife still surprised but she became even more surprised when he did what she sad at first there was nothing uncommon in his duelling position but if you look more precisely as everybody did at that moment because they were more than eager to see how malfoy ass would be kicked i mean gryffindors of course you could see that the fingers of his left hand were a little above his head if to be more exact his index and middle fingers were looking straight at the teacher as a second pair of eyes after a little hesitation halflife took the same position and another show of this lesson began just before the beginning malfoy asked only one more thing may i attack you if you manage challenge was seen in both their eyes as they began to walk in circles in front of the students eyeing one another but the purposes of their looks were different halflife looked at the boy in front of her and thought what he could do if he challenged her to a duel and even asked about attacking her but she couldntfind any answer malfoy only thought about hexes he can use and not get punished but after a few seconds of such walking the professor made her first move she cast a binding hex but malfoy said the counter spell even without looking away from the professor eyes another tough nut hah let see what you can do thought the dada teacher but still wasntthat sure about the outcome of the duel after the first hex she didntwait any longer and began a serious attack five or more curses flew towards malfoy but he reversed them all this is beginning to turn pathetic indignation was even in her thoughts and she was really angry now she then sent some very painful and powerful curses but malfoy only reaction was to reverse some of them and ditching others with malfoy known grace this was the last straw for the professor how could he do something like this to her this is unbearable she sent red sparks towards malfoy and he slightly moved his left hand but then put a shield charm around him understanding that his opponent was angry and could do much worse the only way for him to come out of this alive and with points was to exterminate the professor and he did this crying paralisis which made an effect of paralysis on her wand hand he had the opportunity to cast the spell while she was thinking of another drastic curse for him after such a spell she was wholly paralyzed but the spell was cast perfectly and the other part of her body was paralyzed from utter shock as were the others in the room nobody said a word for a few minutes then the bell rang and malfoy wordlessly went out of the classroom end flashback back in the gryffindor common room discussion about the dada lesson continued i still cantunderstand what was the duelling position that malfoy used said harry deep in thought yes rather interesting indeed i need to research about it in the library again ron was full of dissatisfaction how can you spend so much time in the library you donteven see sun only yellow pages there you know there are some black things on them too they are called letters l e t t e r s but i am sure you dontknow what these are since you cannot read me cantread oh you you bookworm me a bookworm go and watch your sun its sunset right now and dontbe late or your girlfriend will bite your head off she said mockingly because everybody knew that ron didnthave any girlfriend but at her words he looked on his watch and then at hermione oh thanks for reminding she will really bite my head off like she did the last time when i was late with that he stormed out of the common room i didntwash my ears today or did ron just say that he had a girlfriend asked harry in absolute bewilderment i hope you washed them alright just when they sat with their mouths open ginny took ron place in the armchair hi guys what up oh nothing just talking about school you know answered hermione because harry still couldntsay a word but when he composed himself he asked you received a letter today didntyou ah i forgot about it completely after that she ran to her room to read the letter it was a white envelope with no special marks on it just her name to miss weasley she was intrigued and opened the letter when she read it she didntknow what to do or to say about it ms weasley you are welcome to attend advanced potions class if you are interested then go to the potions classroom today at seven o clock sharp donttell about your destination to anybody professor snape potions master the first thing that came to her mind was why me i am not even on top of my class but then she thought and why not it a high privilege to be in the advanced potions snape has his reasons what time is it oh merlin fifteen minutes to seven she ran out of the common room heading straight to the dungeons the dungeons were creepy as always with a lot of effort she reached the door of the potions classroom opening it with a crack she saw that the class was almost empty almost without counting draco malfoy who sat behind one of the desks not a good beginning she entered and quietly sat behind the nearby desk they sat a minute in silence and then snape entered he looked around and saw that everybody was present so he could begin welcome to the advanced potions class i see that you are both interested in some deeper learning of the potions science you will work together no draco and ginny cried in unison and then looked as if surprised at each other then you can leave because this is the only condition of your studying said snape with ice in his voice after that a very long silence hung in the room draco and ginny were weighing their options ginny i cannot work with him it will be pure torture he is a malfoy and i am a weasley we will argue all the time and nothing will be done properly i am asked to participate in such an honorable class and what do i get malfoy of all people brrrr but then it could be fun to torture him back draco snape asked me to help him not a problem but with her no way i cannot work with her it will be pure torture i am a malfoy and she is a weasley we will argue all the time and nothing will be done properly but then he looked into the eyes of his favourite professor and he saw there was something very uncommon entreaty yes draco and ginny answered in unison again that more like it begun snape in his usual teaching tone follow me he stood up and left the classroom and they followed in suit after him they walked for a while before facing an ancient wooden door after they entered they found themselves in a narrow corridor or a passage to be more precise the passage ended with a room which was used like a potions laboratory sit down continued snape this will be your working room here you will find all needed ingredients and books he went to a closet and took two black robes with hoods out of there already asked draco without even realizing it no they are not those ginny looked from draco to snape and back but understood nothing these are your working robes they will protect you from fire acids and blowups you can change the color of course you will study here on mondays and thursdays at six o clock now that we have finished all these arrangements i want to tell you the purpose of all this i need assistants for making different potions for me not very complicated but still time taking you can understand that i have a lot of work to do especially now so i cannot waste my time on some simple potions simple for me but not for you of course i will give you assignments such as lists of potions but without instructions and you are to find them by yourselves maybe later you will do some research too the most important thing is to keep this all in secret nobody must know where you are going and what you are doing top secret understand absolutely nobody must know friends relatives nobody maybe you will be absent from you average potion classes but you can say to your friends that i gave you detention or another assignment something of that sort have you understood everything draco and ginny nodded on this the topic was closed draco and ginny moved to their dormitories without a word will this work out they are my last hope this was snape last thought when he entered his private cambers right next to the laboratory chapter thirty six they are coming they are coming squealed ginny waltzing around the laboratory without noticing draco annoyed look who the heck is coming more people to frustrate me everybody everybody is coming draco ginny yelled with sparks of happiness in her eyes the aurors the order my whole family my parents and all my brothers even the older students from dumstrang and beauxbottons but draco didntlisten to her anymore instead he had turned white after her mentioning the word family are you alright draco ginny asked managing to notice his change of expression through her enthusiasm draco shook his head nothing everything is alright but there were notes of panic in his answer even he couldntcompletely hide what is it draco did i say something wrong ginny repeated everything she just said in her head and her face lit up are you afraid of my big bad brothers she asked teasingly of course not he replied indignantly how could she even say such nonsense then what are you afraid of and you certainly are she added noticing his attempts to object i dontwant to lose you you wontbe allowed to come here being under control of your numerous relatives who told you they can keep me under control ginny said putting her hand on her hip looking like an amazon woman yeh that isntreally an easy task draco said with a small smile of course there could be problems with the twins especially but i ll weasel out of this some how deal so you ll come as frequently as you did he asked with hope he wants me to come here so much i ll try ginny was right during the following three days hogwarts resembled more of a train station than a school people were coming from all directions by brooms by floo powder and some apparated to hogsmeade the entrance hall was always full of people with trunks waiting for a place to stay and knowing hogwarts there was plenty of it abandoned wings of the castle were quickly transfigured into guestrooms so hogwarts started to look more and more like a hotel almost all the unused classes were occupied only one place remained completely empty the slytherin common room not many claimed to stay there because there wasnta lot of former slytherins in that crowd of hogwarts army as it was called by the students still dumbledore announced to the staff that he had saved a very special purpose for it the weasley family arrived in the first portion of the guests of course all the weasley boys settled themselves in the gryffindor tower where they were provided with additional dormitories many relatives decided to join their children not only to support the protection of the walls of hogwarts but also to be together with the family to be united auror apartments were located on castle levels four on each floor and a communication system was established between them so all posts could be alerted in the case of an attack on the fourth day the gathering of the order of the phoenix and the heads of the auror groups took place in the big ballroom on the sixth floor dumbledore office was too small for such an amount of people good afternoon ladies and gentlemen greeted dumbledore sitting down into a huge armchair set on a small podium firstly i would like to thank everybody for their decision on coming here i really appreciate your help the whole wizarding world must unite to win this great battle against evil which consumes our world i hope that your participation is the beginning of the reunion of all the members of the wizarding community secondary i would like to express my sympathy towards the weasley family which lost its house yesterday after another death eaters raid he said with a heavy sigh another home another family is ruined the borrow destroyed ginny looked around frantically searching the faces of her family members why did nobody tell her is it true she asked her mother breathlessly molly weasley looked away tears glistening in her eyes is it true ginny demanded from charlie who stood beside her he curtly nodded ginny felt lost her sweet home was destroyed the place where she had spent all her life the symbol of the weasley family love and now all that was left were ruins it was a miracle how the house kept standing with such a hilarious construction but it stood for more than twenty years and now nothing absolutely nothing something cracked inside her like something died inside her body she became dizzy big tears started to fall down her cheeks no no it cantbe happening ginny muttered shaking her head ginny darling are you alright molly asked with motherly concern how can i be ginny exclaimed hysterically and started to run towards the exit pushing through the crowd when she was almost near the doors they burst open and none other than draco malfoy appeared in the door frame ginny ran into him and he enveloped her into a comfortable hug he didntknow what had happened but his pendent signaled that ginny was in danger she wetted almost the whole front of his robes when he finally noticed the presence of other people in the room he couldntbe prepared for such an audience still he instantly understood what was discussed there and decided not to grab much attention excuse us for a few minutes he said to the staring expressions and pulled ginny towards the door either she was in a deep shock or too hysterical for she didntmake a move so draco simply took her into his arms and left the room all the heads simultaneously turned to dumbledore with an unspoken question draco managed to grab all the attention only with his very presence in the school despite his last actions now i would like to discus some serious matter with you dumbledore said calmly as if not even noticing the entire ordeal draco took ginny to the nearby classroom he set her down on a chair and cupped her face brushing away the strands of her hair to look straight into her eyes what happened virginia he asked softly our house the borrow she managed to answer through sobs you mean your house was attacked crushed ruined ginny whimpered another home another powerful energy center that cunning bastard draco thought with venom he brushed her tears with his thumbs stop crying virgie you must be strong it better than to lose someone right ginny nodded but not absolutely convinced all your brothers are alive and healthy you ll build another house but draco it was our house the best place in the world i understand but please stop crying smiles suit you much more virgie ginny smiled weakly and dried her tears with her sleeve thank you draco i didntthink you could be so tender draco felt embarrassed and confused tender i haventeven noticed let go back i am sure we ll hear something interesting ginny said motioning for him to follow her they cautiously opened the doors and snuck in draco felt quite uncomfortable he seemed to be out of place at that very moment everybody was listening to a report by an auror concerning the recent attacks ginny found herself a place near her family if you need me i ll be in the lab draco whispered into her ear and after assuring that ginny was safe and sound headed to the doors i suggest you join out meeting professor malfoy dumbledore loud voice stopped draco in his tracks the room became silent i wasntinvited headmaster draco said in a business like tone sorry i forgot to owl you i thought your presence was obvious here even draco was surprised by such a statement he nodded to the headmaster and looked around for an unoccupied chair which inconveniently happened to be near the dream team draco sighed and sat down between harry and ginny who appeared by his side out of nowhere the report of the auror was soon finished and waiting glances were set on dumbledore my friends and order members i gathered you today mainly to set up a plan for a counterattack fortunately thanks to professor snape we know the exact day of the dark lord attack the 8th of may the face didntbeam at the information because everybody could count and that left them a bit more than a week he can change the date it isntthat important he can attack in a month when we will be exhausted from waiting grumbled mad eye moody i inclined to disagree with you alaster tom always was a follower of the symbolism this day has an important meaning in the history of hogwarts the eighth of may is considered to be the day of hogwarts foundation the day when the last stone was put into its walls he wants to bring hogwarts downfall on the day of its rising it also happens to be my birthday he finished with a small smile that why tom will stick to his first plan any suggestions dumbledore asked glancing around the room what is there to suggest we just go and kick some death eaters butts said one of the weasley twins a few snickered i am happy for your determination and enthusiasm mister weasley but the problem is that the death eaters are the last on our concern list we are sure about werewolves and dementors but nobody knows what other dark creatures will be brought and it isntneeded to be reminded that dementors themselves are not teddy bears dumbledore went silent everybody began to conjure ideas in their heads but still nobody voiced a suggestion i ve managed to bring two dragons with riders sir they are hidden four miles to the west of the castle very well very well but two is not many charlie i know and those dragons are quite young so there could be surprises also they were the only ones i persuaded to come we also have a few surprises in store but still the advantages could be not on our side we need some serious help use house elves everybody turned to the source of the voice which happened to be draco will you grant us with an explanation mad eye moody snorted how can such a petite creatures defend the castle house elves have powerful magic the can apparate in the hogwarts territory and cast serious spells the other advantage is their size it is impossible to comprehend what hits you when it comes from the ground that why you can use them in the defense system especially against humans draco almost recited why cantthey come up with obvious things but you can t hermione exclaimed all s p e w like they cantjust die there you cantjust throw them into the battle granger we all can die there as for elves then it their obligation to protect their home from intruders hogwarts is their home they ll do it even without your asking them hermione pouted but said nothing very practical proposal draco thank you very much i ll go to the kitchens right after this meeting somewhere a frustrated growl was heard probably from one of the weasley brothers if nobody else wants to speak i would like to arrange the duties i prepared for some individuals dumbledore turned to his left minerva you ll be my general mcgonagall smiled shyly you and the other professors will participate in the defense organization mainly arranging the students and thickening the protection charms you my dear severus wontgo to the battlefield this time he said with a hint of concern but albus i am completely healed i cantjust sit here and do nothing snape objected halflife who of course sat beside him lightly squeezed his hand trying to tell him that dumbledore knew better but snape didntwant to give up so easily he was a man for merlin sake his place was on the front who told you you ll do nothing your place will be on the roof dumbledore said with mischief in his glance the roof snape asked with a frown of confusion he was not the only one even draco couldntunderstand what could be done on the roof during the battle you remember the siege of the macintosh manor i suppose snape paled a little but nodded but i dontknow it was so long ago i am not sure i am still capable of doing it snape stuttered all his self confidence gone you ll do it severus they are being constructed right now you can practice tomorrow if you like will i be there alone no no there are three of them ten goblins will be at your service snape sighed with relief last time wasntthat comfortable he muttered what are you talking about severus halflife whispered snape only shook his head well everything is clear here dumbledore was given looks of maybe to you but we haventunderstood a thing but he ignored them where are the children going to be during all this i hope you wontask them to fight will you molly asked only on a volunteer basis molly as for others i decided to move them to the safest place in hogwarts to the dungeons or more precisely to the slytherin common room that really was a thunder in the bright sly everybody started to whisper discussing dumbledore decision the thought the slytherin common room could be the safest place in hogwarts was disgusting especially to the true gryffindors of whom the crowd mainly consisted but dumbledore loud voice quieted them all still we have another great concern and i dontknow how to approach this problem i am sure tom greatly relies on his new young guards of slytherins it is hard for me because they were students of this school not more than half a year ago it is difficult to cope with the fact they are not on our side dumbledore finished with pity for said students i ll take care of it came a firm response from draco dontthink about it i ll solve your sly problem and what are you gonna do reminiscence about the old good school days ron asked with uncovered sarcasm oh no i ll just fight them as simple as that draco answered ron expression changed from smug to unbelieving are you nuts there is no less than thirty of them what is the first rule in fighting potter draco asked out of the blue turning to harry you must know your enemy harry answered automatically without even thinking ron looked at him with shock and admiration at the same time but still couldntunderstand how harry was capable of obeying malfoy you ve learned you lesson well five points draco threw to harry and then learned back to ron taking into account potter statement i need to know how to defeat them well i know myself pretty well donti ronald draco said looking straight into ron eyes this look made ron shudder well i suppose so he said taking his glance away draco smirked at that well ladies and gentleman if nobody has any questions i would like to invite you to a refreshments table which was kindly prepared for you by the house elves at his words a big round table appeared in the center of the room everybody was tired and tense so they gladly accepted the tempting food while talking about all which was said before potter a word please draco more stated than asked ok harry said with a sigh and started to go when ron stopped them everything can be said in front of us ron stated draco glared at him but said nothing i want to ask you about your training process potter what same time same place harry asked with a chuckle no we are through with that you passed the exam already how do you feel by the way draco asked without any concern in his tone at least well not bad but still i sleep a lot and i feel definitely weaker than before thought so draco said with a nod and took a vial with a blue liquid from out of his robes pocket drink it your powers will return faster harry took it and examined it closer it is the one you talked about with exactly draco interrupted not wanting the name to be revealed especially with her brother right beside him your training isntcomplete yet the final part consists of your work on yourself you must decide what should be revised or studied more practice moves you think you dontexcel i think you understand the point you have one week and dontforget mind games now i have other business to attend to with that he turned on his heels and disappeared into the crowd you had an exam in your dueling class how was it hermione asked excited exams of all kind were her favorite topic i was to kill him harry answered make hermione go pale and even ron felt uneasy if you passed it why is he still alive ron asked trying to lighten the mood he said i had almost done it one more blow was needed to finish him off harry explained how can he talk with you and even give you further instructions after you almost killed him hermione asked bewildered he told me i had done a good job leaving him on the verge of death harry said he is mad utterly ron commented who knows who knows harry said under his breath draco was on a very serious mission it was a life or death situation he scanned the room with his vision looking for an aura with a dirty green moving spot he could bet that person was there somewhere he must be at last he found him and didntlike it one bit when he saw who it was but it was his job he sighed and started searching for snape father draco greeted snape who was in a deep conversation with some ministry officials snape grinned at draco calling him his father it was only one word but it warmed all his insides you want something draco i think there is no point in covering our work any longer they must be told sooner or later i am sure now is appropriate because wounded is one of them no names were mentioned but snape understood draco request perfectly yes you can do it if there are any problems send them to me draco nodded and left one of snape interlocutors asked with a frown i dontremember you having a son the war not only takes but also gives snape answered with a smile draco founded his red headed goal at the refreshments table he tapped him on the shoulder fred weasley turned to look at the person who dared to interrupt his flirting conversation and made a disgusted grimace on finding out the personality of the intruder what do you want fred snapped you must come with me what for fred asked smugly draco lightly hit the right side of fred stomach and his face turned into a grimace of agony that for you are not healed completely i know the way to do it but how do you know fred asked flabbergasted come with me and i ll answer your questions but why should i trust you of all people take your twin brother with you if you are afraid of a big bad malfoy draco said with a sneer big bad malfoy fred rolled his eyes then why are we still standing here george come here we are going on an excursion after george joined them they headed to the dungeons when george saw fred companion he looked at his twin giving him a what s that suppose to mean look on their way down fred quickly described the situation which made george glance at draco with even more surprise they wordlessly entered the laboratory and draco stepped to his worktable he started to prepare a cauldron and the ingredients right away for a few minutes the twins watched draco who skillfully chopped mandrake root but then fred asked so how did you know about my injury you were cursed with the turmilia curse right draco asked without leaving his work yes fred answered hesitantly i knew that someone was cursed with it and an antidote was made to lift it off but there wasntenough of the centaur hair at the time so the antidote was not able to heal properly that why the after effects were left the leftovers of the curse eat your insides slowly but steadily a painful process isntit if you dontreceive another portion of the antidote you ll die in three months with that last sentence draco turned to face the twins who jaws were almost literally on the floor how do i know all this because i made that antidote myself how do i know it was you it my professional secret and i wontreveal it wait for an hour the potion will be ready by then he gestured towards the couches make yourselves at home the twins found their voices at last it wasnteasy to leave them speechless they were gred and feorge for joker sake but this was too much for them malfoy makes antidotes and for a weasley no less it was too unbelievable well they didntknow that another surprise was in store for them three glasses of butterbeer appeared on the table they sat down and took a few sips so what is this place george asked looking around it is the laboratory for professor snape assistants draco said conversationally assistants so there are more fred asked with sudden interest yes there is another one so what do you do mix antidotes all the time no i do the main part of the practical stuff she does the research she so you spend hours here alone with a girl fred asked with heavy text between the lines well they were boys after all draco restrained his urge to laugh out loud if only they knew well let see where this conversation will lead us you could say so wait george began deep in thought so you were the one who made antidotes for exhio ahillessus savana moderato kataracta speculisus curses and many many others wait a minute i dontremember moderato i know the antidote is allegro but draco stood up and walked back to his table he pulled out one of the drawers and took out a pretty big journal we keep record of all the potions made here you can look yourself he looked through the pages here is the antidotes section draco pointed at the page with his index finger and gave the journal to the twins they looked through the pages full of records in neat handwriting there were dates names of the curses and antidotes to them carefully organized do you know that you have saved lives of fourteen people fred asked with wide eyes and a looking a bit pale fourteen people you say well there will be one more in half in hour draco reacted indifferently but inside he felt happy happy that he had done something good something worth mentioning i thought we d die here from all the work of course professor snape made the more complicated ones but it was hell nevertheless you know five potions at once draco reminisced he really was fond of that time he had got so much knowledge then they worked like bees everyday they were really good memories of perfect work by two real partners george took his head into his hands and rocked back and forth i can not believe this malfoy saved my life he said under his breath you saved my life three times he said more loudly here goes your reputation of a troublemaker draco said with a smirk well you can say thank you at least draco didntthink that it would end like this they were so confused like little puppies and they had been smug in the beginning thank you malfoy for saving my life and the lives of my family and the members of the order too muttered george wow the whole family well maybe they wontkill me after this we could still be friends with virgie thought draco with his spirits lifted the cauldron began to bubble and then abruptly got silent draco approached it took out a goblet poured some potion into it and gave it to fred he took it and drank it in one gulp nasty liquid went down his stomach and after another four minutes he felt much better where is that girl i want to thank her too the twins said almost simultaneously as if on cue faint steps echoed in the corridor and the door began to open virgie we have guests today draco said choking on a laugh virgie sounds familiar fred said thoughtfully draco went to meet ginny leaving the twins on the couches your twin brothers are here father says we can tell your family he whispered only for her to hear ginny nodded i like the nick name by the way she whispered back smiling they reached the mini living room and the twins readied themselves for words of gratitude when they were struck but whom they saw meet my potions partner virgie draco introduced her with flourish fred groaned and fell back on the couch no way in hell whispered george and followed his twin brother now draco couldnthelp it he began to laugh openly and loudly ginny soon followed i have finally understood how selfish i ve become i would like to thank my fair reviewers who keep me happy after every chapter is updated i am very glad that this story still interests you and hope to make it even more exciting in the future love you all lady arabella malfoy chapter forty one mr and mrs snape ron weasley was soundly asleep in his bedroom in the borrow the room was built anew but its walls were still bright orange the reason for ron peaceful slumber was the end of the school year and the school life on the whole he wrote his n e and the grades hadntbeen received yet so he could enjoy his leisure time at home the question about his future wasnteven raised because it was obvious that he would choose to go into auror training if his potions exam was passed and that was a big if hermione also stayed at the borrow during this summer or to be more precise she stayed with ron they d become absolutely inseparable her bedroom was opposite to ron and sneaking to each other during the night was quite a common thing between them if you are having some naughty thoughts about the situation then so be it maybe you are right or maybe not i dontactually know what they were doing during such visits ask them if you like i ll remain silent ron was awakened by a noise from outside his window he groggily stood up and went to said window to open it and finally to shut up whomever it was there the window cracked open and an annoyed looking owl flew in it dropped her burden on ron head and left firstly ron acknowledged the fact that an owl flew into his room and dropped something on him so probably he had received a letter or something bigger because quite a bump was forming on his head stupid owl he grunted and looked at the damn letter which was lying motionlessly on the floor dammit it is a howler he exclaimed moving backwards the only thought that was on ron mind at that moment was i haventpassed the exams and mom is going to strangle me and then send me to degnome the garden fortunately for ron it wasnta howler with an exact purpose of it the letter looked like it but was of a deep purple color lady or gentleman with this fragrant card very rare blue rose petals were used in the potion that made the card smell like that so you must feel honored that such tender aroma is touching your nostrils a snappy masculine voice interrupted ron instantly recognized it as snape s dontmess up with the charm severus the woman voice reproached now where was i oh yes with this card she continued in a more official tone you are invited to the wedding reception of professor halflife and there was a pause then ouch and professor snape snape announced with pain in his voice on the fifthteenth of august at the shimmehausen glade at two o clock sharp and dontbe late or i ll deduct points especially if you are a gryffindor you will find the instructions of how to get there on the backside of the card of the invitation oh severus you are such a prat that why you are marrying me the message ended with snape and halflife gradational laughing ron looked at the invitational card which lay on the floor with shock and disbelief after two minutes of staring he finally came to a conclusion that gave him hope he hadntgone mad i am sleeping yeh i am sleeping alright i just need to pinch myself and this dream this nightmare will disappear he pinched himself once twice thrice but the damn piece of paper was still on the floor just waiting to be picked up it was in his masochistic predicament hermione found ron when she entered his bedroom with a beaming glance ron what are you doing your whole arm is red already o i am just having i marvelous nightmare ron started to explain his eyes transfixed on the piece of carton on the floor where i am invited to snape and halflife wedding i just cantwake bloody up ron finished by pinching himself very hard oh you too ron hermione squealed what do you mean ron asked turning to her for the first time well i am also invited she answered showing him her card ron groaned and fell down onto his bed so it isnta dream then and snape is marrying halflife for real and the greasy git is inviting us to the wedding of all people ron asked looking at the ceiling hermione was surprised but this reaction of ron his hate of snape was a well known fact but it just wasntright so she decided to join him on the bed she lay down beside him and ron instantly pulled her closer hugging her by the waist dontyou feel happy for them ron just a bit they are marrying because it means they love each other they finally have found somebody to spend the rest of their lives with why cantyou just wish them luck and share their happiness but mione it is snape we are talking here about arentany questions rising in you head it seems pretty suspicious to me yes two actually what to wear and give them as a wedding present so you mean you are actually going ron asked with raised eyebrows yes i am i was invited why not i despite other people she looked meaningly at ron can step over old rivalry and prejudices i have only one week to find the present and i donteven have a clue what to give them you can receive some experience there too what experience can be received at the wedding ron said rolling his eye well you know wedding experience hermione replied blushing and avoiding looking at him aaaaa ron drawled grabbing the meaning of her words he didntblush just smiled pleased with himself i should go too then we cantkeep only half of the family experienced can we ron said with a wink and kissed her soundly the only topic of discussion during breakfast was also snape wedding it turned out that the whole weasley family was invited to attend only ginny looked distant and tired she didntparticipate in the conversation and silently ate her food wha o yo thin bout all at inny asked fred with a pancake in his mouth huh about what ginny asked tilting her head up with a confused expression fred swallowed about the fact that our greasy bat is going to marry well it is good news to me she breathed out sorry fred i am exhausted i am going to bed it only morning and you are tired already i hope your partner isntinvolved fred asked his eyes tiny slits of course not he is as far from here as possible he better be organizing a wedding isntthat easy i ve spent the whole nigh charming those howlers why cantdraco be here why should he pass those blasted exams in the academy of his right now i canteven think what i will do when he is gone he wrote in his letter that when he came back he would help with everything i ask him but i dontneed his help i need him his arms around me his lips on mine she sighed and we still keep our relationship a secret breaking the news wontbe a pleasant experience of course they know something is going on due to our declarations before his imprisonment but everything is just so messed up but that not the problem at hand professor snape and professor halflife must have the best for the wedding and there is still so much to do now rest for a few hours ginny went to her bed instantly falling asleep dreaming of a wedding but this time of her own the instructions on the back side of the invitation card said that everybody must meet the groom and bride representative at the leaky cauldron at 13 30 on the wedding day it turned out the amount of guests was quite large so the tavern was pretty crowded all the professors of hogwarts were present and all the order members with dumbledore in the lead everybody chatted their time away waiting as they thought for the representative to arrive ginny was standing in the corner with a long parchment scroll in her hands from time to time she was marking something on it as usual ron decided to mind her business and stepped beside her what are you doing gin homework he asked with a smirk looking at the parchment contents from above her shoulder you can look at it this way also ginny responded without taking her eyes from the scroll oh all are here now and on time too splendid she turned to ron confused face i couldntimagine that deducting points by professor snape would be such a strong stimuli to be here on time she finished with a chuckle and hurried to the near table after she climbed on top of it she announced in a clear and loud voice dear ladies and gentlemen thank you all from behalf of the groom and the bride that you have gathered here and accepted their invitation to share their happiness on the most important day of their lives as you probably guessed already you were waiting for me and it wontbe long now until you find yourself in one of the most beautiful places in england the shimmehausen glade please make groups of five and you ll be handed a portkey straight to your destination ginny got down from the table and started to distribute the portkeys which were in the form of a crystal ball of different colors what the hell are you doing ginny charlie asked grabbing her hand after she gave the portkey to the weasleys and started to move to another group i told you just a minute ago i am handing out the portkeys ginny answered calmly but why you how can you be snape representative why not she shook her head dontbother me now charlie i need to maintain my responsibilities with that she flew away leaving the weasley clan with their jaws on the floor of course fred and george could put a connection between ginny and snape that could explain her status here but they silently agreed that ginny herself would do it when she was ready at 14 o clock sharp the portkeys were activated and all the guests were transferred to the glade it could be called the heaven of nature the glade was surrounded by high firs with no space between them it was divided into two halves be a clear sparkling river which was five feet wide the table for guests situated on both banks of the river were covered with indigo table clothes and compositions from orchids and camellias were set on them the table and chairs were the only part of the civilization the opened view was completely virgin and a pure piece of nature art such a beautiful place incredible everything is so perfect i couldnteven imagine something like this still exists came from different parts of the group please take your seats ladies and gentlemen you can apparate to sit on the other bank draco clear voice spread above the crowd one by one the guests started to take their places behind the tables on the way complimenting the choice of the place and fantastic decorations hardly did they know it was only the beginning how many guys have told you today that you look absolutely hot drawled draco embracing ginny by the waist from behind and kissing her shoulder sending shivers down her spine you are the first and hello to you too ginny responded impishly but trying to stop the weakness in her knees then they are all blind he whispered huskily for a moment forgetting they were watched by a hundred eyes draco compliment was based on ginny choice of clothing for the occasion she wore an air silk lilac dress that ended just above her knees and was decorated with orange yellow and purple live flowers which were not going to wilt in the near future thanks to the magic of course draco get a grip your father is going to marry today and is quite anxious already ginny whispered in return of course he is anxious his fianc e is hot i thought we assumed that i am hot ginny said dangerously ok ok she is hot but you are the hottest that my boy now go and give the signal that we can start the ministry official is here already and the guests are seated we can begin you are so businesslike today virgie draco said with respect he just couldntfocus on the wedding of his own godfather when such a goddess stood beside him the guests attention was grabbed by the sounds of the triumphant trumpets from the sky the louder the sounds became the clearer became an ivory pavilion above the river it was connected to the solid ground by two patterns of snow white clouds on both sides everybody held their breaths all knew what was going to happen next but noone dared to move or utter a sound not to interrupt the sacrament snape was the first to appear on the bridge his black robes contrasted with the whiteness of the clouds drastically perfectly he slowly reached the pavilion and took his place on the right of the ministry official the observers were absolutely sure that there was something wrong with him the same billowing robes greasy hair and a crooked nose but there was just something about the expression on his face that was unusual he was smiling just a small happy smile played on his lips his posture was relaxed and excited at the same time nobody had seen such a snape before well nobody actually thought that one summer day they would be the guests at his wedding halflife followed soon after she just couldntwait any moment longer step by step she began her walk to heaven as she called it she discarded all wedding traditions and decided to wear a black dress why not the color suited her perfectly and was her favorite on the other hand the veil was of white lace crowning with a tiara from camellias she looked stunning she wasntan auror a spy for the ministry or a dada professor at that moment she was a woman a woman ready to give her life and honor to a man she truly loved while walking she locked her glance with his those eyes those black holes she willingly let herself be sucked into she looked him over and was pleased with what she saw halflife herself asked him not to wear any dress robes for the occasion but his usual robes the robes of professor snape the potions master who saved her life and intrigued her in every way she choked a chuckle remembering how he proposed to her flashback the were sitting in the dada office grading exams tests even if the seventh years passed the exam on the battlefield the fifth years werentso lucky and were to write an o w l exam in defense against the dark arts the test grading required complete concentration that why not a word was shared until halflife noticed snape grinning widely what the grinning about she asked looking up from her good tests she was surprised by his expression knowing that he despised all his students and grading their pathetic nonsense tests couldntbring such a reaction just ran into draco test it lacks his usual inspired attitude but it is perfect as always sometimes i think that he is my son in reality even if it is absolutely impossible the silence covered them for another few minutes but was broken by snape this time i think you surname doesntsuit you now he said conversationally an interesting point i really donthave only half of the life to live now but the idea of having a surname like full life doesntattract me either she finished deep in thought well i think snape is quite appropriate for you quite laconical he suggested calmly what do you say we canthave similar surnames unless we are the word got stuck in her throat one minute two minutes will you continue to gawk and gape at me or will you just say something snape snapped more from nervousness than impatience i do i mean i will i mean the surname is quite fitting she rolled her eyes understanding how stupid she must sound then not thinking how stupid her next would be she launched herself at snape and made them fall on the floor together loosing her balance if i understood your riddle correctly mister then something is missing on my ring finger she said in a sing song voice with sparkling eyes if your body had been as coordinated as your brain than you wouldnthave been missing anything but now you are lying right on it she gave a confused look it is on my hand he explained irritated halflife blushed noticing that she indeed pinned him to the floor leaving only the head free for him to breath she wasntagainst the position and she felt that he wasnteither but the curiosity overpowered and she stood up helping him up he took the ring from his left pinky and put it onto her palm she looked down and saw the most beautiful black pearl in the world it is gorgeous she whispered in awe not as gorgeous as you are the compliment was rewarded with a passionate kiss end flashback the ceremony proceeded we have gathered here began the ministry official to unite these two people in an official marriage marriage is a serious step in everybody life and must be respected and cherished bring in the rings a small purple pillow appeared from thin air with two modest golden bands snape took one of them and recited with giving you this ring i severus bartholomew snape swear to love you and hate you to guard you and fight with you to leave you alone and in company to be your master and your slave to praise you and be proud of you believe you and lie to you to be with you till the end of time he slipped the ring on halflife soon to be snape finger she felt hot as if the ring was burning her but then everything settled down and it seemed that she was born with it on her finger she took the other ring and went on with her vow with giving you this ring i macbeth berria halflife swear to keep the fire in our hearth and under your cauldron to watch your back and lead you forward to be the mother to our children and a devoted wife to love you till the end of time the ring went down snape long pale finger now please give me your wands snape and halflife automatically presented him their wands lost in each other eyes the ministry official put them on a stool in front of him and sliced them in halves with a spell draco look ginny whispered urgently elbowing draco he is slicing the wands like snape did when we became partners so draco said lazily that why i felt as if i was married to you because i sorta was you dontlike the idea no i mean it alright but i just oh it doesntmatter now it is just weird well it isntthat weird actually came dumbledore voice from behind them in the wizarding world when two people marry they also became partners for life they share their love and magic equally you as partners also must ve shared your magic that why the ritual was performed on you he explained after the wands were returned to their respectful owners it was an interesting sight one half black the other bright purple the official proclaimed i now pronounce you mister and misses snape you may kiss the bride he finished with a smile i cantwatch it it disgusting ron grunted and took his glance away from the pavilion of course i wasntdisgusting in any way it was a firm but sweet kiss of the people whom were finally together when they parted the crowd exploded with applause even if practically no one was a friend of snape and on the main part despised the slimy git they couldnthelp but be happy for people who clearly loved each other snape and halflife sorry misses snape came down from the pavilion the pattern of the clouds turned into a solid bridge behind them when they were finally together on the bank dumbledore was the first to reach them congratulations severus i ve already given up the thought that i d ever attend your wedding my boy but here i am splendid he said lively and you look absolutely fantastic macbeth i am so happy for both of you he finished with tears of happiness twinkling in his eyes the row of congratulations and presents continued for the following hour and the pile of wrapped boxes was pretty big but snape wasntcompletely happy at that moment since neither ginny nor draco were anywhere to be seen when the guest were all seated and prepared to have a good snack they were interrupted by a clear and powerful voice excuse us ladies and gentleman but we want to give the newlyweds our present all heads turned to the pavilion where draco and ginny were standing what the hell uttered half of the weasley boys seeing their sister standing so close to malfoy it was planned to be a magical talent show number but due to different complications it wasntperformed at that time draco continued looking at the astonished faces deciding that the number was suitable for the occasion i and my partner virginia would like to show you the precise art of potions making snape grinned from ear to ear this was the best present he could ever wish for ginny handed him two black scarves just brewing a potion wontbe challenging and simply boring for you that why we ll do it with closed eyes somebody hmmmed among the guests i mean completely blind draco said looking straight at the interrupter who happened to be harry draco glare convinced harry than no vision advantages would be used draco and ginny put the scarves around their heads and crossed their wands a table appeared in front of them it had a cauldron with flames under it and at least ten ingredients of different amounts let begin draco announced to the audience who held their breaths potions making was a dangerous thing one mistake and they could be blown up but snape let it be so they were relatively safe for now anyway draco and ginny hand flew over the ingredients in a silent dance exact movements and order their hands hadntcollided even once you know it is an art of sorts george commented with eyes locked on the partners work yeh fred agreed looks like they ve spent a lot of time practicing it ron said with suspicion oh ron stop being a baby hermione reproached rolling her eyes still she was awestricken not even the dream team worked together so orderly and they knew each other for seven years draco and ginny crossed their wands once again and muttered fiestiness the cauldron was hit with yellow sparks which made the contents bubble furiously they took the blindfolds off took the cauldron and splashed out the potion at the gaping guests somebody even screamed but not a drop fell onto the ground especially on the people heads the potion turned into a magnificent solute of all possible colors the audience erupted with applause draco and ginny bowed ceremoniously but satisfied grins were all over their faces not fair came a yell supposedly from the weasleys table all the ingredients were measured out already you just needed to put them in the right order everybody could do that draco shot a glare in the direction where the voice was coming from but then smiled you are right it wasntfair name any potion and we will prepare it on the same conditions but only one silence greeted his challenge just one potion that will put to shame professor snape assistants again no answer potions must ve not been the strongest subject of the present guests anyone else would ve given up and call it peace but draco wasntanyone his abilities were doubted their abilities they worked so hard to establish the ability to work as a team and it was all sent through the window because of a joke then we should ask the potions master himself draco said with a bow turning to snape do you remember what i ve told you at your first potions lesson about what i can teach you draco you can teach us how to bottle fame brew glory and even stopper death draco recited without a second thought why wontyou try the last one snape suggested with his sneer but it wasnta sneer of torment but of understanding he knew it was a hard time for draco to find himself in a new formed society snape himself didntgive a damn he could do whatever he pleased and sod off everybody else but draco was young his whole life was ahead of him but he already had the past which wasnthis it is a difficult task that why i ll give you a hint what is death to you two without what cantyou live draco nodded but his body treacherously tensed from nervousness can we consult for a few minutes his voice cracked first time in a loooong period yes of course you have all the time of the world draco turned to ginny who looked like the death herself pale and shaking calm down virgie it is just another potion we can do it draco whispered with warmth putting his hands on her shoulders to somehow steady and reassure her but we need to brew death ginny managed to say shakily is it even possible yes there are a few ways the simplest one is just to make any kind of poison or repeat pettigrew trick of reincarnating the dark lord but father waits for much more from us we cantlet him down now let think without what we cantlive after a few seconds i cantlive without you was said in unison a boggart ginny supposed draco shook his head in response too many people and there are two of us it will be like two deaths or something suddenly ginny saw the light we cantlive without our love without our feelings she whispered with emotion draco looked into her eyes and a grin of cheshire cat appeared on his lips are you thinking what i am thinking i think i do but how there is no straight way we ll brew the draught of dread demenroe and icy cube then we ll mix them together and make a big bigger for everyone to seen and dontforget about the second most important things a bottle and a stopper draco finished with a wink ginny sighed what is this demenroe stuff i ve never heard of it kinda a way they reproduce he paused ok i am making it you are doing the other two agreed fine with me let get cracking they crossed their wands again and three cauldrons appeared the potions making equipment and a pile of ingredients in bottles and boxes of different size after everything was arranged draco and ginny put the black scarves on their eyes are you nuts mad eye moody squeaked but they didnthear him during the following two minutes absolutely nothing happened they just stood there motionless breathing in and out both in the same rhythm then after a light hand squeeze the magic began it seemed that their working table became alive everything was moving with the help of hands wands or on their own the audience as if bewitched stared at the pavilion watching four skillful hands snape had the time of his life i wish i could have more opportunities to watch such shows so perfect so complete so exact and no babbling are you sure they ll do it macbeth asked in a trembling voice why did you ask them to make such a nasty thing on such a glorious day she asked with reproach firstly i am absolutely sure if i wasntthen i wouldnthave asked them secondly it is pretty challenging and entertaining look at the guests their sockets will be left without eyes soon they watch with so big interest he replied with a chuckle but they are playing with death there she continued with indignation this time it is only another potion darling snape said with a shrug what have you done you stupid oaf ron whispered furiously nothing totally nothing george said with an expression of innocence of a newborn baby what were you thinking suggesting making another potion ron hissed why not it fun george answered with clear amusement have you already forgotten that it is your only sister who is mixing death for your entertainment ron practically roared but not loud enough to look impolite i dontknow what exactly you are talking about ron but to me it seems that ginny is enjoying herself out there so donttalk about nonsense and watch it is quite worth watching by the way our only sister is now brewing two potions at once two did you hear me two potions i dontremember you or anybody else from us managing to achieve such progress in potions so just be proud and stop bothering us or we ll miss a great show and you ll miss some necessary body parts ron decided to follow the advice everything went smoothly not a single mistake was made the guest threw side glances at snape from time to time but he only smiled then suddenly he tensed almost stood up wishing to scream yell to whatever to stop the process after a second he fell down with a sigh of relief who wasntat that moment watching snape with horror struck faces saw that the reason for the commotion was ginny who almost and i repeat almost added three goblin eyes instead of two but was in time stopped by draco he took one eye and let her hand proceed to the cauldron not even touching her ginny almost and i again repeat almost didntfeel the withdrawal but it was impossible for her not to feel draco presence so close to her especially if right now he worked on the other side of the table in a few minutes all three cauldrons were boiling and bubbling draco and ginny took the scarves off a deep sigh was heard from the audience meaning it over at last but their relief was changed to disappointment or excitement in many other cases when after another wands crossing a much bigger cauldron appeared all three potions found themselves in there in the right proportions of course when the potions were combined the sunny summer day turned into a chilly morning on the north pole everybody felt the presence of something evil lifeless dead but was looking at the cauldron mesmerized in there was death no doubt but what is it what does it look like ginny handed draco the bottle two pints in capacity it resembled a woman figure in some way draco cast a spell on it and looked expectantly at ginny ariso they shouted their wands directed at the cauldron and it began to rise slowly painfully terrifyingly freezing off every life being on its way somebody screamed yelled squealed and trembled like an autumn leaf at the appearing of a black robe but snape and even misses snape just grinned they did it macbeth whispered in awe they did it indeed the rising figure now took an outlined shape and turned out to be a dementor a n as probably everyone guessed long ago when it was ready to suck out some happy feelings of the guests draco opened the bottle and the dementor was sucked into it head first when the bottle was closed and stoppered the warm weather returned as the party mood clap clap clap clap came a steady applause from snape one by one everyone else joined draco and ginny bowed again and the equipment soon disappeared they went down hand in hand and draco couldnthelp but kiss ginny hand passionately you were terrific he breathed out speak for yourself i made a mistake ginny said with a pout everybody makes mistakes draco purred so you admit that you can be wrong well this is a matter for discussion they neared the main table and draco handed the bottle to snape is this what you waited for father snape looked thoughtful uuum well almost you see oh dontbe a snob sev they did everything brilliantly and you looked so cute together macbeth finished dreamily while she was baring them with compliments snape addressed the guests you probably think what a host if he leaves his guests hungry quite my style but help yourself with a wave of his wand the tables with their occupants moved closer to the edge of the forest making a circle on the freed space materialized a dance floor and dozens of laps appeared in the air providing a romantic atmosphere on the glade oh severus it perfect thank you so much macbeth exclaimed giving him a thank you kiss you must thank my naughty assistants for the organization i have almost nothing to do with this you did you did it for us how nice of you macbeth said hugging ginny and then draco who still sat at their table and now go and have fun you deserve it draco and ginny left the newlywed couple to their own world you know one question keeps returning in my head ginny said with a frown where exactly do we sit it obvious you are sitting with your family draco stated leading her to said table and what about you i dontknow will just walk around i presume he replied with longing nonsense you are going to sit with me ginny said in a tone which put an end to any objection we must tell them sooner or later right now is a perfect opportunity draco let himself be led to the weasleys table hoping that he wontbe a sheep for the slaughter house today hi everybody ginny greeted with a beaming smile hi gin her brothers welcomed her together in return you were magnificent back there charlie complemented yeh cool fred joined in gave us an opportunity to get some money on betting ginny blushed she wasntuse to such a praise i wasntthere alone only now they noticed that she wasntalone now either this is draco malfoy my potions partner and my boyfriend ginny introduced with a broad smile as if it was absolutely normal to have draco malfoy as her boyfriend you mean that draco malfoy began arthur weasley with venom who is the son of the death eater who killed his own father who despised our family for so many years and made life hell for my children including you who no ginny cut him off it is draco malfoy who saved my life four times and who loves me and i love him ginny stated clearly with determination to stand her ground draco squeezed her hand in a thank you gesture her hand hadntleft his the whole time he looked completely collected and smug on the outside perfect malfoy but there was havoc inside him they didntknow that if it hadntbeen for him the whole family wouldnthave existed now but he didntwant that to become a common knowledge for now one word and his future will be decided will he be or not even if that is true arthur continued drilling draco with his glance what are your intentions boy draco smirked a question every father asks he was prepared i am sure this will clearly speak of my intentions he said showing everybody ginny hand with the ring molly eyes became round arthur tried to cover his shock with coughs you may sit then he uttered shakily thank you draco said with a superior smile he just couldnthelp it he pulled a chair for ginny and then seated himself his neighbor on the left was ron such pleasant company what was the fuss about ginny whispered into draco ear her breath sent shivers down his spine you see draco began to explain helping himself to a lobster there is a tradition in many pureblooded families of high class arranged marriages the family engagement ring on a young lady symbolizes her status as a fianc e of the heir of the clan not only that but it also binds them forever or in other words there is no way out of marriage the other interesting part is that i can give the ring only once on my free will accepting my destiny even if i was forced into it your parents reacted so because they know all this it means that they are sure that you mean a lot to me if i decided to give the ring to you of all people on the other hand i wontdishonor you leaving you in front of the altar or run away because i simply can t ginny reaction surprised him why didntyou give the ring to your arranged fianc e then aaaaa i wanted to stay free for a bit longer ginny gave a him a i don t believe you one bit look ok i was afraid satisfied draco spat giving in ginny shook her head marriage was the last thing on my mind back then i needed to decide what to do with my life and the people around me and you are asking why i didntgive my family ring to the slut of slytherin you were to marry the slut of slytherin ron cut in with the folk half way to his mouth yes i was draco threw to him but then returned to ginny the contest was big why should i bond myself to a girl in my best age with others wanting me all the time he finished smugly men ginny commented rolling her eyes so you are utterly my right now completely from head to toe hmmm that gives possibilities ginny purred seductively and what is this suppose to mean ron roared through clenched teeth i dontknow ronald draco said giving ginny one of his sexy smiles but i like it he finished his eyes darkening a few shades he started to explore the possibilities kissing her right then and there how dare you ron yelled standing up oh ron be a man and kiss me hermione reproached pulling him down quite forcefully his lips landed right on hers and that why i dontlike to attend weddings harry remarked look who is talking charlie said in return i heard you ve got yourself a girlfriend harry blushed well spill it we all want to know who managed to grab harry potter himself well her name is stephanie she is from beaxbotons we met at the victory ball satisfied you mean that sexy brunette george joined in recalling the encounter with harry suddenly running away yes i mean that sexy brunette harry mocked enraged and embarrassed by them prying into his newfound private live hmmm you ve got it bad then fred remarked oh yeah and what about those red headed twins you two are dating harry cornered weeeel you dontthink you should bring them up harry george said with threat even a mock one what too sexy for you nothing can bring such amusement than confused faces of the weasley twins i am very sorry to interrupt your sexy conversation draco cut in but would you like to have some fun fun have i heard you right fred asked excited there must be the first dance of the newlyweds remember so george asked not understanding the point watch and return draco whispered waving with his wand and the air was filled with music rough rapid music the music of tango hearing it snape rolled his eyes draco you naughty boy we should punish him shouldntwe he asked his wife with sparkling eyes why it is the perfect choice they calmly proceeded to the dance floor and not only fred and george waited for some fun but all the guests because firstly snape doesntknow how to dance and secondly even if he does tango isntas easy as just moving around the floor imagine their surprise when the couple did a few perfect tango steps i dontknow for the guests but the snape surely had their fun they could dance now without hiding their feelings unleashing their love and passion towards each other it was an ideal tango and where is the trick fred grunted i dontknow look yourself draco threw with a wink then turned to ginny care for a dance milady but i and donttell me you cantdance tango but if you can t you ve got an excellent teacher just for you draco said with a gallant bow well on these terms ginny accepted his hand ginny indeed didntknow the tango and hoped she wouldntmake a fool of herself but when they took the stance and she looked into draco eyes all hesitance flew away her movements were not led by her legs but her emotions the only worrying thought was i hope i wontfaint because he is so close to me that it makes me dizzy snape noticed draco who was swinging ginny around the dance floor i told you he is a naughty boy macbeth he arranged the whole thing just to dance tango with her when malfoy is in love it is a natural disaster why so it is like an erupting volcano once it is awakened you cantstop the heat then two natural disasters are too many for one wizarding world dontyou think hell with them snape said pushing her down on his arm you know ron there is one thing that i absolutely dislike in you hermione said watching the dancing couples and what is that my eating manners ron asked putting on his plate as much as it could fit no your disability to dance like this look at them ron looked hmmm something is certainly familiar he drawled examining the moving couples especially the snapes hermione also looked more closely and after a few moments whispered you dontsay well i haventyet but you are probably right i know there is a saying that lovers can understand each other from half a word but please can you enlighten us charlie asked three words snape ball pair in black ron explained that was four words george remarked that not the point ron shouted be my witnesses i solemnly swear that tomorrow i am going to the dance courses that it if snape can dance so can i oh ron you ll do that for me hermione asked with her eyes full of admiration and love i ll do anything for you ron was about to kiss her when fred whimpered with fake tears oh so sweet yes ron you are the best george exclaimed after some dancing and a good portion of firewhiskey the guests became friendlier and started to walk from one table to another for a chat draco on the other hand wanted to a have a chat with the headmaster to ask him a question that wouldntleave his mind in peace good evening professor draco greeted dumbledore when he finally managed to grab his attention oh draco good evening indeed the decorations are quite lovely thank you i want to ask you one question go ahead why did i transformed into a dragon well it is easier than you think dragon is your true self the feelings that you experience towards miss weasley discarded your personality from all layers and the masks you put or were put on you by your upbringing and your life on the whole at that precise moment your soul completely united with your body when you transformed the world saw who you truly are was my explanation satisfying quite it means that whenever i transform my animagus form will be a dragon i dontknow try it some time and dontforget to register he finished with a wink of course draco answered with needed politeness he already started to leave when he swiftly turned back to dumbledore you are the third arentyou draco asked looking straight into dumbledore eyes what do you mean i told harry that there are only two people who master the dragon fang he and i you are the third how did you come to such conclusion my answer wontsound polite go ahead you are not my student anymore i cantexpel you you know too much draco whispered dumbledore eyes twinkled well that a good reason to suspect me he chuckled i am right then draco stated a threesome is better than a duo isntit with that dumbledore left to talk with tonks about her upcoming wedding with lupin the women at last managed to surround the newfound missus for some gossip taking into consideration that the wedding was a complete surprise to everybody she had a lot of explaining to do tell us macbeth how did it all begin mcgonagall grabbed the first word oh it all began in the beginning of the school year when i woke up in severus bedroom bedroom oh macbeth i thought so much better of you how could you oh minerva it was far from that i fainted in his office from the pain from the family curse and he took me to his chambers then he promised to lift the curse from scientific interest end of story are you sure it was only from scientific interest asked diana kingsley who also worked as a spy for the ministry and happened to be quite close to macbeth she gave her a questioning look well when i worked at st mungos snape was sent to us from hogwarts two years ago because his injuries were too series to be healed there dumbledore assigned me to him because he was aware of my identity the only words that he said being delirious were ocean eyes like they haunted him merlin macbeth cried her eyes full of horror i did that to him two years i tortured him and he only looked into my eyes the whole time and didnteven make a sound when voldemort told me to stop he stood up and left as if nothing had happened it was horrible sorry i must talk to him right away she ran away before anybody could utter a word she found him at their table and hugged him like there was no tomorrow what is it macbeth snape asked warmly lifting her hand by her chin why were you crying he said with concern noticing the wetness her cheeks i cantbelieve it it was me me who tortured you so badly what are you talking about you ve never hurt me two years ago to prove my loyalty i was ordered to torture you because you dissatisfied the dark lord in some way my eyes haunted you because you hated them so much but i couldntrefuse a new wave of tears began to cascade down her cheeks and that petite encounter made you cry well if it makes you feel better the reason your eyes stuck in my mind was quite the opposite when you cast crucio on me i didntfeel the pain all i saw was the beauty of your eyes two questions were haunting me how eyes can be so gorgeous and why does this woman serve that ugly freak so you arentmad at me for that macbeth asked with a puppy face of course not it was forgiven and forgotten a long time ago will we make a good family severus we have a whole night to decide chapter forty two be my guests the train was speedily heading to the north leaving behind crystal clear lakes and virgin but mighty forests on a bright morning of august now tell me one more time where exactly are we going ron grunted sandwiched between fred and george on a bench in the train compartment fred and george agreed to do me a favor and i decided to surprise you all with a little adventurous voyage draco answered with an amused smirk he was sitting on a bench opposite ron with ginny by his left side who was as close to him as possible harry settled himself in a corner on a bench with draco and ginny and seemed to be sleeping seemed is a keyword here hermione was on ron side of the compartment but couldntbe as close to ron as she wished because he was guarded by the twin and not without reason to kidnap us sounds more like it ginny runs into my bedroom drags me out of bed and here i am and nobody says why and even where we are going and why a muggle train ron continued his tirade of indignation nobody says because nobody knows draco said with a smile that on its turn said he knew everything and why for gryffindor sake would the twins do you a favor ron didntgive up i am sure they are already grown up to decide about it themselves it is their and only their business draco parried but it was clear that he was near to losing his temper ron turned red in the face you have no right fred elbowed him in the stomach stop it ron you are acting childish and you draco he turned to him why do you still cover it everybody knows that you and ginny were partners why dontyou want to be a hero for a change because i am not one draco replied not liking where this conversation was going what the hell are you talking about how can he be a hero draco and ginny saved the lives of the order members by making numerous concoctions and antidotes if it hadntbeen for them we wouldnthave been sitting here all of us that why we agreed to help draco when he asked us george explained ron cheeks reddened but now not from rage but embarrassment he still couldntget accustomed to the fact that malfoy did save his sister and him once but he just could not be friendly with him all of a sudden his nature was simply against it you still didntanswer my question about the muggle train ron uttered at last oh yes draco sighed i couldntmake a portkey to our destination because there a lot of wards there and it is simply useless and also i invite you all to a party ronald will especially like the reason for it it is a farewell party i am leaving tomorrow he finished with a sad smile ron reaction surprised everybody even hermione who knew him pretty well what do you mean you are leaving only fred and george saved draco from ron heavy punch so you only lead ginny along you gave her your family ring you must marry her or else so you intend to break her heart and even throw a party about it then you are just a filthy bastard and nothing else for a few seconds nobody could say a word then draco with eyes still wide from shock managed to whisper you want me to marry your sister willingly you dontwant to stop me to break my arms so i wontbe able to touch her you are giving me your blessing i thought about castrating you at some point but ron tone turned serious i love my sister and she loves you when she hates you my hate wontbe only emotional but physical as well oh ron you are my favorite brother ginny exclaimed with a happy smile she was so glad that draco and ron fued subsided for now at least and what about me george yelled with mock rage the situation was loosened a bit by giggles and laughs when ron fred and george began to fight for being ginny favorite brother when they finally decided that they were all her favorite brothers they took their respective places but now hermione managed to grab ron and snuggle close to him draco took the moment i know you are all wondering where we are going i suppose it is fair to reveal to you at least something at last harry muttered draco smirked we are going to scotland mountains scotland what did we forgot there it will stay a secret for now with such a way of transportation we have a lot of time and i left some questions unanswered so i am sure this time is suitable for some explanation who will begin the interrogation draco looked from fred to hermione and back why are you leaving harry asked from his corner right to the point i am surely starting to be afraid of him i am going to the academy of magic to receive a grade in potions you mean the one in switzerland hermione asked excitedly exactly wow it is said to be the most prestigious university of high education i am so jealous i wish i studied there she finished with a dreamy look why can you draco asked truly surprised he was sure hermione granger was able to enter any university because i am staying here with ron she answered with tenderness putting her head on ron shoulder it was clear in his glance that he was quite satisfied with her choice london university of magic can provide me with all the needed knowledge i wish i studied here unfortunately they donthave a potions department here fortunately i will return i really will i am dreaming of this moment already he said the last sentence very softly next question hermione took out her wand accio questions a parchment in her hands let see she went through the contents of the scroll prepared for everything draco asked with a chuckle ok let start with the beginning what was the dueling position you used while dueling with professor halflife hermione asked in a business like tone prepared indeed the answer to this question is in the reason i dueled her in the first place she was a newcomer and i considered it my duty to know who she was i looked into her aura and found a dark mark there she is a death eater hermione exclaimed with horror yes she was in the past tense draco corrected and continued the most interesting fact was that her mark was small and far from the aura center like in the background of her life such view was familiar to me but it was not enough to complete the picture that why i decided to pick up her challenge and used the cobra bite the dueling position where the left hand is used as a backup plan two pointed fingers became the second pair of eyes and aim perfectly at the target if you able to see it it is used when you are incapable of casting a spell your wand is broken or you are too weak or anything of that sort but your left hand will bite only during an official wizarding duel not every time you want to hex someone and not to get the detention for rules the point of my using cobra bite was that it is popular among first class aurors so it came out that our dada professor was an auror and a death eater with all the gathered information i came to the conclusion she was a spy and not for the dark lord and you didntturn her in what for she was a good teacher and it wasntreally my business anything else on the list when we were in your dueling class with harry why did you say that he had eyes on the back of his head or something like it hm well he doesnthave eyes on his back because he has eyes everywhere when people are very close and spend a lot of time with each other they are able to feel each other emotions if they master dragon fang harry could feel your auras even if you were behind him your sufferings and pain harry will know if you are in trouble even when you are on the other end of the world you have a very close connection why are you speaking only about me harry asked coming out of shadows you know quite well that you and i also share this connection that why i ve never been against you and ginny harry said locking his glance with draco and draco saw an understanding there he nodded in gratefulness but draco i can feel your emotions too ginny uttered emotions like what draco asked with interest well back at the ball i felt that you were looking for me intriguing draco said moving his hand up and down the back of her neck we ll certainly deal with it what is next hermione i really start to like it blaise zabini were hermione next words the happy expression instantly fell from draco face what about him he choked out what was your relationship with him and why did you mention threatening him to join the death eaters draco leaned onto the wall and closed his eyes the vision of him and blaise at school doing homework together playing quiddich their talks in the common room late at night when everybody was asleep already and then his body falling under the ground to be buried with people he had nothing in common we were close draco breathed out at last very close we reached a certain level of understanding he was much stronger than me he didntwant to be a death eater he wanted to be a free man but he was a slytherin and the word freedom in its true meaning wasntin the lexicon of the slytherin house there was a girl a hufflepuff this says it all you haventsaid mudblood ron spat with hate for everything the slytherins stood for i dontknow anything about that if she had been a pureblood then there could have been hope but otherwise it was a tragedy a tragedy of blaise zabini he was crazy in love with her and crazy from impossibility of even talking to her i bet that voldemort threatened him to kill her or more probably rape her if blaise didntjoin him i could save him but his eyes told me he wanted to die to die to relieve him of the stigma of being the death eater he knew she wouldnttake him even if he survived the war and he hadntanother reason to live for draco heard a sob from his left then another one from his right he opened his eyes and saw that both girls were whimpering and the guys had grave expressions on their faces ron was trying to calm hermione by stroking her back again silence settled in the compartment it wasnteasy to digest said information everyone at hogwarts was used to the idea that slytherins lived by their own rules they were labeled as bullies cheaters sluts and gigolos and of course death eaters they lived in their own world and nobody wanted to be a part of it the prejudices were so strong and unbreakable that a guy practically committed suicide just to escape that shut world such revelation wasnteasy to comprehend especially to true gryffindors does hermione have more cheerful questions on her list draco drawled moving his glance to ron because hermione was still sobbing ron picked up the parchment from the floor and began to read his eyebrows went higher and higher with every word who are those people who were indigo and purple in the rainbow of love were they snape and halflife if yes why was snape unconscious for so long you know ronald you have a brilliant girlfriend do you understand what treasure you ve got and what mess you have gotten into you must work very hard to maintain your relationship draco lectured with light sarcasm but amusement in his eyes that wasntthe answer ron only said in return draco sighed this question isnteasy to answer to especially if other people are involved you must promise me that everything i ll say remains in these walls george and fred exchanged looks of is he crazy it will be superb gossip especially about snape we promise harry proclaimed for everybody draco wasntblind he knew that such gryffindors and specifically the twins would use that information somehow to their advantage but he continued nevertheless those streams of love memories indeed belonged to father and macbeth i didntmake it a common knowledge because i protected their privacy as for the last question i we damn it is too embarrassing you want to say that it was the second most embarrassing moment in the life of draco malfoy harry asked with a smirk there is even one spill it mate george asked in a gossip hen mode merlin can you be serious just for awhile draco groaned nope it is our profession fred remarked with conspiracy ok no violence is needed draco put his hands up in surrender my condition after the battle was not similar to father only because i was young and healthy father didntfully recovered and his body wasntstrong enough probably wontever by fully healthy i didntwant to be a donor of the memories in the first place because i thought i had nothing to give but dumbledore talked me into it you were loved from the day you were born me and professor snape were not the spell took from our hearts all the love that was there and living without love is hardly possible draco finished very softly our beloved helped us to recover but i wasntthere you were still at the hospital wing when i left with mum ginny said with guilt rising up again she left him on the hospital bed weak and lifeless and hadnteven written a letter that why there was a mess in the laboratory draco replied with a small smile you mean you made a mess in the laboratory ginny exclaimed holding back laughter hey guys what is so funny about some stupid mess ron asked with a frown how can you not understand draco made a mess in the laboratory ginny said between giggles of course it was hermione who was the first to grab the funny point of the situation and she began to laugh so hard that tears began to stream down her cheeks but now they were the tears of joy you know george i begin to hesitate about my sanity because i cantunderstand what is funny here and that is not normal fred said looking from one laughing person to another they are snape assistants hermione began to explain through fits of laughter and he messed up snape laboratory what do you think his reaction was now really that wasntso hard to understand was it ron exchanged glances with fred and george and joined the laughing members of the compartment none of them knew that snape hadnteven thought twice about broken vials or expensive potions that were ruined but about draco who was completely broken and needed urgent comfort at that moment nobody except draco knew that and he decided to leave it that way professor severus snape needs a reputation to maintain honestly the enjoyable atmosphere was restored especially after lunch provided by draco who said it was his duty to feed his guests scotland still wasntin sight for another few hours and the company was discussing the ways to spend the time left let play games harry suggested excitedly i am sure you understand that truth or dare and bottle are out of option draco stated i am spilling truth all day long today and you haventfinished yet how did you know exactly that fred had the after effects of the curse and not me for example i just saw it in your aura even if you and fred are identical in appearance your magic level is different and of course some personality differences so you can to put a diagnosis to any decease hermione asked astonished no only pregnancy want a free check up draco asked her with a bit of a spiteful smile of course not why should i need any hermione exclaimed blushing common hermione draco did it even before he finished the question harry remarked so what is your resolution draco nope nothing interesting inside draco answered with mock disappointment well if we take into account the possibility then i am not so sure about proving the test negative but taking into consideration the weasleys long wizarding blood line and hermione strong magic i dontthink they can have a squib so hermione is not pregnant right now anyway of course i am not pregnant who do you think i am we use contraceptives all the time and she covered her mouth with her hand realizing what she had said draco smile widened and harry began to snicker ron was the most unfortunate sitting next to george well well well our little ronnikins has become a real man who would ve thought i am really proud of you son george brushed off a nonexistent tear ron groaned now i wonthear the end of it how can you even discuss such private things so evenly ron asked looking from harry to draco and back comes from experience of trying to kill each other every day by prying into each other most private thoughts harry explained casually how is that possible fred asked completely sure that they were just fooling around shall we harry suggested gesturing to the place opposite him merlin draco grunted changing places with george and dont tell me you didntplan it all along he said looking straight into harry eyes i am not saying anything harry said in return with an innocent look if i remember correctly we are even so it is the final match now and what is the prize ginny cut in odd we haventthought of it if i win you ll be my best man at the wedding draco proposed with a sly smile you could simply ask me you know harry agreed shaking his head but it a deal if i win you ll do the same not original draco remarked smugly well i still can ruin your wedding he said thoughtfully probably some ideas have started to enter his naughty mind already who said i cantruin yours you know guys we are still waiting ginny said in a sing song draco and harry expressions turned serious and blank they sat down opposite each other and tilted down until their foreheads were touching they simultaneously touched the left temples of each other and connected them to the right temples respectfully the connection was in a form of a sparkling mist one was read and another silver for a few moments nothing happened harry and draco were sitting motionlessly with their eyes closed then harry visibly tensed then frowned and draco clenched the edge of the bench the wordless battle continued for another half an hour and was accompanied with sweaty foreheads trickles of blood from temples noses and lips because they were bitten into so hard and ginny unstoppable prayer for them to stop the connection threads turned red or silver from time to time but when they were both completely red draco roared veins on his temples started to pulsate widely the threads instantly turned silver and harry was thrown backwards crashing soundly into the compartment wall everybody even you potter is restricted to pry into that part of my mind draco hissed with cold rage breathing rapidly he covered his face with his hand and all the blood disappeared harry performed the same gesture ginny was the first to find her voice what were you thinking doing it she said with reproach and concern at the same time i dontwant to remember draco responded tiredly something along the lines like cho chang in bed with diggory and lily potter raped by lucius the girls gasped in horror he shuddered a few times as if getting rid of such ideas what was that place harry whispered still with closed eyes the blow was too strong he wasntprepared for such a reaction how could he forget that finding yourself on the bad side of malfoy is very unpleasant what place that dark place draco sighed it was my residence in the beginning of this summer draco said with a tired smile they put you in prison even before the trial hermione asked in disbelief there wasntsupposed to be any trial in the first place my name said it all but harry described it pretty exactly it is a place full of darkness and nothing else really good idea to drive anyone mad without moving a finger that absolutely intolerable you mean there is no light in the cells hermione fumed well not exactly the lighter your crime is the more light you get my cell had a small window on the ceiling you felt completely empty as empty as your dark cell with one light at the end of the tunnel i calculated that i would ve taken three years to go utterly mad in such conditions the train began to slow down but today i not going to hang onto the memories of the past draco said his face lighting up face as he moved closer to ginny put the warm cloaks i told you about we are coming off the train after the train departure our travelers found themselves on a deserted station no houses or signs of civilization in sight just a long road through a forest that led towards the mountains did we travel through time or it isntaugust now harry asked wrapping in his cloak no it is always a bit chilly here common we need to walk a bit draco threw guiding their way up the road chilly my ass its bloody freezing ron grunted they walked for half an hour making a few turns with each turn they went deeper and deeper into the mountains on the last turn they faced a huge iron door with the malfoy family insignia draco opened it with his ring and they proceeded through a corridor hollowed out through a solid mountain the corridor exit revealed nothing but a wall of mountain picks we are here draco stated looking upwards where here our destination is behind this rage fifty feet right above us an apparitional point but we cantapparate there because of wards i need to shut off i ll go up and do it after my signal you can levitate yourself there understandable everybody nodded ok does anyone have a speedometer such a question made their eyebrows go pretty high i do ron said raising a hand good put it on when i start going up shut it when i wave you with my hand ok what do you need it for if you are just going up well it is just a tradition i do it every year after coming home from school that all draco explained with a wink ok i am ready ron set up the speedometer on his watch go and draco started to go up to everybody disbelief he did manually or in other words by climbing without any protection he moved from one ledge to another swiftly moving up to the apparitional point which turned to be a stony platform between two picks after a wave of a hand and another few minutes draco signaled it was safe to come up to the platform do you need any help he shouted to them no no everything is alright ginny yelled back they levitated each other up i dontremember windario leviosa working so quickly before hermione remarked neither do i ginny said giving draco a stern look he only shrugged so where is our target then george asked looking around down there draco pointed downwards the group moved their glances down to see a valley surrounded by mountains in the center of the clearing stood a large absolutely black building it seemed to be built from a solid piece of granite and stood there completely lifeless you said it was a quarter of hogwarts fred said to draco i miscalculated draco asked in return it is much smaller there are dungeons underneath dontbe disappointed is your equipment ready of course fred showed draco a shrank trunk what is this place a mausoleum or a prison of some sort this place gives me the creeps ron shrieked oh sorry i completely forgot about hospitality welcome to my off school residence malfoy manor draco said with flourish but pain was in his eyes but it is huuuuuge probably the whole clan lived here oh no only three of us draco said distinctly then put on a smile and started walking down the hill they came to another clearing which was supposed to be a part but were only a low cut lawn with benches and statues while fred george and i are attending to our businesses i solemnly ask you not to wonder around it is for your own good wards you know draco instructed emotionlessly and nodded to the twins to follow him soon they disappeared behind magnificent entrance doors i hope we wontstay here for long ron muttered shaking are you alright fine no i am not damn i feel like i am gonna throw up ron exclaimed going back and forth sit down ron i will help ginny suggested sitting on a bench herself it won t cantyou feel it the place is full of dark magic how can you make such assumptions even if it is malfoy residence it doesntprove anything hermione contradicted dontstart now guys i ll just check it out the moment harry activated his vision he regretted doing it ron was right it seemed to harry the house was built of dark magic magic of numerous generations has settled on it the aura was pitch black and consuming everything around it even clouds the only association that came to harry mind was death death to all living things and definitely to people who lived inside harry was brought back by a wild shaking of his shoulders he slowly opened his eyes and saw a panic stricken face of ron what happened mate one minute you are standing and another you are out i am fine ron you were right about dark magic this air must not be good for me harry said with a weak smile standing up i must ve fainted where the hall are they ron yelled to the house as if it could hurry them up as if on cue the doors opened and the trio exited two huge trunks flying behind them the twins moved like in a daze their faces as white as paper draco on the contrary quickly marched to harry and shouted into his face your curiosity will kill you for sure one day have you gone nuts it is a bloody building it is worse than voldemort himself damn he shook his head in frustration and stormed off to the trunks that stood already on the ground what was all that about hermione asked looking from draco to harry harry shrugged probably felt that i was looking into the aura of the building and he sounded concerned ok everybody we have an hour and i still must finish some things here firstly we need some cleaning to do fred george please step to the trunks harry you know what to do harry nodded but didntlook very happy about it ronald please stand behind harry just in case it is his first time after all ginny subconsciously moved to stand behind draco there were two persons now and those heavy trunks werentfull of candy for sure harry and draco outstretched their hands hermione was the only spectator and she had very sharp eyes she was muggleborn and wasntuse to magic a lot that why what she witnessed a few moments later was a sight that she would always remember as a demonstration of pure magic blue fire streamed from harry and draco palms embracing fred george and the trunks hermione made a record of how much effort was needed to produce such fire harry looked like he was turned inside out and was shaking heavily draco on the other hand looked more stable but it was visible that he was worn out he sank down on his knees slowly very slowly so nobody could ve accused him of falling down loosing his strength be weak he said something but nobody understood because it was said so quietly that why ginny said it for him fred george step out of the fire and dontworry it will die down on its own they followed the advice that was in a form of the order both still had shocked and frightened expressions on their faces but it started to fade being replaced by comfort and calmness forget about dignity harry draco whispered but now it was audible it is more than unnecessary now harry dignity was lost in a form of his knees weakening and his falling on ron who almost fell down himself are you ok harry ron asked sitting harry down on the ground harry only response to this was shaking his head how can we help him ron inquired turning to draco who only shook his head too he ll come around eventually i dontknow how long it took draco to recover from the last time ginny said three hours and twenty seven minutes draco stated standing up and swaying a little it was my second time so it will take harry about four hours to become harry potter again but your friend will return after an hour of rest what that suppose to mean ron asked with a frown it means that he can talk walk and do whatever he likes after some rest but he wontbe able to use magic and especially really advanced one till those four hours pass draco explained in a lecture tone i lied when i said there had been only three of us living in this this here and that is another problem i must care about he finished with a sigh then he walked to a more spacious space and faced the building folly dinky patty winky sissy danny cassy goofy gardy olly ziggy abby tassy goggy tinky one by one house elves appeared around draco forming a circle i am glad you are back with us my lord squeaked an elf who looked like the oldest and the most presentative of them all my lord so they already know that i am the only malfoy now there will be none of the malfoy manor soon so your services are no longer needed i ll take two of you with me the others are free to go the clothes will be provided right now draco said sternly leaving no room for argument but his strictness didnthelp the choir of you cantleave us master please take us with you we ll serve you for eternity took draco off guard the house elves were tugging on his robes almost pulling him to the ground their big eyes begged him not to give them freedom merlin draco groaned why must everything be done the hard way he asked his accompaniments they only shrugged amused by the sight of draco struggling with the house elves and definitely losing enough take your places draco barked and the elves instantly obeyed you want this you ll get this draco took out his dagger and lifted it above one of the elves head this certainly brought an active verbal reaction from the others you cantdo it draco ginny screamed they are still living creatures fred protested but draco heard nothing of it his dagger went down and then again and again cutting the air between him the house elves the moment he did it the elf became utterly grey even transparent its eyes turned lifeless and glassy even its ears hung down ziggy you are going to hogwarts to retire i grant you with master permission to end your work your will is free now the elf rose its eyes on his now former master the unwillingness to fulfill draco order was clear on its small face but an eternal struggle was finished by outstretched hands draco dagger went between the elf hands and ziggy disappeared with a pop what have you done to them they look like zombies hermione cracked they are house elves they cantlive without a house and master to serve for they are born for it draco explained shrinking the rest of the elves and putting them in a box which found its place in one of the trunks how much time do we have he asked the twins george checked his watch four minutes the group quickly went up to the apparitional platform and started to debate how to go down when draco stopped them i have a portkey you dontneed to climb down what are you waiting for then you said we had only four minutes ron fussed with panic draco snickered what so funny what will happen in four minutes draco asked his lips twitching from contained laughter ron looked thoughtful for a moment then exchanged glances with harry who shrugged then hermione and ginny who shook their heads showing that they had no idea either then ron looked back at draco who gave him a look of innocence in return and added we still need to use a protective shield just in case so what the hell is going on ron yelled his further tirade was interrupted by a pang of an earthquake then another the epicenter seemed to be located exactly under the manor with the next bang the first floor disappeared under the ground in a moment the second floor followed it the next explosion brought a snow avalanche and covered the remains of the building leaving no signs of it even being there so the test proved positive then draco commented addressing the twins yeh the question is whom we can sell it to george replied deep in thought another house another source of energy draco said with mock grief looking below then raised his glance to the sky with the happiest expression on his face holly heavens how good it is to feel free the portkey took them to well somewhere because nobody except draco knew their new location what is this place ron wondered looking around and seeing nothing but trees around him now it is definitely a kidnapping he finished gravely relax draco drawled he seemed to be completely relaxed himself and at ease with everything that surrounded him i promised you a party remember yeh my stomach is grumbling already fred complained and you are going to serve it on the ground harry asked seeing nothing suitable on the green valley why harry you dontthink i ll keep you outside even if it is a lovely summer day draco said with mock hurt he neared a tree trunk nearby and pressed his ring to a small hole in it the trees on the left started to move revealing something that looked like a huge barrel with windows on four rafters welcome to malfoy heaven draco announced and there was no doubt that he assumed being right there you ve built an entire house ginny asked with admiration of course not i just designed it but what are you waiting for common draco urged them already on the way to his house he again touched one of the rafters with his ring and a trap bridge came down to draco feet i know you are all eager to eat and rest but i need to bring a few lives back first he finished with a smirk harry ron almost plead please say he is crazy he certainly is are you afraid of him harry asked in return now you are crazy why should i be ron said with hurt dignity harry smirk closed the topic while harry and ron were talking crazy draco removed two tiny elves from the box and unshrinked them he put them on the threshold and proclaimed putting his hands on the elves heads this is your house your home and your sanctuary i am your only master and you must serve and obey me whenever i wish it now enter and remain the house elves transformed completely life returned to their eyes backs straightened they even looked younger they squealed joyfully and ran into the house be my guests draco invited with a bow the company started to go up stepping into the darkness but it was soon dispersed by small lamps lit on the floor guiding their way and after a few moments they found themselves in a slytherin common room of course they were not in hogwarts but draco living room was decorated in slytherin colors it was furnished with a few couches and armchairs small tables for tea or other refreshments and of course i cantforget about a fireplace decorated with black marble the furniture and the carpet didntlook enormously expensive like was expected from malfoy but stylish and tasteful nevertheless wow draco it is so cozy in here ginny commented with dreamy look squeezing his hand i tried he whispered back dontstand paralyzed take seats or do you want a tour first draco suggested to the gaping guys it will be nice i think hermione said for everybody they went up a small iron staircase to the second floor the house itself wasntbig the living room was indeed the size of the common room at hogwarts and it had two thirds of the store already on the left is the library and on the right is the bedroom the library isntfully equipped with books yet and what about the bedroom george smirked all equipment is present actually it is it is ready for anytime draco said not picking up the joking tone can we check it out fred proposed with mischief all over his face they were right in front of the door at that very moment only virginia and i can step through this door nobody else draco said very seriously ok ok mate just fooling around fred gave up the third floor brought a big surprise it was a swimming pool a pool with deckchairs around it just begging for someone to lie down under the sun and rest for awhile i dontknow about you guys but i am staying for bit harry said taking of his cloak and shoes i hope you dontmind draco that was the plan the changing rooms are down there draco said with a grin pointing to the bottom of the pool you mean that i must undress jump naked into the pool swim down for gryffindor knows how long maybe even drown from lack of oxygen just to get a pair of swimming trunks and if i do how will i change back i ll take my clothes go back to the pool they become soaked through i put them underwater keeping breath steady and then come up from the pool completely refreshed and in wet clothes what is the point of taking them off then harry yelled in the end well of you dontlike that you can use the other variant right there draco gestured to white cabins just beside the stairs they used to come up to the pool harry stormed to the pointed direction ron was the first to crack merlin that was good really good he uttered between laughs and it feels really good to follow harry example fred suggested stretching his back i am really dirty from all that digging in the dungeons i have trunks for everyone help yourselves and what should we do ginny asked i hope you dont have any bikinis stuffed under your pillows huh fortunately for me i don t but it is quite an unfortunate situation for you virgie of course a thought of you swimming naked with me is quite tempting ouch ginny elbowed him on the ribs but there are too many guys to see that which belongs only to me he finished intently looking into her eyes ginny noticed that they darkened but only for a few seconds dontwaste your time on sweating under all those clothes draco pecked her on the nose and disappeared inside the cabin yeh gin let show them what girls are made of hermione winked what the point ron seen everything already it was ginny turn to be elbowed the boys were the first to occupy the pool while it took the girls a bit of time to transfigure their underwear into some tight but modest swimming suits ginny decided on deep blue and hermione has chosen purple both looked very easy on the eyes wo ho ho would you look at that george exclaimed when the girls appeared just tell me how ron has got such a piece he asked fred but couldnthear the answer because george was being pulled under water by ron who not only inherited the weasley temper but also a high level of jealousy hey someone was talking about refreshments here ginny said with a pose tassy goffy the elves popped up refreshments for the guests and a dozen sandwiches draco ordered the elves nodded with grins on their happy faces and disappeared this is life i donteven want to move an inch to reach for food harry breath out surrounded by bubbles you can organize it at your home too it isntexpensive draco suggested speaking of expensiveness how can an eighteen year old without a job build himself a house especially if i remember that you swore not to take your family fortune hermione cut in nothing illegal here i began the construction about two years ago something i saved but mostly earned and where did that come from potions making i ve been working for professor snape for three years and he paid you do i look like a person who does something for free draco implied with one raised eyebrow certainly not and what was your tariff oooo here is the most interesting part the more attempts i spend on one potion the less my pay was his highest praise was that if i had gone in the same mode he would have become bankrupt soon draco said with a chuckle in the end but when i remember the wedding budget i wasntthat good after all yes the wedding was really fabulous hermione added dreamily probably picturing her own wedding day yeh it was really cool when gin made two potions at once fred remarked with pride two common fred it is pathetic comparing me to draco ginny said bursting into laughing how much is it now draco he said something but too softly for anybody to hear i donthear you ginny said in a sing song voice nine draco replied a bit louder nine holly gryffindor ron yelled falling into the water sending splashes all over everybody hey that unfair water war harry yelled and made a huge wave with his hand i ll give you a wave draco exclaimed and dived when he surfaced a little tidal wave covered the swimming pool occupants draco jumped out of the pool landing near the cabins the big wave was caused by draco doubling in size after transforming into a tiger when everyone came around a bit from the deafening wave they were met with another shower of splashes coming from the shaking down tiger draco you naughty tiger you made us all wet ginny shouted in mock reproach but she was clearly having the time of her life the young people continued to splash and play around in the pool relaxing not only after a hard day or even month but from all their school years full of fear and uncertainty when the sun set down and it became chilly outside they moved to the living room where the fireplace roared with warm flames and dinner was served i ve never thought you could be such a good host draco hermione remarked taking a seat on a fluffy couch the food looks delicious anyway ron said eyeing the plates around him drools almost dropping onto the table when everyone got a seat and a plate draco stood up and addressed his guests thank you all for coming here tonight as you remember tomorrow i will leave that why i want to give you something to remember me by you are hard to forget ron muttered i have some presents for you draco levitated one of his trunks to set in front of him and opened it here are very valuable volumes of the malfoy manor library and i want you to have them i tried to choose the book to match a personality of each of you so let see how it will turn out he took out seven books in similar covers and handed them to hermione she almost dropped them not only because of their heaviness but because of shock and excitement this encyclopedia of magic the last edition it is priceless she whispered tracing the books borders and still not believing they were hers fred and george got books on various hexes and undetectable charms when draco took out a book with a bright orange cover ron yelped and jumped from his seat you cantsay it is what i think it is and what do you think it is draco asked with a cheshire cat grin the full history and the full biographies of every member of the chudley cannons but it was washed away in the first day it appeared in the bookstores ron wept remembering his depression when he realized that he would ve never have that book draco slowly turned the book over so the title was visible ron just stared at it what are looking at take it it yours ron took the book with shaking hands and pressed to his chest like a baby here is another one draco continued about auror training ron accepted it and not a word was heard from him for at least half an hour and you draco said turning to harry you were so eager to torture me for these books but i am giving them to you willingly they are my dragon fang text books i hope you ll find the lost pleasure of torturing me in reading them there is also my journal of colors as i called it can come in handy sometimes harry looked through a note book with leather cover betrayal jealousy deception treachery lies confusion hesitation plotting hate desperation hm could be really interesting the list continued with every negative feeling possible but no good emotion was mentioned the very last entry was rounded a few times love bright white light these books also serve the purpose of proof draco said giving ginny two ancient looking books ginny looked at the titles and couldntbelieve her eyes even when you explained everything i still thought it was impossible but these books what is so fabulous about them harry asked peeping from above her shoulder look yourself how to learn to hiss if you are not born with it and how to give your animagus form a special talent harry read out loud but that impossible how can you learn parseltongue from a book why are you so sure draco hissed in parseltongue right away we established you believed your eyes what about ears do you trust them also leaving harry bewildered to comprehend draco neared the trunk to finish his handing out his presents i want you all also to accept these he gestured to the small box with tiny house elves they can make your life a lot easier believe me will you provide them with homes and work to do i am asking because as former master i must be certain of their well being in the future those are the rules of course we will do everything for them to be comfortable hermione agreed this is it then the elves were taken from the box and returned to their normal size pairs to the right singles to the left the elves moved leaving two couples on the right and eight singles on the left hm i thought there were only two families including one that works for me start to fool around when master leaves you naughty elves hm ok danny and abby you go to ron and hermione consider it an early wedding present the future newlywed blushed the weasley red dinky goes to harry gardy is for george and folly for fred goggy is for both of you for your shop fred and george winked in understanding others are going under your guidance virgie mine but there are so many of them ginny exclaimed looking at more than a dozen big eyes staring at her only temporarily two of them the winkass aka winky and cassy i want to give to your parents they are also a family and cantbe separated other singles are going to your remained brothers and one for yourself as everything you see around you you mean the house the house is mine ginny stammered draco nodded but i canttake it it is not just some flowers or candy it brings a lot of responsibilities and i wontbe able draco silenced her placing a finger on her lips it will be yours sooner a later i am letting you get used to it common gin think of what parties we can arrange here george persuaded what are you talking about george you have only fun on your mind it is draco property i think you have enough places to ravage havoc hermione scowled now what are you talking about hermione we and chaos are completely incompatible fred objected with look of pure innocence i am sorry to interrupt your heated argument about my property but i just want to mention that only virginia has the key and only with her presence can anybody enter malfoy heaven party time is only allowed for family members on conditions of appropriate behavior of course draco settled the problem well if you are so eager to be part of our family then i think it reasonable to know where exactly the residence of our future brother in law is located ron inquired well if you are so anxious to know we are in pixies forest killegan is two miles on the south and one mile to the west is ottery st catchpole why so shocked faces we are still in england not somewhere in brazil the borrow ginny uttered huh the borrow is located at st catchpole harry explained then i can walk you home today draco only reaction was they left the house and started to walk a narrow but straight path through the woods draco went first leading the way with ginny beside him i dontknow how i will cope with your departure she said with a sigh they ve spent a day full of amusement but the dreadful minute was near now and ginny couldntjust ignore it i dontknow either draco whispered back but i am not falling from the surface of the earth we still can write to each other but you yourself know that it will be just a petite resemblance of a conversation ginny said hopelessly but i will be back three years is a long time draco my life can take twists i donteven imagine or could predict draco tensed but his voice remained even i made some modifications to the ring if you feel that you dontlove me anymore or dontwant to unite your life with mine just take it off and throw it into the fire i ll be immediately notified and i wontever return oh draco of course i ll wait for you my love will always be only with you alone i canttake anything second best she finished with wry smile so i am the best ha draco asked smugly his worries disappearing at least for awhile he didntwant to let himself think that such a long wait could make ginny forget him and find somebody else as for himself he was certain that virginia was and would be the only woman in his life only she could awaken such a feeling in him that nobody else could manage he was sure that life without her would be lifeless for him still he was leaving her and it hurt him more and more with every second what was that part of your mind you defended so strongly ginny asked changing the topic draco smiled when you were away i had trouble with sleeping because every night i dreamed of you of us all those dreams were stored in my mind they are my most precious part of it the column soon reached the borrow the twins headed straight to the house catching a smell of apple pies in the air harry stretched out his hand for draco good luck with your studies you were a good teacher you were a good student draco responded giving him a firm handshake you d better return or you ll stay there without some body parts the weasley brothers will keep sure of that ron said in his turn for a farewell still he shook draco hand more confidently than he did at the ball after hermione words of encouragement and good byes the dream team disappeared in the house leaving draco and ginny alone when exactly are you leaving ginny whispered afraid that if she spoke louder he would disappear as a dream as soon as you release my hand draco answered pointing at his right hand squeezed by ginny so hard that it turned white then maybe i should glue my hand to yours she proposed in a shaking tone i must go there it is the token to our future together draco tried to reason with her but knew himself it wontlessen the hardness of the parting i know i know my mind agrees with you but my heart wants just to kiss you senseless and never let go she shook her head attempting to hide her tears at least our hearts understand each other draco said softly and tilted his head down locking his lips to hers this kiss wasntas desperate as the one before draco imprisonment but it was still intense and passionate each of them tried to show their immense feelings to the other through that kiss draco embraced her one last time remembering how perfectly her body fitted against his and a traitorous fear went down his cheek no matter how long i am gone i will be back with these last words draco disapparated a n the question of the chapter why did draco show to the others his houses or more specifically malfoy manor and why did he answer all the questions so frankly thanks to all my fair reviewers who still stay with me and sorry for such a big delay with this chapter frankly speaking it was written more than two months ago very important a n i read in several fics that in real time the dream team and draco finished school in 1998 so i ll be using this year as a starting point the following letters will be organized chronologically for you to understand the order of the events they are only a selection from a whole bunch of letters chapter forty three everything is still the same september 1998 dear virginia here is my first letter to you how are you doing i have started my first year of study and it is pretty tough already the academy itself is situated in the swiss alphas so it is quite cold here but as you know i am used to it so it doesntbother me in the least but my classmates are not so lucky as i understood the academy in switzerland is a center of high education at least for the whole of europe if not the world there are six of us here one from italy one from africa one from france one from russia one more from poland and me from scotland no females among us probably the feature of the profession pity the place itself is at least three times larger than hogwarts everyone is running somewhere minding their and only their business i found out an interesting fact that there is a charm on the hallways so nobody could collide with one another so how is your final year going wishing successful studying draco p s how are the others dear draco i was so glad when i received your letter i am fine and the others are fine also harry and ron went into auror training and hermione is studying to be a lawyer i feel a bit lonely here without them of course i have della and colin but it is different as you probably remember yourself we are buried under assignments for advanced courses from the first day the main problem is that the library is still in disorder frankly speaking it is a complete mess so nobody can find anything there the headmaster asked me to help with restoration due to my past experience it is a very exciting work takes a lot of my time though hard working and a bit lonely virginia october 1998 hello draco i am writing to you during the halloween feast you are probably wondering why i am writing instead of eating various delicious food well actually i am in the hospital wing with a broken ankle just fell from a ladder in the library the other day i know it is nothing serious and i will be released tomorrow but why should i stay here when everybody else is partying in the great hall a group of first and second years decided to have a real treat or tricking making the teacher mute when they entered they were all dressed up so nobody especially the professors could recognize them i heard they emptied the sweets supply of the whole school even mine of course i gave them some of the twins candy so maybe i am lucky to get rid of them but still do you have a halloween party there feeling empty without candy virginia november 1998 dear virginia i am sorry about your broken ankle should be more careful and not make me more worried about you than i am already there is no tradition of celebrating halloween here so i spent that night preparing for an exam i really lack your research help now i found another way to find the needed materials but it is different without you unpleasantly different how are father and macbeth still teaching they are not hard on you i hope preparing for exam draco p s in the box is something that will fill your emptiness dear draco you are so sweet but you are not as sweet as the chocolate you sent me it was sooo yummy della supposed it was made from the magic itself we almost ate it all at once but then i remembered what would be the consequences and left the other half for some other time i still cantunderstand how my brothers stomachs work till today after they stuffed them with so much food anyway professors snapes as i call them are teaching at full swing and i heard that marriage hasntchanged snape teaching style one bit i am writing that i heard it because i am not taking potions this year of course i really wanted to study them this year also but professor snape suggested to me to pass the n e w t exam a month ago because he was sure i knew everything i needed for it already and then he added you know like he does it like nothing important that he d give me an outstanding anyway as a regard for being his assistant isnthe sweet ok he isntbut i still have an outstanding for potions i really earned it for working with such a partner like you yack what a disaster but we can make great things together can we not as for macbeth she insisted on my calling her that she said she didntsee any reason for her to stop teaching married or not you canteven imagine what a rumors bomb exploded when macbeth asked the students to call her professor snape firstly they thought she had gone mad but when the true reason came out it was like mass shock the snapes both insisted on not taking in any sign how to differ them from each other they must be taking all the fun from the situation that all for now with love virgie p s will you come to the burrow on christmas holidays december 1998 dear virginia unfortunately i cantvisit you on christmas because i have an exams session and the area isntthat easy to apparate from you will find my present under your christmas tree love draco december still 1998 christmas eve everyone is supposed to be happy and cheerful i can t the golden watch is absolutely fantastic but i wish more just for a glimpse of you as a christmas present just to hear your voice to look into your eyes just for a moment and i ll be happy the whole upcoming year but you are not here and i am not happy harry ron and hermione are staying in the burrow for the holidays they found time to be here why cantyou january 1999 dear virginia i am sorry i am sorry for your unhappiness i am not skipping from joy either the separation from you is even harder than exams but i am living knowing that one wonderful day i ll embrace you and never let go with love draco p s please honor this paper with your kiss maybe it will cheer you up a bit draco what is it with you letters kissing back are you a pervert or something it can turn into an addiction whatever you done to that paper i absolutely love it can all your letters be like this one kissing hungry virgie february 1999 dear virgie i am very glad you found my little trick useful the other day i looked through a window and saw the rising sun it was the most beautiful sight i ve ever seen it reminded me of you i heard your contagious laugh in my head i wish i could make a joke to you and hear it one more time i absolutely forgot that you were still on the quiddich team had they made you the captain this year if not they really should but i still hope the slytherin team has the chance at last after harry potter they greatest seeker of all times graduated if there is a team that is wishing to laugh with you draco hi draco thank you for the flowers you d sent me on my birthday i ve never thought that i d see real edelweisses in my life such lovely flowers i hope you didntfreeze your pretty arse off collecting them in the mountains the quiddich opened in hogwarts as usual in the beginning if november i wasntchosen as a captain but i still play a significant role in the team despite the fact that i spend more time in the library than practice and here is some really good news for you the slytherin table is full again the aurors found all the children somewhere in africa as i heard unfortunately there are no seventh years because the sixth years werentfound you know why everybody was obliviated not to remember not only the knowledge they received during the training but also to forget the horrors they ve seen so to your joy there is slytherin quiddich team and they are quite a competition i might add they are led by some forth year and he surely knows what he is doing our captain is roland lester a sixth year beater he is pretty good but that blasted forth year so here is the last news so far virgie march 1999 dear virgie i am sorry for your tough quiddich season this year but i am really happy for the slytherins not only due to being one of them but also because nobody can be deprived from one childhood to be turned into a monster in the very beginning of one life does the forth year who makes your quiddich team miserable happen to be perry wilson the boy who followed me around like a puppy when i became the quiddich captain he is a quick learner then but i will tell you nothing about what i told him donteven ask it is a professional secret i wish you to reach the quaffle first every time with love draco hey to you too and that little prat is really perry wilson you know i am afraid of him a bit now i watched the match between slytherin and hufflepuff and they practically crushed them slytherins i mean but that is just daily matter something now vitally important but the date of your arrival is something to look forward to thus when is this glorious day my graduation is in less then three months i am sure you ll be there waiting fir you ginny june 1999 now where the hell were you graduation happens only once in anyone life it wasntjust a date which could be rescheduled and you were not there that was a very serious mistake just yesterday i played with the ring given by you and thought it didntlook good on me maybe i could reconsider my thought but it need a lot of convincing on your part draco a howler that it what are you doing dammit are you really sure that you are studying and not making out with some chick on the beach and dontgive me this bullshit that you cantapparate or leave any other way it is school not bloody prison hi we haventbeen introduced to each other but i am della chatter ginny friend from school i decided to write to you because i think the situation is getting very serious malfoy ginny partly stays at hogwarts for summer to reconstruct the library but we still hang out a lot and the thing is that she is angry very angry at you she doesntsuffer from longing to see you or well you know she is fuming and you know you deserve it today i noticed she wasntwearing your ring but she d never taken it off before even in showers i can tell you you are in big trouble draco malfoy huge trouble messing with weasley temper wontdo you any good you must work something out or your relationship is destined to be ruined best regards della july 1999 father i failed i failed half of my exams i failed to keep virginia love i failed my life it is completely pointless now i am sitting in my room late at night feeling her distress and angst towards be in her aura she has her reasons i admit that but i am trying so hard to shorten my staying here by taking first and second years courses together but all my studies can be frown out of the window if i know that i wasntbe welcomed with her embrace when i return i cantfight on both fronts simultaneously even if i know that she still has my ring even if she doesntwear it we are very young but giving her my family engagement ring wasnta silly mistake made by spontaneous decision i loved love and will love her forever but i ve lost all hope i am confused and scared for my sanity i dontknow what to do anymore your son draco ms weasley i am sorry for not having this conversation face to face due to urgent business but even in this form i hope to persuade you not to be so hard on draco he is living through harsh times now he is working very hard to gain a place in society and he is alone in a completely foreign country with no familiar face beside him i understand your position and agree with your arguments but you still should understand draco too not like his fianc e or lover but simply like his friend which i am sure you still are your friendship made draco do a lot of things that he wouldnthave done under other circumstances he is suffering as much as you are you both must find a compromise yours sincerely severus snape sos hermione i am writing to you because you are the most sensible of us all i dontknow what to do with draco he sends me letters every two days with apologies and love declarations but they are all just on paper he is still somewhere and not here i wish i could just speak to him that all i ask but he doesntlet me like he is hiding something i still dontknow what to do i decided to just wait to see what time will show wishing to not have such problems with ron ginny august 1999 harry harry wake up wake up it urgent huphmph dammit you harry wake up bloody hell ginny what are you doing in by bedroom at four in the morning oh harry i had nobody to go to it had been happening for almost three days it felt like life had been sucked out of me and then then tonight i felt a sudden urge to wake up and when i did i felt i felt that draco was he was dead oh ginny stop crying it is impossible why would he die and during the night no less it absurd and you said you had felt it oh i dontknow how to put it in words i just had a feeling of sudden emptiness inside me like i lost something precious to me and the next moment i knew he was dead ginny hysterics will get us nowhere i ll just check on his aura and we ll receive a confirmation of his well being harry you are white as a ghost is he is he he is alive thank merlin i thought i d die right away but he is quite near it he is hollow his soul is empty he has nothing to live for he doesntlook for anything to save him doesntask for help he gave up but he can t i am going to him what you donteven know how to get there remember what draco said on the train our beloved helped us to recover if he is not coming to me i am going to him academy of magic draco room and she disappeared in green flames the room she flooed in was almost completely dark the only source of light was a lamp on a table in the middle of the room draco was sitting behind said table writing something on a piece of parchment without enthusiasm he was hidden behind thick ancient looking volumes making him even more invisible in the motionless surroundings ginny was rooted to the spot by such a sight he neither heard me nor felt me coming odd he usually very sensitive to my presence ginny took a few steps towards the table but was still unseen by its occupant he looks so pale sickly pale what is he doing up in the middle of the night he is definitely ill he looks more like a zombie than a student ginny slowly moved a bit nearer to draco leaving not more than four feet between her and his back only then draco felt something was out of order after a few seconds he understood what exactly wasntright virginia he choked out why isnthe turning to face me and most importantly he doesntsound happy to see me not happy at all he is scared scared of what of me so he is cheating on me he got in so much trouble right now yes it is me i decided to play with the mountains and came here myself you are not jumping from joy as i see ginny remarked coldly virginia i draco began weakly but was instantly silenced what ginny blew up donttell me the story about building our future i dontlive in the future i am still in the present we are living in a material world and i am a material girl a n you all know where this phrase is from i dontbuild dream castles i want to sit with you at meals to wake up near you i want to bloody kiss you and not somewhere in the future but now and look at me damn you when i am talking to you i am sure you should and will reconsider the kissing part draco replied to her tirade icily repeating the tone she began with so you are disgusted with me now probably have found a bimbo chick for pleasing your needs draco was boiling inside why does she accuse me of this of all possible sins she doesntknow anything it is the other way around virginia i am a monster not you ginny was taken aback by such a turn of events she even lost her ability to talk for some time what are you talking about draco she whispered breathlessly staring at the back of his head draco turned to face her holy founders ginny exclaimed and would ve found herself on the floor the next moment but a chair was placed for her to fall onto what what happened an accident during an experiment in may can it be healed it was an experiment so nobody even i knows what caused it it is healing gradually i am not trying for nothing and you shouldnthave seen it he snapped in the end but draco i ginny stood there and couldntutter a word she just stared at draco face the lower half of which was covered with a burgundy mess that looked like a one big bruise a n wontelaborate on this part merlin i was so stupid why did i jump to conclusions so fast he was who he is malfoy he didntwant me to see him like this so i could pity him he wanted to work on it alone and come to me like nothing had happened and nobody would ve known that he had made a mistake he can be so stupid sometimes some things never change i am sorry draco ginny said with a guilty smile for what for accusing you of cheating on me of even thinking about it you are a girl what else would you have thought you mean you wouldntthink that i am socializing with other guys when i am on the other end of the world without you ginny asked with a frown you said yourself you didntwant anything second best draco said with a smug smirk which was clear even with his bruised lips ginny shook her head you are such a prat and always will be and i still dontknow what you are doing here in the middle of the night and what are you doing here in the middle of the night draco asked in return it was a spontaneous decision ginny explained hoping he wouldntpress further unfortunately i wasntup without a reason i still need a report to finish draco sighed and turned back to his table and the parchment he was working on when ginny arrived ginny moved her chair to stand beside his draco gave her a questioning look i didntcome just to yell at you if you cantthrow this blasted report into wall and spend some quality with your precious girlfriend then i can at least sit here for a while draco opened his mouth to say something but ginny made a dismissing gesture even if it is five in the morning she sat down and snuggled as close to him as possible the room was cold and draco wasntthat warm too but ginny managed to warm the both of them it was not only the heat she provided but care and love she watched as draco slowly moved his quill against the parchment the low speed was also caused by ginny whose presence was a pretty distraction to draco he often dreamed of her during the lonely nights in his empty room now just the smell of her hair made him dizzy he thought it was another dream but it was reality he felt every inch of her body pressed against his dammit it was distracting he just wanted to grab her and kiss her senseless and how could he be such a fool to not visit her earlier only now he understood how much he really longed for her presence her touch her warmth the reason why his bruise was healing so slowly was because his magic was very weak he hadntany strength for healing but now he felt almost happy with his little distraction beside him almost meaning that even after spending a whole night here she had to leave they sat for several hours in peaceful silence content by each others closeness when the sun started to rise ginny moved i need to go back draco till christmas noticing his attempt to object she silenced him with her hand till christmas or i will come again and drag you out of here she was near the fireplace already when she turned back to him will it hurt if i well say good bye to you she asked shyly draco smiled not without smugness you can try ginny returned and gave him the softest and the tenderest of kisses it was practically a brushing of her lips against his but it sent electrical sparks all over their bodies till christmas draco whispered till christmas ginny disappeared in the green flames the bruise healed in nine days september 1999 dear draco back to this unemotional way of communication you can congratulate me now because i was officially placed as hogwarts librarian the library itself is completely renovated of course we are still in the most ancient castle in england but dumbledore decided to bring some modern trends in on the design well you ll see for yourself when you come all my n w are well done so my parents congratulate me to no end eager for congratulations virginia hello to you too i am really happy for you congratulations from the deepest part of my heart hogwarts will have the prettiest librarian ever and no flirting for you with deepest love draco october 1999 dear draco i was given the honorable task to inform you of the greatest news of the year macbeth is pregnant you will have a brother macbeth confirmed to dumbledore that she would continue teaching no matter what of course the amount of dark magic will be reduced to the minimum because it can harm the baby you should ve seen snape the other week i was told that he assigned no homework for a week to all the houses for everybody to celebrate with him celebrating virgie dear virginia i donteven have any words to express how happy i am for father and macbeth in turn i have some interesting news for you too i received a letter from harry the other day where he is asking me for a permission to teach dragon fang to his fellow aurors surprising isntit not the letter or permission asking but the very fact that somebody else wants to learn dragon fang technique i cantsay that i pity the guys under his supervision because he wouldntever be as horrible as me because he is a gryffindor and all interesting how he will control more than one aura well it his problem not mine i hope you behave well if not no kissing letters for you wholly yours draco november 1999 hi there far away i heard a bit about harry and his teaching experience so far nothing exact but i am sure that ron was quite eager to participate speaking of ron his and hermione wedding is in june and if you wontreceive an official invitation i ll drag you into it as my date so donthave any plans set in june as for the reason all are so anxious to learn the dragon fang and there are many i saw the lists is that they want to know how voldemort was defeated because now they know it wasntsome special talent only harry possessed by the way when did you decide to call him harry you were quite reluctant to switch to his first name if i remember right busy with wedding plans virginia dear virginia hm june let me think of it maybe just maybe i will be free but who knows but when i think about you dragging me somewhere brrrr i dontlike the sight so i may join you for the wedding then where the world is going harry potter will make other harry potters and without a woman no less when the world will again be in danger then we just whistle and potter army will come and destroy all the bad guys what a terrific idea and nobody will ever know that voldemort was destroyed by love and slytherin attitude what an irony but it is their choice not mine isntit the whole progress still interests me though and to answer your question about me calling harry harry then prison gives a lot of time to think about things counting days till christmas your draco may 2001 draco walked through the large oak doors the usual silence of the library greeted him luckily for him it was deserted the only figure he was interested in was sitting behind a large table with lots of drawers around her what can three years do to a girl first of all they can change her into a woman and what a woman she was fiery wavy flammable hair developed curves in the right places long legs and brandy colored eyes that could make you drunk from the intensity if her gaze unfortunately right now draco couldntfeel the pleasure of locking his eyes to hers because she was very busy writing something her face was completely covered with her hair waves draco stepped closer to the table is there some particular book you require ginny asked noticing a presence nearby and thinking it was another student yes i would like potions discoveries through history draco drawled right away ginny stood up and hurried to the potions section then stopped in her tracks nobody has requested this book before i was only in the laboratory library and only draco and i knew draco she squealed and jumped on him kissing him into oblivion they would ve caused another library renovation starting a domino effect of the shelves because they were using them for support the wall would ve been much more effective but it wasntthere when needed but it was saved by some fourth year yelling get a room which brought draco and ginny to their senses what are you doing here ginny asked astonished still holding tightly onto draco neck what you dontwant me here draco asked in return with a hurt expression i mean you wrote to me that you d decided to continue your studying to receive the master degree in potions have you taken a holiday between two degrees or what because you dontusually come in may well draco drawled firstly i want to ask when you finish because i have a plan to kidnap you and bring you to the three broomsticks for a real date because i came to a terrifying conclusion that we haventgone on a date once you mean you are asking me out ginny said even more surprised yes and you have three seconds to decide because otherwise i ll drag you out of here the last part was whispered huskily into ginny ear drag that will be a sight ginny stammered not understanding what his tone meant your time is up miss weasley draco whispered sending shivers of fear and excitement up her spine what is he up to her question was answered when draco took her onto his arms bride style and headed to the main doors and straight to hogsmeade draco i can walk you know ginny protested with a pout half way to the village donteven say that you dontlike this means of transportation or you ll go down down down right onto the ground you dontwant to ruin your spectacular outfit do you spectacular outfit well on such terms i can bear some dragging they entered the pub in the same fashion draco released her only on the stool in one of the secluded corners of the pub after their orders were taken and brought ginny returned to their earlier conversation so will you explain your sudden appearance you fall on me from clear sky no notice no warning no anything i am not even dressed properly you cantdo such a thing draco i am very sorry draco really looked sorry it was a spontaneous decision i ve received my diploma and apparated right away i brought some news to the school too by the way oh really what could that be professors snapes wontbe teaching at hogwarts any longer what why what happened ginny almost choked on her butterbeer when he broke out the news well as you remember i said there had been a great loss for science when father hadntpublished his research on multiple poisons presence in one body i talked him into defending his thesis with mine as a result he was invited to teach at the academy of magic draco said with pride and great respect for professor snape the whole family will stay at switzerland from now on have you seen victor isnthe a cutie ginny asked with a dreamy look well yes he is interesting interesting strange opinion about a baby i have never seen the magical aura of an infant so it was education in a way you are always so serious draco i think he is cute even if he inherited most of his father looks our children wonthave such problems their inheritance will be perfect on both sides draco remarked with a smirk malfoys always care about appearances dontthey ginny uttered a bit coldly not liking his attitude towards children her tone made him change in the face sorry i didntmean to say it like that i just haventseen babies in my life of course i see how happy father and macbeth are because of him i just cantawake such feelings in me yet i am sure this child will give them a lot of headaches though that i know for sure draco finished with a distant glance i really dontwant to know how you know that because i have a lot of on my own shoulders already i ve never thought that hogwarts library was so hard to maintain but i still manage it somehow what are you going to do now isntit obvious draco asked with impish eyes playing with the ring on her finger ginny blushed she completely forgot they werentmarried yet because she already felt like an old married couple but what about the future you were so worried about she asked softly right now you are talking to professor malfoy potions master of hogwarts master but you said it took five years to gain the se i rushed things a bit oh draco she embraced him tightly so you wontleave me again she asked wish glistening tears of joy never ever again all right everyone gather in a circle ok now calm your breathing and relax concentrate your mind on a blue quill picture it in every detail now slowly open your eyes still having that quill in mind on his command twenty men started to open their eyelids their reactions were different some hissed in pain some stood like nothing happened white eyes instead of average some just blinked rapidly and couldntget the picture straight now that we cleared out who can and who can not use vision with open eyes we can design different learning programs for each group harry proceeded in a lecture tone are you sure came a soft but confident voice in harry head if his reaction had been called surprised it was a huge underestimation he almost jumped but decided to ignore it and to go on with his class it was a way to find out this ability in each of you i thought it wouldntbe appropriate to use the way my teacher applied for me what was it one of the students asked harry chuckled he nudged me forward so i opened my eyes from pure surprise from his gesture where is your teacher now professor potter harry shuddered he hated to be called that some of his students were twice as old as he but they still treated him like their superior their teacher their commander well let see harry concentrated on an image of draco malfoy and started to feel the familiar pull when draco face appeared nose to nose to his and even winked at him he is here harry breathed out the door slammed open and draco malfoy himself appeared in the doorway and marched to harry side his robes billowing behind him gorgeous as always when draco reached him harry muttered always make a grand entrance dontyou why not especially if it is waited from you draco muttered back and bowed ceremoniously to the gaping gathering meet my dragon fang teacher draco malfoy harry announced with mock respect why thank you harry you ll always be a student to me draco said with the same irony what is the reason of my receiving such an honor as your presence in my class nothing much decided to pay a visit to a friend after a long separation that all of course i also wanted to look at your students i dontsee ron here he must be in the advanced class isnthe draco replied eyeing the group and then frowning instantly harry jaw fell onto the floor not from draco words from the tone he said them with like he really missed harry and really was interested in his students progress while harry was thinking over assumptions about draco draco frown deepened and he spat in disbelief a circle are you that dumb haventi taught you anything he turned to the students do you often stand in a circle like this during your lessons the asked nodded simultaneously rooted to the spot by draco demanding tone and rude attitude towards harry draco turned back to harry do you want me to correct your mistake or will you figure it out on your own well if you so kindly noticed it then you should correct it harry said smugly but in his brain he frantically searched for the possible mistakes draco started to move around placing everyone in different places of the room some in pairs some in corners one man was left completely alone in a corner with no one nearer six feet okaay remember those places they are your permanent training places no moving even an inch and then harry groaned got it didntyou draco asked harry with a knowing smirk another thing harry hated when draco knew something he didn t or more closely when draco knew everything class dismissed draco waved with his hand excuse me someone from the group began hesitantly could you please show us something draco laughed eager for some tricks erh and donteven think about mind games harry we dontwant to scare off your students do we draco said conversationally harry gave him a you are so full of it look with the very question he scared them worse was that harry knew it but the worst thing was that harry knew that draco knew it but harry also understood that malfoy was fooling around meaning he was in a good mood but what is that suppose to mean if you are so anxious i would like to show you my new trick called the searching thought but we need to go to the library for the demonstration the students as one headed to the door draco and harry followed them you know when i came here draco continued the conversation with ashamed harry i wanted to find the way in which you manage to control power of several people i ve never thought there would be so many of them but back to the topic you found a way to be a gryffindor once again harry snorted you put them in a circle so their power was equal at close proximity their auras united but not united as you wanted crushed into each other of course you could control everybody when only one stream of power was coming to you from the circle but they are all different dammit it is a conception of power you canthave all of it but at the same time you canthave as much as any other person even as close as a sibling draco sighed they are in your care treat them according to their differences you cantplay with power at that point after draco lecture they reached the library of the ministry of magic here not only a copy of every published book in the wizarding england was kept but all the statistic reports the group stepped into the library with draco facing them quick but mind tiring way of research for example i want information on the variety of horns added into healing potions with no movement of even a finger a stack of no less than a hundred books appeared on the table in front of draco in a strangely monotone voice draco continued right now my mind is going through the content of these books discarding a book flew away irrelevant sources in this case i working with magic hidden in words it allows me to store information here and there for further research even in useless books in my current searching the process went on and on until only nine books were left these are the most useful books on the subject you can check them for the proof i ve never thought there are so many books on horns and most of them rubbish brrr draco commented massaging his temple donttry it until you are in advanced class class dismissed while excited students fussed over books harry met draco eyes impatiently tapping his foot you just had to do it didntyou he drawled what are you talking about draco the picture of innocence asked in return well it is my class and you dismissed it twice it is a habit and on the other hand i couldnthelp it draco smiled wryly cafeteria isntit too public for what i am not going to spit out my darkest secrets to you draco already started to go to the direction of the cafeteria harry rolled his eyes and followed after taking a seat and ordering a tea and a butterbeer for draco and himself respectfully harry began the conversation so what are you really doing here i told you already i wanted to see how you handle the training have i passed harry asked with sarcasm dripping even from his glass you can do better but it is quite satisfactory still i ll wait a bit before giving you one student i would like you to train she needs special attention she but you and the books said no woman possessed the vision well seems to be there is an exception in every rule comes from the long pureblooded family line probably and we are talking about virginia of course ginny harry gaped are you sure absolutely you know yourself that she feels my emotions she managed to concentrate her love in her hands i didntgive it much of a thought at that time but on the train i checked her neck the vision eyes are right there there is no doubt why dontyou teach her yourself then it would be pure torture too much distraction she only needs the basics somewhere until the sixth level and i am good enough to do it harry snarled basics nmpth there are only fifteen levels who told you that have you forgotten self improvement you can increase your level any time like you with your mind searching harry mocked you can say so then check this out harry winked and one of his eyes turned white but the other remained ordinary green i called it wink impressive draco sounded really impressed you can see a lot like this yeh what did you say about ron when you entered the class how did you know he was in an advanced group already he is very powerful and at last got his brains in the right place so it isntthat surprising you bragged for so many years about them being the blood traitors and now you are talking on and on about how powerful their family is saying this you of course know exactly what blood traitor means come to think of it harry never thought about it he knew it was somehow connected with tolerating muggles but was there any deeper meaning harry thoughtful expression gave a negative answer to draco so he elaborated on the topic pureblooded wizards are considered to be blood traitors when they waste their magic on muggles and not use it for their clan benefit if the weasleys are so interested in muggle world it doesntmake them less powerful or their magic weaker i am sure all the weasley men can be your students well the twins are making really fast progress harry only said i dontknow when you or virginia will be ready for the training maybe after the first child is more suitable child what child ginny is pregnant no but i am working on it draco sounded very full of himself but you are to marry her yes the wedding is in three months and you must still keep your promise what promise you lost so you are my best man for the wedding quite a lot of work to do believe me i am talking from experience so what are you gonna do after the wedding live in the heaven of yours harry asked referring to draco house only during summers probably i ll teach at hogwarts from now on oh no no no how could that happen harry wailed i will have to see your face every day when this is all over i will certainly be placed into st mungos well macbeth will surely faint when she finds out that her precious place was given to harry potter and by the way forget about st mungos the end is too far way it only the beginning a n i am very sorry it took me so long to post this one last chapter i was carried away by my new story and just couldntfinish writing this one disclaimer i have no ownership of the characters and insignia of harry potter and everything connected to the hp series dedicated to my fair beta reader and friend stephanie epilogue the family reunion 15 years later arthur dear are you sure you checked the unbreakable charms on the vases of course dear three times arthur weasley replied rolling his eyes the same thing every year why are you so worked up molly it happens every year and the house is still standing miraculously only do you remember what happened when it was the twins birthday i felt the house would collapse any moment there were too many fireworks and joyful goodies for my liking molly weasley finished with a frown but the children were so excited and happy about it arthur protested the twins were too so many innocent guinea pigs for their experiments they will never grow up even with children of their own dontbe so hard on them molly it is in their very being and i ve always wondered where did they get it from molly gave him a piercing look well molly you yourself werentan angel when you were young remember what you did at hogwarts hm and what are you implying arthur weasley she asked advancing on him with a dangerous looking pan well you know gryffindor pranks and kicking slytherins asses whose asses i ll kick yours right now if you dontelaborate on your previous statement now now molly we dontwant you to smash something with that pan do we the guests will be arriving soon and the table isntset yet the expression on molly face instantly turned from rage to panic and she rushed outside to check on the big family tables as they called them uuuuh that was close arthur breathed out and went to check on the sofas and spells on them to prevent anyone falling on the floor you are probably wondering what the commotion is about it is about an annual tradition that was established after everybody settled down or in other words when the borrow became empty the only remaining inhabitants were molly arthur and two house elves that is why molly decided to arrange an annual family reunion at the borrow it wasnta brand new idea of course because the weasleys always gathered on christmas and new year holidays but other celebrations were missed by all members of the family it was absolutely impossible to gather on every birthday especially for bill and charlie or percy who moved to france after his marriage the peculiarity of the meetings was the following the date moved from year to year it was also a birthday of a grown up family member the rules were that no matter when and no matter where you are you must attend or suffer the consequences and knowing mrs weasley it was a risky dare the only family that got the privilege not to attend every reunion was the snapes due to their tough working schedule and far location they only came on very important occasions important for them mostly like ginny birthday celebration or anniversaries they awaited that year too because it was the tenth year of the family gatherings another special feature of the reunion was that not only strictly family members but all family friends could come that why the snapes were being invited in the first place the lupins visited quite often and even dumbledore paid a visit once in a while but let not rush things every guest will tell his or hers story of life on their own the flames turned green and charlie weasley stepped put of the fireplace he hadntchanged much over the years the same long ponytail and an earring were still in place charlie usually came among the first because he didntneed to gather children together or wait for everybody to get ready he remained a bachelor and was very happy about that the twins always joked about the fact saying he must have secretly married his dragon priscilla which charlie was very fond of and that why he hadnttaken any woman to be his wife i return that charlie said that to have a dragon for a wife was much better than a woman and especially a redhead and speaking of redheads the fireplace lit again and a redheaded community appeared they called themselves the true weasleys being all with red hair those weasleys were fred and george with their twin sisters for wives izabella and elizabeth respectfully both families were blessed i dontthink others were blessed also with their own twins fred and izabella boys were born two months earlier before george and elizabeth s the four redheads were even worse than the marauders and even their fathers hogwarts hasntever been so close to destruction after the weasley quartet was enrolled in the portkey way appeared the black family which consisted of the boy who won the french white lily two small beauties and one beast namely the potters even before the nickname stuck harry really considered taking sirius last name not only to prevent publicity harassment on his family but to honor the man who had become a father he never had especially after his return sirius also accompanied harry and his family not having one of his own he decided to remain single due to his past and just wanting to be free in choice of his ways of life that still wasntstopping him from dating various women especially in france where nobody knew him france was mentioned because stephanie having french roots had a house there and the whole family made trips there from time to time especially on holidays harry potter ended up as a dada professor at hogwarts but he still taught dragon fang at the ministry the whole business became international after four years people from all over the world were coming to receive the knowledge about wandless magic his wife was mostly with the kids because three children were quite a pressure even without house work after the potters came percy and his family he was the last to marry mrs weasley lost hope already but surprisingly enough france again was involved specifically french ministry of magic where percy was delegated on some business trip when he didntreturn in time the english ministry of magic asked mr and mrs weasley about his whereabouts and molly owled him the answer she received made her faint there was only one sentence on the parchment i am getting married after a few pulled strings percy was transferred to the french ministry of magic where his wife michelle worked as the minister secretary and their children attended beauxbatons the lupins the were family came soon after their family was the smallest but the most tragic one they were very hesitant at first to have a child taking into consideration remus condition but after two years they decided to risk it thinking that a combination of a werewolf and a shape shifter would only be beneficial for the kid unfortunately they were very wrong that very mix was too hard for one body to handle and the baby died on the second month after a long mourning they adopted dazel who was beaten by a werewolf in his early childhood and grown up in an orphanage by his parents who needs a werewolf in a normal family it was a blessing for dazel to get out of there and to people who could understand him and his problem he was in ravenclaw as was harry eldest daughter josephine who knows who knows the dark family arrived straight after the lupins the nickname black was already taken so everybody decided to call the snapes that it quite fitted if you consider their pasts but if not they were all black haired after all professor snape potions immortalizer of academy of magic and his sons victor and abraham entered the household with dignity and pride as always macbeth rolled her eyes they like this game so much slytherins hmph then came the mediterranean family a k a bill and fleur with their two daughters the name came from their living locations fleur and the girls lived mostly on the southern cost of france and bill still worked in egypt with the pyramids the weekends were usually spent in between or more exactly on the yacht somewhere in the sea in this manner they visited all mediterranean countries and islands other children called cassiopeia and cassandra two chocolates because of their constant bronze skin color not to mention they were hot even without that tan that any girl dreams about they did have veela blood the only unaffected by their charms were their cousin christian percy son who everyone was constantly jealous of because only he could freely chat with the exotic blonds but enough about school romance the next family is coming through the fireplace the hogwarts family guess who they are i think you can easily count who was left out draco and ginny with their brood of five children with the very beginning of draco and ginny union the traditions of the malfoys clan began to be destroyed one by one the last one about the heir of the family vanished when ginny gave birth to two completely identical gorgeous blond boys tobias and domian making them both the next heirs of the malfoy family ginny remained the prettiest hogwarts librarian and having draco teaching potions the whole family lived at hogwarts not all the children were of age already to attend but they still helped their parents especially in the department of watching over detentions in the dungeons you think it was a blessing to the students who were put in detention none of that even if they were their cousins which happened a lot because there are weasleys and because there were so many of them at hogwarts at that time or brother and sister no scrutiny and feeling of obligation were for some interesting reason very high priorities for young malfoy children or draco paid them well for doing his work anyway it was very educational for the youngsters and they knew exactly what would happen if they got themselves in detention and the picture wasntall colorful last but not least came ron and hermione with their kids ron did everything to hold her back and hermione did everything against it because she hated to be late but there was a very important reason behind ron behavior hermione happened to be the birthday girl that year and that meant that everybody should gather at the borrow and only then they could enter to receive congratulations and presents birthday grown up played an important role in the weasleys family reunion from him or her depended the whole party from the season to decorations the season feature meant that if the date of the birthday happened to be in winter then it certainly needed respectful outdoor activities and the whole celebration was held indoors hermione birthday in april gave the opportunity to be outdoors the newcomers were met in the backyard of the borrow with cheers and clapping quite a lot of settings were tried out to contain all the people but the most optimum variant was found in the center of the clearing stood a square table occupied by the younger part of the family with a small fountain of punch in the middle it was surrounded from three sides by three long family tables it was easier to watch over the kids from such a sitting positions there wasntan established sitting order so everybody could sit with whomever they liked guess where the dream team sat together obviously oh here you are darling molly ushered hermione and ron we are all waiting for you yeh i am starving fred exclaimed yeh we have been saving our stomachs since the very morning gabriel a red headed boy supported his father boys boys molly quieted them you know the rules first presents then food the male part of the population of the gathering groaned mrs weasley was too good at cooking and everybody must ve followed gabriel example trying to save some room in their stomachs to put as much food there as possible ok hermione take your honorable place over there molly pointed to a big armchair probably made in the 18th century hermione sat on it and blushed she could stand without a flinch in front of a full court and the jury but was really shy when she became the center of attention the present giving was another traditional part of the family reunion there was no hidden meaning in the process all families gave their presents to the birthday grown up but there was an unspoken competition between the families about who could give a better present after several thankyou from hermione a pile of presents appeared on the table to her left an exotic necklace made of corals and sea shells from bill and fleur charlie perfume dragon breath it will made ron crazy my last girlfriend tried it on me so i am speaking from experience he commented to hermione molly book of recipes lupins book on werewolf legislation on the corner lay a middle sized piece of parchment it was the most treasured present by hermione so far the paper gave an unlimited access to the ministry storage of veritasetum to a lawyer like hermione such permission was priceless making a connection to who the present could be from veritaserum potions snape came to same conclusion perfect fred and george surprised everybody by bringing a huge box which revealed a home cinema hermione squealed like a little girl who received a long awaited doll the twins gave meaningful winks to the others meaning stuff it guys our present is the best next turn was for the french family a k a percy and michelle who made a pure french gesture giving hermione beaxbotons the history oh thank you soooo much i ve been searching for it for years hermione exclaimed lovingly tracing the cover of the ancient book crap we were outsmarted harry punched his palm and made an expression of one deeply wounded giving up already charlie asked harry whispering in his ear who are you to talk harry responded in the same quite tone you dontparticipate but i can bet who the winner will be charlie remarked full of mischief weasleys harry only muttered in return but there was no time to debate on the weasleys origin because it was harry turn to take the carpet here happy birthday herm harry said handing her yet another book i am lucky i ve bought another bookshelf the other day ron commented what is it is it some kind of joke hermione asked after reading the title are you so old that you cantread hermione harry asked with a chuckle i can read alright it says hogwarts the history her bewilderment was caused by the condition of the book it wasntancient or even old it was bright and shiny with golden patterns and a richly decorated cover with a look of mistrust she began to go through the fresh printed paper she knew the book by heart so there was no way harry could trick her still hermione eyes started to become wider and wider when she scanned the last pages of the book they are all here all our adventures are here she said softly with utter shock disbelief and finally pride adventures hah harry took the book from her hands and after finding the needed paragraph read aloud hermione granger can fairly be named the best head girl through the history of the school deserving this honorable title with her remarkable activity in the social life of hogwarts and unmatched striving for knowledge harry finished with the roars applause thank you so much harry hermione said in tears she was too overwhelmed by being mentioned in the history of the famous wizarding school harry high fived with ron and went back to charlie have you won yet draco and ginny haventpresented yet then we ll see draco and ginny were famous for their original and exquisite presents the female part of the family always voted for them as the best present givers because they seemed to know exactly what the women wanted and it distressed the weasley men to no end excuse us if our gift will take a lot of room probably a few bookshelves will be sacrificed but it is your choice draco introduced their present in a careless mode which always concentrated all attention on him after moving draco and ginny fingertips a small cylinder in draco hand unshrinked and unrolled revealing a carpet with a labyrinth of dots and words beside them looks quite familiar ron remarked only he and hermione had a full view of the carpet you better start from the bottom ginny suggested draco and ginny levitated the carpet a bit higher for the bottom to be more visible everybody was already gathered around the mysterious piece of tapestry to find out what it was hermione traced the last words ariadna harold stephan weasley look here are hermione granger and ron weasley and upper are my parents it is the grangers family tree holly heavens here are all my ancestors she exclaimed following the thin lines which connected one generation to the other they are not all here we cut out a few centuries here and there there wasntanybody remarkable there but you can open them any time draco began an explanative tour the grey dots are muggles the white squibs and the blue ones are wizards but there are more than a half of blue dots here bill pointed out that the point bill that the point draco said with a knowing smirk but that means that means ron started gaping between words that i am not a muggle born i am half blood hermione finished for him staring at the carpet in awe the last five generations were a mixture of squibs and muggles so they simply forgot there is a wizard blood in their clan the crucial part was played by your pureblooded grandfather who died early in muggle war but managed to leave a descendant that why you are a witch hermione draco explained and what do these small eyes beside the names mean those were the seers ginny pointed out the first one is quite remarkable draco and ginny moved the carpet downwards for everybody to see the very top of it seeing the large blue spot and the name beside it hermione fainted catching her into his arms ron asked dumbfounded what is it with her she is not pregnant is she molly asked in a mother hen mode no she isn t answered a choir of weasley men after a small commotion of bringing hermione back to the conscience world the party atmosphere was restored what was it all about george asked with a frown turning to draco and ginny they only gave him innocent but knowing smiles my very first ancestor is cassandra the seer hermione breathed out really everyone checked out the first spot on the carpet where cassandra name was clearly sewed in at least your predictions helped everybody to win the war harry mentioned and not the opposite the carpet was placed behind hermione armchair hanging in mid air the guys shot daggers at draco because it was clear who had won the competition of the best present again how do you do it draco fred cornered him after everybody took seats at the tables and finally began eating what do you mean draco asked conversationally you know what i mean presents selection fred grunted give a lady what she wants and she is yours haventyou heard of such a rule fred gave him an incredulous look but then it changed into a frown and hermione asked you to make her a clan tree no i just asked myself how a muggleborn can be a seer she is definitely a seer so she isnta muggleborn a few years of research and here you are i dontlike to have questions hanging without answers so with this time consuming research you just wanted to answer a question george cut in with a grin that clearly said he knew the real reason behind draco behavior draco clenched his teeth he hated to be embarrassed or get into situations that deflected his pride of course he couldnttell them that it was some sort of an apology for calling her mudblood all those years at school especially if she wasntone it was virgie idea smooth draco very smooth anyway you somehow managed to win the contest so the dinner is on us dontbother the end of the school year is nearing and so are o w l s and n e w t s and i need to prepare so save the reservations why do you think you ll win the next year george asked with challenge draco gave him don t i always look and returned to his meal after several toasts for hermione the weasleys older generation and the peace on earth another traditional toast should ve been raised old habits die hard but with harry and draco they died very hard they were the only ones that taught in hogwarts from all the present community apart from lupin who gave dada master classes from time to time so they were both vicious competitors for the award every year of course every professor of hogwarts participated in the so called elections of the best so sometimes neither draco nor harry were the winners but really who do you think has more chances small old flitwick or tall young and handsome draco or harry house preferences were strictly forbidden so the slytherins couldntvote for draco just because of him being their head of the house the same applied to harry and the gryffindors so who do we drink this year for arthur asked with a raised goblet he got the answer after seeing harry pissed off expression harry had won two years in a row trying to beat up draco record of three years but luck seemed to abandon him and draco won again that year i ve never thought that i would be considered a good teacher draco whispered to ginny nonsense you are natural remember when you were answering questions on the train trip to the manor they were listening to you as if hypnotized catching your every word you canthelp but dominate over your students show them authority but not of a tyrant but of a guide who knows the right way and they believe you respect you well it was far from that on my very first lesson when father was ill remember but you ve matured since that time and many things have changed still i ve caught a rumor that there is some kind of a challenge called malfoy twins detention heard of that draco gave her a look of total confusion never what is it about the rules are the following someone must get a detention in your class and serve it under our younger twins supervision if he or she survives it then this lucky student is praised by the house and prefects even dare to give house points for it every newcomer must go through it if he or she doesntdo it till their fourth year then they will be a shame of the house ginny said unbelievingly what insufferable kids we have darling draco only commented you think students willingly getting detentions is normal but it is so much fun especially if they dont get it and they try again and again and again disturbing the peaceful atmosphere in class he finished in a tone of a humble monk and you get pleasure out of it dontyou darling well it wasntmy idea draco said defensively probably one of your gryffindoric nieces and nephews or even more all of them dontplay a saint with me draco our tobias is also in gryffindor so it can still be your devious plot because i am soooo evil draco rolled his eyes in response by the way he got his detention on the second attempt i was really proud such a resourceful boy blew up half of the class literally but that could ve been dangerous ginny cried with horror nah there was a loooot of noise and smoke but nothing really explosive this is my son we are talking about i wonder how you didnthear anything in the library it was so loud after the super delicious dinner was consumed the tables disappeared and the opportunity to mingle appeared the whole gathering divided mainly into groups of men and women it was so funny when you all answered that hermione wasntpregnant bill said with a big grin he was the only one from the weasley brothers who hadntlearned dragon fang because he didnthave time and lived too far from england well it is kinda funny for a husband to know about his wife pregnancy before her ron responded donteven remind me of this painful experience draco said with a shudder spill it mate harry encouraged yeh what can it be about well ginny and i were married for a year already and i was taking some books from the library at home when i decided to check ginny aura and to my total surprise saw two spots inside her one could be a surprise but two was an utter shock so books flew everywhere being a gentleman i asked her if she had something to tell me she didnthave a clue what i was talking about after i informed her that we were having twins she bumped me on the head with a huge volume what for i promised not to look into her aura but how can i not do it i must check on the red fire from time to time a n guess what a red fire can mean the men nodded yes the red fire is very important i dontwant to spend any more nights on the couch for sure on the other end of the backyard went another animated conversation you just join us the next time you dontknow what you are missing sirius said to remus enthusiastically but sirius you do know that i only can be suitable for these activities during three days of the month and you any moment so what the date can easily be arranged even with my tough schedule just like the good old days open wild forest the moon lightning our path sounds of nature around you sirius was describing so poetically his hobby work hunting with rich aristocrats of europe hunting somehow gained back its popularity and who can hunt better than a dog with brains the other advantage besides beautiful scenery was the fact that the job was paid really well for but i m not just a dog sirius remus said with hesitation well a portion of wolfbane and you are as good as any other hunting dog even better you know that you are much stronger than an average dog and werewolves hunt is planned in two months what do you mean by that the ministry tries to keep a record of the existing werewolves so we hunt them down and mark them with a special substance no harm done but it is still a hunt remus sighed ok i ll think about it maybe i ll take dazel with me i still need to consult tonks about it all splendid remus just splendid the women decided to take a picnic under an old oak gathering in a circle on a comfy blanket so whose husband will we gossip about today tonks suggested eagerly the weasley women didnthave a lot of opportunities to meet all together so during such family reunions they talked about everything especially their husbands so what did ron get you for a present hermione izabella asked knitting something of a deep purple color she somehow inherited molly habit well he bought a two week trip to hawaii for two hermione replied with pride really that terrific when are you going in september i hope we ll get everything ready in time and knowing hermione she will start packing tomorrow ginny whispered to michelle who giggled the children were playing around in groups or pairs of exploding snap chess or any possible game in the wizarding world every kid was playing except for one he was sitting on a lonely chair staring into the horizon or was it just horizon so much joy and energy everything shines around her son the locks of such wonderful fiery color and eyes of crystal pools victor so much grace in every movement i wish i could just stand near her and bathe in the warmth she emits victor huh at last victor turned his head to acknowledge the presence at his father you wanted something well since i see my sons only three months a year so some talking wonthurt snape replied putting a chair by his son side of course father so how is school so far draco isnthard on you you are probably wondering why draco teaches victor when the snape live in switzerland the reason is victor heritage came mostly from his father side with the looks he got the talent of potions making and taking into consideration that it was quite a rare one it had to be dealt with special care after talking with various potions professors snape came to the conclusion that they were all amateurs and putting his sons under draco care would be much more efficient in this way both young snape ended up in hogwarts in slytherin house other women often complained that victor and abraham took too much after their father being slytherins and all but after a few years macbeth admitted that she herself had been in slytherin during her school years this fact was met with astonished looks from the weasley family and a knowing smirk from her husband school is fine everybody is a bit too giddy about the tournament but it is still the same old hogwarts how is the contest going extreme as always nothing crazy at least the third task is going through the forbidden forest at least half of it i think victor made a sideways glance in the direction of his previous gazing snape followed his look but wasntexactly pleased with the picture so who did you take to the yule ball cassiopea why her it was convenient two champions together she doesntknow anybody in hogwarts and i didntwant to search for anybody either it was settled in october already victor explained impassively i ve got an impression you preferred another candidate i cantget all i want victor said looking away from snape penetrating eyes next time take what you want and maybe you will get it but with no attempt it will pass you either way leaving victor to contemplate his words snape hurried over to his wife macbeth we have a problem what is it severus you forgot to finish some potion before we arrived here worse victor fancies the weasley girl which one there is like a dozen of them here ariadna ron weasley eldest daughters oh my this is definitely a problem at least he has an exquisite taste ariadna was called a wonder girl due to her appearance the children of molly and arthur couldnthave red headed kids of their own except for the twins and their red headed wives hermione being a seer knew that her first child would be born on ron birthday so she decided to make him a really good present after a bit of magic using a girl was born a girl with bushy red locks the problem with which snape seniors were faced was caused by victor reputation nobody even thought that victor snape would take a page out of draco book and become the heartbreaker of hogwarts he himself wasntespecially interested in the feminine population of the school but long curly black hair eagle black eyes and arrogant but witty attitude drew girls to him like a magnet he dated the most persistent ones but only once thus having no steady relationship and ron weasley was far from liking such a suitor for his daughter how time flies macbeth remarked with a sigh seems only yesterday i wondered how to overcome my curse never even dreaming about children and now i already must deal with the war which will certainly break out if victor looks at ariadna the wrong way seems so familiar history always repeats itself the clock hands neared six o clock and children started to run back and forth preparing for their favorite part of the reunion it quiddich time screamed harry weasley the biggest quiddich enthusiast the weasleys and quiddich were inseparable all the weasley and potter kids were officially allowed to fly from the age of ten but usually dads were teaching them at nine already the match was usually played on a big enough clearing in the nearby forest the game as always was quite spectacular even if not all the children that were of age participated in quiddich activities at hogwarts the game began and went the day began and went the year began and went nobody knows what will happen in another fifteen years maybe the national quiddich team of england will be formed only from weasleys maybe the rivalry between gryffindor and slytherin will finally disappear maybe another dark lord will rise nobody knows but till then everybody must live happily ever after happy end a n firstly because you still read this i want to say that i put a
