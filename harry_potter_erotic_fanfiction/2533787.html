result opposite to that which was planned or expected 2 to start a fire deliberately in order to check or stop the advance of a larger more dangerous one webster new universal unabridged dictionary broad tendencies in forest fires have long been known blazes accelerate amid evergreens but sputter in leafy stands they speed naturally downwind and uphill and grow fiercer and faster in the late afternoon than at night such truths have traditionally dictated firefighting tactics years of experience and research into fire behavior tell firefighters whether a particular blaze is likely to flare or fizzle to threaten a town or burn itself out harmlessly leaders must anticipate this and adjust their efforts like chess pieces to head off danger fires have many ways of starting deep in the woods where the light does not reach some small lifeless dried out vestige serves as the fuel all it takes is a bit of carelessness or worse some evil destructive purpose sometimes massive forest fires begin from ignorance or indifference sometimes they are the result of arson sometimes they are created by both this is the most dangerous fire where ignorance carelessness and denial are supplemented and exploited by an intense effort to wreak destruction as the fire spreads it leaves death and darkness even despair in its wake the colors of life of nature are vanquished in favor of the brittle black of carbon but the flora are not the only casualties fire consumes oxygen as it proceeds it steals away the very breath of any who get in its way it does not discriminate it kills man and woman young and old rich and poor weak and strong friend and foe it cares nothing for others it exists only for itself and it will survive as long as there is a path to conquer breath to steal room to spread but the world consists of more than just fire and potential fuel the earth houses more than merely existence and destruction there are forces that fight the fires whether it is the natural barriers of lakes and rocks or the sheer luck of rain pouring down at the right moment something has always halted the fires life has always prevailed in the end but in the meantime the greatest of these fires cannot be stopped before they wreak havoc before they take lives and destroy families one such fire was thought to be extinguished on halloween night 1981 but it had begun to burn again the thin man stepped out of the cauldron staring at harry and harry stared back into the face that had haunted his nightmares for three years whiter than a skull with wide livid scarlet eyes and a nose that was flat as a snake with slits for nostrils lord voldemort had risen again there is a third way after nature and luck that these awful fires can be defeated there is a grand muggle expression that directs us in desperate times to fight fire with fire so that is what we do a backfire is a smaller guided fire that while set purposefully by firefighters is no less powerful or dangerous than the fire it was created to stop wise and experienced firefighters know that starting a backfire can head off and contain a great blaze that otherwise defies nature and fortune a great fire that seems invincible that seems as though it will explode and blacken everything in its path but this fiery monster is forced to halt if it collides with a backfire if the position the power and the direction are just right the line of the backfire cannot be breached though it is smaller in size the death the darkness and the destruction will stop its ruthless progress the flames will be contained and then carefully put out by the firefighters cool and quiet will return and new life will emerge like a phoenix from the blackness and burning lighting a backfire is an art it must be set in the path of a moving fire near enough to be sucked in by the powerful draw of the main fire but distant enough to prevent damage to those creating it when the two fires collide the larger fire momentum is slowed by the lack of fuel in its path as well as slowing the advance of the main fire a backfire can help steer the greater blaze into a lake or river or clear smoke away to give firefighters a clear view of the target sealing the destruction of the angry flames so you see like with magic there is good fire and bad fire and as with magic the fires that are born of ignorance and evil can be met and conquered by those that are set with purpose and guided by compassion and justice you know of course that they have called this boy my downfall voldemort said softly his red eyes upon harry whose scar began to burn so fiercely that he almost screamed in agony you all know that on the night i lost my powers and my body i tried to kill him his mother died in the attempt to save him and unwittingly provided him with a protection i admit i had not foreseen i could not touch the boy voldemort raised on of his long white fingers and put it very close to harry cheek his mother left upon him the traces of her sacrifice this is old magic i should have remembered it i was foolish to overlook it but no matter i can touch him now and so we pick up our story now that this terrible conflagration has begun to burn again now that it has burst forth from where it was thought to be contained for thirteen years this is the second part of a tale of two extraordinary young women two women who never met who only had two things in common the fiery hair of the flames they represent and their love for a remarkable boy with green eyes and messy black hair the first woman the first backfire failed but because of her that heartless heinous blaze was contained just long enough for a new one to take her place now we return to a world that is once again slowly being engulfed by a horrible and familiar force that leaves only blackness in its wake and we see that this second backfire is about to ignite the love of a mother could only contain this evil the first time will the love of a lifetime be enough to extinguish it forever will the one with the power of the prophecy be able to fuel that love and with it douse the flames of evil in the end many thanks to j j o robert legit tronishere voided ginny 22 ennui eaf lilyep08 harryginnyfan23 and sludge for their great reviews and helpful comments hope you all and all thelurkers enjoy the chapter chapter 10 the aftermath ginny had staked out a spot on the floor at the end of the hallway that led from the stairs to the fifth year boys dormitory she was just out of sight of the common room but at the opposite end of the corridor from the door of the room in which nadine and andy had barricaded themselves she didntwant them to think she was trying to listen in it had been about two hours since she d acted so ridiculously about the question game and she was starting to rethink her decision to sit in vigil outside of andy room but she wanted to be the next person he saw she needed to apologize her attention was distracted as she heard footsteps coming up the boys stairs every once in a while she d hear someone coming up but usually they just kept on going up to whatever floor they lived on some didnteven notice she was sitting there but this one did ginny harry asked as he stopped his progress up the stairs and came around the corner to see her oh hey harry she replied sleepily it was swiftly approaching bedtime and she hadnteven started her homework yet she rubbed her eyes not unlike a small child harry smiled but she didntsee what are you doing he asked with genuine curiosity ginny sighed and laid herself down on the floor waiting for the mcgrath and ryan worlds to finished colliding so i can apologize to my best friend for completely humiliating him in front of the entire house and the girl he madly in love with her eyes were closed as she said this harry smiled again and again she didntsee it what was that game you were playing anyway he asked the question game she answered simply eyes still shut and how does one play the question game he returned well say you and i were playing she began finally opening her eyes to look at him he was standing directly above her head looking down at her from six feet up but moved to sit down next to her her face shifted with him as he moved i would randomly blurt out two girls names and you have to pick the one that you find most attractive or the one you d prefer to snog or the one you find less revolting it a wonderful game and you have to answer immediately so the other people playing know you re not lying if you dontanswer right away you get punishment which means you have to do whatever dare the questioner gives you ginny eyes closed again when her explanation was complete harry nodded to himself as he went through the rules in his head so what happened earlier he began she resisted the urge to sneak a glance at him was that you asked andrew which girl between you and nadine ryan he found to be he trailed off dork yes i forced him to reveal whether he thought nadine or i was more desirable i wouldnthave answered you harry admitted i wouldnthave asked you she countered opening her eyes again looking directly into his for a beat and sitting up she took out her ponytail and made it up again neater but andy knows the rules and he knows that i play for keeps he knows that if he hadntanswered i would have dared him to kiss her really yeah he been arse over elbows in love with her since we came to hogwarts and i know she fancies him too you were too busy having a pissing contest with michael corner to notice not that i didntenjoy it mind but nadine was practically having a breakdown when you kept implying that andy fancied me she always thought he did but he doesn t he all hers she finished smiling to herself so you felt put upon to relieve nadine insecurity i suppose yes i didntthink it out way ahead of time if that what you re asking ginny was thoughtful for a moment i was thoroughly enjoying the little scene unfolding between you and andy and michael and then i turn around and see nadine looking like she was about to burst into tears and there was absolutely no reason for her to because andy doesntlike me he likes her a lot so it seemed like the logical thing to do that actually rather nice of you harry observed sounding somewhat perplexed at his own conclusion except for the whole part where you had to humiliate your other friend to do it ginny cringed and harry laughed at her hearing him laugh lessened her distress a little yeah well we ll see if he ever speaks to me again then we ll know how nice it was they sat in silence for a while ginny was considering all the horrible reactions andy could possibly have to her actions and then he asked you to choose between him and me harry voice was low but clear ginny was grateful that the lighting in the dormitory hallways wasntvery good at night her face was so hot that she knew she was blushing furiously by this point they were both sitting shoulder to shoulder against the wall harry indian style ginny with her knees up near her chest ginny was leaning her head back against the wall yes the retribution i so sorely deserved he was quiet for a few minutes before he spoke again so so what she returned so who did you say me or andy ginny swiveled her head to face him startled that he had actually asked the awkward question that normal people would have ignored to save each other the mutual mortification that was sure to follow if they actually talked about it but they werentexactly normal people were they only ginny hadntthought on the fact that turning to face the boy next to her would mean that he might be looking at her too she quickly faced forward again regardless of whether he could see it she could feel another roaring blush climbing up her neck i said you of course her stomach was in chaos her chest felt full and her heart was hammering against her sternum like it was going to explode me he replied with genuine surprise you picked me over him his voice was barely above a whisper of course i did she replied with a small sigh leaning her head back against the wall and closing her eyes again why ginny couldnthelp but smile in the midst of her own embarrassment he really did not have the faintest idea how overwhelmingly attractive he was to her and she loved that about him she leaned her head over rest on his shoulder waited with baited breath until she d counted to seven in her head and relaxed when she felt his arm slide around her shoulders andy like my brother ew it would be like choosing ron or fred ew ginny shivered at such appalling thoughts you told me you didntneed any more brothers he recalled well with six weasleys and probably two mcgraths i think i pretty well stocked with them dontyou so i not one no you i can safely say will never be my brother is that a good thing he asked ginny sighed heavily what was one more in a long string of confirmations that he didntfancy her apparently still depressing as hell i d like to think so she said with little joy in her tone but i suppose it up to you what do you mean he asked well at least he was still holding up his end of the conversation like with so many other things recently he would have been a wreck if this had occurred the year before andy one of my best friends and he like my brother in the sense that i have never and will never and could never think of him romantically he not annoyingly overprotective like ron percy or bill he looks out for me but he knows i can handle myself and make my own mistakes like george and charlie and fred but me you re my friend you know things about me that no one else does i can tell you things that i would never tell my brothers because they would freak out if i did you are so matter of fact about so many things that they could never be calm about you know about voldemort and you donthover around me when i play quidditch and you donttell me that i shouldntdo things because i a girl or because i the baby and that how you want me to be very much yes she realized something just then something of potentially magnificent proportions you donttreat me like ron little sister anymore well i suppose you re not he paused i mean of course you are but he trailed off again but what she prompted quietly i dontreally know he replied honestly okay she said basking in his small admission too much to care that he couldntexplain himself she thought she had a pretty good idea of what he meant anyway really he asked incredulously no doubt hermione would never have let him get away with such an insufficient answer but as she thankfully reminded herself she was not hermione really wow ginny giggled what it just she began turning to get a look at him you really need to know that hermione is not the best example of what a girl is like harry chuckled i think i know it in an abstract sense but my instincts are so used to dealing with her that i guess i forget sometimes i not so bad am i he asked with a tiny bit of anxiety no you re not usually you re a rather good sport when you hang around me i just find that i have to remind you sometimes that i not going to bite your head off or interrogate you or tell you to study that i not her she returned to leaning on his shoulder trust me i could never confuse you with hermione good he went quiet again and ginny could feel him shifting a bit as if he was going to speak again when a new voice broke through their quiet conversation what this andy asked with not a little sarcasm at hearing his voice ginny turned to face him and scrambled to her feet he put his hands up as if to calm and slow her down nadine shot her a thankful smile from behind andy before venturing to speak herself andrew i ll see you tomorrow i going to bed andy smiled and nodded in pleasant acquiescence okay night nadine a small smile threatened to creep up onto his face night harry goodnight ginny she offered harry and ginny responded in kind how are you harry andy asked harry had a much different demeanor from the one he had worn earlier when he was in the middle of the corridor putting andy on the spot about the survey then he actually put out his hand for andy to take andy looked pleasantly surprised pretty good actually he answered as they shook hands i better get to bed he shot ginny an encouraging glance give you two a chance to talk ginny eyes were wide it really did look like the new bolder more frank harry was taking over ginny expression of surprise transformed into one of barely concealed triumph she had adored the harry of old but that boy didntquite set her on fire like this one had lately night then mate andy offered harry smiled and nodded night andrew goodnight ginny he looked at her for an extended moment and then turned to walk up the stairs to the room he shared with the rest of the sixth year boys ginny watched him leave and was still watching long after he was out of sight andy turned to look at her we re quite a pair you and i he said turning his whole body to face her he crossed his arms over his chest and looked at her thoughtfully hmm she asked turning back around at the sound of his voice he smirked look at us both ruined forever if we dontend up with the bloke and the girl we fell in love with in first year i dontknow what ll happen to us ginny smiled at the olive branch she really did adore this seventh brother of hers i dontknow what you re talking about i could always marry one of those rich slytherins i friends with he shook his head and chuckled yes you probably could he replied with the familiar quiet smile that she found so much comfort in it made ginny suddenly remember why she had been out there waiting for him for so long oh andy i so sorry i cantbelieve i did that to you she gushed out nadine just looked so miserable and i did the first thing i could think of to make her feel better i didntstop to think that in making her less upset i would be upsetting you instead it was impulsive and mean and i so sorry andy did the most brilliant thing he could have done at that moment and hugged his close friend of nearly five years i forgive you ginny he replied i understand why you did it and considering that i dontlike to see nadine upset either i cantsay that i really blame you ginny nodded into his shoulder as she returned his affectionate embrace so she began as they pulled apart where do you stand with her after all that ginny asked tentatively we re going to see if we can handle being nice to each other if being friends works out then maybe we ll see if we can handle something more andrew o connell mcgrath if you dontask that girl to hogsmeade i will string you up and lock you in a room with filch and all the hufflepuff third years he laughed at her demand and nodded rest assured i have every intention of doing so damn straight he did the third year hufflepuffs were notoriously obsessed with andy the heartthrob she smiled okay so so you and harry what about me and harry she returned suspiciously restating his words more than asking them he looked like you two had come to an understanding about something andy observed with not a little insinuation the only thing we established was that he is not my brother and that i am not hermione and actually we kind of already had that conversation a few months ago so no progress really andy examined her with a somewhat knowing look on his face it reminded her eerily of the kernel well then perhaps he realized something on his own andy added giving her a significant look with one last squeeze of her arm he turned and went to bed leaving ginny to think about what he had said fresh from making up with her best friend ginny decided to stage a coup if the blokes in the school could engage in this ridiculous activity as some unconscious effort to distract themselves from the horrors that were going on outside the safety of the school then why couldntthe girls indulge themselves too not to mention it had the additional enticement of being sweet sweet revenge she wrote down her plan on a self replicating note and passed it on to every girl in all of her classes they in turn passed it on to every girl they saw soon the word was out fifth sixth and seventh year girls were meeting in the room of requirement at seven that night even if the blokes realized what was going on they still wouldntbe able to do anything about it until it was over walking up onto the stage that the room had so perfectly created ginny cast a sonorus and said hello to get everyone attention the girls quieted and looked at her ginny raised her eyebrows and smirked when she saw that hermione had deigned to join in the fray sitting in the front row of course she wondered what sort of excuse she had given harry and ron to sneak off and come here what this all about then called a girl from the back glad you asked ginny replied pulling the list out of her pocket and holding it up for all of them to see i sure you re all by now aware that the blokes in our years decided to show a bit of school spirit and unification in the form of a mass survey a murmur of acknowledgement went through the crowd i thought that perhaps the ladies ought to make the same sort of effort to unify ginny said smirking you mean like our own version of a survey nadine ryan asked just loud enough for ginny to hear i mean that exactly ginny said waving to the multiple desks that lined that fantastic room i propose that we fill out our own version of their survey and see how the blokes rank up that murmur of acknowledgment changed into a murmur of excitement after you fill out your anonymous survey drop it in the slot in the desk the room will add up the totals and after all the surveys are in we ll each receive our very own list there was a shifting in the room as each girl tried to reach a desk the room accommodated them accordingly creating new desks where there was a lack including one right in front of ginny feel free to suggest any category that you feel ought to be added ginny finished ending her spell and sitting on her new desk to look with satisfaction over the heads of the girls in front of her ginny i dontknow about this hermione said stepping onto the stage with a survey in one hand and a quill in the other dontknow about what ginny asked picking up her own survey and placing it on her lap this could turn out really poorly people could get hurt hermione said then they should have thought about it before they made their list ginny replied you re splitting the school just as the house distinctions used to hermione scolded only now it between male and female i really dontthink one little survey will be that damaging to male female relationships at hogwarts ginny said i mean look at marietta edgecombe she been asked out by more blokes since the survey came out than ever before hermione harrumphed in response and ginny looked down at her survey only to have her attention pulled up when one of the youngest girls in the room called out what about something like most likely to defeat you know who ginny stared at her hermione did too what do you mean ginny asked trying not to betray how wary she was of the suggestion well dontyou think we ought to acknowledge him a bit more than just saying he the best quidditch player the girl asked several of her friends around her nodded who harry hermione asked sounding as shocked and strangely proud as ginny felt it true said a different girl he vanquished you know who when he was a baby probably saved all our lives and in his first year there was that business with the sorcerer stone he bested you know you to save the school a seventh year added giving a slightly skewed account of what happened he killed the basilisk and saved ginny lavender brown said well that was true he went to the ministry to protect a weapon and ended up living again and if only they knew what that had cost him ginny felt her chest tighten at the thought of sirius and there was that business with the tri wizard tournament one girl said looking at her friends for support they nodded remembering the interview that they werentallowed to read the year before he never changed his story not once he brought cedric body back cho chang added last and silence fell over the assembled girls as they all looked at the hottest girl in school to see her staring at the stage obviously determined not to cry ginny saw a movement behind cho and saw that it was daphne greengrass walking forward to stand beside cho offering her support with a single physical gesture we owe him something more than best quidditch player padma patil finished ginny swallowed hard trying to keep down the lump in her throat how she wished harry could hear these words hear and believe them how she wished he knew what he meant to the wizarding world and even his fellow students hermione ginny could see was blinking rather rapidly what do you suggest ginny finally asked a dedication to harry a hufflepuff proposed a thank you to him what about a category asked gretchen ramsey something like bloke we trust most with our lives or suggested kerney boy we can t live without literally her idea took hold immediately causing the whole group to think it over then girls began nodding and soon it was an official category ginny definitely saw pansy parkinson scowling during this discussion but ginny had no doubt that her fear of gretchen ramsey and a room full of girls beside her was greater than her desire to voice her disapproval of thanking harry for anything he had done soon thereafter all the surveys were submitted ginny explained that everyone would receive their lists in twenty two minutes and that they might as well head back to their common rooms the girls began filing out hermione taking charge and running the bottleneck at the doorway in such an efficient manner that ginny was almost glad for her need to control every situation almost ginny remained on the stage sitting on the edge elbows on her knees and chin in her hands walking out katie bell came up to ginny to tell her what an excellent idea this girl list was ginny smiled at her though the entire mood of the meeting had sobered toward the end ginny liked katie she d been good friends with her brothers and had often visited the burrow for some pick up quidditch you know katie if you put you and me together we d apparently be the perfect girl ginny joked katie smiled it you they all want to date katie said well sure but that only because they want in my pants you re the one they want to bring home to mum and dad ginny said giving an exaggerated sigh and frown i just not parent material i guess katie smiled again turning to look at the almost empty room it meant a lot to me katie said looking at the places where the girls had stood to hear the way those girls talked about harry ginny nodded wishing katie could be the type of person to laugh at everything and take nothing seriously then they could have avoided talking about this emotional subject i ve known him for six years ginny and he never once commented on the burden he bears he simply accepts it katie said ginny of course had heard him comment on it but she couldntdisagree that the boy simply accepted it he never even considered a career in quidditch he so good at it and he loves it he could become a professional but i asked him once if he was talking to scouts he looked at me surprised and said the only career he ever really considered was being an auror well that harry ginny said shrugging she was now feeling vaguely uncomfortable about adding the special category for harry of all the things harry potter might appreciate being singled out for the millionth time because of the scar on his forehead was not one of them it is isntit katie said taking the difficult job over the one that could make him so happy avoiding the spotlight and coming in at the end to save them all he the lynchpin ginny thought remembering sirius words from so long ago now she was worried about his reaction to yet another public reference to the life he couldntfix or control katie shook her head and ginny remembered something her mother once told her when ginny asked her about her brothers molly weasley had talked about destiny and pain and how some people are willing to take up more responsibility than they need to in order that others can live carefree lives i glad he has his own category katie said lifting the almost depressing mood in the room as she smiled ginny wished she could smile like that wished she could agree with her and if you promise not to mention it to anyone i ll tell you that i think he in the running for a couple other titles as well i the very best secret keeper you ll ever find ginny said trying to return to joking for instance i knew you and george saw each other for two months last year before the great weasley escape katie blushed but still managed to smile you knew about that i a little sister with big ears ginny said shrugging and smiling kindly she certainly would not have minded if george had kept on seeing katie for the rest of his life well all right then katie said heading to the door and waving to ginny night ginny night katie ginny said sitting on the edge of the stage and waving back and soon it was just hermione ginny kerney and luna sitting in the room of requirement which had shrunk to accommodate them including couches one of which ginny sat on as she waited for the list to appear luna sat beside her no one who knows harry said anything luna noted in her list checking style of conversation that ginny liked so much no ginny agreed strangely glad about that about the fierce devotion that harry unwittingly commanded in his friends perhaps she wasntthe only one who was anxious about harry reaction you didntfill out your survey luna said no ginny said i turned it in blank you what hermione asked ginny looked at her i try not to make a practice of writing down my most personal thoughts i didntmean to imply that hermione cut herself off looking at the three fifth years in front of her i suppose i ought to be getting back to the common room you can stay if you like hermione kerney offered ginny looked at her barely remembering that they were both prefects and had probably gotten to know each other a bit this year but hermione was looking at ginny not kerney scott ginny looked back at her quirking an eyebrow hermione came closer sitting next to ginny and looking around as though to make sure luna and kerney werentlistening they took the hint and began to talk together that irritated ginny what right did hermione have to make ginny friends turn away i know sometimes we dontalways think alike hermione began but i wanted to let you know that i think this survey idea was actually quite good i glad to have your approval ginny said sarcastically hermione narrowed her eyes looked ready to say something but stopped herself and said something different despite what you may think harry is my best friend hermione said i d die for him ginny looked at hermione why was she bringing that up i consider him my brother and what everyone said about him that made me really very proud and very glad for him she went on okay i know he talking to you more now and just i ll try to back off it only that he sometimes needs prodding in order to get moving you know i know that ron and i cantbe there for him always her voice seemed to get a little nervous there pushing him and i know that sometimes we re rather exclusive but she cut herself off staring at ginny as if begging her to understand ginny suddenly wondered when ron and hermione had started snogging behind harry back ginny wanted to take hermione by the shoulders take her by the shoulders and shake her until she got it through her brilliant but appallingly thick head that harry had never needed prodding he d never needed people nagging him with questions as if his emotional health was the subject of their next care of magical creatures test he d needed a person he could trust someone who he wouldnthave to explain every bloody thing to because they already understood but she didntdo any of that she could throttle hermione and yell at her for half an hour but the girl would probably never understand hermione ginny said feeling somehow the strange need to comfort hermione the girl was obviously worried though whether it was just for harry mental state or the fact that she was entrusting ginny with what she must have seen as his caretaking ginny couldnttell there something about the three of you harry ron and you that special when the three of you work together good things happen the sorcerer stone is saved the d a is created the tri wizard tournament won the basilisk is identified and the chamber of secrets found and it was true as close as ginny had finally become with harry she knew his friendship with her would always be different separate from the one he shared with ron and hermione hermione looked at ginny and countered but there also something about you and harry that special when you re together he changes and becomes i dontknow stronger somehow bolder you can make him do things and see things that i can t i dontknow how you do it ginny was slightly shocked at the sad tone that laced hermione words the other girl shrugged somewhat dejectedly i dontreally know how to explain it except to say that you re good for him ginny was embarrassed and confused why would hermione say something like that well technically ginny knew why hermione always intervened in people lives regardless of the feelings of those people no matter if those people just wanted to be bloody left alone if hermione granger believed she knew what was best for you she wouldnthesitate to consider your perspective she just did what she thought should be done like telling a girl she was good for a certain boy girls who were desperately in love with brooding complicated 16 year old saviors of the world got to a point where they were somewhat comfortable with the fact that the boy savior would never feel the same way got to a point where they actually pondered what it would be like to date their potions partner or the head boy and here was hermione the sodding administrator of the world spoiling her piece of mind by saying she was good for him the only times ginny had ever seen harry act more bold than usual was when he took the twins up on their offer of a chance to talk to sirius when he gave the quidditch team their pep talk before the first match of the year and just days ago when he had come sauntering down the corridor to have a go at andy and michael the first one may have been her doing seeing as she had orchestrated the twins offer in the first place but she certainly couldntbe credited with causing the other two ginny absent mindedly shook her head she didntwant to have this conversation and wanted to have it with hermione even less but she was saved from further conversation as the girl list appeared in the air in front of her she grabbed it seeing hermione do the same and read the list with not a little bit of shock the sixth years had cleaned up and the slytherins had grabbed quite a few titles including ew draco malfoy for best arse ew but the best thing about the list was that andy and harry looked to be the real winners ha nicest neville longbottom smartest theodore nott best sense of humor seamus finnegan best quidditch player harry potter most handsome baron ramsey most likely to be head boy quentin crowe most dangerous with a hex harry potter most likely to seriously commit tie ron weasley andrew mcgrath best to take home to parents andrew mcgrath best date tie michael corner baron ramsey best dancer baron ramsey best kisser duncan moran best body adam skillman best arse draco malfoy most want to date harry potter most want to shag andrew mcgrath boy we couldn t live without literally harry potter malfoy kerney shrieked ginny and luna laughed at the uncharacteristically stunned reaction of their friend hermione actually looked to shocked to speak ron came a few seconds later in a strained yell the other three girls doubled over with laughter how bout them slytherins eh ginny asked once they had all calmed down a bit they had all returned to perusing their copies of the new list cantreally argue with the choices though can we the kernel observed ginny and luna nodded while hermione only looked up to see the reactions of the other girls i mean except for draco getting dont say it again ginny cut her off all four girls shared a look and shuddered collectively at the thought ginny tried to revive the conversation otherwise though kerney right duncan moran is the best kisser hermione asked no one in particular she shot ginny a significant look what ginny challenged back hermione attempted to shrug innocently but ginny wasntbuying it well you went on a date with him didntyou the older girl clarified i did but i didntkiss him really hermione asked genuinely curious yes hermione really he not a bad bloke to chat with in the hall but i was never trying to be his girlfriend ginny glanced at kerney i only said yes in the first place because he caught me off guard in the corridor kerney snorted in amusement and luna smiled ginny loved that hermione was so out of the loop when it came to her life hermione eyebrows were slightly raised and then he went and acted like a complete git while we were in hogsmeade she wondered if harry had related the story to hermione but by hermione display of increased curiosity ginny came to the conclusion that she didntknow a thing about how harry had unwittingly sat in on their date this was a most interesting development harry had been concealing more than their extra potions sessions from his two best mates i dontknow about adam skillman for best body the kernel inserted to break up the strange staring contest that had arisen between ginny and hermione as they silently sorted through their thoughts true luna agreed i should think they all meant to put baron ramsey but figured he would already be winning in other categories it not as if adam would have won for best quidditch player either amen to that ginny blurted out in low tones before she could stop herself baron a freaking adonis her hand flew to her mouth immediately her eyes wide kerney and luna laughed riotously hermione was back to her previous look of astonishment are you really friends with the head boy hermione asked her skepticism permeating her tone ginny rolled her eyes sure that hermione interest in the matter extended only as long as baron ramsey held that particular title oh baron ginny thought sadly he and gretchen still hadntreturned to school after their parents had been killed devon had informed her that the two of them were getting their family affairs in order which was no small task for such a wealthy and prominent line yes i am friends with him ginny replied voiced laced with some of the sadness of her thoughts i cantimagine what he and gretchen are going through luna walked over and sat next to ginny leaning her head on the redhead shoulder ginny relaxed slightly at her friend gesture hermione didntseem to have heard past her confirmation of being baron friend and you re pretty friendly with your new potions partner arentyou hermione asked with not a little accusation in her voice luna head came up and kerney and ginny shared a wary glance what are you getting at hermione yes i friends with baron and theo and i get along well with gretchen and quentin and holly and the skillmans what it to you hermione was quiet but clearly taking careful note of all that ginny had just revealed ginny felt that devon would appreciate not being included it was advantageous to both she and ginny that no one but harry and apparently theo knew of their friendship outside the strictly academic partnership they had shared in potions class theodore nott father is a death eater she returned severely as if that explained everything sirius black entire family was evil including his brother and his cousin who were death eaters ginny was getting angry at the shallow insinuation the other girl was making what your point while not yelling her voice was steel hermione countenance was battling between realization that ginny was quite right about sirius relations and suspicious anger that ginny would defend a slytherin whose father was a death eater kerney and luna were glancing back and forth between the two girls hermione ginny finally began when it looked as though hermione was too mixed up to speak any time soon you are the one who always after harry and my brother about making friends with the slytherins and you stood there in your compartment on the hogwarts express scolding us for being mean to draco malfoy of all people the sodding prince of the death eaters because of where we saw him that morning are you really going to stand there and tell me off for doing exactly what you were telling the boys to do hermione opened and closed her mouth several times as if she were going to say something and then thought better of it i just think you should be careful ginny wished she could throw harry working friendship with devon in hermione face but couldn t it would be revealing far too much just for a little immediate gratification i am careful hermione i not stupid you know indeed ginny had to bite back a smirk as she recalled the fact that she was now in three of hermione n e w t classes the expression on hermione face told ginny that she was remembering the very same thing heh and i have a little experience with trust issues if you remember and you have this thing with professor wrightman hermione added as if she had not heard ginny last words i donttrust that woman it took everything in ginny self control to keep from snorting in derision of course hermione didntlike professor wrightman hermione couldntsuck up to her or rather she could but their professor wasntbuying it of all people gertrude wrightman knew very well the importance of experience and practicality relative to theory a lesson that hermione had yet to learn again ginny bristled at knowing a lot more about a particular subject than hermione and not being able to rub her face in it well on this perhaps she could say something vague look hermione if you donttrust her that fine it makes you a hypocrite but that fine and you can distrust me if you want even though it completely ridiculous i really dontcare what you think of me but i know that harry trusts me and i trust gertrude wrightman harry and i both know things about her that you would never imagine so why dontyou do us all a favor and wait to be judgmental until you know the whole story hermione expression had become one of perpetual shock after they had vocally disagreed so many times in the past year ginny wondered at how hermione could still not see it coming their bitter discussion was interrupted as the door to the room of requirement opened causing all four girls to swivel in the direction of the entrance each one quickly stashing her copy of the new list in the nearest pocket what are you lot doing up here harry asked climbing in with ron right behind him herpo was peeking out of harry right pants pocket nothing ginny and hermione answered at the same time they shot each other startled looks at having blurted out their answers simultaneously the only real difference between their responses was that while ginny looked completely composed in the throes of a blatant lie hermione had guilt and concealment written all over her face harry smirked at the scene before him ron unsurprisingly looked puzzled it must have been a pretty significant nothing for hermione to lie about it harry observed helping herpo out of his pocket ginny rolled her eyes at hermione shameful inexperience at fibbing ron looked genuinely impressed at harry ability to detect falsehoods herpo scampered over to ginny who picked him up fine ginny conceded determined to speak before hermione did she had a feeling that hermione would try to hide the fact that she had been talking about harry behind his back she often did that when she was attempting to run someone else life hermione thinks i cantbe trusted because i friends with too many slytherins including but not limited to my various potions partners the head boy and our defense professor ron looked appalled at this admission well that was ron when it came to slytherins harry nodded in confirmation ginny had a hunch that nodding was the only thing keeping him from smiling or worse laughing his eyes had brightened somewhat and experience told ginny that he must be enjoying this immensely no laughing would not have gone over well with hermione just now it okay hermione ginny has assured me in no uncertain terms that she is not going to marry baron ramsey harry began with a completely straight face ginny couldnthelp but burst out laughing luna laughed as well since ginny had related the story to her when they returned from the christmas holiday the boy was bloody brilliant hermione looked very confused at his answer and then very put out it not funny harry she answered urgently harry face softened not the route ginny would have taken as it only encouraged the girl but then hermione was his best friend believe me hermione i know very well how funny it not but i promise you that i am not concerned about ginny various relationships with people from slytherin the ramseys parents were just murdered by death eaters on christmas day he reminded her causing her face to pale as if to demonstrate that she had forgotten that fact it made ginny angry i doubt we ll have to worry about baron and gretchen becoming death eaters professor wrightman knew my mother he continued with a glance at ginny they were meeting with professor wrightman on saturday afternoon after their quidditch match against slytherin to discuss what ginny had seen in the pensieve though ginny had still not told harry anything other than that there were some things he needed to know and i dontknow much about theo nott other than that he is very good at potions and doesntlike to be called theodore another glance at ginny she had shared with him her utter surprise in getting acquainted with her new potions partner in the course of grilling devon about the situation during one of their recent potions sessions his dad is a death eater isnthe ron offered speaking for the first time yes but we have it on good authority that he hates both of his parents so i doubt that going to be a particularly attractive life path for him ginny smiled but straightened it out when hermione started to turn toward her who is this good authority hermione asked insistent on wanting to find out what ginny and harry werenttelling her and ron that is not our secret to tell harry said sternly defending devon confidence the point is that i know most of the people you re worried about and as for the ones i don t it good enough for me that ginny either trusts them or doesn t she knows better than anyone about putting your faith in someone and having it shattered she knows how manipulative voldemort can be and she knows it better than anyone in this room so could you lay off of her a bit if you re worried about me come to me but please dontget mad at ginny on my behalf because i dontappreciate it and i know she doesntappreciate it you and ron are my best friends but because of that my friendship with ginny is completely separate from my friendship with you two can you see why she might find it a little patronizing for you to tell her what to do when she basically been excluded from the three of us since she came to school here rest assured if i dontlike something she doing i am perfectly capable of telling her so he said it all in a way that made it sound like he was telling her she had something in her teeth rather than telling her to butt the hell out of their friendship he really was getting better at this whole savior of the world thing he was learning how to command people without those people thinking they were taking orders all before her very eyes ginny shared a look of approval with luna kerney looked pleasantly surprised at how smoothly harry had taken control of the conversation so what are you two doing up here ginny asked drawing the gazes of both boys harry and ron were pinned with the inquisitive eyes of all four girls harry smirked we thought that it was a little suspicious that both ginny and hermione have been gone all evening i asked andrew if he knew where ginny was and that when nadine ryan walked back through the portrait hole followed by practically every other fifth sixth and seventh year girl in our house except for the three of you he added indicating the kernel as well we thought it was a mite strange for every single older girl in the house to be gone at once ron explained and i figured that whatever was going on ginny was probably behind it harry admitted and i figured that hermione had probably followed her out to try and stop her from getting expelled for whatever it is she doing ron perceptively noted ginny smirk was now matching harry s luna was smiling though it didntappear that she was paying attention to the conversation the kernel looked torn between wanting to smile and roll her eyes well you re not too far off the mark ginny replied i wouldnthave been expelled though she paused sneaking a glance at her brother and then hermione man those two had to be playing some hard core tonsil hockey she wondered if harry had any idea but hermione did state her predictable and completely absurd objections to my activities this evening hermione gaze broke from where it had been set on ron and she scowled at ginny ron smiled i am not predictable hermione insisted but hushed quickly as the patronizing glares of everyone else fervently contradicted her claim luna piped up before the older girl had a chance to get wound up i going to bed good night and she abruptly left the room ginny smiled at her friend retreating figure loony the kernel shouted causing luna to stop and turn when she was halfway out the magical door wait for me she added night ginny she called with a wave as she followed their ravenclaw friend out the door now alone with the trio ginny wished she had hustled out with kerney i ll go too she said turning to leave see you she tried not to be disappointed when harry didntcall her back or follow her into the hall impulsively she took corridors and secret passages that were out of the way in the faint hope of seeing theo or devon or a newly arrived baron but it was to no avail somehow the rare and welcome prospect of a good night sleep didntmake up for walking back to the common room alone as the boys descended upon the great hall ginny watched for harry arrival she hadntstared at him this openly since third year and it was almost liberating in a way she watched him approach the table with neville and ron watched as copies of the new list made appearances watched as he and his two mates found their names next to various categories and then she watched as his eyes went from the slip of parchment directly to her own ginny nodded her head ever so slightly toward the doors of the great hall and harry nodded once as he turned to make his excuses to ron ginny nudged nadine and told her not to wait for her when they went to class she joked to andy that apparently the girls could unite just as well as the boys to which he smiled sheepishly and it not such a bad thing to be leaving andy and nadine to sit next to each other is it ginny thought to herself as she rose to leave she caught kerney eye and her friend glanced immediately down the table to where harry was getting up to leave as well looking back to ginny she nodded in understanding and smiled not her usual knowing infuriating smirk but a small warm friendly smile the one ginny had come to believe was saved for a very few people and even fewer occasions smiling back she winked at her friend and turned to follow harry at a distance mind out of the great hall she had hoped to find him waiting for her outside the doors but he was still walking about twenty paces ahead of her when she finally made it out into the entranceway but as he ducked into a secret passage just before the hall turned a corner she knew immediately where he was headed the kitchens thank merlin she was hungry she smiled at the thought of seeing dobby and briefly thought that she could afford to miss her first class of the day since she had double charms and a break before lunch when she finally ducked into the doorway to the kitchens she looked around for several seconds before finding harry all the way on the other side she had never thought that there might be a third entrance to the kitchens but so it was harry looked up at her with kind eyes and an almost smile as her form emerged from a sea of merry elves and breakfast dishes once ginny was seated and her order taken she turned her full attention on him so you ve been a little busy i see harry observed unfolding the new list on the table ginny bit her lip for as long as she had known him and watched him and catalogued him there were still times when he was unpredictable when she couldntread him at all after the way he d been acting recently she hoped she hadntruined it with her little act of revenge she liked this new slightly bolder slightly taller harry a little she said non committally willing him to give some indication that he either hated her guts or didntmind the thing it looks like the girls dontwant to shag me nearly as much as the blokes want to shag you he commented and ginny laughed with delight he smiled at her reaction dobby and a few of his friends brought them an intimidating spread of breakfast choices while she calmed down ginny grabbed the list as she made to reply wait so you mean in addition to being she glanced down at the parchment amazing at quidditch completely dangerous and essential to the lives of witches everywhere you tell jokes too she smirked and looked back up at him no wonder you re the most datable boy in the school he chuckled as he unfolded his napkin and laid it across his lap well i aim to please he jokingly reminded her ginny smirked as she dove into a belgian waffle with fresh strawberries and whipped cream dobby was the coolest friend ever this is what we were doing last night she explained once she had made some headway into her breakfast hermione only started accusing me of being chummy with slytherins after we did it she came to the meeting and tried to tell me i shouldntdo the list and then afterwards she tried to tell me that it was a good idea then when we saw the results she freaked out about all the slytherins i know harry nodded she has trouble with that ginny harry replied with a look asking her to cut the girl some slack she doesntalways know how to say what she means to say she certainly seems to know when she ordering me around like a little girl ginny groused back harry smiled ginny saw this and pouted harry chuckled i think the majority of people are well aware that you are not a little girl he said in response strangely concentrating on his plate of eggs when he said it harry i sorry about that extra category he looked up at her i didntput it on there some of the girls suggested doing something like that and the idea caught on i know you hate it when you have everyone attention because of this and i didntmean for that to happen hermione and katie were so touched and happy about it that i couldnttake it off without someone making a fuss about it i understand he said i think the only other person who was uncomfortable with it was luna well she pretty on the nose about things like that ginny suddenly recalled the trip on the hogwarts express in september when luna had called her out for being in love with the boy in front of her yes she is maybe a little too on the nose again ginny was struck with a sudden recollection her new suspicion that ron and hermione were sucking face in secret no doubt making productive use of their prefect rounds harry can i ask you something sure he replied eyebrows furrowing slightly at her somewhat anxious tone um well are ron and hermione snogging behind my back yes i had a hunch yeah it kind of an absurd spectacle he smiled grimly i mean they are terrible about keeping secrets that involve themselves about me they can keep a secret very well but when it comes to their own they re absolutely rubbish but they think they re being extremely clever you dontseem very upset that they re keeping something this important from you oh i was at first do you know when i started suspecting them ginny shook her head curiosity all over her face the night you came into our room looking for ron after your dream there was no reason for him to be gone then and when i got back to bed i saw that the map was gone ginny eyebrows raised in surprise so that why you started giving him the cold shoulder harry nodded looking out into space as if deep in thought then he seemed to realize something and looked back at her actually i was more angry with him for being gone when you needed him ginny tried to contain her shock harry was glaring at his food and shaking his head i glad you have five other brothers because you d be in a sorry state if he was the only one to rely on he brilliant at being a best mate but i reckon he turned into a pretty rotten brother that probably my fault it probably is but i dontblame you for it ginny explained harry looked skeptical harry i don t i ll admit that i was pretty angry first and second year and having ron go from my best friend when i was ten to ignoring me when i was eleven is a big reason why i found the diary so appealing but it not ron fault and it certainly not yours harry looked very upset at her admission just think even if he hadntgiven me up for you i still might have been stuck down in the chamber of secrets only you wouldnthave known to come save me i quite glad you and my brother are best mates harry i would never want to change that he looked somewhat placated they fell into silence as they finished their breakfast after draining his glass of pumpkin juice harry spoke when did you start thinking they d finally gotten together he asked last night when we were waiting for the room of requirement to tally the votes for the list hermione felt it was the appropriate time to give me her permission to be your friend ginny explained with not a little sarcasm harry chuckled and shook his head i sorry about that he said it not your fault she feels the need to stick her nose where it doesntbelong ginny countered but she said something that made the pieces in my head click she said that she knew you and i are talking more now and that she knows you three can be kind of exclusive sometimes kind of honestly but that she realized and this was the kicker she said that she and ron wouldntalways be there to push you to open up about your feelings and things i was like whoa when did they start snogging it wasnthard to see that she was shoring up emotional support for you in their absence harry nodded looking thoughtful isntit incredible how a girl who is so academically sharp can be so dumb when it comes to dealing with people he asked yes it is it surprises me almost as much as it surprises her when i disagree with her and get angry with her she honestly appalled that i would have the gall to challenge her authority like how she appalled when you dare to skip ahead in three classes he added with a smirk just like that actually ginny matched his pleasant smirk with one of her own it was strange but after she answered him they sat there fork and spoon poised in their hands watching each other ginny was wondering when they had become good enough friends that conversation would flow so easily like it had the funny thing about it was she didntfeel uncomfortable under his gaze and he didntappear to either she liked looking at him it brought her comfort to watch him when he was at ease when he was comfortable his emotions ran through his expression and body language much more smoothly and cleanly when he was comfortable needless to say he was rarely at ease or comfortable these days ever since cedric had died but particularly since sirius had been killed harry rarely dropped the tension in his back and shoulders the tension that sometimes made ginny think that if he didntresort to it his whole body might give way with the grief he felt but not at the moment at the moment the tension was gone melted away leaving the taller stronger older almost lithe harry in front of her as they continued to watch each other quietly harry adjusted his seating leaning back in his chair considering her more thoughtfully with every passing moment tired of unknowingly holding her fork up above the remnants of her waffle ginny set it down on her plate and cracked a smile at harry new posture it struck her as very james potter like she could definitely imagine harry father sitting back casually in his chair like harry was doing now and almost on cue harry reached a hand up unconsciously to scratch his head ginny barely there smile grew into a grin and she couldntfight the urge to shut her eyes and savor the image of him when she opened them again harry was still watching her and he was now faintly smiling as well what so funny she asked him with a quirk of her eyebrows he shrugged nothing his answer echoed hers and hermione from the night before she smirked playfully it must be a pretty big nothing for you to lie about it she countered and he laughed she chuckled at him i suppose it is he conceded the knowing look in his eyes piqued her curiosity really she asked still amazed that he would be so uncharacteristically frank with her yes i believe that is how i would characterize it he replied she couldnttell if the slightly pink tinge to his face was the heat from the ovens or could it be a blush but you re not going to tell what it is she guessed he smiled all traces of pink vanishing no i not miss i have a secret patronus he countered with not a little triumph in his expression ginny cringed there went the nice morning she was having if harry only knew what it was he wouldntthink it was quite such a riot to tease her about it if my patronus is the price of your big nothing i think i can live in suspense for a little while she responded harry nodded in recognition i thought that might dampen your curiosity a bit he said he glanced at the clock on the wall nearest them oh shite i have charms ginny giggled yes giggled she wasntproud of it but the boy was bloody hot and he was acting so unguarded and just oh he was shooting her the same winning smile she d seen in pictures of james potter she could safely say she now had a very healthy appreciation for lily evans choice in a husband no wonder they had looked so nauseatingly hot for each other in professor wrightman memory ginny harry chuckling voice cut through her inner monologue she shook her head a little to clear her mind yeah i ll see you at quidditch practice yeah oh of course sure definitely his smile was bloody distracting he was trying not to laugh at her she did not appreciate this and shoved him he was clearly not expecting it um ginny he asked doing slightly less of a terrible job of keeping the laughter out of his voice but his face completely betrayed his amusement what you big wanker she said grumpily causing him to laugh outright i was just going checking to make sure you re not actually ten years old he managed to get out she looked scandalized and he ran for the door but she wasntto be outrun so easily her wand was out before she even thought to wield it and she shouted the first joke hex that came to mind extra zagela she shouted as her wand sliced through the air surviving a childhood with the twins certainly had its advantages the blow of the hex sent harry flying through the door out of the kitchens and ginny tore after him he was picking up the remainder of his school things when she caught up to him in the corridor when he turned to reach for his ink bottle ginny burst into laughter by all means he snarked pleasantly as he straightened up his things finally collected enjoy yourself she leaned around him and ran her fingers over the smooth black tail that was now running out the back of his trousers it was like she imagined a jaguar might be as far as tails went it suited him matched his brilliantly unruly hair it very handsome as far as tails go she offered he scowled but his eyes sparkled indeed they sparkled so enchantingly that she didnthave time to react when he whipped out his wand and cast the same spell on her eep she yelped as she felt the tail suddenly burst out under her pleated skirt it was cat like like harry s but smaller and slimmer and red oh yes it matched her hair perfectly you ll notice i didnttoss you down the corridor when i cast the spell he insinuated she looked back at him unabashedly well you bloody deserved it you self satisfied git she hollered fighting a smile it was hard not to smile when you were having such a ridiculous argument with such an incredibly attractive boy not to mention figuring out how to move your new tail okay i seriously late to charms and seeing as i ve already missed history of magic today i really need to go he insisted still chuckling ginny grinned and shoved him again go then you big dork i will he replied smiling back somewhat triumphantly he turned and started off in the direction of the charms corridor tail swishing slightly ginny laughter rang out through the halls cheerfully as he disappeared around the corner ginny watched harry disappear and stood where she was pondering the boy who now on his way ten minutes late to n e w t charms she smirked at the thought of hermione probably reaction she wondered whether ron had noticed how much more time harry was spending with his baby sister lately hermione had noticed she knew but was ron too distracted by hermione oral gymnastics to have caught on ew ginny shuddered at the thought of them making out though she had to admit the notion of the uptight and rule mongering hermione locked in a passionate embrace particularly with a boy as unrefined and sprawling as ron made her snort in amusement these were the thoughts running through ginny mind when she felt something strange coming from er behind her something or someone was faintly smoothing down the length of her recently acquire tail she was so un used to having the thing that it took her much longer than it should have for her to realize that there was a person behind her petting her bloody tail what if she hadntscreamed in surprise she would have thought it felt oddly stirring but she did scream and in doing so whipped around to face a smirking and handsomely smug theo nott you stupid ponce she yelled catching her breath her hand was clutched to her chest as she willed her heart to cease from slamming against her sternum theo laughed pleasantly well it would have been pleasant if ginny didntwant to slam him against a wall for scaring the living shite out of her merlin nice tail ginny he said not even putting up the pretense of sympathy smug bastard although she couldnthelp but notice he was a terribly handsome smug bastard what was with all these achingly attractive boys tormenting and mocking her today then she remembered the tail she had given to the last boy who teased her you should have seen his she replied smoothly with not a little triumph in her expression theo eyebrows raised though she couldnttell if it was in curiosity or consideration oh yes may i ask who dared to incite the most dangerous girl in the school ginny eyes narrowed briefly at his allusion to her less than fond memory of the first list he had been one of the very few to catch on about how self conscious it had made her but she considered for a moment hadnthe won something too yes well at least i know people arentjust my friends to get the answers to n e w t homework assignments she countered with a glint in her eyes that revealed her to be infinitely more fred and george sister than bill or percy s theo seemed quite satisfied at her response disconcertingly so is that the only reason you talk to me for the answers to the potions assignments he asked knowing full well that it wasn t and letting it show easily through his tone and expression smug bastard bloody attractive smug bastard she was close to even with him in the class and wouldnthave needed him at all to support her grade they both knew this ginny wondered if he didntknow exactly how attractive she found him of course not she replied beginning to walk down the hall he followed and looked briefly surprised that she would admit it his first mistake it makes malfoy and hermione squirm to see us getting along if she wasntso well schooled in reading slytherin facial expressions by now she would not have noticed the light dimming in his eyes in fact she wasntsure she had even seen it and what more they re jealous they brightened again hermione will never be a pureblooded witch and that makes her insufferably insecure malfoy has been staring at me creepy git since the end of last year it burns him that you can make me laugh and i would never look at him twice poor as we are he knows his money would never win me over he seemed somewhat pacified by her blunt observations about their two classmates though his eyes were still not as bright or engaging as they had been a few minutes before i wondered whether you had noticed his rather attentive behavior the ultimate cosmic joke is it not the little prince of the blacks and the malfoys not remarkable in any way other than his lineage and his family fortune loses to harry potter in every match outscored by the muggle born on every exam and infatuated with the only daughter of the family he was taught to scorn more than any other i dontthink i could have done it up better myself draco malfoy knows that he cantcompete with the kind of blokes who would stand a chance with you and that before we get to the fact that you d rip him and his father to pieces given the chance she looked torn between being highly amused and somewhat grumpy you dontlook very entertained by it he observed well perhaps if he didnttotally make my skin crawl i d be able to appreciate the joke better theo stopped walking causing ginny to halt as well and studied her thoughtfully for a moment then his brow furrowed in uncharacteristic gravity he moved in and lowered his voice he never tried anything with you has he his gaze was penetrating and ginny decided instantly that she would stay friends with this boy for life she recognized the shadow that absorbed the usual light in his eyes it was the same one that hooded harry s baron s and her brothers gazes when people they cared for were threatened ginny heart beat picked up speed no she answered immediately wanting at once to reassure him and figure out if he really cared about her as much as his behavior was implying when she finally processed the content of the question she recalled that strange night in the fall term when she had wandered down near the dungeons in an insomnia induced stupor well once i not sure really but i didntget a chance to find out because baron happened upon us but that was after i had already punched him in the face so she trailed off theo delicious smirk had returned with a vengeance his eyes practically glistened with amusement and ginny had to seriously restrain herself from leaning forward and up and closing the distance between them instead she took a deep breath and kept walking theo followed anyway he a slimy git i almost regret setting that bat bogey hex on him last year theo eyes widened a little in recognition it was only after that that he started watching me and following me and things that was you he asked as close to being in awe as it was possible for a confident slytherin like theo nott to be yes why theo shook his head and smiled he tried to tell us that umbridge had done it as if she would have been powerful enough to cast it i knew he was lying but i didntrealize the truth was this good he paused with another thoughtful look at her you really can take care of yourself cantyou it sounded more like he was making observations to himself but she answered anyway i reckon so she replied smiling at his estimation of her it was a lot more than her mother and several of her brothers were willing to give her credit for she felt an urge to compliment him in return you know if more slytherins were like you your house would be the most popular one in the school she said watching for his reaction his mouth appeared to quirk as if indicating that a smile was imminent but he refrained he swallowed and considered her a little longer in silence you know if more gryffindors were like you the two houses would unite as friends his face curved into the playful smirk that she loved on him or shagging partners at the very least uh ginny groaned in playful exasperation punching his arm theo was very pleased with himself but their animation and good humor was immediately arrested as they turned the corner into the foyer between the entrance to the school and the great hall standing in the doorway speaking with dumbledore and periodically nodding or shaking his head arm linked delicately with his sister s a grave but thoughtful expression on his finely chiseled face was baron ramsey many thanks to the following folks for

msmissprongs torri chiobie thestral91 sentinel doom18769 solar1 and psychofroth your comments are all much appreciated apologies for the long wait on this chapter but school and real life have been intervening more than usual i hope this makes the wait worth while chapter 11 boys and secrets ginny had stopped dead at the sight of the ramsey twins seeing her grin disappear theo turned abruptly to find the cause of her sudden gravity gretchen was the first to notice them looking more fragile than ginny thought possible where had her fiery personality gone the girl in front of them arm looped delicately but not weakly through her brother s did not look like the formidable young woman who could shut up draco malfoy and impress her progressive attitudes upon the whole of slytherin house this girl looked broken but upon noticing ginny and theo across the way her countenance brightened slightly after watching them for a moment she tugged lightly on her brother arm both baron and dumbledore turned to find ginny and theo standing self consciously near the entrance to the great hall the three of them walked over as they did something strange passed over baron face piquing ginny curiosity since baron rarely showed emotions or reactions outwardly ginny turned slightly to glance down the corridor from which she and theo had just come sure enough most students were still in the middle of class and harry was in charms harry she had just begun to smile at the thought of him when gretchen ramsey excellent laugh broke out in front of her ginny turned back quickly to see what the cause had been dumbledore eyes were twinkling and baron seemed on the verge of smiling but gretchen was the only one laughing it took ginny a moment to remember that she had a tail oh yes that ginny admitted rolling her eyes please enjoy yourselves only make sure you find harry and have a good laugh at him too harry dumbledore inquired pleasantly yes ginny replied she had to watch what she said to keep from incriminating herself using magic in the corridors was against the rules after all and she was standing in a conference with the headmaster and the head boy he has one too had his first in fact the others seemed to grasp her meaning and you haventgone to see madam pomfrey for a spell reversal dumbledore asked not yet she answered harry had to get to charms and i got distracted she explained glancing at theo well just a moment then dumbledore replied he reached around her and flicked his wand mumbling something that ginny couldnthear slowly she could feel her tail begin to retract and absorb back into her tailbone she looked back up at the headmaster thank you it is quite all right he replied kindly he looked as if he was preparing to take his leave mr ramsey miss ramsey if you do not require my assistance any more today i shall return to my office both of the twins nodded and thanked him have a good day miss weasley mr nott ginny and theo returned his wishes and dumbledore strode away the four teenagers watched him until he turned a corner and walked out of sight i very glad to see you ginny offered walking forward to give gretchen a hug she could hear theo and baron greeting each other and shaking hands next to them are you back for good then she asked once she had pulled away a hopeful look on her face gretchen smiled grimly yes but only because it our seventh year as soon as school is out i ll be assuming my mother place on the board of governors for hogwarts and my father place in the ministry ginny eyes widened she was quite impressed but also completely confident that gretchen ramsey would have no trouble taking over her parents roles in elite society she smiled proudly you will do them credit i sure she replied theo nodded in agreement you will make them very proud gretchen he added looking the girl straight in the eye ginny was rather shocked at his kind words then again ginny had never been with theo in the presence of people he didntdislike maybe he was a respectful enough bloke with people he admired and baron ginny asked turning to gretchen twin brother what new responsibilities will the head boy be taking on i will be entering auror training when i have completed my seventh year he replied not taking his eyes from ginny s her eyebrows rose in surprise not what she had been expecting wow she answered and calmed her tone down very impressive was that your intention all along or is your career choice a recent development baron nodded in recognition of what she was aiming at he instinctively wrapped an arm around his sister waist ginny ground her teeth to keep from crying at the sight i applied last fall he began with a glance at his sister but i will not pretend that recent events have not shall we say enhanced the appeal of becoming an auror ginny nodded knowingly she wondered if dumbledore would invite them into the order perhaps he already had i sure you will be a brilliant auror she said holding his gaze steady he was as handsome as ever and just as regal but she could see the contained anguish that showed more openly on his sister face theo moved to shake baron hand again undoubtedly theo added congratulations on being accepted they require the highest qualifications and you will only be an asset to their endeavor thank you both baron replied if he and theo werentfriends it was at least clear to ginny that they held each other in high regard oh theo gretchen inserted almost cheerfully as if remembering something i saw your grandmother at the ministry last week theo uncharacteristically grave expression was replaced with an equally unusual look of soft affection this was turning into one of the strangest conversations ginny had ever had at hogwarts oh did you he asked with interest was it a monday she always goes down there on mondays for lunch with my grandfather gretchen nodded and smiled she was lovely i was feeling particularly horrible that day and some of the ministry administrators were incompetent and the details of the estate were frustrating and i was nearly losing my grip she was so nice and intervened and helped me with the arrangements for the rest of the afternoon and she took me out to lunch with your grandfather she was so wonderful and it really helped me get through the rest of that mess without losing my mind she is a rather nice lady theo admitted with the same sweet smile he had worn at the first mention of his grandmother who knew the snarkiest most sarcastic boy in the school had a soft spot for his elderly relative your grandparents are two of the finest witches and wizards in britain baron added we cannot thank them enough for all the kindness they have shown us over the past few weeks he finished sincerely theo nodded i sure they would say there is no need to thank them your family has always shared their ideals and their notions of civility i know they had a high respect for your parents just as i have great respect for you never doubt that my mother and father aside and at the mention of his parents theo face briefly grew uncharacteristically dark you will always be able to count on the caldwells as your allies theo had practically transformed before her very eyes gone was the cynic the sarcasm the mocking tone the sly smile it was almost as if he had flipped a switch shifting him into proper slytherin mode as he now stood spoke and carried himself he would not be out of place with gertrude wrightman and the head boy in a grand sitting room of a great estate ginny had rarely felt more out of her element and the weasleys she added drawing odd looks from her companions ginny cringed why had she said that they were all from rich and powerful families with the best blood pedigree well at least there ginny didnthave to feel self conscious she knew that her own bloodline was probably more formidable than any of theirs heirs or not but that didntstop her from still being embarrassed at her family poverty well i know my brother ron generally doesntlike slytherins but he a git so it doesntmatter i am your ally at any rate and i reckon harry is too and my family would be if they knew you her rambling was punctuated by an unbearable silence where ginny wondered if she d ever embarrassed herself more then baron let out a small smile we appreciate that he began and ginny was relieved to see his eyes conveying the earnestness of his expression he wasntpatronizing her and ginny let out the breath she had been holding your father great value to the ministry is sorely unappreciated and at this ginny couldnthelp but look gob smacked her father the nutty muggle lover he sees progress and opportunity that has only been squandered and abused by the ministry if they had followed his recommendations over the years it would have been much more difficult for the death eaters to regain such a confident place in britain ginny couldntspeak she was so taken aback and your brothers are all highly respected baron continued two head boys a quidditch captain and two of the most successful self made businessmen in the country and closest friend to the boy who lived we could not ask for more valuable allies thank you let not forget that ginny is the most valuable one of all gretchen inserted smiling on one side a prewett and on the other the seventh child and only girl for seven generations ginny eyes sprang open with shock that gretchen had taken notice of this little known detail had professor wrightman told her with as private a person as her teacher was it was unlikely perhaps these were things that heirs of great families were required to know theo eyes had taken a surprised look at first followed by a nearly triumphant one baron smiled again ginny didntknow whether to feel uncomfortable or pleased with the attention most powerful witch in the school talented flier remarkable bravery and the undaunted devotion of numerous classmates gretchen began not too shabby for a gryffindor theo added they laughed and ginny shot him a grateful look for interrupting she wasntat all comfortable with where the conversation had been going it was like the boys list all over again well thank you for saying such kind things about my family ginny said earnestly but then she turned quite serious but please and here she took turns looking each of the ramsey twins in the eye dwelling on baron s if you ever need anything anything at all donthesitate to ask the expressions of the other three became more serious at her tone she turned slightly toward the boy next to her and that goes for you too you snarky slytherin git theo smiled we will gretchen confirmed but for now i starving she stole a glance at her brother before turning her attention to theo would you be a gentleman and escort me to the kitchens she asked him theo smiled and nodded of course i will he replied extending his arm for her to take ginny thought it seemed like this was part of a game for them not unlike the little game she played with baron with the bowing and the curtsey ing and the proper names until next time miss weasley theo offered smirking and playing up the proper demeanor that ginny found so strange on him see you theo later gretchen she returned with a smile the four finished exchanging salutations and ginny found herself alone in the front entrance of the school with the head boy one look in his anguished eyes and she felt compelled to slowly wrapping her arms around him i so sorry about your parents she said with tears in her eyes and her face in his chest he squeezed her back much more forcefully than she had expected he would thank you he returned with a hint of emotion in his voice ginny shut her eyes tightly at the awareness that it took something soul shaking to make such a reserved and private guy show even that much ginny tried not to dwell on the fact that he smelled really good and he had said all those wonderful things about her family as they broke apart ginny wiped her eyes with her sleeve and watched the boy or was he a man now in front of her and wondered wondered what would happen if she could forsake harry completely if she could just get over him i mean it anything that you and gretchen need i your girl she offered baron smiled not the brilliant one she d gotten after the first quidditch match but a soft sweet one we appreciate it i promise you baron assured her gretchen has always liked that you re your own person not first year i wasnt where had that dark thought come from ginny banished it from her mind but it left an unsettling mark in the back of her mind i think she feels safe leaving hogwarts in your capable hands once she gone ginny smiled she liked gretchen and would be sorry to attend hogwarts without her next year without either of them thanks she replied i hope i live up to her expectations i have no doubt that you will he said there was a pause and then baron went to speak again ginny was glad because she didntknow how to continue the conversation of course if she d known the consequences of his next words she might have been more motivated to blurt something out ginevra he began and she smirked at his use of her full name it amused her even though he d done it a million times before you must know from your brothers experiences that there is a ball held every year following matriculation from hogwarts ginny set her mind on not displaying surprise or emotion the most she allowed herself was a look of curiosity it is held every year as a celebration for the seventh years and their guests yes i remember when bill charlie and percy all went she replied fred and george obviously hadntattended opting instead for a legendary departure out from under the reign of umbridge would you accompany me to the seventh year ball he asked as grandly and graciously as she would have imagined it she couldntspeak for a moment trying to confirm in her mind that he had actually asked her then her mouth curved into a small smile i would love to be your date to the ball she returned pleasantly he smiled again and this time it was that smile from the quidditch match excellent i will keep you abreast of how our plans are proceeding okay she said starting to feel excited about the prospect sounds good well my sister will be waiting to hear your answer and i suppose mr nott will eventually have to attend class sometime today so i must take my leave of course tell gretchen that i cantwait to see what she plans to wear i am positive she will be just as excited to tell you he said kindly there was no doubt that this young man held his sister on a pedestal it was comforting to ginny to know that gretchen deserved it we will speak again soon i sure see you later baron ginny returned she started walking and then stopped and turned back baron she hollered across the hall suddenly remembering their rapidly approaching quidditch match he turned to face her looking expectant good luck this weekend she said sweetly then she smirked you re gonna need it and then he laughed he actually laughed it really was a beautiful sight i would wish you luck in return he began but i dontthink you ll need it ginny tried very hard to keep herself from blushing it was a futile effort they each stood for a moment enjoying the smiles on each other faces before setting off in opposite directions toward their respective common rooms ginny supposed she ought to go to at least one class that day gertrude wrightman wasntsomeone ginny had ever expected to see at a quidditch match though now that she had seen her in the stands at one it seemed rather natural not that the woman cheered oh no but she watched intently interested wearing a hint of green as she sat beside professor snape who glared at everything and everyone on the field in his usual way there was almost something comforting about the consistency of their demeanors the game itself had been surprisingly uneventful for a gryffindor slytherin match no one tried to kill harry slytherin team had been all male and other than baron ramsey and the skillman brothers rather nasty but gryffindor had prevailed in the end and harry had once again sent draco malfoy plummeting into the ground without the snitch in fact the snitch had been the only significant character in the entire outing if ginny thought it took forever in showing itself during the match against ravenclaw that was nothing compared to this time the match had lasted for nearly six hours before the little gold ball had deigned to make an appearance harry made short work of it once it did but in the meantime chasers and beaters alike were thoroughly wearing themselves out ginny had never been more exhausted from playing quidditch baron had played a splendid game and slytherin had actually been ahead in goals due to ron losing his head at malfoy taunting about two thirds of the way through ginny had been impressed with her brother growing skill until he had become unhinged at whatever draco had said to him just past the four hour mark after that the gryffindors had been hard pressed to quash the scoring tear of the slytherin chasers gryffindor actually would have been in the lead if betsy moran hadntmissed three penalty shots the slytherin beaters had clearly made a point of shaking up the young third year chaser and the poor girl had been too nervous to out maneuver baron excellent keeping skills ginny had come out of the match with a broken wrist and a black eye following a collision with malfoy at one point during hour three he had swerved in front of her as she raced to claim a loose quaffle forcing her to slam right into him being several inches shorter and much lighter than malfoy ginny had come off much worse than the stupid git but accidentally elbowing him in the face as she recovered made her feel somewhat better about things her legs were killing her as the broken wrist she sustained had forced her to hold onto her broom and steer with only her legs during the final three hours of the game her quadriceps were positively burning but they had won and remained steadily in first place with only the third and most difficult match against hufflepuff ahead of them at full strength hufflepuff was probably the only team that could challenge gryffindor for the cup their beaters were so good that they had thwarted the other two houses chasers until it didntmatter who caught the snitch in the end the interesting thing was that their wins were by such a small margin seeing as their seeker was weakest of the four that if they lost to gryffindor ravenclaw would edge them out by point differential to play against ginny and her teammates in the final gryffindor would have to lose to hufflepuff by a wide margin and ravenclaw would have to lose to slytherin for the lions to be left out ginny was contemplating all of this as she undid her wrist guards standing in the middle of the pitch as students and fans exited after the game the celebrations had died down and ginny was examining her injured arm picking up her broom and the two wrist guards from the ground she headed toward the school with thoughts of finding madam pomfrey she was testing the range of motion in her gimpy limb when her broom was suddenly jerked out from under her arm ginny whirled around to face the culprit but quickly stopped and rolled her eyes commencing her stroll back toward the school theo fell into step with her that quite a shiner you ve got there miss ginny he offered slinging her broom up against his shoulder she handed him her sweaty wrist guards to hold while she continued to test out her wrist yes remind me to thank your terribly clever housemate for such a lovely decoration she replied sarcastically theo smiled i will she hit him with her good arm so you re going to the seventh year ball with baron ramsey he began without further preface if ginny had been drinking something she would have spit it out instead she turned and looked at her friend with surprise and not a little skepticism yeah so what if i am she asked i just saying that nice liar are you she deadpanned sure i am he continued nonchalantly if anyone had ever mastered the proud slytherin nonchalance it was theo nott actually the almost haughty casualness kind of reminded her of sirius maybe he really had been a black despite himself well then we ve established that i going to the ball with the head boy and that it nice wow theo this is the best conversation we ve ever had including that one in class when we had to brew the anti acne serum and it was so complicated that we only had time to shout ingredients and times at each other for the entire length of double potions he chuckled that was a special one i ll grant you she glared and hit him again he smiled seriously what with the awkward mention of my date that nearly four months away you want to help me pick out new dress robes sorry pal i using the ones i got for my birthday instead of answering her theo moved her good hand out of the way and pointed his wand at the injured one it startled her because it caused them to stop walking but even more so because it was the first time he had ever touched her skin this is going to hurt for a second when the bone resets he warned she nodded not even stopping to consider that perhaps she shouldntbe allowing him to try this he swirled his wand and said the incantation fuck she yelled cringing as the bone instantly reset itself another murmur and flick of his wand washed the pain away task accomplished he began walking again it took ginny a moment to realize that she was standing by herself she jogged to catch up with him where the hell did you learn how to do that she asked strangely exasperated and not knowing why she resumed her examination of her wrist only this time it was in amazement rather than consternation transfiguration where do you think he replied ginny narrowed her eyes liar i ve caught up to you lot in that class and i know you haventlearned advanced healing spells yet theo shook his head slightly and smiled to himself as if he was confirming something in his own mind this made ginny grumpy and she stopped walking barely stifling the urge to stomp her foot what her insistent tone caused him to turn and stop as well he looked her in the eye and smirked go to hogsmeade with me he said not taking his eyes from hers her broom still chucked on his shoulder ginny jaw dropped slightly as she processed the question like in a week on saturday she said for lack of anything else to say that was at all intelligible to her credit however she wasntnearly as thrown here as she had been in the corridor when duncan had asked her in a week on saturday he confirmed calmly nodding once and watching her closely ginny cocked her head to the side a little as her mind cleared and she examined his face then a small smile crept onto hers all right then she replied coolly but the smile grew a little satisfaction burned in his eyes show me how slytherins do hogsmeade i cantsay it all that different from how gryffindors ravenclaws or hufflepuffs do hogsmeade what no secret dark magic clubs and ritual sacrifice she asked with mock surprise he smirked you mean you dontsit around a fire and draw the dark mark on each other arms with black markers here his face darkened quite unexpectedly and it startled her theo she said apologetically pulling his arm so he wouldntwalk away from her hey i sorry you know i dontthink your house is like that theo stared out at the nearly empty quidditch pitch for a moment and then looked at her it not you i apologize dontfeel bad he assured her at least his face had softened a little but she knew she had hit a nerve with her joking comments she recalled the day the ramseys had returned and she had stood and talked with the three slytherins in the front hall theo had said quite a lot about his family theo i know you re not like your father she tried to reassure him his jaw hardened at the mention of a parent he obviously had no love for he let out a hollow laugh but what about my mother am i like her he asked sarcastically ginny wasntat all sure whether the questions were rhetorical or if he expected an answer from her i dontknow anything about your mother ginny admitted she was again reminded of sirius i do know that a person parents dontdefine who they are a friend of mine that i loved very much taught me that no matter how great or rich or old or pure a person family is it doesntdictate their life unless they want it to he frowned for a moment and then looked at her thoughtfully who was this friend sirius black she replied unblinkingly his eyebrows raised in surprise ginny felt a rush of triumph wash through her she liked surprising these slytherins she didntwant them to think they could ever pin her down in a box with the typical gryffindor he made some very difficult choices in his life theo said gravely but with a trace of proud reverence in his voice as he started up the steps to the huge doors of the school ginny followed he probably the only person who hated his parents more than i hate mine why do you hate your parents she asked quietly unable to imagine hating her own even with sirius as a frame of reference my father is a death eater which makes him a coward on top of being a dark wizard a murderer a bigot and very likely a rapist and a thief my mother married him knowing full well the acts he was suspected of committing not because she loved him but because she too is coward he turned to her with a strange expression ironically enough she was a gryffindor to this ginny eyebrows raised she had never heard of a gryffindor siding with voldemort or the death eaters sirius had been associated with them of course but he had been innocent in the end then again she had heard of one peter pettigrew her brow furrowed as she thought of who theo mother could be my mother name was samantha caldwell before she was married he said apprehending the question in her mind she nodded noting that the name sounded familiar we thank merlin everyday she gave up the name caldwell because it means she cantdestroy any more of the family my uncle became the head of the family when she took the name nott and i the head of my family now that my father is in prison they began walking again toward the great hall you seem very close with your grandparents ginny observed trying to move the conversation into a more pleasant topic she obviously chose the right one his face relaxed immediately yes i am much closer with my grandparents than i have ever been with my parents my uncle chad as well he been like an older brother to me what are their names she asked as they strolled past the great hall their common rooms were in opposite ends of the school and not wanting to end the conversation just yet ginny subtly steered them toward the kitchens it would be a good excuse she was starving and thirsty after six hours of quidditch my uncle is charles caldwell he was in ravenclaw five years younger than my mother my grandparents are alistair caldwell and laura creggie caldwell he was in slytherin and she was in gryffindor of all places he smirked at the last part she sounds like quite a lady ginny replied smiling at the knowledge that his grandmother was a product of her own house mrs samantha caldwell nott must have been a bad seed indeed she really is theo confirmed i think the two of you would hit it off remarkably well i think i d like to meet her i curious to see this gryffindor who married a slytherin vocally opposes the death eaters and so obviously has your respect you better be careful theo people might think you re a bit soft she smiled as she said it and he chuckled yes i suppose this is point where i command you to keep my respect for my grandmother a secret or face terrible consequences ginny smiled except that i know you wouldntlet me exact those consequences without a rather furious fight and i in no mood to test my dueling skills against the a first daughter of seven generations ginny rolled her eyes and shoved him again he laughed openly at her exasperation what is the big deal with you people she asked out loud but not angrily why do you heirs know so much about me that question was much more earnest she really was a bit curious about how they all knew the special situation of her birth my dear ginny it is my job to know she glared at him just as it is baron and gretchen responsibility to know as the head of the nott family and a prominent member of the caldwell family it is my duty to know the identities of other prominent witches and wizards in my generation this made ginny wonder why professor wrightman had seemed surprised to find out that ginny was the first daughter in seven generations isntthis something that she would have known then why didntprofessor wrightman know about me ginny asked theo looked at her thoughtfully for a few moments before answering as to that i can only guess he replied yeah so guess already ginny prodded a smile briefly graced his face at her blunt response then his demeanor took on a more serious cast she was supposed to marry sirius black you know he began ginny expression reflected the gravity of recalling the circumstances she nodded so you also know that when he renounced the beliefs and political causes of his family the wrightmans revoked the arrangement even if sirius black had a younger brother to step into the heir role it wouldnthave been the same sirius black was one of the most powerful and influential wizards of his generation even before he left hogwarts even those who sided with the dark lord couldnthelp but respect him regulus black was insufficient to step into his elder brother shoes gertrude wrightman was as much a heavyweight as her former betrothed it would have been an insult for her to marry sirius less worthy brother ginny made to ask the question that had been driving her to distraction ever since she d first found out about the connection between her old friend and her defense teacher but theo must have anticipated her because he pressed on with his answer i cantsay that i dontunderstand why she submitted to the wishes of her parents he raised his hand in a calming motion when ginny face darkened i not saying that i would have done the same thing or that what she did was right i simply conceding that i understand the position she was in and that i can comprehend the reasons behind her decision ginny nodded grumpily i can guarantee you however that what she gained in preserved stature for her family she sacrificed ten times over in personal happiness ginny watched theo as he said this wondering what he truly thought of their professor and her decisions regarding marriage sirius and her family that why she lives in france you know he added this was news to ginny france yes shortly before the end of the first war she moved her family to france the home country of the man she married she lived there ever since it is rather strange though because she has worked for the ministry ever since she left hogwarts this was turning out to be quite the information session she works for the ministry but she lives in france yes but few people know either of those things to be true why because the character of her position with the ministry is such that she is not visible to the public and living across the channel only helps her to maintain a discreet and i would guess a relatively quiet life her husband is much more active in french magical affairs what does she do for the ministry ginny asked but the answer came to her even as theo said it she an unspeakable ginny had heard of them of course but she had never come close to knowing one this added a whole new aspect to her ever more intriguing professor how do you know all this she asked him and dontgive me some dodgy answer that it your job to know i mean it how did you come across information like this my grandparents told me he replied simply at ginny expectant look he elaborated they couldntbe sure that my parents would ever tell me the correct history of that particular time period so they made sure i found out last summer once my father had gone to prison and sirius black was killed fighting his death eater cousin in an attempt to protect harry potter they knew that he had never become a death eater they visited my father in prison and he confirmed it the main part of ginny brain was trying to process all this while the part of her that was constantly resenting her mother kept wondering why it was so much easier for theo to get information than it was for her we all knew that his brother regulus had been a death eater but many of the old families who resisted the dark lord always doubted the official position of the ministry i only knew what i d heard from my mother until sirius black escaped from azkaban i was old enough to tell that my father and his colleagues grew nervous and i began to suspect that my mother had lied to me at that point i was already spending most of my holidays with my uncle family or with my grandparents the next opportunity i had i asked them to tell me the truth and they told me of their suspicions which were compelling after all sirius black was never given a trial no he wasn t ginny agreed she was torn between grateful feelings toward theo for thoroughly believing in sirius innocence and angry ones toward her parents and others for keeping her in the dark for so long she wondered if anyone in the order besides dumbledore knew gertrude wrightman true profession remus perhaps probably professor snape as well they had come upon the entrance to the kitchens and ginny had stopped walking on instinct theo looked at her quizzically or as near to quizzically as was proper for a slytherin what she asked as she tickled the pear in the painting it giggled and the frame swung open theo eyebrows raised in realization i did not know there was a second entrance to the kitchens he admitted there are three actually ginny replied he didntneed to know that she only found out about the third one recently that i know of anyhow knowing this place i wouldntbe surprised to find out there are more dobby and several of his friends met them as they climbed through the portrait hole would miss wheezy be wanting some snacks he asked turning to bow at theo the other house elves bowed several times and her friend would he be liking something too ginny smiled theo seemed somewhat amused yes please dobby this is theodore nott but he likes to be called theo dobby face scrunched in thought and he suddenly began backing away from them the other elves looked at him and seemed torn between serving their masters and following dobby example is miss being sure that master theo be a friend dobby asked warily taking care not to look at theo ginny wondered what on earth was bothering him when it hit her dobby had worked for the malfoys he probably recognized the name nott from lucius malfoy death eater business sparing an apologetic glance at theo she crouched down to dobby eye level motioning for her companion to stand next to her when theo was level she pulled out his arm forcing him to crouch down as well dobby i promise you this nott is a friend she said looking dobby straight in the eye as she did then she tugged theo arms out in turn pulling up the sleeves to reassure the faithful elf that there was no dark mark to be found theo quickly caught on to what was happening and sighed in resignation theo father is a death eater she admitted but theo hates his father theo is my friend and he doesntlike the malfoys okay dobby nodded in evident relief ginny and theo stood up giving dobby orders for pumpkin juice and various foods when the elves had dispersed to prepare the meal ginny went and sat down at a small table in the corner sorry about that she offered as theo joined her he shrugged it not like i haventhad something like that happen before he admitted that doesntmean it right she returned you re absolutely correct only that doesntmean it not going to keep happening i doubt i ll ever lose the tag that my father loyalties have attached to my name the name nott is soiled for the foreseeable future and i cantvery well take the name caldwell the people that matter wontcare and the people that care probably arentimportant ginny decided theo nodded thoughtfully and their food arrived they ate somewhat quietly periodically making jokes or discussing the quidditch match when ginny decided that she really had to take a bath they parted pleasantly having taken showers and accepted numerous congratulations harry and ginny managed to slip out of the gryffindor common room after only an hour of the festivities ensconced in the invisibility cloak they stopped at the kitchens on their way to professor wrightman office the visit served two purposes to have dobby tell their professor that they were coming and to have something to eat and drink that didntcontain either sugar or alcohol as they made their way to the defense classroom ginny felt a draft and shivered her hair was still wet and it had begun to soak through the neck of her jumper harry must have noticed because he turned his head to look at her while they walked are you cold he asked barely above a whisper no she replied you shivered he countered with a bit of a smirk yes my hair is wet why didntyou dry it he asked honestly perplexed it feels clean she answered simply he considered her for a second but seemed to forget that they were still walking and promptly caught his foot on the bottom of the cloak tumbling to the ground ginny only barely kept her balance are you alright she asked with concern but also a slight chuckle yes he replied shortly by the way he was avoiding her eyes ginny guessed he was blushing she smiled endeared by his embarrassment though why he would ever be embarrassed in front of her of all people was beyond her understanding if anyone had been humiliated more times in their life it was ginny so tell me again what this is all about he asked finally after they started walking again ginny bit her lip very glad for the short amount of daylight in the winter and the increasing darkness of the corridors there are things that you need to know she replied not sure what professor wrightman wanted to remain hidden it was frustrating she desperately wanted to tell harry everything that she had seen but she had given gertrude wrightman her word her teacher was trusting her and only because ginny had brashly and inappropriately invaded her privacy in the first place she had made her bed and now she had to lie in it she could hear the clich s echoing in her brain with great knowledge comes great responsibility you re probably going to be angry she added frankly harry turned to look at her quickly why am i going to be angry he said not exactly asking so much as not contesting her conclusion because i know you hate having things withheld from you even more than i do and you re going to be pretty pissed that no one told you any of this already she hoped being honest now would score her some points when he freaked out later but she doubted it would you ve been keeping things from me he asked sounding not a little disappointed there was also a trace of resignation in his voice i wanted to tell you she replied and at least that was the truth so why didntyou he asked a little snarky oh bloody hell he was getting pissed before they even got to the defense room this was going to be even worse than she expected look she said stopping suddenly and turning to him he stopped short as well though ginny wasntsure if he would have were it not for the cloak covering them i saw something i wasntsupposed to and i was asked to keep someone confidence i begged her to let me tell you and now we re here please understand that i wouldnthave kept it to myself if it wasntimportant ginny pleaded she was looking at him earnestly desperate for him to understand that she was between a rock and a hard place harry sighed it about my mum isntit he asked sounding still more resigned and not a little tired partly she replied harry nodded paused in thought and began walking again ginny followed both of them still under the cloak i never thought i would have to worry about you keeping things from me he said ginny couldnthelp but feel the burn of his words but it didntstop her from wondering how he could be so presumptuous after thoroughly ignoring her for the first four years that he d known her you seem awfully invested for someone who only been talking to me outside the d a since the summer she snapped back before she could catch herself harry was clearly startled by her response and she felt terrible as soon as it was out ugh she groaned in frustration covering her face with her hands what is wrong with me why do i say things like that harry seemed even more startled at her self recrimination she didntnotice i thought i already apologized for that he ventured tentatively ginny shot him a glare and he shut his mouth i know you did but things arentthat simple it takes time to get it out of my system can you honestly say that if professor snape said he was sorry for being such a git all these years that you d forgive him and forget about it harry sighed in recognition and shook his head no of course you wouldn t you ve taken years of abuse from him and it left a dent in you it wouldntbe an easy thing to get past no harry said but i certainly wouldntcompare the fact that we werentfriends for five years to the way snape has treated me well of course you werentever mean to me or anything but indifference can be just as hurtful in its own special way so i afraid you re going to have to just face the fact that i had this ridiculous crush on you and i know it wasntyour fault but it left a dent in me okay ginny was grumpy but she liked the fact that she could say these things without quite as much fear of losing his company sorry she added as he studied her thoughtfully he was doing that a lot lately i can see that he answered at last just try to take it easy on me he asked earnestly if you re allowed spiteful comments i allowed to slip up sometimes too i guess i can try that she conceded they rounded a corner and saw light emanating out of the room at the end of the corridor ginny stole a glance with harry and then started toward it she could feel his eyes on her again as they entered the classroom harry immediately tensed it took a moment for ginny to understand his reaction but when she thought of all the professors who had occupied this space and the way they had affected harry she took his left hand in her right without thinking he squeezed it a little in recognition and they walked toward the professor office in the back has miss weasley told you why you re here professor wrightman asked harry he shook his head and their professor pale blue eyes turned to ginny for her part ginny was proud to say she resisted the temptation to stick her tongue out at the woman she hadnttold harry no matter how hard it was to keep that information to herself i know you were in a picture with my mum at school harry said shocking both women ginny because she didntimagine harry could speak so casually about his parents though now that she thought about it of course he could what picture was that the harry was obviously trying to remember the exact wording friendship appreciation day picture professor wrightman took two deep breaths and nodded yes of course in the yearbook you all looked very happy ginny said remembering the way lily evans had laughed occasionally in the photo gertrude wrightman looked at them both it was a good day and then there was silence ginny had to practically bite her lip to keep herself from talking just to fill that silence harry and professor wrightman did not seem to have the same aversion to quiet that she did why am i here harry finally asked you re here their teacher said inclining her head a bit because miss weasley stumbled into my pensieve and decided that there were certain things you ought to know about my past harry shot ginny a quick disbelieving look like what harry asked ginny and then turned to their professor like the fact that i knew your mother knew bellatrix lestrange and the fact that my parents had agreed to a marriage between myself and sirius black wrightman said harry looked upset and confused he shot ginny a look as she shrugged and felt guilty he was going to be so angry you were engaged to sirius nope he didntsound pleased at all promised to him their defense professor corrected ginny rolled her eyes at that shoddy explanation as if harry would accept the distinction of old wizarding customs their families probably set it up when they were born ginny explained to him it an arranged marriage harry looked shocked it was actually really common not too long ago i think some families still practice it ginny would have brought up draco malfoy and pansy parkinson and her suspicions about them if harry hadntlooked so shocked and not a little bit angry why didntyou marry him then harry asked their teacher not even acknowledging ginny explanation uh oh that couldntbe a good sign professor wrightman began to say he broke away from his family when he was sixteen i know harry finished for her but why didntyou marry him their professor looked briefly unsettled because when he left his family it was no longer the arrangement my parents contracted contracted harry repeated somewhat incredulously an edge in his voice that sent warning bells off in ginny head she didntdare touch him right then ginny did spare a glance at professor wrightman though who was looking at harry as intently as he seemed to be looking at her it the way things worked then the older woman said heirs of great families married those whom their families chose and sirius wasntgood enough because he left his dark evil bigoted family harry asked accusingly yes the edge was definitely still there this wasntgoing well at all ginny briefly considered summoning the pensieve and shoving harry into it so that he could find out that way but that still didntfix the problem that harry simply hadntgrown up in a magical family ginny had no idea how they did things like marriage in the muggle world but she knew it probably wasntlike the old families in the wizarding one sirius wasntwhat my parents expected anymore well what about you what did you think of all this it was your life wasntit harry snapped sounding oddly like sirius in the memories ginny had seen and seeing professor wrightman flinch showing what might have been the most vulnerability ginny had ever seen in her ginny knew she saw the parallel too i did what my family asked professor wrightman replied but it was like watching water begin trickling through the cracks of a dam that was about to burst for so many years this petite but formidable blonde woman had said those same words she d said them to sirius almost twenty years before and she d said them to ginny but somehow saying them to harry seemed to break her seamless confidence in that conviction what does your family have to do with anything harry asked families dontdetermine everything about a person and certainly not the people they marry he added fervently gertrude wrightman opened her mouth and shut it but it was the pain in her eyes that caught ginny attention why was this woman fighting back tears at the words that ginny had as much as yelled at her before christmas was it because she knew harry would never understand why would that matter sometimes a person has to do things they would rather not in order to you dontthink i know that harry asked obviously livid you dontthink i know about being bound to something difficult his voice was rising and ginny was resigning herself to an inevitable breakdown of anger and resentment this is different professor wrightman insisted tight lipped and obviously upset but where was her usual confidence where was the unshakeable veneer made out of her moral code why did staring into harry burning green eyes hurt this beautiful refined woman so much how why because you had a choice and i don t because sirius made the right the good the difficult decision and you decided that wasntthe way you wanted your husband to act harry asked not bothering to check his patronizing tone ginny stared at him shocked by his words and his passion unwilling to speak in defense of professor wrightman and yet still finding his anger overwhelming i had an obligation to my family it was her standard line but ginny heard beneath the steel in her voice an undercurrent of regret sirius was my family harry hissed at her standing up ginny stood too becoming more worried by the minute and if he was willing to have you you made the biggest mistake of your life in turning him down i cantbelieve you would do that that you would abandon him just like his stupid family did gertrude entire face closed off and she said not a thing harry ginny asked quietly shocked to hear her own voice whatever he cut in shaking her off if you werentstrong enough to stay by his side when he needed you the most when he might have loved you you didntdeserve him harry said still staring at professor wrightman whose pale face went paler but ginny began quickly cutting herself off as she stared at their teacher who met her gaze without flinching and ginny remembered that kiss their first and presumably their last that she had seen sirius give the seventeen year old gertrude wrightman it broke ginny heart to think that he might have loved her it certainly had appeared that he might in the pensieve i had an obligation wrightman said again standing then too and i did what i could for my family and we survived i cantbelieve my mother was ever your friend harry said with the tone of someone who was disgusted with the sight in front of him that was when ginny saw something break in gertrude wrightman eyes not because you re a slytherin not because you re a snob but because you obviously never cared for anyone but yourself i cared for an entire family it was my job harry laughed grimly do you really expect me to accept that to say that you turning from sirius and staying out of the war is okay because you had an obligation to your family do you see mrs weasley hiding protecting her own first harry asked no her greatest fear is losing one of her children and still she fights and still she loves mr weasley it isntthe same situation you dontunderstand ginny cringed at her teacher response knowing that it would not do anything to endear her to harry who shook his head angrily did my mum understand did she know you chose to break it off with sirius did she approve professor wrightman flinched then staring into harry green eyes and ginny watched with a somewhat nervous awe how horrible it must be to have your best friend disapproval thrown in your face by her son twenty years after the fact but another part of ginny was glad to see gertrude wrightman feel the regret that ginny thought she deserved to feel i fought their teacher tried i fought more than you could possibly know where were you when sirius went to jail harry accused cutting her off again when my mother was murdered to that their professor seemed to have no response harry walked closer to her and said viciously but i glad glad gertrude wrightman asked perplexed but wary two states of mind that ginny never thought she d see in a million years i glad sirius didntmarry you harry said hotly if the blacks approved of you you were obviously never good enough for him harry ginny admonished shocked again at his brashness but their teacher said nothing shut up ginny he snapped at her his face was dark and angry and she wondered if this was what he d been like when he trashed dumbledore office the year before dontspeak to her that way their teacher said quietly but sternly surprising both teenagers she not the one who deserves your anger i dontcare harry shouted back i have more than enough anger to go around why not her i thought she might be the one person other than sirius who wouldntkeep things from me but i was wrong she ll keep secrets when it suits her apparently harry was furious and it was clear that he wouldntbe calming down anytime soon believe that if you wish but it will only hurt you in the long run mr potter ginny was impressed that their defense teacher was audacious enough to be blunt with harry when he was so emotionally volatile you know that she would never knowingly hurt you and yet you storm at her like she meant for you to suffer you arentready to hear the rest of what i have to say right now or you would also know that i would never allow harm to come to you if i could help it i loved your mother she was my best friend sirius black was the only man i ever trusted you wontlet yourself believe me you wonteven let yourself believe your friend come back when you are ready to hear what i have to say when professor wrightman finished harry just stared alternately at their teacher and at ginny he seemed to be practically blind with anguish and resentment and ginny doubted he would be able to sort out what he d been told before the next morning you re lying to me and i dontcare what else you want to tell me the only people who seemed to think i not a complete imbecile were sirius and remus and sirius is dead he glanced bitterly at ginny who restrained the impulse to shove him up against the wall and yell and i thought that at least my friends could be relied on to be straight with me but i guess i was wrong there too harry ginny shouted to get his attention thinking that she could at least try to defend herself but he cut her off dontspeak to me he ordered sternly he shot the two ladies each a disgusted look and stormed out of the room leaving a bewildered ginny and visibly distraught professor ginny hadntseen or heard from harry since he had stormed out of professor wrightman office the night before she had remained behind for a few moments following his dramatic exit watching her very distressed teacher try to pull herself together apart from the sympathy ginny felt for her it was very disturbing to see the usually stoic woman struggle to regain her composure for a minute or so it seemed as if the older woman didnteven know she was still in the room she had appeared to be honestly startled to find ginny still standing there he needed to know ginny had said quietly in response to the silent question the professor sent her way he ll come around and he ll respect you for the strength you gave his mum but he isntready to hear the rest yet he will though i promise and here ginny voice broke it was the same way with sirius but once he accepted sirius ginny recalled running through memories in her mind only death could keep them from each other once he knows how much you loved lily his loyalty will be fierce and then she had left the professor office as she went to bed that night ginny began to think that gertrude had misjudged something just as much as sirius had when they d split up and argued that time she saw in the pensieve sirius hadntbeen able to see the influence and opportunity for good that they could achieve by completing the union between two of the most powerful families in britain but gertrude had missed something as well and ginny wondered if maybe it had finally become clear as harry had ranted and shouted angrily at her with the pained green eyes of her dead friend ginny wondered if gertrude finally realized that no matter how strong your sense of honor no matter how deeply ingrained your priorities and sense of duty the loyalty born of love would always outlast and outshine the brand of loyalty extended only because custom required it her own loyalty to harry would always be stronger and more fierce than any loyalty she might feel toward her brother percy just as sirius loyalty to james and lily potter and to their son overwhelmed any trace of loyalty he might have felt toward his blood relations ginny had fallen asleep shortly after that series of thoughts had run through her mind finally giving her quidditch exhausted body and her emotionally exhausted mind a few hours of peace now she sat in the common room after breakfast chatting in a secluded corner with kerney andy and nadine each of them had sworn they wouldnttell a soul what she was about to say and understood why once ginny revealed her two upcoming dates with significant members of their enemy house much to her surprise andy was the first to speak up well you could do a whole lot worse than theo nott he commented the kernel joined ginny in giving andy a surprised and skeptical look what may have surprised ginny even more than andy comment was the fact that nadine didntseem to think his sentiment was at all strange i ll say this for you gin kerney added you dontaim small do you first you go on a date with duncan moran only the most sought after boy in all of gryffindor if not the entire school now you score a date to hogsmeade with theo nott who might be the brightest bloke in the school not to mention one of the most highly respected slytherins ginny glared at her friend good naturedly as the kernel continued but on the off chance that theo nott isntthe marquee attachment you were hoping for you re going to the seventh year ball with baron ramsey who besides being quidditch captain and the first slytherin head boy in like twenty years really is the most highly respected slytherin in britain after professor wrightman ginny thought to herself but being a muggle born witch kerney might not know what a society heavyweight their defense teacher really was ginny thoughts were interrupted by two very familiar male voices shouting what at the same time turning slightly to see around the back of andy cushy high backed chair ginny could see harry and her brother ron struggling to lunge into the fifth years private conversation from behind hermione attempts to restrain them in the end it seemed that hermione thought it best to try her luck with just keeping ron away from the conversation allowing harry to practically leap over the arm of andy chair his face was livid and his green eyes flashed so is that it then harry asked accusingly as if there was no one else in the vicinity ginny was not at all used to having his attention so directly and exclusively and passionately trained on her the room felt warmer i dontknow what you re talking about ginny returned defiantly and you re really starting irritate me with your condescending tone why wouldntyou have told me at his insistence and deciding that he wasntgoing to lower his voice any time soon ginny stood and grabbed his arm which wasntnearly as easy a thing to do as it had been over the summer and dragged him out of the portrait hole and around the corner to an empty corridor i promised professor wrightman i wouldn t ginny said sternly turning to face him and feeling her temper starting to simmer you ought to be able to understand why i couldntbreak a promise like that not that everything else that business with devon it wasntjust a joke was it it a fucking possibility isntit why wouldntyou have told me that harry asked angrily why wouldntyou have said anything about the fact that you want to marry a pureblood are you mad ginny yelled back not believing what she was hearing her disbelief was so powerful that she didnteven stop to wonder why harry gave a damn who she was going to marry it isntmad harry insisted professor wrightman just said it wasntcrazy and you agreed with her it normal apparently to contract out a marriage for a baby so your obsession with the slytherins obsession ginny repeated incredulous not even really processing the rest of his statement you ve got to be kidding me with this if you re going to marry one of them why even be in gryffindor why even oh shut it you stupid prat ginny snapped do you really think my parents would ever make me marry someone ever are you telling me your parents didntnotice that they were from two old families that you dontstill have the purest blood of practically anyone in the school harry asked ginny couldntsay anything to that her parents had known and she did have exceptionally good blood pedigree of course they noticed but do you honestly think that my mother family would have chosen my blood rich cash poor father to continue the sodding line do you really think arthur weasley the muggle lover would have been their choice ginny let out a strangled noise of frustration sounds to me like that would be a pretty good reason to marry off their only daughter into one of the richest pureblood families in britain he shot back i cant believe you ginny practically shrieked harry eyes were blazing but so were hers she could feel her magic starting to churn violently well if the git was going to attack her like this he could damn well deal with the consequences if something in the corridor exploded it was no skin off her back stupid prat what you cantbelieve that i d be upset to find out you re going to be auctioned off to the highest slytherin bidder she didnteven realize she had slapped him until after the loud crack had resonated in the air for a moment the physical outlet of her anger was probably the only thing that kept her accidental magic from exploding the statue of merlin in the corner as it was the marble figure wobbled precariously on its pedestal harry looked completely shocked his cheek still glowing red from the impact ginny hand stung i going to write off that last comment as temporary insanity on your part since i cant believe that you would ever disrespect my parents and your best friend like that ginny said with a steely voice that was nearly begging him to say otherwise he wisely stayed silent only nodding slightly in recognition or that you d ever think so little of me that i would allow someone to choose my husband for me she added harry cringed and ginny was relieved she had never seen him erupt like he just had and it was more than a little comforting to see a familiar reaction from him now you listen and you listen well she demanded stepping up very close to him i am going to hogsmeade next week with theo nott he a good guy he smart he handsome and he makes me laugh until my stomach hurts but most importantly he asked he the same bloke you defended to hermione last week and the fact that he in slytherin shouldntmatter anymore now than it did then so you ll just go out with any bloke that asks you as long as he first in line harry asked sharply it wasntas aggressive as his previous questions but there was still a hint of nastiness in this tone there was much more nastiness in his demeanor stop being stupid ginny demanded i only went with duncan because he caught me by surprise you saw how that turned out excuse me if i was bloody surprised that anyone would ask me on a date it not like it had ever happened before she reminded him angrily she wasntsure if the anger was at him or at herself for having to choke back tears as she admitted it neville asked you to the yule ball harry insisted ginny rolled her eyes yes after he had already been turned down by hermione really made me feel like i was the belle of the fucking ball harry stop being such a prat she paused and took a few deep breaths it was obvious that harry had some kind of a mental block about this and she had no idea what it could be he was acting like ron and there was no earthly reason why he should bloody hell hadntthey just resolved the fact that he wasnther brother he d never had a problem with theo and baron before and as for baron give me one good reason why i shouldntagree to be the head boy date to the seventh year ball he my friend and i respect him as did you up until this ridiculous display may i remind you his parents were just murdered and even if i didnt already want to go with him i wasntabout to turn him down on the day he returned to school oh so that it a bloke just has to get his parents offed and you ll go out with him no wonder you had a crush on me when you were little little little on top of all the horrible implications of his statement it was the last straw and ginny temper exploded as did her magic her first thought a fervent shut up was immediately manifested as a hex which threw him back against the wall not terribly hard as it had only been a silencing curse but certainly more forcefully than it should have been as it knocked the wind out of him harry caught his breath and gaped at her she saw him reach for his own wand but she was too quick for him her loud expelliarmus and wrench of her hand to the side tore his wand out from his pocket and sent it flying behind her he looked at her with a strange mix of anger awe and surprise then he seemed to catch himself and looked to where his wand lay on the ground in an instant it was back in his hand so he had wandless powers too fancy that what are you going to do harry hex me ginny taunted her anger making her more bold you going to show me who boss the thought passed through her mind that he was probably a far superior dueler but if he wanted to have a go she was more than willing to take out some of her frustration on him but then something changed and a wave of sadness washed over her as his comments finally sunk in she threw her wand on the floor she was suddenly very tired and she could feel tears rushing up to her eyes all she wanted at that moment was to barricade herself inside her four poster and cry what he d said had really hurt she ran a hand over her face i dontknow what to say harry i fifteen years old and i haventthe slightest idea who i going to marry i thought devon comments were just as much of a joke as you did as it turns out i friends with baron ramsey and theo nott makes me laugh baron looks at me like an equal and theo looks at me like i worth something to him i d be crazy to turn them down harry said nothing his features for once not betraying how he was really feeling ginny shook her head and sighed he didntfollow her back into the common room monday found ginny and luna walking back to the school from hagrid after lunch they had nicked food from the kitchens though perhaps saying they had nicked it was a bit of a stretch dobby had been more than obliging the two girls had a custom of visiting their half giant friend once every two weeks or so and the simple fact that hagrid had been so happy to see them served to lift ginny spirits a bit luna had acted as spaced out and odd as usual until they started the walk back to the castle what bothering you she said not really asking as much as stating the fact that something was obviously wrong ginny almost cracked a smile luna would always be perceptive boys are thick and they re more trouble than they re worth ginny decided out loud luna smirked which ones she prompted or should i say what he done this time she corrected i should preface this by letting you know that i ve recently accepted dates with two different boys ginny began oh luna asked ginny had a feeling that luna already knew about at least one of them baron ramsey asked me to be his date to the seventh year ball ginny replied luna eyebrows raised briefly in surprise ah so she must have known about theo yes and i going to hogsmeade with theo nott on saturday luna satisfied almost smile confirmed her suspicions well how about that she answered oh shut it ginny returned with little hope of it actually occurring luna smiled i think it good for you both of them are good for you you say that and yet the fact that i going on a date with each of them is completely alienating the one boy i really want which is in turn making me completely miserable have you thought about why that might be luna asked ginny thought that luna could stand to be a tad less patronizing donteven suggest that he jealous that ridiculous get it out of your head right now there is no possible way he acting like a complete git because two slytherin boys beat him to the punch he just channeling ron and bitter about slytherins and resenting the hell out of everyone not that i dontthink he deserves to vent every now and then i just wish he didntfeel compelled to vent it on me he can be very nasty when he wants to be ginny brow furrowed as she remembered the things he had said she hadntseen him or spoken to him since you keep thinking that if it gives you piece of mind luna said smirking oh why dontyou go snog sheldon ginny retorted luna smiled as she kept right on talking i think he discovering that he not the only boy who noticed you and he angry at himself for blowing his chances especially since you ve been right there in front of him all this time and i think he so sick of being brave when people are trying to kill him that he doesntwant to feel guilty about being absolutely terrified when he thinks about asking you out but he is and he does and it makes him angry no more talking ginny replied grumpily but that just me luna finished as if ginny hadntsaid anything and i not very smart or the least bit perceptive only luna could have managed to say such a ridiculously false statement without her mouth quirking into a smile ginny groaned at her friend obnoxious but credible inferences she shoved her out of frustration which sent luna into fits of laughter as they continued toward the school they became absorbed in a shoving match alternately laughing and trying to knock each other over luna enjoyed it because it was further proof that she had a true friend ginny was just glad to get harry off her mind for a little while given the roller coaster of events that transpired over the weekend ginny was more than a little surprised to see harry walk through the door of the room of requirement tuesday night for their usual potions session devon seemed nonplussed despite the fact that she had been informed of the events of the weekend ginny had not been surprised to find that devon knew about both of her dates but was able to elaborate on the scuffles with harry that had occurred in the meantime while ginny gave him credit for showing up at all and secretly gave thanks that he wasntgoing to completely abandon the friendship they had finally built it was evident that he was not at all comfortable with being there luckily devon was a pro at cutting through bullshit and following some unbearably awkward hello they were soon plunged into the depths of how to properly constitute an anti swelling draught and why the characteristics of murtlap changed in a certain way when combined with something as innocuous as mint leaves the d tente was threatened however when they took a break for snacks and pumpkin juice hey i need to tell you guys something harry spoke up tentatively ladies harry devon interrupted casually like a mother correcting a small child english not guys we re ladies harry stopped in his train of thought and looked momentarily confused devon had interrupted his process of working up the nerve to say what he wanted to say and it clearly discombobulated him ginny tried very hard not to giggle at his confusion she didntknow how long or how very very short his fuse was at the moment er right ladies um i can only do potions once a week from now on after this week i mean i have to do extra stuff with dumbledore ginny was skeptical he was obviously still having issues with being around her and she wouldntput it past him to tough out this first meeting in order to make his life easier later on the thing about harry was he was so unsure of himself around people in general that it was hard to tell whether he was really trying to avoid her or if he was just being his usual tentative self however recent developments in his personality the slightly more audacious harry that had called out andy after the list and had asked her who she d chosen in the question game pointed toward the former much to ginny chagrin okay devon replied as if harry was acting completely normal which day do you want to cancel devon attitude pretending that there wasntthe slightest bit of tension in the room would have been completely believable to any outside observer but it was driving ginny crazy she sensed that devon was maneuvering to force one or both of them to get their issues out on the table and ginny had to admit it was starting to work er thursdays i guess so beginning with next week we only meet on tuesdays devon clarified still all business ginny wanted to push her down the stairs is that right ginny froze as she saw a set of stairs suddenly appear in the corner of the room crap it seemed the room was particularly sensitive to her inclinations today er yeah that right ginny let out a breath in relief when the stairs disappeared merlin i was being sarcastic at any rate she had to get a better grip on herself she had a feeling they would be hashing things out before they left for the evening if devon had anything to say about it and at the moment it seemed that she did harry was looking nervously back and forth between the pseudo oblivious devon and a grumpy ginny he must have sensed something was afoot well good ginny didntwant him to be any more comfortable than she was perhaps we should meet for an hour longer on tuesdays to make up for the lost time a bit devon suggested if ginny wasntso annoyed it would have been almost comical to watch as devon kept forcing harry to speak uh okay he agreed reluctantly i propose that we meet thirty minutes earlier and end thirty minutes later devon continued almost as if harry hadntspoken that way we dontcut into other activities very much ginny wondered if devon really cared about saving potions time at all or if she was merely doing this to artificially amp up the tension in the room somehow she doubted it was the former that sounds fine i guess harry agreed by the look on his face he was definitely confused and wondering what was going on i just dontwant to cut into my beauty regimen any more than is necessary devon added and that was where ginny drew the line beauty regimen oh for the love of merlin ginny shouted bringing a satisfied smirk to devon face ginny turned to harry harry are you sure you re not just doing this because you re still mad at me no he insisted a little too quickly ginny thought i mean yes i sure that not the reason dumbledore told me i have to meet with him more often and i wontgive up quidditch for potions ginny quirked an eyebrow in suspicion i swear harry said indignantly you can ask ron he was there when mcgonagall came to get me well good ginny replied i dontknow what you re so worked up about anyway harry face darkened as she raised her voice well what am i supposed to think when you re out cavorting with slytherins he replied hotly he turned to devon sorry devon shrugged she was too busy watching the show to care for a swipe at her house that harry probably didntmean anyway cavorting what is the matter with you why canti go on a bloody date without you and ron starting a world war over it ginny wanted very much to know you stood in this room just a few weeks ago defending my friendships with theo and baron and devon to ron and hermione what so wrong with them now what different now from a week ago you werentgoing to marry one of them a week ago he shouted you werentliving by some stupid list of slytherins who she says you re allowed to love harry pointed accusingly at devon on the word she devon cut in finally her calm but authoritative voice silencing ginny and harry immediately harry you re not an artless jerk so dontact like it and while you re at it you might recall that you were included on the list and you re not a pureblood you were one of the top two i proposed in fact dontput words in ginny mouth it doesntdo anyone any good and does you the least good of all devon seemed to grow a bit impatient as she continued setting him straight besides you know very well that the day might come when you will be thankful to have true allies in slytherin and ginny relationships with baron and theo are your best prospects other than me the ramseys and the caldwells are both extremely powerful families and neither baron and gretchen nor theo have any affection for the dark lord harry looked back and forth between devon and ginny suspiciously as if they had ganged up on him which ginny supposed they kind of did only it wasntlike ginny had up and asked devon to intervene their sly friend had simply called it like she saw it as she tended to do as harry entertained female conspiracy theories devon watched with a condescending expression on her face that plainly demonstrated how thick she thought he was being ginny was trying to look surprised that devon had spoken when it became clear that harry wasntin any hurry to speak devon picked up the slack again the last thing i ll say on the subject is this ginny will never marry baron or theo unless her first choice dies before he realizes what important what that supposed to mean he snapped ginny face was in her hands for once she was glad he was thick devon had just given her away oh the humanity there was a small part of her that just wanted to end the suffering on her end and slap him upside the head while yelling that she was in love with him idiot use your somewhat undersized gryffindor brain and figure it out devon scolded the hat wanted to put me in slytherin you know harry insisted defensively but you used your undersized gryffindor brain to argue against that didntyou harry didntsay anything which was enough of an answer for devon who smirked thank you for proving my point for me harry was thoroughly put out but it was more because he had no retort for devon last statement than because he harbored any lingering anger at ginny at least he seemed to have comprehended the fact that ginny wasntall but running down the aisle with various slytherins now shall we get back to work devon proposed we should really finish intermediate medical potions this week if our meeting time is going to be cut down and back to work they went harry periodically glancing at ginny and ginny trying not to notice when he did author notes thanks so much for the comments and feedback i sincerely apologize for the long wait but hopefully a nice long action packed chapter will get me back in your good graces enjoy and no gertrude did not marry christian this chapter is long overdue and dedicated to grimm sister because she a brilliant writer and a great h pot friend now on with the story chapter 12 coming to a head ginny and harry were walking solemnly back to the gryffindor common room from the defense classroom having had a second much more peaceful conference with professor wrightman their cheeks were tear stained and their eyes were red but there was no trace of sadness in their expressions his face was the picture of grim but bolstered determination hers of ferocity and fire the two teenagers had sat quietly while their defense professor explained to harry the extent of her relationship with both his mother and his godfather when she seemed to have finished harry softly spoke asking the first of many questions that he had for her about lily and sirius and even james and in answering that first question gertrude wrightman finally saw what ginny had told her she would find once harry got over the initial shock of who she was she saw a hardening regard and a heightened respect that she couldnthelp but return and how could she not with lily eyes her humility her utter selflessness and the same incredible knack for attracting the unconditional loyalty of everyone he befriended and with his unwavering trust and love for sirius gertrude finally allowed herself to feel the kinship with harry that she had kept at bay for her entire adult life and she saw the steadfast fervent and almost wild devotion of the person at his side she knew that devotion that bottomless affection that lightening of the eyes and the heightened awareness that transformed ginny countenance when harry walked into a room it may be appearing on a young woman now instead of a young man but it was unnervingly familiar nonetheless harry had apologized before they sat down meekly and honestly as was his way and they had proceeded as if nothing had happened they were passing the great hall both teenagers deep in thought when harry stopped suddenly and went to open one of the hall doors ginny hesitated and followed stopping when she came up behind where he was leaning against the doorframe she squeezed in next to him and he glanced at her before returning his gaze to the hall i ve always wondered what this place was like when my parents were here he said finally he spoke so quietly that she had to lean in to hear him clearly it was hard to tell whether he was talking to her or to himself like were my dad and sirius like the twins once i saw what they did to snape and how much my mum seemed not to like them i couldntever be sure that they were as good as everyone says well people always exaggerate goodness or evil a bit when other people die your parents were seen as heroes so naturally everyone remembered the best parts of them but for sirius since everyone thought he had betrayed them everyone exaggerated his flaws except for remus and professor wrightman especially remus and professor wrightman at this harry turned his head quickly to look at her curiously harry think what was your first reaction to sirius when you heard that he had betrayed your parents harry paused as he recalled his thoughts and then nodded in realization i was furious he conceded and you didnteven know him yet imagine how they must have felt remus was his best friend and remember last time professor wrightman said that sirius was the only man she ever trusted harry frowned and the ones who hated him the most the death eaters bellatrix and voldemort they all knew it could never have been him and you can bet that bellatrix and voldemort probably exaggerated his goodness of course they hated him too just for the opposite reason harry sighed so what am i supposed to think very few things are as black and white as we d like them to be take snape is he an enormous git sure he is but he puts his life on the line every day for the order and in particular to keep you alive so what does that make him he hated your father and your godfather he called your mother a mudblood and as far as we can tell he doesntseem to be any more inclined to like you either but he brilliant and he on our side in a pinch we can be on the same team and we could probably work together but if someone asked you about him you d probably say that you hate him or that he a mean bastard so my parents and sirius werentperfect i get it ginny smiled actually as far as i can tell your mum nearly was perfect i have never heard a single negative thing about her not from professor wrightman not from sirius not from remus not from anyone harry seemed to calm a little at this observation he was quiet for a while and ginny couldntbe sure what was going through his mind after a bit he cast his gaze around the great hall lingering on each of the house tables one by one i love this room he said at last not as much as the common room or my dormitory or even the quidditch locker room but i feel like i can trace my life through this room i d agree with you there ginny added but i think i would add the room of requirement and the kitchens to your list harry smiled at the mention of them there certainly hadntbeen any bad memories for either of them in those two rooms nodding and smiling obviously running through pleasant memories harry backed away from the doors and ginny fell into step with him as they resumed their trip back to the tower so he said when they were approaching the fat lady ginny glanced at him and he slowed to a stop just outside where the fat lady would be able to hear them so ginny asked expectantly harry looked up and directly into her eyes so tomorrow hogsmeade he elaborated somewhat ah yes hogsmeade that would explain the slightly obtuse conversational skills yes it is and you re going to hogsmeade with theo nott yes on a date yes then to ginny surprise harry cracked a small smile okay i just wanted to clear that up so now hopefully i wontcome and sit down at your bloody table and order you butterbeers like an enormous git ginny laughed harry looked rather proud of himself for being the cause even if you did i rather doubt that theo would be as ungracious as duncan of course he wouldn t he quite a catch that theo nott and here though harry was making a commendable effort to be good humored ginny could tell that he still wasntparticularly pleased about her date his smile didntreach his eyes not by a long shot well at least i dontthink he would cheer against me in quidditch ginny joked hoping that the reference to michael corner who neither of them particularly liked would lighten the mood it helped a little that true harry agreed there was a somewhat tense pause in which it seemed like harry was deciding whether to tell her what was preoccupying him harry ginny prompted as unobtrusively as she could manage he looked up at her again is there something on your mind she bit her lip as she anxiously waited for him to answer he took a few moments before answering and seemed to be examining her face do you like him a lot he asked almost whispering but maintaining eye contact with her it was as if by whispering the question wasntas big of a deal ginny wasntsure how to answer she felt a fleeting urge to try and make harry jealous but given his personality she doubted that would help her cause with him but she also didntwant harry to think that she didntcare about theo i do like him a lot a nearly imperceptible flinch went through him i not sure how much that is though he not like most boys i know she paused for effect then again neither are you harry gaze snapped forward to meet her own if only they knew that the same thought was passing through each of their minds too bad this is the last hogsmeade trip of the year ginny he began in somewhat of a rush if i mean to say would you that is do you think that oh bollocks he shoved his hands in his pockets and stared at the floor ginny heart was beating so fast she thought it might burst out of her chest harry glanced at the portrait as if he were seriously considering making a break for it ginny wasntsure what he had been so anxiously tempted to ask her but she didntwant to discourage him whatever it was harry she ventured softly he instinctively looked up at the sound of her voice before remembering his embarrassment and fixing his gaze somewhere in the proximity of ginny shoulder er yeah i hungry let go to the kitchens he visibly sighed with relief and then he actually smiled all right he held out his hand let go to the kitchens she took his hand and off they went ginny and theo met up in front of the great hall the next day just after breakfast ginny found that she couldntstop smiling theo appeared to be exceedingly albeit quietly pleased with himself they walked and chatted about a number of things including potions various members of theo house quidditch and their families unlike her date with duncan ginny found that their conversation made the trip pass by quite rapidly before she knew it they were approaching quality quidditch supplies where theo noticed her pretending not to look at the window display smirking pleasantly he asked her if she would like to browse and once she admitted that she did opened the door to let them inside they spent quite a while in the shop and ginny found that although he did not play himself theo was very knowledgeable and very interested in the game his team was the kenmare kestrels which while not the chudley cannons was evidence that he was a true fan and not a bandwagon type he explained that while he loathed everything about his parents and all associated with them he had first been introduced to quidditch when he was very young and as the nott estate is located in county kerry in southwestern ireland kenmare was the local team and the natural object of his undying allegiance he also elaborated that while he spent most of his holidays with his caldwell relations whose ancestral estate was situated in northern ireland he never took to supporting their team the ballycastle bats as they continued to stop and check out many of the items in the store the first two games of gryffindor season as well as the approaching match with hufflepuff came up several times while he certainly had his own opinions ginny was pleased to discover that he wasntlike ron and michael corner in the sense that he could respect someone else views without necessarily agreeing quidditch discussions with ron and with michael when she was still dating him always deteriorated into angry shouting matches because those two boys always had to be right when ginny had seen her fill they left the store and walked to the three broomsticks on theo suggestion ginny was thrilled that he didnteven glance in the direction of madam puddifoot s ginny volunteered to order them butterbeers from the bar while theo agreed to find them a booth both the fact that he was a relatively mysterious slytherin sixth year and the fact that he had walked into the pub with ginny weasley in full view of all the student patrons made theo task significantly easier than it would have been for the average student ginny matched rosmerta smile as she approached the bar so who is it this time rosmerta inquired indirectly alluding to ginny last date with duncan moran ginny smiled this time rather than rolling her eyes theo nott he my partner in potions madam rosmerta eyebrows lifted slightly in recognition of ginny good humor well you certainly seem better pleased with him than the last bloke you brought in here the hostess commented ginny expression displayed her agreement and relief definitely it probably helps that i actually like him rosmerta laughed yes i think that would make dating a bit easier ginny face seemed glued into a smile rosmerta lifted their drinks to the counter we ll be having lunch in a bit but no rush ginny said thanks for the drinks rosmerta nodded in recognition and ginny turned to find theo and their table this action was violently disrupted by someone knocking into ginny as she turned thoroughly soaking her bare arm in butterbeer neville a familiar voice chastised ginny looked up to see a horrified neville and behind him a concerned looking harry luna was standing somewhat to the side but was obviously with their party sorry ginny neville cried picking up the mug that had fallen to the floor at their collision luna reached her wand around to cast a drying spell on ginny wet arm thanks ginny said to her in response then she turned to neville with a small smile no harm done neville accidents happen i ll just get new drinks then her gaze found harry hey harry he didntquite smile but certainly didntlook displeased to see her either hey gin sorry about this no worries harry she assured him glancing at his company ginny smile broadened i see you ve found some good company this time did the other two run off again and leave you in the dark harry laughed yes i have and yes they did well i glad about the first part and i dontreally know what to say about the other thing ginny responded thoughtfully do you think we should clue them in that we know harry shrugged i cantdecide if it would horrify them or relieve them to know that we know i think they deserve a little of both to tell you the truth ginny said harry smiled wryly i think i agree with you then maybe we can let them know tomorrow she suggested sounds like a plan harry agreed smiling slightly he held her gaze for a moment and then looked to his two companions neville was turning from the bar with new drinks for ginny and luna was speaking to him as he did so when ginny turned to thank neville for fetching the butterbeers she thought she saw harry sneak a glance at theo sitting by himself in a booth in a far corner of the pub thanks neville you neednthave done that neville smiled sheepishly it was the least i could do for dumping the first ones all over you ginny smiled and said goodbye to him and luna luna responded cheerfully that ginny should remember to avoid kissing people because if not done exclusively to one soul mate it could cause a person to sprout warts on their arms harry face and ginny suspected her own was flushed red when they turned to each other to part ways ginny couldnttell if luna was hinting at something or just being spacey as usual harry cleared his throat nervously erm see you later ginny have i hope you have a nice time today ginny smiled though not without a considerable degree of self consciousness thanks harry i ll see you at dinner and with that she took the drinks back to the table where theo was waiting for her ginny hoped luna wouldntdecide to take matters into her own hands on the subject of her and harry and any feelings they may or may not have for each other when she arrived at the booth theo had commandeered the young man looked very much like he had been observing the entire exchange from across the room his first words to her were a bit startling neville longbottom and luna lovegood were the other two students who went with you to the department of mysteries last year werentthey he asked ginny blinked ah yes they were do people not know that she confirmed and wondered aloud she had thought that between dumbledore and the daily prophet most of the wizard families had gotten some sketch of what had gone on at the ministry of magic the previous june perhaps she had been mistaken no most people dontknow that i reckon the prophet only said six students including harry potter were involved in the events that occurred in the department of mysteries from my family i know that you your brother and hermione granger were three of the others but i didntknow that longbottom and lovegood were the final two ginny brow furrowed dontworry i wonttell anyone ginny eyebrows rose slightly as if she did not quite believe him okay so perhaps i might say something about it to devon pearce ginny smirked knowingly did they already know each other so well i know she replied and if you happened to mention it to the ramseys or professor wrightman i would not see a problem but that is really as far as it ought to go theo assured her of his discretion and their conversation took a different though no less intriguing turn i get the impression that harry is not particularly pleased that you accepted a date with me he commented in the way one might suggest that it might rain later his manner disarmed ginny momentarily since she was still not quite used to such directness in the discussion of awkward subjects um i not quite sure how i supposed to respond to that she admitted theo nodded in apparent agreement i mention this because he has never paid me much attention during the nearly six years we ve been in school together but ever since you agreed to spend the day with me today he has shall i say been much more attentive of my existence well he can be very protective when it comes to ron and my family ginny said not at all convincingly she didntparticularly care how convincing she was though since she hardly knew how she wanted to respond in the first place i dontthink that is where his particular concern stems from in your case theo replied with no small amount of insinuation in his tone ginny gulped oh not theo too first hermione then luna and now theo was her date really attempting to tell her that harry was jealous ginny was a bit tired of waiting for theo to come to his point then what do you think theo she began her voice rising slightly that harry likes me that he jealous because i ve come to hogsmeade with you instead of him dontbe ridiculous he seen me practically every day for the last four years he had plenty of opportunities to ask and what more he knew i had a thing for him when i was younger it would have been a right sure thing to ask me to hogsmeade but he never did there no way that he cares that much about who i go to hogsmeade with okay so maybe that was a lie he had brought it up the previous night and she certainly remembered the way his eyes never seemed to match his supportive remarks theo looked skeptical would it still be a sure thing theo asked shaking ginny from her ambivalent inner monologue what she replied her voice reaching heights in pitch that she hadntpreviously known to exist it a simple question i would merely like to know where i stand for the love of merlin they hadnteven ordered lunch yet and he asking where he rates couldntshe at least get a whole date in the books before the boy wackiness started up again what was it with her dates and the moments just before they ordered lunch well seeing as we haventeven been on a whole date yet how about i let you know by the end of the day theo paused for a moment and then nodded that seems reasonable he conceded ginny was flabbergasted did all slytherins take so direct an approach to romantic relationships at first the attentions of baron ramsey and theo had been refreshing in their frankness but now ginny wasntsure she could take much more of this they had been growing closer and getting to know each other at such a nice pace and now he d gone and nearly spoiled it put it this way she began pausing to make sure she actually wanted to say what was on the tip of her tongue you and harry are the only boys that i would agree to go to hogsmeade alone with where i would actually look forward to the trip but seeing as he didntask me and you did what he thinks doesntmuch matter at the moment does it at this submission theo face curved into the somewhat sly somewhat triumphant grin that only she though ginny didntknow it could bring out in him no he admitted i suppose it doesn t and with that madam rosmerta arrived at their table to take their lunch orders ginny and theo thought about and looked at nothing but each other until late afternoon when they began the trip back to hogwarts and when unfortunately there was indeed quite a bit more to think about and look upon besides each other ginny and theo were walking casually up a small hill as they left the outskirts of the wizarding village the turrets of the castle and the quidditch rings came into sight as they overtook the mound but any musings they might have shared with each other were cut off by a particularly urgent yell ginny look out harry shouted and by pure instinct ginny fell to the ground eyes searching out danger and arms groping for theo who she had tugged down with her she heard footsteps pounding and glanced up to see neville and harry rushing to meet dementors six of them coming out of the small patch of woods that ran up one side of the small hill harry kept glancing toward her and ginny thought that if he kept it up he might get himself killed or seeing as they were dealing with dementors much much worse as she looked down at theo she caught luna slight form running to stand with harry and neville in her peripheral vision she glanced at her somewhat startled date can you conjure a proper patronus she asked him quickly he nodded briskly his face all business what form does it take she had to be sure for everyone safety but for theo in particular a dolphin he replied immediately then let go help them she said rising and pulling him up with her just as she did he pulled her back down and rolled them over simultaneously ginny felt the temperature plummet there were more of them without thinking ginny hugged theo tightly much to his distraction and not unpleasant surprise and whispered the apparation spell whisking them across the mound just as she could feel the coldness creeping in again they reappeared about fifteen behind the other three and ginny was almost immediately on her feet harry neville and luna were starting to feel the pressure of holding the patronus charm for a long period of time expecto patronum theo voice rang out followed quickly by ginny own only where theo dolphin came wooshing out of the end of his wand ginny patronus sputtered need a happy memory she chastised herself what was the one she d used with remus oh yes the chamber of secrets suddenly images of giant serpents mysterious older boys and clumsy saviors filled her head and as she began to re live the joy of seeing harry arrive to save her in her mind she heard faint shouts around her her head cleared briefly reminding her of the danger at hand and she dropped her wand thrusting out her arm and pointing with only a finger at the rushing dementors on pure instinct expecto patronum she thundered and harry came swooping forth much like the real version was apt to do on his broom patronus harry went at the now ten dementors slashing at them with his sword and joining harry stag theo dolphin neville thick vines and luna unicorn in their swirling battle with the dementors suddenly harry stag fizzled and ginny looked to find him staring at her in utter disbelief so he d seen her bloody patronus at last well now he d regret teasing her about it wouldnthe but there was no time to be humiliated with twice their number in dementors trying to get at them they were much weaker with harry patronus out of the picture and ginny struggled to hold up her own charm with one hand while she shoved harry hard to the ground with the other knocking him out of his temporary shock get up we need your patronus she insisted and harry snapped back into boy who lived mode with one smoldering look at her a look that sent shivers up her spine he closed his eyes and re cast his patronus conjuring a stag nearly twice as big and more than twice as bright as the other charms ginny briefly wondered what memory he had used to cast the spell patronus prongs gored dementor after dementor drawing their attention away from the others and allowing the other four teenagers to pause and re cast them this second casting drew brighter and larger patronuses from neville ginny luna and theo but none were as grand or as blinding as harry s they had all used different memories this time around ginny had been a recollection of the time they had first found herpo in her bathroom messing about in the toilet paper at spinner end though they were holding out pretty well so far ginny knew they wouldntbe able to last very long and the dementors would be ready to pounce on them when their charms gave out harry must have realized this too because ginny heard him call out theo can you apparate he shouted over the noise from their struggle yes the answer came back and ginny heard her name next the wind seemed to have picked up significantly ginny you ll have to apparate yourself and luna to the castle gates theo and i will get neville ginny nodded it was becoming downright blustery now not to mention cold and the wind was almost completely swallowing their words ginny put three fingers in the air and counted them down running toward luna as she did on zero she practically leapt onto her friend and shouted apparatus in the slight hope that yelling the incantation would add power to the spell before she could blink the two of them landed with a significant thud at the gates to the castle and they rushed inside screaming alternately for professor mcgonagall professor wrightman professor snape and the headmaster when they had made it half way to the large doors of the castle they heard a loud crack and turned to see the three boys tumble out of thin air at the foot of the gate luna screamed as they both noticed that one of the dementors had gotten through the apparation with them and still had a firm grip on harry ankle this sent ginny and luna running back toward the gate but not before ginny sent a strong reductor curse toward the large heavy doors of the school one of the doors exploded and ginny hoped it would attract the attention of a faculty member in time to help them theo had already cast a patronus by the time they reached the boys and it looked like harry was able to wrest his ankle away from the dementor but as ginny looked up to see whether any teachers were coming to help them she noticed that the several dementors they had left on the other side of the hill were fast approaching there was no apparating on hogwarts grounds but she had to hope that there would be some kind of protection against the dark creatures inside the gates of the school run she yelled yanking on the nearest arms she could reach which turned out to be luna and harry s she took off with the other four fast on her heels harry soon overtook her and by the time they were half way to the doors of the castle they saw dumbledore and professor wrightman appear in the area around the damaged door if she hadntbeen panting from an outright sprint ginny would have sighed with relief the thought briefly crossed her mind that she could be severely punished for damaging school property professor wrightman spotted them first pointing and drawing dumbledore attention at nearly the same time ginny felt someone tug on her shirt and she stopped running it was neville and ginny turned with the others to see professor mcgonagall and professor flitwick emerge from the side of the castle casting powerful patronus charms to give the teenagers some cover the five of them shared a look and jogged the rest of the way to the headmaster still not particularly comfortable with dumbledore ginny began spilling the story of what happened to professor wrightman they were all ushered inside the castle as she spoke and dumbledore transfigured the remnants of the old door into a new one they were eventually led up to dumbledore office with ginny explaining all the while during a pause when ginny was nearing the end of her tale dumbledore inserted a question and how did one of our front doors come to explode off of its hinges he asked her not unkindly the three boys seemed surprised that the destruction of the door had anything to do with their encounter ginny swallowed and took a deep breath glancing at professor wrightman for reassurance the defense professor didntlook angry and ginny took that to be a good sign well when luna and i were running to get to the castle ginny began we were screaming for help but with the wind and the distance to the castle i thought it was unlikely we would be heard once we saw that a dementor had come through with the boys we had to go back and help and the only thing i could think of to get your attention was blowing up the castle door and i supposed it worked because here you are dumbledore pondered this and professor wrightman sent ginny the slightest of nods ginny hoped rather than believed it was a nod of approval but what else could they have done sent and owl honestly dumbledore put his head in the fireplace and from the hushed sounds ginny could make out it sounded like he was floo calling the ministry well good perhaps the ministry of magic would still be good for something they spent the better part of an hour in dumbledore office answering questions professor mcgonagall returned at that point to report that the dementors had been contained by aurors and were presently being transported away from the school grounds this news allowed ginny a small bit of relief though she was hardly confident that either the aurors or the people of britain would be particularly safe when mcgonagall and flitwick departed a silence descended over the five students and two faculty members after a moment the headmaster spoke i must admit i rather expected miss granger and mr weasley to be involved in this little adventure and not mr nott he observed harry and ginny shared a look since they had an idea as to what might account for the absence well we re not quite sure where they are at the moment ginny began harry looked as if he might smile but it was interrupted by a shiver after effects of exposure to dementors no doubt noticing this professor wrightman disappeared briefly behind some shelves at the far end of the room and returned with numerous chunks of honeyduke chocolate harry eyes widened with approval and he looked relieved they thanked their teacher who resumed her seat harry spoke up after swallowing his first few bites of candy actually we haventseen them since last night ron was gone when i woke up this morning the two instructors glanced at each other not looking alarmed but perhaps preliminarily cautious we re pretty sure we know what they re up to though ginny interjected to ease the adults concern oh professor wrightman spoke this time and what reason do you suppose they have for disappearing i think what harry and ginny are alluding to is the fact that weasley and granger fancy each other and go off to er express their mutual affection behind harry back theo responded when neither harry nor ginny looked particularly inclined to explain ah dumbledore rejoined i see well just to be safe i think we ll fetch them anyway he sent fawkes off with the task harry and ginny both looked slightly impressed that theo had caught on so quickly or maybe ron and hermione were just as bloody obvious to everyone else as they were to harry and ginny this course of action decided upon the five students were dismissed and sent back to their dormitories neville begged off to check on a special project he was doing for professor sprout and luna parted with them almost immediately as the ravenclaw dormitories were in an altogether different section of the castle this was how ginny was left solely in the company of harry and theo awkward so ginny said turning to begin walking away from the headmaster office behind her back the boys shared a glance as if to say does she really think she getting away so easily they were both curious and both determined to be satisfied about that curiosity when they didntfollow her ginny stopped and turned well are you coming i think perhaps we should discuss some things first theo offered ginny brow furrowed and then her eyebrows shot up as she realized that the whole lot of them had seen her patronus oh bloody fuck well the jig is up i suppose you do she returned stalling without any real effort to disguise it yes we do harry agreed then talk ginny prompted harry and theo looked at each other each in the hopes that the other wanted to speak first when it became apparent that this was obviously not the case harry sighed and began working up the nerve your patronus he began a little nervously but looked to be gaining resolve ginny jaw hardened in an attempt to keep herself from blushing was that me ginny supposed the fact that he was surprised rather than horrified was something to be relieved about yes harry looked like he might collapse theo broke momentarily from his thoroughly pensive expression to glance at harry with slight concern as to his ability to remain upright they both looked back at ginny when she spoke up again it shouldntbe a surprise should it she went on sounding much more even and confident than she felt did you notice the sword you were carrying it was the one you had when you came to get me in the chamber of secrets a patronus is a protective charm it not much of a stretch to think that the person who saved my life when i was a child symbolizes safety and protection to my subconscious she wondered if she had sounded as matter of fact as she hoped but it wasntmy 12 year old self who came out it was me as i am now harry returned well when i see you and think about you it usually the way you are now yeah ginny answered a little defensively it not like i think of you as still being twelve years old unlike the way some people mum and ron still think about me you think about me harry said barely above a whisper eyes hopeful theo scowled ginny blushed er well of course i do ginny began not at all sure what to say she didntwant to deny it and give harry the idea that she only wanted to be his friend but she also didntwant to hurt theo we have most of our activities together and we even have a class together now you are part of most of the things that are important to me this didntseem to mollify theo very much he appeared to be thinking very hard about something oh harry said ginny couldnttell if he was sad about her explanation or if he was still just surprised at the admission just then theo walked up to her and right there in front of harry lifted up her chin looked her in the eyes and kissed her while certainly unexpected it was not the least bit unpleasant in fact it was very very nice as she began to respond one hand came up around her waist and another softly held the side of her face when he went to deepen the kiss he found that her mouth was already slightly open and waiting upon making this discovery he moaned quietly and plunged in with control and no small amount of enthusiasm he was fluid and not sloppy strong without being overly forceful and had obviously done this before her right hand grabbed a handful of his shirt in the front and her left attempted to steady herself by holding onto his hip a few moments later two things happened they heard the sound of someone walking away down the corridor and their lungs began to burn for air it took ginny a second to realize that the person quickly retreating down the hallway was harry and she wrenched herself backwards out of theo semi embrace eyes wide theo looked more unkempt than she had ever seen him and it suited him his shirt was a little wrinkled it had come untucked in places and one of the buttons had come undone he was panting and so was she ginny was torn between slamming theo up against a wall to resume their previous activity and running after harry to explain sod it all she thought to herself she and theo hadnttaken their eyes off each other ginny gulped and made her decision that was incredible she said with honest affection wide eyes and small smile then she took off at a run down the hall after harry after running for a solid five minutes ginny came into sight of the fat lady and shouted the password from about ten yards away so that it would swing open and she wouldnthave to slow down with a quick glance around the common room she took off up the stairs toward the sixth year boys dormitory wondering if he would have locked it she slammed up against the door and tried the handle nothing doing backing up to try again she waved her hand in the appropriate movement and shouted alohomora when she tried the door again she went stumbling inside to find harry by one of the windows looking startled and then furious what are you doing here he demanded just short of shouting ginny had rarely seen him so angry ginny threw a quiet colloportus at the door you took off what was i supposed to do she demanded back you seemed pretty well occupied when i left he responded scathingly he kissed me ginny yelled pointing toward the door presumably to indicate theo you werentexactly hesitating to kiss him back harry shouted he was breathing hard and looked like he was either going to blast her out of the room or burst into tears it was at this moment that ginny could no longer contain the frustration she had been feeling about harry resentment toward her recent romantic entanglements well maybe i wanted to she roared back tears starting to well in her eyes her voice choking up a bit maybe i like being kissed by handsome boys who care about me maybe i like feeling desirable you have no right to be angry with me for that yes i do he insisted appearing on the verge of tears his cheeks were flushed with emotion and through her own rage and frustration ginny thought he might be shaking what right do you have ginny returned angrily as we have discussed many times you are not my brother and you certainly have never expressed any interest in any other role in my life that would give you a right to be angry at this response harry whole countenance fell the room went from barely containing their shouts to dead silence in an instant ginny was trying with all her might to keep from sobbing and harry just stared at the floor when he finally looked up he looked nearly as broken as when sirius had been killed tears began silently streaming down ginny face you re right he said quietly i haven t with one last look at her he went over to his four poster and sat on the edge staring into space his expression was a strange mix of disbelief frustration and utter sadness herpo appeared out of nowhere and made his way onto harry lap harry began stroking and petting his cat mindlessly barely glancing down at him in recognition ginny stood there watching the boy and his cat for nearly five minutes before she decided that harry had nothing more to say to her only when she turned to leave and had her hand on the doorknob did he finally speak up dontgo he said with a slight sense of urgency in his tone hand still on the doorknob ginny turned back to him to find both harry and herpo watching her when she didntsay anything harry sighed and looked back at his lap after a few more moments of silence ginny went to turn the knob why does everything have to be so hard harry asked out loud the question was one of frustration but it was laced with an edge of bitterness that ginny had never heard from him before it reminded her of the resentment she had occasionally heard in sirius voice when he had been forced to stay at grimmauld place for so long somehow she doubted anyone else had ever heard it from harry out of most people the question would sound like immature whining but from harry who ginny knew really did have an unbelievably difficult go of it it only made her heart ache nothing in this boy life was easy except for quidditch the least she could do was answer him i suppose some things just wouldntbe worth as much if they were easy she replied harry looked up at her perhaps surprised that she had answered him she tried to smile in an effort to comfort him but it would only form half way he watched as she wiped tears from one eye with her sleeve and slipped out the door ginny walked back in a daze to where she d left theo standing in the hallway near dumbledore office as she had guessed he was no longer there she honestly didntknow what to think to further complicate matters her confused ponderings were interrupted by ron and hermione noisily exiting the headmaster office trying not to panic and very much wanting to avoid an encounter with the two of them ginny sped quietly down the hall and darted behind a suit of armor sometimes it was a blessing that ron and hermione were always carrying on at ungodly volumes how do you reckon he found out did you i didntsay anything and how on earth would ginny have found out he probably just furious with us fat chance ginny thought to herself as they passed by her not when he doing such a splendid job of being furious at me her angsty inner monologue was cut off by the sound of a familiar voice which given the fact that her present emotional state was in complete uproar was a very welcome one indeed gin kerney asked causing ginny to turn and smile in relief once the initial relief passed the relieved smile crumbled and ginny held back tears just long enough for the kernel to wrap her up in a hug after a few minutes ginny calmed down caught her breath and looked up at her friend thanks she said meekly she moved to start walking down the hall in the direction of the kitchens wiping her eyes with her sleeves the kernel fell into step with her what happened kerney stated more than asked ginny appreciated the fact that it didntsound like she was prying well i had a lovely day with theo and then well then we were coming back to school and theo harry neville luna and i were attacked by dementors ginny began then added miserably so of course they all saw my patronus as if that was the worst of her troubles and then i blew up one of the castle doors and then we went to dumbledore office to explain and when we were done i was stuck alone in the hall with theo and harry and theo kissed me right in front of him and it was brilliant but harry got mad and we fought again and now i confused and i feel absolutely wretched and hungry having arrived at the portrait of the fruit she tickled the pear kerney followed her into the warm familiarity of the kitchens with slightly raised eyebrows and a shake of the head that expressed her utter lack of surprise once ginny had taken care of her hunger they moved on to the confusion and wretchedness the kernel was brought up to speed on the day events laughing heartily at the notion of ron and hermione thinking they were at all discreet by the time ginny had finished her explanation kerney had been surprised more than once by what she heard something that happened rather rarely in ginny experience at last ginny looked to her friend for counsel or a reaction at the very least so what d you reckon the kernel nodded in assent i reckon that harry is bloody scared of you ginny face fell not like that i think he scared of you the same way you re scared of him ginny expression was more tentative now the way your brother scares the living hell out of hermione granger it the same way that andy and nadine are absolutely petrified of each other it the power they hold over each other the power that harry has over you and now that we come to it the power he must believe you have over him what do you mean power ginny why the bloody hell did you try for so long to get over him because you knew that if he was ever in trouble or if he ever asked you for anything you d do it you d be at his side in an instant didntmatter if he dangled cho bloody chang in front of you for the length of a school year his godfather been kidnapped by death eaters in the bowels of the department of mysteries you re there no questions asked and from what luna says your loyalty was firmer there than his supposed two best friends while they questioned him you didntblink that the power i talking about it the absolute trust that vulnerability that you resign yourself to when you care that much about someone take control freak hermione i think half the reason she wants her and ron to be a secret is because she paranoid that others will see her vulnerability her brain has probably told her a million times that ron is not her kind of bloke but she just canthelp it no one can for andy and nadine it was fear that one would reject the other because they ve known each other so long and so well i reckon it not that easy to feel attractive to someone who seen you at your worst or most private moments and then there harry here a boy who has had so little control over his life since the day he stumped voldemort that he probably resents the hell out of every authority figure he comes across he got a bloody mad dark wizard out to kill him and that leaves him with about two areas in his life he has any control over one is quidditch which i reckon to be the only thing that has kept him sane over the last five years the other is his affection which given his life situation is probably not something he has any natural talent for like he does with the snitch if he gives in to how he appears to feel about you that the ball game and he knows it because if you knew how he felt he wouldntbe able to deny you anything a bloke like harry plays for keeps he a lot like your brother ron that way sure ron is louder and much more aggressive about it but dontthink that harry potter doesntwork in the same extremes he wontdive in like ron apparently has because he so bloody noble and he doesntthink he d be able to pick the survival of the wizarding world over you if voldemort ever made him choose that the power you have that the fear but that so stupid ginny cried her body confused between a half choked sob incredulity and anger love makes people stupid kerney replied ginny found little comfort in this but she doubted the kernel had meant to be comforting but you and theo didntcooperate with his little plan he could make excuses when you dated corner because he was a git but harry respects theo he cantfind anything wrong with him and now the bloke went and kissed you and hell if you didntappear to like it and in case he missed it you ran after him and made sure he realized that he got a decision to make whether you meant to or not i do believe you just threw down the gauntlet to harry potter mate oh sod it all was all ginny could muster in response no kidding kerney answered honestly so what do i do now ginny wondered aloud i think harry might be okay if we could act like nothing happened but then what about theo i do like him but if there a chance harry would ever look at me that way i dontwant to lead theo on how do i manage this without being a complete wench to one of them you ve got to be honest with yourself and decide what you want then be honest with theo i think you ve already made it clear enough for harry that he got to make the first move and given the history between you two i reckon that pretty fair the next week passed by ginny in a way that made her feel alternately like she was moving at hyper speed and as though she were underwater in most spare moments at meals when she spaced out in class in the shower during quidditch drills she thought on the question kerney had told her to ask herself what do i want it wasntso much that she found answering the question difficult it was how she felt about her answer that she needed to sort out she wanted harry and there was really nothing else to think or say about it but the reality of the situation was that harry hadntmade a move and her own pride and self consciousness would not permit her to make it herself theo on the other hand had asked her out and it had been wonderful he had kissed her and it had been wonderful it had been so wonderful in fact that she rather fancied the idea of him doing it again and yet she couldntdeny that if harry ever seemed romantically inclined toward her she wouldntbe able to restrain the desire to be with him the last exchange she had shared with harry on that strange day kept coming back to her in her mind why does everything have to be so hard i suppose some things just wouldntbe worth as much if they were easy she hated being right tragedy in theo family provided a respite for ginny inner reflection though she would have faced the uncertainty and awkwardness of encountering her potions partner in a second if it meant that his grandfather would still be alive devon had told her about mr caldwell death on sunday the day after hogsmeade when the two of them had dinner together in the kitchens theo hadntmentioned to devon how his grandfather had died but even more surprising than the cause of theo sudden absence was the fact that all five of the ryan and mcgrath children had been taken out of school as well ginny was unsure of whether they were absent for the same reason seeing as she had no idea why the ryans or the mcgraths would have anything to do with theo grandparents again devon provided a much needed explanation i surprised that you dontknow her slytherin friend began honestly theo uncle chad and andy uncle will have been best friends since before they started at hogwarts the mcgraths and the caldwells have always been close allies and friends theo mother andy parents and andy aunt tracy were all friends at hogwarts as well the attachments between those two families run deep and as the other family who is so closely connected with the mcgraths the ryans would have been invited as well mr caldwell was the patriarch of his family leaving chad caldwell to take over in his place of course his closest friends would be there to support him i had no idea ginny responded with surprise she really had to stop underestimating the depth of the connections that ran through the old families of the wizarding world her knowledge of gertrude wrightman should have taught her that when do you think they will be back devon face took on an expression that ginny had never seen on her before a slight hint of sadness i would be surprised if theo returned before your match against hufflepuff next week devon replied that was nearly two weeks off i imagine that stephen and the ryan sisters will be back by the end of this week andy will probably be gone as long as theo is as the oldest son in his family and theo friend andy will have nearly as many things to attend to as theo andy and theo are friends since when ginny wanted to know how could she have missed this andy was one of her best friends and she had really thought she was getting to know theo apparently she had been mistaken since before they came to hogwarts devon replied evenly seeing that ginny was about to ask why they had never told her about their friendship devon continued just as there are perfectly good reasons why you and i dontpublicize our friendship there are equally prudent reasons why they donteither i do know that in stephen first year here they had a hell of a time getting him to remember not to wave and say hello to theo in the corridors ginny face fell into a look of considerable chagrin at hearing this she did not like the idea of children having to censor themselves like that but if everyone knows how close their families are why would it be a problem ginny asked because of who theo other family connections are devon explained ginny recalled what theo had told her of his family his mother and his father she confirmed out loud devon nodded in confirmation will mcgrath and chad caldwell along with andy parents and theo grandparents held very strong views during the first war they were never particularly outspoken about it but everyone knew they opposed the dark lord and the death eaters will mcgrath chad caldwell and andy parents were even rumored to have connections with the order of the phoenix this was certainly news to ginny but theo mum married a suspected death eater ginny inserted she had a feeling that there were some subjects that devon might not elaborate on if ginny didnthint that theo had already told her about them slytherins yes she did and practically tore her family apart in the process apparently when theo started to approach school age will and chad took it upon themselves to bring him back to what they saw as his proper family if samantha caldwell had kept her name and not married into a dark family theo eventually would have been the caldwell heir not chad ginny nodded in assent that much she had figured out for herself though theo had never said it explicitly i still cantbelieve they ve been friends all these years and i never had a clue devon sighed and ginny wondered if her slytherin friend was growing slightly impatient with her thick gryffindor brain it was very hard for them at first with rumors that voldemort was returning and draco strutting around the slytherin dungeons like he bloody owned the place theo didntexactly have an easy first two years his father was indifferent toward him and his mother had grown cold since her estrangement from her family he was not the confident young man that we recognize as our friend his grandparents and his uncles did that he feels the loss of his grandfather terribly is there anything we can do anything i can do ginny asked she couldnthelp but feel guilty for running off after he kissed her if she had stayed she might have been with him when he heard the news she might have been able to comfort him other than writing him i not sure there is anything to be done at the moment devon answered looking strangely sympathetic my family is sending flowers for the funeral and i was going to write him tonight we can send our letters together if you like ginny nodded i ll have mine ready why dontwe meet at the owlry during lunch everyone will be eating in the great hall and no one will miss us i do have an owl you know devon reminded her always having to ask to use pig hedwig or a school owl every time she sent a letter ginny tended to forget that many other students had their own i ll owl you my note tonight and you can send them off then is that alright devon replied that it would be perfectly suitable a note to theo wasntthe only owl ginny sent that night having learned that the funeral would be held on wednesday ginny had sent her mother a request that she send flowers on behalf of their family she hoped the gesture would signify more than her own sympathy and support regardless of what they may have been in the last war the weasleys were more than fully invested in the present one a show of support from another old albeit much more humble wizard family might remind the caldwells and the mcgraths that they were not alone this time around on wednesday ginny noticed that the ramsey twins were not at school and figured that given what she had heard about gretchen relationship with theo grandmother when they had returned to school she reckoned that they had gone to the funeral in the time between the funeral and the return of andy and theo to hogwarts only two things occurred of note first ginny had her career planning meeting with professor mcgonagall that was required of all fifth year students and then as devon had indicated gryffindor played hufflepuff in quidditch to decide who would advance to the cup final the first thing ginny noticed walking into her career advice meeting was mcgonagall particularly calculating look it reminded her of the way mcgonagall had looked when ginny and she had first discussed ginny desire to take her o w l early the second thing she noticed was the collection of pamphlets on the table with glossy pictures depicting all of the jobs she had considered and decided not to pursue healer which her mother would prefer second only to ginny popping out multiple grandchildren as quickly as possible preferably with harry potions curator gringotts employee that particular picture was fairly unattractive but seemed more life like than the rest experimental floo coordinator charmer daily prophet employee there were more but ginny didntfeel much like looking at them her family often called her stubborn and true to that depiction she had come into this meeting knowing only two positions in the working force that would satisfy her notwithstanding professional chaser which she doubted the deputy headmistress would accept miss weasley professor mcgonagall greeted her motioning to the seat across from her as she looked down at what might have been ginny course work and evaluation forms ginny resisted the urge to snatch them out of the professor hand and read over them snape comments would have been especially interesting hello professor ginny replied taking her seat we have discussed previously how your early exams would strangely effect your future choices have you thought any more about that odd question but ginny had known it would be brought up yes i know that i ll be forced to make certain changes to my curriculum in my seventh year but i was hoping to continue with transfiguration potions and defense in some capacity in seventh year while working intensively in other subjects that my future profession will demand you are aware that hogwarts used to have a practice of seventh year projects mcgonagall asked yes ginny said it stopped the year before bill became a fifth year he was terribly put out wanted to study curse breaking many students chose to focus on the subject which later became their profession mcgonagall said still looking calculatingly at ginny if we were to allow you to propose and work on an individual project do you know what you would do ginny stared she had thought she might be allowed to sit in on seventh year lectures help the professors study with someone she hadntthought mcgonagall would give her such freedom rumor had it the projects stopped when one ambitious student studying herbology the effects of some plant or other on the lives of mandrakes had been hurt i suppose i d like to contact the department of mysteries and see if i might be able to work on something that could also serve as an admittance test ginny said mcgonagall lips narrowed never a good sign ginny prepared for a fight instead all she received was a sharp look and a question the department of mysteries i know they dontnormally work with people my age well i suppose i dontknow that so much as i assume it no one really knows that much about them but it one of the few jobs i actually interested in why such a simple question asked with so much vehemence ginny paused to make out exactly what she wanted to say it hard after seeing those rooms and what happened to people there not to want to know more ginny said at least it is for me i mean they were so strange and that curtain the familiar flash of memory of sirius came to ginny what was that why was it there without any warning and how did remus and everyone seem to know that he was gone forever and those brains how did they hurt my brother why did they there was a wall of what looked like water that managed to change a death eater head into a baby and back again there are things in there things that could really help in the fight against voldemort maybe there is a way to destroy dementors instead of just holding them off with if someone just took the time to study in one of those rooms and ginny stopped she d been babbling she hadntdone that since second year third year at the latest how embarrassing didntmean to carry on like that ginny said to recover herself but mcgonagall looked far from taken aback by her enthusiasm she didnteven look upset her intelligent eyes looked oddly satisfied with ginny sentiment are you determined to be an unspeakable determined was she determined when andy and even kerney asked her what she wanted to do she always told them that she was open to possibilities but that wasntexactly true and if ginny had to be honest with anyone about her goals she supposed it should be her career counselor of sorts mcgonagall yes ginny said the only other job i d really consider is being a professor of potions preferably mcgonagall picked up the pamphlets and straightened them before sitting back no not relaxing her back never touched the back cushion there is an opportunity during the summer holiday that might interest you what sort of opportunity ginny asked curiosity more than a little piqued the sort that is only being offered to you and only if you demonstrated a prior interest during your conversation with me mcgonagall answered in a very un mcgonagall un straightforward way it is an apprenticeship with the department of mysteries ginny shook her head in disbelief it was too convenient for her to be offered this after only just mentioning her interest in the subject she d never brought it up with anyone before why the reasons given mcgonagall said summoning a piece of parchment from her desk across the room and then handing it to ginny were skill intellect and display of potential once again ginny instinctively rejected such a generous offer she had not appealed to the department of mysteries how had they heard of her she couldnthave been the first student to take the o w l early could she she wasnteven the best student in the school were seventh years also offered this chance from mcgonagall description no they weren t ginny looked down at the parchment for answers to professor mcgonagall deputy headmistress hogwarts school academic advisor to ginevra weasley the department of mysteries extends an invitation to miss ginevra weasley to study in the department of mysteries for the months of june through august of 1996 with an access level of apprentice miss weasley unique potential intelligence and background have given rise to this invitation we expect an immediate response unspeakable specialist in the third room gertrude wrightman ginny coughed professor wrightman yes mcgonagall answered curtly it has been her occupation for nearly twenty years until she came to teach here ginny shook her head as things rapidly became clear to her the apprenticeship had come at professor wrightman behest she was offered it because she showed an interest still there were a couple of very odd things it certainly is a short letter ginny said reading it again it mysterious mcgonagall said with evident derision ginny smiled at the professor disgust as she kept reading one word caught her eye what do they mean about my background they did not send a separate letter to me mcgonagall said by way of an answer interesting everything that the professor knew ginny knew it felt oddly dissatisfying if information was kept from her until she was older than mcgonagall ginny might just decide to give up on all these people professor i taking all of the classes that i need i plan to take o w l in the rest of my classes and continue them in whatever capacity i can which i think ought to help me with whichever career i choose ginny said so do you mind if we cut this short a bit i d like to talk to professor wrightman about this professor mcgonagall nodded standing i must say miss weasley that i had rather hoped you would have an easier conference than your brothers what were theirs like ginny asked brightening somewhat standing and indicating the parchment did they also receive summons to mysterious departments every one of them had already decided what they wanted before they walked through my door mcgonagall recalled and not without something akin to fondness bill wanted to work in curses and could not be convinced to find a career more fitting for a head boy charlie wanted to live in the wild for a while to see how it was to live with only his wand ginny remembered his gap year and smiled at the memory of her mother all too predictable reaction to the idea percy came in with four feet of parchment that was a step by step plan to rise within the ministry the twins came in together despite their separate appointments insisted on making me tea and calmly explained that they planned to undermine the government through radical political speeches and widespread dungbombing if necessary they also explained a goal to mobilize the people of the united kingdom in order to create the world largest human pyramid ginny smiled in appreciation of her twin brothers she had always thought that mcgonagall had liked them best despite herself that sounds like them sometimes ginny almost painfully missed her family it was all well and fine to be near ron but there was nothing like being home with all of her brothers at once even percy what did ron say mcgonagall looked at ginny for a long moment i cannot discuss students who haventleft school a thought occurred to ginny as she looked down at the parchment that might be the key to her future she remembered the battle they had fought through in the department of mysteries and she remembered ron right beforehand as they were about to leave hogwarts following harry without hesitation or question but ron does you know have a plan doesnthe ginny asked you donthave to tell me specifically but he thinks about the future right i mean i cantimagine him doing it but it must be something he considers mcgonagall nodded as she gestured at the door and it swung open he considers it ginny couldnthelp but wonder if the beginning and end of ron consideration were that he would follow harry to his final confrontation with voldemort ginny wondered if despite her interest in a future if she shouldntbegin to consider the idea that people she loved certainly she herself might die in the fight they all knew was coming talking to professor wrightman was as always both frustrating and enlightening ginny had knocked on the professor door and been surprised when the defense professor opened the door almost immediately miss weasley wrightman stepped back to let ginny enter which she did i just left my meeting with professor mcgonagall ginny said turning to see the professor shut her door and walk past ginny to her desk without showing any reaction to ginny statement ginny decided that as with most slytherins the direct approach would be best she placed the parchment on the desk and backed up as she said in a rather mild tone explain this to me professor wrightman looked at the parchment and then up at the sixth year it an invitation from the department of mysteries yes i gathered that much i was hoping you could tell me why i received it ginny said as she leaned against the armrest of the chair i believe the exact reasons given were your unique potential intelligence and background yes right that really vague and confusing do you not want the position i dontknow yet ginny said starting to stall why didntyou ever mention that you were an unspeakable not that i didntalready know gertrude wrightman folded her hands in front of her and ginny couldnthelp but notice how perfect her nails looked i am currently your defense professor but for the last twenty some years you ve worked in the department of mysteries dontyou think that something your students would be interested to know i was under the presumption that my students wanted to know how to defend themselves against the dark arts wrightman said smiling a half smile as if she found ginny amusing who else received this invitation ginny asked no one okay mcgonagall had been right that didntmake things much clearer though what do you want from me want my dad says that there no such thing as a free lunch and this is the lunch of a lifetime so to speak no matter how well and how early i took my o w l s they didntwarrant this offer ginny said leaving the armrest so that she stood upright on her own as she looked at her little blonde defense professor so i want to know what it ll cost me gertrude wrightman looked at ginny with her unwavering light blue eyes and said tom riddle ginny face closed off but gertrude continued without pause you will work with me on my project and in return you ll let my colleagues and i study tom riddle through you ginny thought of the dreams at the beginning of the year the unforgivable curses she had cast and had enjoyed casting the pain that consumed her afterward but she said i not connected to him anymore any memory i have of him is four years old you lie well gertrude said with something like appreciation ginny refused to let a response on her face how would you know if i lying i not ginny responded or maybe they did not see what they did not want to see because whether or not you choose to accept it you certainly have unconscious connections to tom riddle professor wrightman leaned back though she like mcgonagall did not actually touch her backrest somehow ginny was not surprised that it was more intimidating coming from the woman in front of her you are a fifteen year old girl with proficiency in areas of study in which none of your family has shown potential you understand concepts in advanced classes so quickly that it seems professors are only refreshing your memory instead of presenting new ideas most telling your worst classes are subjects that either werentoffered fifty years ago or werenttaken by one tom riddle the ability you have with wandless magic though you do an admirable job of hiding it is one only manifested in people whose personal magical mental wards have been thoroughly or continuously breached i a seventh child and the first girl in seven generations i work hard in classes that seem most worthwhile and that takes away from study time for other classes i have certain abilities but so what other people have had them it doesnthave to mean that the bloody dark lord human incarnation lives in my head still ginny didntlike the feeling that she had to defend herself to her teacher it never felt like this when she talked about it with harry perhaps it doesn t or perhaps you who were susceptible to retaining such abilities because of your unique birth were affected by the hostile invasion of another consciousness on your innocent eleven year old mind professor wrightman gaze never wavered perhaps you ought to consider the possibility that when one of the most talented wizards to ever walk this county controlled your mind and body he changed you when his diary was destroyed you were his only conduit to the world does it seem possible that he left behind pieces of his soul his power in you and most importantly a possible connection to his living body ginny hated this she hated hearing gertrude wrightman voice all of her inner concerns about herself all of the thoughts she had pushed out of her head since the nightmares had subsided back then when she had been lying in bed in the middle of the night she had acknowledged that voldemort would probably be able to control her more easily because of her experience in first year and she had long recognized the fact that her ability with school probably related to the chamber of secrets and the diary but the way professor wrightman talked about it made ginny want to deny every part of everything she said he not still in me ginny insisted you dontknow me we ve had all of three conversations and all were about you and your past i may have accidentally fallen into your pensieve but i promise you ve never been privy to my most important memories you ve never been anyone in my life except a professor that thought too highly of herself because she is part of an archaic nobility that still bears less respect than the oldest names the founders names listen to yourself gertrude wrightman replied fiercely when you become truly angry you grow cold withdrawn you exude power and a clear apathy toward those with whom you are angry like you could hurt them without flinching and twice i have seen your eyes burn red during such exchanges ginny felt as if she had been slapped instantly her anger grew cold and just as she was about to respond she realized she had done exactly what professor wrightman said she would do exactly what tom had done and she hated this conversation all the more you want to study me i want you to work with some very talented witches and wizards to learn more about tom riddle and how his existence effects you i wontspend three months being poked and prodded like a potions experiment we would do no such thing her professor said sounding disgusted with the idea you provide a link to a man that threatens the world a link no one else has you would learn as much as we would share in all of our findings professor wrightman had correctly divined that ginny ultimate weakness other than harry was her desire for information but she said harry has the same connection the defense professor shook her head his is different then i imagine he would be a better test subject than me harry could and has provided valuable information about the dark lord but now we want to know about tom riddle gertrude gazed seriously at ginny besides harry has other things he must do this holiday like staying with his aunt to replenish the magical protection she provides him they had already argued over the term protection in relation to harry aunt so instead of picking a fight about that ginny asked for clarification of something else that was bothering her if tom had not possessed me would you still have offered me this position no professor wrightman said resolutely ginny had to admire the way her teacher never seemed to lie however had you shown less power character intellect or potential even if you had been through the same experience you would not have been given this opportunity well at least there was that what happens if i donthave the information you need about tom riddle ginny inquired with a strange kind of insecurity gnawing at the back of her mind do you know what tom riddle did in his third year to gain the attention of the headmaster professor wrightman asked ginny shook her head briefly he sent a spell at the very door that you blew up when you ran from the dementors ginny shook her head it was a spur of the moment decision the only way to alert the faculty to the danger the only way or the way you instinctively thought to do it because in a hidden part of you that you hate and suppress and canteven feel lie the memories of a sixteen year old boy memories that could help defeat the man whose name so many fear to speak he doesntcontrol me but could he professor wrightman asked then more softly wouldntyou like to know again ginny thought of her dreams her teacher was apparently thinking related thoughts you could be a threat to harry ginny looked sharply at her professor and when she saw that she was sincere ginny sat into the chair you re playing to my weakness i playing to your strength the defense professor nodded at her we do not judge at the department of mysteries ever when scouting for potential recruits the first indicator is an open mind we will give our findings to no one only the results of the research in the forms of spells and potions that we have deemed appropriate tools there was a long pause before ginny felt confident enough to respond can i think about it not for long her professor cautioned we would be proud to work with you but if we must we will begin other projects instead ginny wanted to hit something you cantjust dump this on me in this ridiculous letter tell me i might embody some incarnation of voldemort and then expect an answer immediately i ll have to talk to my parents who will never in million years let me do this by the way and figure out transportation to the ministry and you would live with me during the holiday professor wrightman cut in ginny jaw dropped what only unspeakables have direct connections to the department of mysteries that didntreally stop six students from waltzing on in last june or a fleet of death eaters how protected can it be the death eaters captured tortured killed and used necromancy to have one of our seers open her personal alcove by having her deposit her own blood in a security ward that through a flaw we had not been aware of was not prepared to handle all of her blood being poured into it the system override came on and allowed access to the main floors there was also quite a bit of dark magic and the help of the security system that the ministry had secretly installed when they rebuilt the department in 1982 you had an easy time because the death eaters wanted you all to come ah well then so if i do this i am going to stay at your house two full weeks prior to entering the department all personnel must reside with an unspeakable professor wrightman confirmed apprentices must reside with their designated unspeakable for the duration of their apprenticeship we recommend that you have no contact with family except letters and even those ought to be limited your acquaintances will be the people i invite into my home and if you choose to do journey there those in the nearby village nothing but letters ginny exclaimed not even hogwarts as rules like that consider it an opportunity to be away from your family for the first time to know who you are without being defined by them not for the first time ginny thought gertrude wrightman was hardly one to talk about the virtue of not being defined by one family i d still see my father at work rarely if ever you re being deliberately mean you re being childish on the heels of such a meeting ginny didntreally spare a thought for the quidditch match against hufflepuff as it turned out she neednthave done so anyway due to the fine match up she made with her good friend and hufflepuff beater jamie bowen and the quality of the gryffindor chasers and hufflepuff beaters in general the game was built up nearly as much as the gryffindor slytherin rivalry unfortunately the match itself proved to be the most anti climactic one ginny had ever seen or been a part of the projected quality of the match up had depended on one simple thing one thing that had never seemed to be lacking in the progression of a quidditch match time the last two games gryffindor had played in had run uncommonly long each lasting more than three hours against hufflepuff on the other hand harry went diving for the snitch in the twelfth minute and it was over so absorbed was the crowd with watching the superb gamesmanship that was developing between the chasers and beaters that half the stadium didntnotice went harry firebolt went shooting into the sky in celebration golden snitch glittering in his right hand as devon had predicted stephen preceded his brother in returning to school by nearly a week and was thus able to play in the match the win provided somewhat of an uplifting effect on him since he would be able to write his family and invite them to come and watch the final the win also had a relatively calming effect on harry who stopped avoiding her as he had been doing so religiously ever since their row two saturdays before this sequence of events had ginny agreeing resolutely with kerney estimation that quidditch had single handedly kept harry from losing his mind over the last several years and not for the first time in her life she thanked merlin for quidditch such was the state of affairs in ginny life as she trekked down to her defense professor office still dressed in the sleek gryffindor quidditch uniform she had designed for the team when it came down to it she knew she had to do whatever she could to help harry and together with the added bonus of not spending the summer holiday in the jurisdiction of her parents and the opportunity to find out more about the rooms in the department of mysteries how could she possibly say no perhaps she wouldntsee harry for three months but if it meant she would get to see him live past hogwarts then she would do it she would accept gertrude wrightman offer for the summer author notes many thanks to professorspork msmissprongs ginny22 edwinm eagleblaze incompetent reciprokates elyra darkwynde haliwel starzlight gmr buggs fudge stylin fire and andrew for the wonderful comments i we really appreciate them hope you all enjoy the chapter spoilers this chapter is chocked full of spoilers and characters from prelude to destiny if you haventread that story yet parts of this may not make sense or they may not seem as significant as they really are chapter 13 for what it worth anyone in the stands who was new to hogwarts quidditch would notice one thing right away gryffindor had two players who could fly like they were born on brooms a redheaded girl and a black haired boy one a chaser the other a seeker zoomed around the pitch seamlessly it appeared as though their brooms adjusted instantly to every motion every turn of their hips every swivel of their shoulders rarely had any of the houses had a flyer like them let alone two at the same time the girl was remarkable her smaller stature and lower center of gravity giving her a shockingly tight turning radius which she used to duck and skirt bludgers beaters and opposing chasers at point blank range people who knew her family might say that she took to her broom like her brother charlie with the same ease and equal aggression but with much more calculation in her eyes but the boy now he was really something a strict looking woman in gryffindor colors a professor turned to the blonde couple sitting next to her and said i reckon he better than james can you believe it to which the petite blonde woman quietly replied true her older brother said nothing eyes glued to the players zooming to and fro between the rings he looked stricken like he was in pain on the other side of the brother sister pair another blonde man this one several years younger than the first sat with his wife and child discussing the match and the players with his friend who had somewhat darker hair hope he falls the young blonde man said pointing to the ravenclaw captain and earning an eye roll from his wife will that a student his darker haired friend chided will smirked and will returned the friend shook his head you always were an intense fan the friend replied intense nothing go stevie he doesnthave the ball will wife chimed in helpfully as the ravenclaw seeker moved as close as she could to the gryffindor seeker hit her in the face will called out as one of the bludgers zoomed toward a gryffindor beater again intense the friend observed with a slight smile chad you say intense i say familial obligation will explained with a straight face that threatened to break into a smirk until something in the match caught his attention he pointed at one of the gryffindor chasers hey who that redhead the little chit can move chad directed his attention toward the redheaded girl who was currently weaving her way toward the ravenclaw rings that ginny weasley the response came from will wife as she bounced her young son on her lap at the surprised look she received from the two young men she explained mcgonagall told me will mouth widened into a grin the love of stevie life he asked hopefully and not a little cheekily his wife socked him in the arm donttease him she scolded will grinned and turned back to chad tease him i proud of his choice will exclaimed but it is her right chad asked yes will wife confirmed over her husband head that her she turned back to the toddler on her lap arentthere like a hundred weasley kids chad asked or is she the next generation merlin that makes me feel old will replied wasntthere a weasley when we were at school yes but he was in gryffindor chad said cool little kid though will recalled he was always getting detention for trying out difficult spells in the corridors and wasntthere a little seeker too seventh year or maybe after we left chad wondered will paused to think back to the quidditch games of their final year at hogwarts as chad went on remember our seventh year when gryffindor was terrible but they had this little seeker who always got the snitch even though they would still lose by like a hundred points oh man they were horrible will agreed but not the weasley kid chad nor apparently is his sister will added as said sister scored a goal you really think they re all from the same family chad asked if so that woman was really pumping em out will concluded that it stevie crack the bat yeah i think she his sister chad declared scanning the pitch and then pointing toward the gryffindor rings look their keeper must be another brother merlin those weasleys dontplay around when it comes to procreation do they will observed i wonder how she compares to lily chad said quietly after a few thoughtful moments of silence no one compares to lily will insisted then he smiled but stevie thinks she really something chad gave his friend a look will fine whatever no teasing my nephew will promised then after watching the girl for a few moments why couldntshe have been more studious and put in our house i think it a rule redheads belong in gryffindor chad explained both boys thought back to the other redheaded gryffindor they knew i can respect that their conversation was cut off as the black haired gryffindor seeker suddenly took off into an almost vertical dive over near the ravenclaw end of the pitch and in the urgency of the situation the other seeker had no choice but to follow him as they grew closer and closer to the ground the crowd stood up in anticipation leaning over banisters and around each other to get a better view the ravenclaw seeker was smaller than the boy but was able to keep up just behind him the spectators in the stands grew more and more anxious as the two players went hurtling toward the ground and some even started to scream and yell in anticipation of the collision but just at the last second the gryffindor seeker twisted around ever so slightly like a heat seeking missile whose target had changed and he took off back up into the sky like a shot the ravenclaw seeker was not so lucky she must have noticed that the snitch was nowhere in sight and tried to pull up at the last second but was not quick enough to avoid catching a bit of the ground as she redirected her broom when the tail of her broom nicked the ground she was thrown off but not seriously injured it could have been a lot worse wronski feint the professor mentioned to her blonde neighbors in a breathless almost disbelieving sort of way that suggested amazement despite the fact that she had seen the boy moves many times before the blonde woman nodded but kept rapt attention on the game her eyes briefly resting on the girl being attended to on the ground before returning to the gryffindor who was already 200 feet in the air and climbing the blonde man leaned over his sister to address the teacher and he s what a sixth year the professor nodded the man shook his head in a mix of recognition and disbelief so he just missed andy by a year by a couple weeks actually i knew he was here when andy started but i guess it just didntseem real until i saw him true his sister replied ginny was pleased at how the game was progressing as usual the other team was no match for a firebolt and a retro and she and harry were dominating at their positions stevie was playing an inspired game for his family who were watching from somewhere up in the gryffindor stands ron was having a relatively easy go of it only having let in one goal so far it didnthurt that harry had taken cho chang for a ride with that wronski feint a little while ago at any rate with gryffindor so comfortably in the lead almost shamefully so for a quidditch final the match had practically turned into a waiting game the entire stadium was waiting for harry to see the snitch once she saw the glimmer of gold in his path ginny took off toward him perhaps being a little presumptuous about the victory but mostly just determined to be the first one in his sights when he caught it she was getting gradually closer when slam she got knocked over almost off of her broom luckily she hadntlost her grip and jerked her head around to see where the bludger had come from calvin wilde the seventh year captain not a bad bloke usually but probably bitter at being so thoroughly dominated in his final outing by now harry had raced off toward the other end of the stadium still in pursuit of the snitch with cho chang trying desperately to keep pace alright ginny thought if calvin wants to be nasty i can be nasty she tore off toward betsy who now had the quaffle and with one glance at katie the three of them went streaking back toward the ravenclaw rings passing feinting dodging back and forth up and down the three of them performed maneuvers without error and without visible effort with katie racing down the middle a simple nod of her head sent ginny and betsy across to the opposite sides ginny underneath katie as they flew betsy right over her at point blank range with the keeper katie tossed the ball down to ginny who relayed it through a wide open hoop as they rounded back toward their own end ginny glanced at the ravenclaw captain who nodded and frowned to convey that she had made her point at just that moment the announcer voice started shouting and was promptly drowned out by roar of the crowd ginny eyes searched quickly for harry as she flew off in the direction of her teammates despite the cheering of the crowd and the stop in play she refused to cheer until she could see the snitch in harry hand when his brown glove shot up into the air in triumph and she caught a glimpse of the fluttering gold ball she threw a fist up in celebration and screamed flying as fast as she could to reach him he had caught it right underneath the gryffindor stands which meant that despite her wonderfully fast broom half of gryffindor house reached him before she did she could see ron and their beaters jack and stephen already piled on top of him as she hopped off her retro she entered the bustling crowd with a shout oy mates let the chasers through and the horde of red parted like the sea as she stepped toward the four boys katie and betsy close behind her once they were in sight the boys turned around and ginny took off at run dropping her broom as she was plucked off the ground by her brother he twirled her around in celebration and she kissed him on the cheek as they cheered to each other when ron put her down she was met next by jack who she hugged quickly next she turned to stephen mcgrath who greeted her with bright eyes and a grin that took up his entire face she squeezed him tight and gave him a peck as well only to be torn off of him by his older brother gin you were brilliant she smiled and embraced her friend delirious with joy he squeezed her tight before kissing her cheek and letting her go exchange hugs with her fellow chasers the crowd began to settle down as she finally got a chance to look around for harry as she walked back toward ron her arm was yanked to the right and harry beaming face briefly came into view before she was picked up and twirled around a second time this second turn in the air was apparently the last straw for her ponytail which came completely undone letting loose her red locks and capturing the shocked attention of the small group of friends and family who had come down to congratulate their son and nephew as harry stopped turning and held her tight ginny could not know that ten feet behind her four people had stopped dead in their tracks thinking they d seen a ghost from behind ginny all matt mcgrath will mcgrath chad caldwell and tracy merton could see was a black haired quidditch player with glasses embracing a red haired girl with the deepest affection and enthusiasm they couldntsee the girl face couldntsee her small nose and chocolate brown eyes so unlike the features they knew they couldntsee that the boy eyes were green instead of hazel or that he had a lightning bolt scar on his forehead they forgot for a moment that they had just watched him play an entire match at seeker not chaser for one moment they thought they were seeing another black haired boy and red haired girl who they had known at hogwarts years before but their reverie was rudely interrupted as stephen ran at the boy and girl yelling harry ginny we won causing the boy to look up and the girl to turn around beaming and admit him into their embrace soon the other gryffindor players piled on for a team hug and cheers went up with renewed intensity from the sea of crimson that surrounded them after a spell after the quidditch trophy had been presented and yet more cheering rose up from the gryffindor students the crowd on the pitch began to calm down and disperse in the general direction of the school ginny was standing with harry nadine and andy reminiscing about the first game they had played against ravenclaw when her ingenuity had begun a new trend of quidditch uniforms at hogwarts just when andy had caused them to laugh in remembrance of stevie gawking at a half naked ginny the very same third year boy walked up to them accompanied by nadia and several adults when andy caught sight of his brother companions he smiled ginny harry this is my dad matt mcgrath andy said by way of introduction mr mcgrath nodded and smiled looking somewhat bittersweet when harry reached out to shake his hand and this is my aunt tracy he added indicating the blonde woman who was no taller than ginny andy looked to harry who played quidditch with your dad at school harry smiled as he followed ginny in shaking the woman hand nice to meet you ginny said smiling merlin but mr mcgrath was handsome not bloody hot like sirius had been in his prime but handsome and kind looking like his son andy aunt looked uneasy none of the adults could keep their eyes off harry this is chad caldwell andy added with regard to one of the younger men ginny and harry greeted and shook hands with him ginny thinking that perhaps he had the same eyes and jaw as theo and this is my uncle will andy continued gesturing to the younger blonde man who was quite as good looking as andy dad but slightly shorter and more athletically built this is his wife colleen and my cousin michael he finished indicating the nice looking woman who was clearly several months into another pregnancy and the small boy at her side when his little eyes landed on harry they widened and he came forward pointing at the boy who lived mummy that harry potter yes dear stevie plays with harry potter yes he does but what have i taught you about pointing not to do it michael replied skulking back behind his mother leg good colleen mcgrath replied she turned to address harry sorry about that she offered kindly dontworry about it harry assured her much too pleased about his new acquaintances to mind his celebrity it great to meet people who knew my parents harry added seeing the adults glance at ginny then back at him and finally at each other harry seemed to think he ought to lighten the mood remus has never told me am i anywhere near as good as my dad he asked indicating toward the quidditch pitch with the hand holding his firebolt mr mcgrath looked at his older son then to ginny and then back to andy again tracy cleared her throat before venturing to answer harry question you are better than james was she managed in a somewhat strangled voice she attempted a half smile but ginny noticed that it did not even come close to reaching her eyes harry and stevie smiled at this information which seemed to brighten her spirits a bit andy seemed to notice the restrained slightly odd way that his aunt was acting ginny wondered if there was a reason other than grief that made tracy merton so uncomfortable seeing harry and talking about the potters he played a different position of course harry said to keep the conversation from stalling ginny smiled with approval i sure i d be rubbish at chasing compared to him he glanced at ginny who promptly piped up what do you mean compared to him she asked jokingly you d be a rubbish chaser compared to anybody she insisted grinning at him playfully he laughed certainly compared to you i would he admitted ginny bit her lip eyes still smiling at the compliment harry turned to mr mcgrath andrew said that you were head boy the year before my dad was he offered andy and stevie dad smiled kindly yes i was it was an incredible year for several reasons not the least of which was your mother he replied will mcgrath and chad caldwell exchanged glances talking about lily seemed to light up mr mcgrath countenance and put him at ease ginny thought that he must have been extremely fond of her interestingly it seemed to have the opposite effect on andy aunt tracy whose face was blank and whose jaw seemed to harden after a pause mr mcgrath spoke again with an almost disbelieving smile i sure you ve heard this a million times so please forgive me but you look almost exactly like your father harry nodded yes sir that and my mother eyes he finished for him mr mcgrath laughed it sounded lovely like matthew mcgrath was honestly shocked and pleased to be talking to lily and james son all the students smiled while andy aunt showed no reaction yes indeed your mother green eyes it must get bloody annoying having all these people you dontknow gawking at you and telling you things when they dontknow a lick about you harry eyes and the nod of his head conveyed his confirmation of that statement for my part i hope you will chalk it up to my affection for lily and my great respect for james they were the best people i ve ever known besides my wife ginny wanted very badly to cry when she remembered that all three of those people were dead chad and will smiled in fondness for all three of the deceased tracy mcgrath merton was looking more uncomfortable by the minute thank you very much for saying so harry replied earnestly but with a contented expression everyone seems to know who they were but no one seems to have known them other than remus and sirius i mean ginny grabbed his hand without thinking and agonized over whether to yank it back or leave it in his the decision was made for her when his fingers entwined themselves with hers it actually kind of funny that you mention them and that i finally meeting you near the end of your sixth year mr mcgrath began his expression had taken on a look of pleasant recollection when harry had mentioned remus and sirius at harry look of curiosity he continued your father punched me once about this time of year will and chad laughed heartily obviously knowing the incident to which andy dad was referring harry eyes widened but he calmed when he saw that mr mcgrath was still grinning at the memory he thought your mother was in love with me and that i was flaunting christine in front of her harry looked slightly embarrassed at this information but was a little heartened when ginny squeezed his hand and smiled at him andy and stevie were confounded at the news of this oddly intimate connection that their parents apparently had with harry s why did he think that harry asked the tone of his voice expressing his hope that his father had had a good reason for punching him mr mcgrath laughed openly at his question harry seemed a bit less anxious if matt mcgrath could laugh about it now it couldnthave been too bad could it that what reminded me of this actually when you mentioned remus and sirius harry looked curious you see your dad had fancied your mum for a few years before that and she had never given him the time of day and around the same time i had started suspecting that remus was a werewolf he explained ginny liked that the fact that remus being a werewolf didntseem to matter in the slightest to this man or to will mcgrath or his wife or to chad caldwell oh yes this was andy and stevie family all right so your father and his friends got wind of my suspicion you see and decided that james would drink this stuff called polyjuice potion ginny and harry shared a knowing look which would make him appear to be remus so that remus would be able to do his prefect rounds during the full moon thus disproving my theory the kids all smiled and their plan worked like a charm until james started to polyjuice himself for every one of remus patrols with her and she thinking he was remus became good friends with him and told him all about this boy she was in love with who was now dating one of her best friends harry was transfixed ginny got the impression that he had never gotten this kind of memory from remus or sirius it seemed to relax him and she was glad to see that their little group was now quite alone on the quidditch pitch so who was the boy nadine asked clearly enraptured in the story mr mcgrath looked at her with all the affection of a family friend who had known her for her entire life well james thought it was me because it had recently come out that christine their mother he motioned to andy and stevie and i had been dating but it was really your dad he said looking at harry with a smile you see there had been a terrible misunderstanding earlier in the year when your mum had somehow come to the conclusion that james was dating my sister he motioned to the strangely uneasy tracy standing to his side and of course the fact that james was hearing this and lily thought he was remus didntmake it any less confusing when the truth finally came out but what did sirius have to do with all this ginny asked startling harry out of his reverie ah well he was the only one who could have prevented all the confusion because he had already become close mates with your mum he started eyes still on harry he had somehow discovered that lily was arse over elbows in love with your dad but thought that the only way she would give him a chance in person was if she got to know him without the presumptions and misconceptions she had about him i can only assume he thought that the polyjuice scheme provided the perfect opportunity for that except for one small problem a new voice added harry and ginny grinned with delight when they saw a tired but happy looking remus lupin walking up to the group mr mcgrath looked happy to see him as did chad and will remus put out his hand for andy dad nice to see you matt he said kindly you too remus mr mcgrath replied warmly they seemed very familiar with each other and this visibly added to harry general contentment with the occasion you remember my sister tracy matt said politely briefly setting his hand on her shoulder remus nodded to the blonde woman of course he said with equal politeness although it was abundantly clear that tracy and remus did not share the fond feelings that matt and remus did hi tracy he greeted her hello remus she said with not a little stiffness harry expression darkened slightly as remus exchanged much more pleasant greetings with the other three adults ginny wondered whether it was the werewolf issue or something to do with the potters that had come between the former housemates remus observant as usual turned the conversation back to its original subject like i was saying the plan was brilliant until lily ruined it all he said jokingly mr mcgrath laughed what d she do harry asked not knowing whether to laugh or be a little concerned well she began to fancy the remus she knew from her patrols only it wasntme it was james so she was pretty confused when her prefect partner acted like one bloke during their walks around the school and then acted totally different in classes and things he finished ginny nadine and nadia were all taking in the story with considerable affection the boys seemed amused at the predicament sirius had declined to prevent and when james found out that christine and i were dating matt added he jumped to the conclusion that lily fancied me and that i was torturing her by subbing for remus when he missed patrols for the full moon so he confronted me and punched me and i assured him that lily did not have feelings for me and on the absolutely preposterous chance that she might i certainly didntknow about them as harry was shaking his head and smiling at the funny memory he removed his hand from ginny and slid it around her waist causing her to lean in casually against him neither of them seemed to notice as they shifted positions but he must not have believed me because soon after that when i was filling in for remus another time he came after me again only as remus this time but he didntget to punch me because lily stunned him and knocked him down before he could get one off everyone laughed and harry looked delighted at the actions of his mother anyway i left them to their patrol thinking it was remus but that was the night that james let the potion wear off and tracy came running after them because she had found out about the plan and lily found out needless to say she was furious remus added picking up the story ginny and nadine shared a look and nodded to express their agreement with lily take on the issue by that time all of us except for james and lily knew that they were mad for each other lily was simply livid at everyone other than matt and christine james was mad at the situation because the girl he adored had only liked him when he looked like someone else tracy and another girl in our year samantha caldwell chad sister he indicated chad and the mention of the name ginny recognized as belonging to theo mother caused the expressions of the men in the group to darken briefly were outraged that james and sirius would do such a thing it was quite a mess but everything turned out in the end right ginny proposed causing harry to turn his head and look down at her where she stood by his side i mean they got married and everything didntthey he started when he noticed their proximity but when ginny didntseem to notice he relaxed again yes remus replied with a slight smirk but not until lily made him wait all summer before she would agree to officially go out with him the conversation carried on in this manner for some time with remus and matt mcgrath recalling stories about james lily sirius and christine and the children all listening in rapt attention no one seemed to notice andy aunt tracy who trailed the group stoically as they retreated under the falling darkness to the great hall for dinner they were all so wrapped up in their reminiscences and stories that no one noticed when mrs merton left the group no one noticed her reaction to seeing their blonde defense professor in the corridor and no one noticed the hardening of the professor gaze and jaw but ginny did notice when theo nott joined them at the family table in the great hall and watched as he was greeted by his uncle chad and by the elder mcgrath men with warmth and not a little respect she chuckled to herself as she watched stephen try to work out whether he could finally openly greet their long time family friend theo smiled to himself as the youngest mcgrath brother gave him a hug ginny was growing sleepy as she walked back from the room of requirement luna had caught up with her as they were leaving dinner and they d met up for a visit ginny was taking the long way back as she suspected that the common room would still be very much in uproar with the quidditch victory party and she wanted to gather her thoughts before facing her rambunctious housemates as she passed the owlry she heard voices a man and a woman it sounded like and she paused near the entrance to find out whose they were tracy merton stood with her arms crossed over her chest staring out the window at the moon you all right mr mcgrath asked his sister as he leaned a shoulder against the wall ginny envied his effortless ability to look casual and poised did you expect me to be mrs merton asked without moving they stood like that for a while before a slow smile appeared on mr mcgrath face he flies just like his father he said the way he grabbed his broom and kicked off he doesntfly a thing like james tracy said coldly cutting him off and stiffening her posture to such a degree that ginny thought she couldntpossibly be comfortable when james flew people watched he was flashy and brilliant and daring for the audience harry harry flies like lily cast charms with an understated brilliance that makes it look so easy that it doesntseem impressive tracy don t you needed to come i did not tracy said i came because you wanted me to see him well i did are you happy now i know what i gave up i knew it when i chose to move away i know it now and what do you want me to say that i wish i would ve stayed that i should have been more like you or gertrude wrightman or even severus snape i won t i wontbecause i could have just as easily been lily or james or christine dontyou dare snapped mr mcgrath in a voice that did not seem to be his own dontyou dare say it was okay to run because look what happened to my wife she died matt because she and lily chose to broadcast their alliances ginny would have cursed this angry speaking idiot of a woman but mr mcgraths words beat her to the punch she was attacked she was attacked by dementors and i wasntenough of a master at the patronus to do anything until it was too late ginny wanted to cry wanted to walk forward and embrace that stranger who looked so much like her best friend that was why he had wanted andy and stevie to learn the charm so badly that was why oh it hurt too much to think about she was my best friend matt it hurts me too oh so that why you didntwrite her is this why you invited me here to rub it in my face that i left them all behind this isntabout you tracy mr mcgrath said this is about my son and the fact that he wanted his legendary aunt the gryffindor beater to see his big match well i saw the game i dontsee why we cantleave or why you re on such friendly terms with a werewolf oh yes it was official ginny weasley hated tracy merton what next are you going to invite gertrude wrightman and severus snape to talk about lily when we know she would have sold lily to voldemort and snape did mr mcgrath looked as disgusted as ginny felt you dontknow either of them let alone remus lupin all your life you ve assumed you understood the world well why dontyou go owl the only person you made an effort to stay friends with at school the wife of the bastard who probably ordered those dementor attacks even though she was wrong sam was just doing what i did she married to protect her family no matt mcgrath said sounding angrier than anyone ginny had ever heard before all i know is that she stayed neutral so perfectly neutral while better women fought maybe that true but samantha and i are still alive our sons have their mothers ginny had to physically restrain herself to keep from hexing tracy merton matt mcgrath voiced what was going through her head yes because that worked out so well for theo he bit back the two stood there glaring and angry and ginny wondered if hexing mrs merton from this distance would land her in any sort of trouble maybe if she didntuse her wand dontlet andy get involved matt his sister finally said breaking the silence what take him out out of hogwarts if you have to tracy said we will not run from what coming she poison for him andy aunt continued she ll drag him into the thick of things and he ll be the one that hurt she pressed on and ginny felt her chest tighten with a suspicion that was confirmed a moment later ginny weasley will be in the middle of this conflict she just like lily and you saw her with harry today just like i did donttell me you werenthaving flashbacks so many thoughts coursed through ginny mind right then that she barely caught hold of one how odd that tracy merton who was both a gryffindor and in harry mum year should think that ginny was like lily when gertrude wrightman was convinced they were opposites maybe it was just the red hair maybe that was why people associated them with each other either way ginny had a hunch that professor wrightman had known lily somewhat better than andy aunt could ever claim to she certainly knew ginny better than the hard hearted woman in front of her now you haventchanged mr mcgrath said all these years and you haventchanged neither apparently have you she replied as if to scold him you re still just as willing to put those you love in mortal peril dontyou remember what it felt like to lose christine i donthave to remember i live with it every day mr mcgrath returned coldly every day i wake up and she isntbeside me seeing andrew grow up to look just like her watching him struggle with nadine and knowing christine could have helped him i remember that because we werentprepared my best friend died and my children hurt because of it stevie doesntremember her and he doesntknow what to think of the women i date and neither do i because while i have found myself loving one or two none of them are christine and none of them ever will be but do you know what gets me through the knowledge that people like ginny weasley and harry potter are in my sons lives the knowledge that gertrude wrightman and remus lupin are watching over them ginny weasley would die or kill to protect my sons and harry potter as young as he is opposes every wrong he is his mother son no matter that she didntraise him and ginny weasley is his james his partner his support you re right that i had flashbacks out on that field but it was not of two people i loved that died it was of two people that i once saw run toward death eaters attacking a house to help the people inside dontyou dare tell me that i should want to keep my sons away from people like that ginny blinking back tears that she hated and an overwhelming sense of responsibility and pride decided it was time to leave she walked back to the common room replaying the conversation in her head and hating mrs merton and adoring mr mcgrath more each time when she reached her room ginny went to her trunk and pulled out the old yearbook photos that she had copied and planned to give to harry at the leaving feast it had been an extraordinary year for gryffindor all those years ago but as amazing as they may have been what they became was hard to accept four were dead one had run from the magical world one was a death eater one had married a death eater and the last was a betrayed werewolf ginny stayed there for a long moment a single unanswerable question refusing to leave her head is that what would happen to her generation ginny was walking down to breakfast the next morning with kerney andy stevie nadine and nadia when they came upon andy dad in the front hall of the school he was standing with professor wrightman theo and naomi ryan having what appeared to be a rather pleasant conversation ginny didntremember her defense professor ever looking so animated in the presence of another adult except for sirius of course she wondered if professor wrightman would react the same way to remus when mr mcgrath noticed them he brightened and called out to his sons the teenagers all walked over and andy dad was introduced to the kernel ginny stood next to theo who nodded in greeting and smiled at professor wrightman who nodded with kind eyes and could it be almost smiled and then the funniest thing happened when professor wrightman indicated that she was going to take her leave matt mcgrath smiled warmly and a little sadly and stepped forward to give her hug her face began its automatic response of withdrawing from expressing any emotion causing mr mcgrath to hesitate and draw back in that instant ginny saw a look of horror briefly flash through her teacher eyes but it was different than anything she d seen before it was horror at her own reaction horror that her body and emotions were so well trained so finely manipulated that they denied her the ability to express the ones she actually wanted to convey rather than take offense or be embarrassed andy dad seemed to understand he extended his hand and shook hers kindly he wished her luck in her teaching endeavor and expressed his desire that they meet again soon it had been too long since the last time they spoke he said gertrude wrightman nodded and ginny could have sworn the professor shot her a glance said that she would make a point to ask them over for tea during the summer apparently this wasntan empty gesture because mr mcgrath looked rather gratified as her defense professor left ginny paused for a moment and followed her professor she asked causing the petite blonde woman to stop and turn a knowing look on her face yes miss weasley she replied patiently was that for my benefit ginny asked which part her teacher answered the part about andy and his dad coming to your house for tea over the summer holiday ginny offered not entirely was the reply ginny smiled mouth closed professor wrightman had made the invitation both to comfort ginny about spending the summer in a strange place and soothe andy dad at the same time ginny decided that she liked the changes that came over her teacher when the woman old schoolmates were around she was starting to see how sirius could have been attracted to her she was his opposite in every way notwithstanding the hard and fast sense of loyalty instilled in them both where sirius was outwardly brash and rebellious only rarely slipping into the manners and proper decorum that had been ingrained in him during childhood gertrude wrightman was the picture of contained and controlled self possession only rarely allowing a glimpse of raw emotion but even with the family issues that divided them ginny knew now after all she had seen that gertrude feelings for sirius had been perhaps still were as strong for him as his had been for her it was strangely comforting thank you ginny replied both for herself and on behalf of her friend father not quite so deliberately mean then professor wrightman asked ginny chuckled no ma am she agreed and with a nod her professor turned and left by the time ginny turned back to join her friends they were gone she looked to the entrance of the great hall and saw the last of the doors shutting behind nadia and stephen turning back to the front doors of the school ginny saw mr mcgrath standing alone looking at her expectantly when he saw that she had noticed him he smiled and began walking toward her she did the same hello ginny he greeted her she couldnthelp the grin that sprang to her face hi she answered politely not sure why he wanted to speak with her i just wanted to say well i ve heard a lot about you from andrew and nadine and stephen here he paused to smile on stevie name and ginny blushed remembering the crush andy younger brother still had on her well i ve heard a great deal about you miss weasley and to know that you are also very good friends with harry potter and theo nott well it makes me very happy ginny was slightly embarrassed to hear this but kept herself from showing it er i glad she said in as perky a way as she could manage andy dad grinned at the awkwardness but then his tone took on semblance of gravity listen i ve spoken with gertrude wrightman this weekend and i thought you should know something from someone else who knew harry mother dontlet people compare you to lily ginny mind jumped back to the vehement row she had overheard the night before as well as to her own discussion with professor wrightman on a similar subject he continued you might hear things like that in the coming months but i want you to remember always remember that you are unique you may have red hair but you are not lily and she wasntyou and anyone who says otherwise either doesntknow you or they didntknow lily you are both so important to us but for very different reasons just dontforget that you are your own person and you should be who you were meant to be he spoke so earnestly in such an obvious attempt to reassure her that ginny was beginning to worry that something was wrong mr mcgrath is everything all right she couldnthelp asking he appeared to shake himself out of his grave countenance at the concern in her voice he considered her thoughtfully for a moment until a small smile spread onto his face yes he said after a moment the smile extending a little further yes i believe it is he extended his had to shake hers she took it with pleasure it was very nice to meet you it was lovely to meet you too she returned he smiled then in a way that lily would have recognized as one of the smiles he used to humor christine with at school see you this summer he said cryptically before turning to leave having started toward the great hall ginny brow furrowed as she wondered what he meant then it hit her professor wrightman apparently trusted him enough to tell him about their summer arrangement she turned back to address him on the subject but he was gone the lull that descended upon hogwarts after the quidditch final was lightened only by the gradually improving weather it was getting sunnier and the rain was less biting each time it fell but the pressure of impending o w l and n e w t exams for the fifth and seventh years seemed to make all the other students grouchy and somewhat less cheerful than usual ginny classes had become an odd mix of harried revision in her o w l classes and perfunctory calm in her n e w t courses the only classes that brought any semblance of fun or humor were defense and potions in defense she often had the opportunity to practice hexes and shields with an increasingly pleasant harry while in potions the monotony was periodically broken by professor snape derisive mocking and on occasion a delicious quip from her esteemed partner theo had returned to school with a gravity to his person that had not been there before the old theo was still in there somewhere as evidenced by the smirk that graced his face every time he made ginny laugh but otherwise he always seemed preoccupied now ginny tried to carry on as if nothing was different comprising the lion share of the conversation as they worked in their usual way once in a while she would look up to find him watching no considering her in a thoughtful way when he saw that she had caught him he would simply smile and return his attention to his part of the assignment it happened during meals in the great hall as well she had expected that his direct personality would lead him to broach the subject of the rather passionate kiss they had shared outside dumbledore office but perhaps the chain of events that immediately followed had buried it in his mind for the foreseeable future she doubted this latter theory however as she had found devon looking at her strangely during their last two potions study sessions as ginny sat her remaining o w l tests her thoughts turned to the seventh year ball she had nearly forgotten about it in the quick succession of events that had started with her date with theo until luna had mentioned it the night of the quidditch final and it hadntbeen one of her spacey idle musings either luna had learned the day before that cho chang having broken up with michael corner yet again a week before the quidditch championship had asked harry to be her date the ball and he had accepted when ginny asked why luna hadnttold her this as soon as she found out luna replied that she didntwant to spoil the quidditch final for ginny indeed ginny chastised herself but she couldnthelp wondering whether cho had done it exactly for the reason luna had held off on telling her everyone had been predicting that gryffindor would have no trouble with ravenclaw in the final and cho must have known that she didntstand a chance against harry in getting the snitch her only hope would have been a poor performance by the gryffindor chasers had she done it with the intention that harry would tell ginny before the match or that someone would overhear and inform her before they lined up to play thinking that ginny would dissolve into a pathetic wretch completely useless on a broom maybe in her second year she might have but if cho chang thought ginny could be thrown off that easily now she had another thing coming or maybe cho hadntthought about the quidditch game at all maybe she just wanted a popular boy to flaunt around at the ball it would undoubtedly rub michael the wrong way to know they were going to together as much as ginny liked baron ramsey she couldntdeny that she wished she was going to the ball with harry instead then again if they hadntbeen asked by seventh year students they wouldntbe going at all at this point ginny wasntsure she wouldntprefer staying at home with harry but baron was counting on her and he had honored her by singling her out so she would go as ginny was walking with luna on their way back from their habitual visit to hagrid a commotion down the corridor from the great hall caught her attention the scuffling and the raised voices sounded familiar and sure enough when they got closer ginny recognized one head of untidy black hair and another head of silvery blonde in the midst of bodies tossing and hitting each other exchanging a glance with luna they hurried to join the onlookers who were not about to step in and attempt to separate the life long enemies among the students observing the tussle was theo a fact which seemed odd to ginny and made her pause thoughtfully before she remembered why she had come over in the first place hey she shouted at the top of her lungs causing the two boys to halt their mutual assault on each other and causing the students around them to gawk at her and luna what are you on about she asked causing harry to look sheepish he went to stand up and brushed his pants and shirt off unfortunately for him malfoy had no intention of stopping their duel and grabbed his wand by the time ginny noticed that malfoy was doing something from the ground there was no way to stop the hex from hitting harry in the back but harry must have been able to sense what was coming or perhaps his many years of experience with malfoy as a nemesis had taught him to be cautious because he threw up a block just in time and turned back toward draco blasting him back into the wall knocking him out potter came the familiar angry voice of their potions professor harry shoulders slumped in resignation knowing that he would get no favors from snape when ginny looked up to see where professor snape was coming from she was slightly surprised to see professor wrightman approaching as well as both professors arrived and took in the scene theo calmly took out his wand and sent a second blasting curse toward malfoy throwing his unconscious form against the wall a second time though not very hard ginny was shocked at this but nearly laughed at the perplexed expressions on the faces of the two slytherin faculty members theo was certainly not in the habit of getting detention and both professor snape and professor wrightman appeared to be absolutely confounded at his behavior what is the meaning of this snape finally ground out his frustration at being unable to account for theo behavior evident in his temper harry shrugged watching theo curiously and not a little skeptically feeling eyes on her ginny turned to find professor wrightman observing her keenly luna snorted in amusement though ginny could hardly pick out what she had found so funny sir theo piped up again to the surprise of all present draco was insulting harry mother who is as you know no longer with us he was provoking harry to the point where he was forced to retaliate frankly draco deserved it because he fired the first curse apparently he neglected to recall that harry has always been his superior in defense and harry return volley hit home snape countenance didntseem to take theo characteristically blunt explanation in a favorable way and is there a particular reason why you felt the need to curse mr malfoy after the fact snape demanded sourly yes sir theo confirmed calmly ginny had to try very hard not to burst out laughing as snape face began to flush in anger when theo did not answer further and would you be so kind as to explain your reasoning to us mr nott snape ventured clearly resenting theo patronizing response he deserved it sir how theo was able to maintain a stoic countenance ginny would never know for her part she was biting her fist to keep from laughing and could feel luna shaking in contained mirth behind her a look on the other side of professor snape showed wry amusement on the face of professor wrightman snape seemed to be somewhat flustered by theo unexpected actions to process what was going on and when on the part he knew best detention both of you tomorrow night but before he could continue professor wrightman broke in calmly but forcefully if you both would come to my office at 8 00 i will provide you with a suitable activity snape scowled at her interference but she paid him no mind the small crowd began to disperse mostly toward the great hall for dinner as she and luna went to join them ginny noticed harry watching theo walk away with the rest of the slytherins he was clearly unsure what to think about what had just transpired for that night and the entirety of the following day ginny was hard at work trying to suss out what would make theo act so oddly in the end all she could think was that he wanted an opportunity to speak with harry alone with no chance that someone else would interrupt them and no way that harry could leave before theo finished what he wanted to say that left ginny with the much more interesting question of what exactly theo had to say to harry that was so important it was with these thoughts in mind that ginny decided a walk around the school felt like a good idea after about an hour of searching out the most common detention sites she came upon the corridor that housed the trophy rooms her heartbeat quickened with excitement as she heard a familiar voice coming from within the middle room which held all the non quidditch and non academic awards as she began to listen from outside the door she found that she had arrived at a most opportune moment do you even understand what hanging out with you does to a person in the eyes of a slytherin theo asked harry most of my housemates flinch back at the mere mention of you because malfoy hates me harry guessed theo gave him a rather patronizing look it more because of the dark lord oh right harry said looking a bit embarrassed about the fact he hadntthought to mention the dark lord that was constantly trying to off him i ve heard that you dontreally acknowledge how famous you are theo said and that you avoid being the center of attention when polyjuiced professors arentputting your name in enchanted cups but i promise you that no one else has forgotten who you are or why you re famous you re the poster child for the fight against the dark lord and while i dontmind an association like that you can be sure that some people desperately want to avoid any mention of being in the same room as you people who want to be death eaters harry said people who dontwant to fight theo corrected people who dontwant to be used as bait to lure you into the department of mysteries people who dontwant to be involved in the politics of war you me no i not one of those people theo said smiling a half smile i quite enjoy the fact that your association irritates my father and makes my mother feel a lot of guilt which leads to lots of wine at family meals thanks harry replied sardonically ginny had to bottle up a snort of amusement in order not to have her presence detected devon pearce isntone of those people either you know theo added clearly startling harry out of his wry expression what do you mean devon pearce isntone of those people what does she have to do with anything harry asked doing a pretty poor job of pretending he didntknow exactly what theo was getting at theo sent him a look that indicated he wasntinterested in humoring him harry sighed and put down the plaque he was cleaning ginny told you about potions a scowl almost a pout was evident in his voice no my best friend told me theo corrected at harry very confused look he clarified devon pearce we ve been friends since before we started at hogwarts ginny was surprised to hear theo say this but once she thought about it it made sense devon had been the one who initially brought theo to her attention and theo was a topic of conversation between them more than anyone else besides harry she told you about potions harry inquired somewhat anxiously she told me that she was studying with ginny twice a week and that you joined them in their study sessions since you arentin potions this year i figured that you missed the requirement for n e w t potions and still wanted to sit the exam it been done before snape isntthe first member of the faculty to set the bar for n e w t classes outrageously high in order to weed out the students he doesntwant and most people assume that you re going to be an auror when you get out of school so it made sense that you d want to keep studying a subject that you haventshown much enthusiasm for in the past that essentially it harry confirmed resignedly but ginny was getting ready to take her potions o w l early and she had to catch up in the n e w t material so it wasntjust for me there would be nothing wrong with your arrangement if it was theo assured him ginny smiled at the fact that theo could recognize where harry needed to be reassured and chose to alleviate his anxiety rather than exploit it as i understand it devon was pleased for the opportunity to spend time with her friend outside of class and intrigued by the opportunity to see what you were really like which brings us back to our original subject you said devon isntone of those people who doesntwant to be seen with me on account of politics and voldemort but she only spends time with ginny and me in secret and under the excuse of studying why should we consider her our friend if she hiding us isntshe just like the people you re talking about theo shook his head no she doing it because on the off chance that circumstances deteriorate to how things were the first time voldemort was a threat it will be important for you and ginny to have allies in slytherin that the dark lord and the death eaters are unaware of your mother and professor wrightman conducted their friendship under a similar arrangement for many years only your father sirius black remus lupin and the mcgraths knew of their close friendship but for a long time only sirius black knew about it harry paused thoughtfully recalling what he had learned from ginny and professor wrightman on the subject he nodded slowly as he came to the conclusion that theo theory was on the right track so what about you harry asked i can understand your reasons for resenting the people who brought you up since i certainly resent the people who raised me but that cantbe the only reason you dontmind being seen with me when you cursed malfoy yesterday you might as well have thrown your lot in with me against voldemort you know how malfoy is he ll run and tell his daddy theo nodded in agreement my situation is different from devon s theo explained because of my last name the first thing everyone thinks is that i a little death eater in training like malfoy what most people dontknow and what you probably didntknow until the day of the quidditch final is that the other side of my family was closely connected to those who opposed the dark lord including your parents matt mcgrath and his wife christine will mcgrath and my uncle chad were very close to your parents you saw how friendly they were with professor lupin and professor wrightman but not andy aunt tracy harry said no not andy aunt tracy she fled the wizarding world almost as soon as she left hogwarts she married a muggle and has chosen to shelter her magical children from our world much like my mother she was a coward who selfishly chose to run away from the war rather than fight also like my mother she has become increasingly more bitter as she realizes the regret of her decision to hide harry seemed to appreciate theo bluntness no one but remus sirius hermione ron and the twins had ever been this straight with him before in response harry went over to a shelf housing year books from the twentieth century and found the volume for a particular year he flipped to a page and then brought it over to theo this is your mum harry said showing what looked like a photo to theo who raised an eyebrow and nodded did you always know they were friends your mother and mine yes yes you didntsay anything i sorry should i have made us matching friendship bracelets because our mothers were in the same year harry narrowed his eyes they were best friends and yours died a hero while mine married a slytherin who was widely suspected of being a death eater i can only imagine they had some sort of falling out theo said turning back to his detention task of cleaning the trophies your father is a death eater isnthe he in prison theo replied ginny noticed that he never actually incriminated his father well played with an undertone of familial loyalty that ginny found very attractive despite the subject it was directed toward sometimes being an orphan doesntseem so bad does it obviously you ve never met my aunt and uncle harry put down the special award trophy and picked up a quidditch cup if you would quit saving the school so damn much we d have less work theo observed wryly harry shook his head i didntsave anything the trophies were ceremonial theo rolled his eyes well ginny couldnteven see his eyes right then but she knew he was rolling them fighting a basilisk and saving ginny life seems a bit more than ceremonial how d you know about that it impossible to keep a secret in these walls theo held his trophy up to the light you kept your mother identity a secret for a while and your relationship with ginny about my mother i hid nothing i just didntbring it up that keeping a secret i dontexactly see you gabbing on about your family they re dead it not the same you d be surprised how similar death and azkaban can feel theo kept polishing or maybe you wouldn t you see thestals and from your reaction on the quidditch pitch you seem to feel the dementors like i do i didntfaint boys were stupid with their pride sometimes you fell off your broom and blacked out i lost consciousness theo motioned as if to say same thing they continued for a time in silence and just as ginny was beginning to accept that they were fine with one another and she didntneed to stay and that they wouldntkeep talking so she didnthave a reason to keep eavesdropping theo started talking again what are you doing with ginny weasley what that rapidly becoming one of the most irritating responses i ve ever heard harry looked at theo and asked well what do you mean what am i doing with ginny i mean that she in love with you and she not about to give another bloke a chance unless she sure you re dead gay or secretly a weasley already though i not sure either of the first two would make her completely give up i dontknow what you re talking about then you re a moron a blind moron and i going to have to assume it the second option i not gay denial the first sign she doesntlove me i donteven know how to respond to such a patronizing statement and the thought that she pining away for you i didntsee her pining away when you two were snogging in front of me harry replied hotly you didntsee her initiate anything either did you like that matters of course it matters who can resist me theo asked facetiously ginny smiled only a girl that cantget over another bloke ginny stopped smiling and you obviously like her maybe you even love her i dontknow so why cantyou ask her out prove yourself a mere mortal and fade away into your next heroic deed i not going to date her harry said defiantly ginny heart which had expanded at the thought of harry liking her suddenly broke in two ouch then you really are a moron both the boys had stopped shining trophies and stared at each other i cantsee how any bloke wouldntwant to be with her harry glared of course i want to be with ginny he shot back reviving ginny spirits slightly of course i do but it not that simple she infatuated with you and you with her i missing the complication voldemort is the complication why because he might try harder to kill you if you re dating a redheaded girl theo asked smirking sarcastically i pretty sure he trying his best as it is i not worried about him trying harder to kill me harry said i worried about him trying to kill ginny you think she not already in danger theo returned starting to lose his cool a little did you hit your head and get amnesia making you forget what happened in second year harry shook his head that wasnthim it was a memory of him trapped in an old diary ginny wasntsure if that all it was she supposed she and professor wrightman would find out over the summer doesntmatter she on his radar even if it werentfor that she most certainly is for having that particular shade of red hair and the last name weasley dating you would be like a chocolate chip buried in large cookie of reasons his primary goal is to kill me harry said then all these years he been lying to his minions who believe he wants to take over the world i d be putting a bull eye on her forehead so what so what harry raged back i dontknow what i would do if if anything happened to her ginny was frozen in place her emotions dueling between happiness at hearing him say those words so earnestly and fury at his insistence on staying away from her you d probably go off and kill the dark lord like you re supposed to anyway i wontlet her be hurt then you re being selfish theo said it not selfish to want her to live yes it is theo said sounding rather passionate he leaned toward harry as kept speaking how can you stand there and not want to give that girl anything her heart desires do you really want to make her miserable do you even realize the power you have over her she would do anything for you are you willing to do the same for her if you re not then you dontlove her and you should make that clear so she can move on with her life harry looked momentarily stricken by what theo had said before his face dipped into the hero scowl that he had perfected over the years so she can move on with you you mean theo shrugged and nodded preferably yes but more than anything i want her to be happy and let me be clear it more important for her to be happy than for her to be safe i sure she would agree and i wontlet you ruin her life if i gave in if i asked her out and made her my girlfriend that would ruin her life that would end her life no you re being an idiot again theo said beginning to show his impatience in his tone of voice none of that matters do you think matt mcgrath regretted marrying christine just because she died do you think that even for a second christine regretted accepting his offer because she died did she think that accepting his proposal ruined her life and do you really think gertrude wrightman is proud of the decision that protected her the decision she made to turn away from sirius black his knowledge of some subjects was a little overwhelming at times and do you really think ginny would be less angry at you if you rejected her and went away than she would be fighting at your side if you do then you dontdeserve her i dont deserve her no one does but you ve saved the wizarding world like twenty times you ought to get some credit for that i didntsave i get it i get it theo said waving a hand at harry the humility it overwhelming ginny would have laughed if she hadntbeen so moved by what the boys had said there was another pause as theo pulled a wand out of his sock and magically cleaned all of the trophies in the room simultaneously before standing and looking at harry who stood up as well look mate believe me when i say that i wouldntstep aside if you were any other bloke but i suppose if anyone deserves a break it you just dontwaste the chance you ve been given ginny didnthear the last thing theo said because the sight of him finishing their task magically indicated that they would be leaving the room soon and she wasntabout to be caught eavesdropping she ran the entire way back to the common room and then spent a sleepless night thinking about what she had overheard by morning she had come to a rather daunting conclusion now that she had heard some evidence of how harry felt she couldntjustify trying to be with theo she d have to come clean and tell him that she intended to wait for harry no matter how long it was going to take as it turned out ginny wouldntget a chance to talk to theo before the seventh year ball which he would also be attending as gretchen ramsey date one person she did see was devon with n e w t and o w l exams out of the way the two girls were enjoying a leisurely lunch in the room of requirement as they ate in comfortable silence ginny thought back on the last few days she had watched devon and theo out of curiosity spurned on by what she had overheard during theo and harry conversation in detention she had never really taken the time to notice how theo and devon interacted with each other and what she saw through a few days of observation surprised her while devon had gradually become more comfortable in ginny s and even harry s presence she seemed wholly at ease around theo only many years of close contact and a complete understanding of each other background and personality could produce such a relationship they looked out for each other able to sense when something was amiss each seemed to anticipate the needs of the other whether it was providing a quill for an assignment or passing a particular dish at the dinner table theo carried her books sometimes and they walked to and from classes together they ate nearly every meal together in the great hall and there seemed to be an understanding without possessiveness that surrounded their attachment on the rare occasions that either of them smiled the other was usually the cause ginny chastised herself for never having noticed it before they were quite as close as she was to andy and probably closer but it was devon that had startled ginny the most while devon certainly had a hold on theo not merely as the only slytherin he trusted but as an obvious source of comfort and contentment there appeared to be an even stronger attachment in the opposite direction while theo had a habit of watching devon when she wasntimmediately next to him there was a subtle but nonetheless distinct difference in the way devon eyes followed theo how could she have missed this how could she have spoken so callously of theo and harry and her own indecisiveness in front of devon but even more curious how could devon have suggested theo as a potential partner for ginny when devon so obviously wished to be with him herself regardless of how inexplicable devon actions now appeared ginny discovery of them helped to make her decision not to get romantically involved with theo that much more firm now she just needed to figure out how to broach the subject with devon without sounding like a complete git she finished the bite of strawberry shortcake that she was chewing and sat back in her chair devon ginny began taking a drink from her pumpkin juice as devon wiped her face with her napkin and turned her full attention on her yes i ve been doing some thinking have you actually let me start by saying i came to a decision about something several days ago and in the meantime i have come to another realization that sort of relates to the first thing okay her slytherin friend replied clearly not sure why ginny felt the need to impart the timeline of her thinking the first thing is that i not interested in theo or what i mean is i not interested in being his girlfriend devon took a drink from her goblet so ginny couldntget a good look at her reaction is there a particular development that brought this on devon wisely inquired yes but it not important suffice it to say i want harry and nothing is ever going to change that devon nodded as if ginny answer was perfectly satisfactory and have you mentioned this to theo not yet i haventhad a chance to talk to him since i made my decision we haventhad potions since exams started no offense but i rather think he been expecting something like this ginny frowned i cantsay that i blame him ginny admitted i feel horrible about the whole thing he brilliant and i love being around him but it just i dont he not he not harry devon finished for her ginny nodded sadly i want to be his friend but it sounds so stupid to tell someone no and then come back with i hope we can still be friends i think i would hex someone if they said that to me not to worry i have every reason to think that theo will save you the trouble the two of you get along very well he respects you and your sense of humor is somewhat more lively than what he used to i doubt he ll want to give those things up even if it means he wontbe allowed to hold your hand well that good ginny replied sounding somewhat unsure in view of the topic she was going to bring up next and the second related thing devon inquired what is this wondrous realization you ve come to since deciding against theo if devon had the slightest suspicion of what ginny was about to say she didntgive any indication well it started when i took the time to notice how close you and theo actually are it didntreally hit me until this week but you two are best friends arentyou we have been friends for a very long time and we understand each other we are confidantes and housemates our families are closely tied we have found that we can depend on each other and expect the other loyalty despite being in a house that boasts neither quality i dontknow how you define best friends but i think i can venture to say that yes we are i trust theo more than anyone else i d like to think he trusts me as much ginny bit back a smile devon countenance brightened slightly when she spoke of theo after a thoughtful moment ginny leaned forward over their meal and spoke quietly devon why didntyou tell me you re in love with theo devon froze for a second and then visibly swallowed somehow managing to keep a blush from rising onto her cheeks artfully maintaining her composure she took a deep breath and looked ginny in the eye falling for your best friend is a sad clich she said finally so clich or not ginny thought it was rather brilliant in this case i dontapprove of clich s devon keep your voice down i a year younger than he is ginny but he always treated me like an equal and i dontwant everything to change if he finds out about this and isntreceptive to the idea it could ruin everything instead of his trusted partner and confidante i ll be the stupid little girl who has been pining away for him all this time i dontwant that i dontwant to lose his friendship but even more than that i dontwant to lose his respect ginny heart wrenched for her friend devon you could never be a stupid little girl ginny insisted earnestly if he cantrespect you on account of this then i dontthink i can respect him devon smiled sadly at the encouraging words i appreciate that ginny but you forget that i ll still be losing my best friend it not like you and harry if something comes between the two of you he still has ron and hermione and you ll still have andrew kerney nadine and us but if it didntwork out for theo and me we d both lose our primary source of comfort and support i couldntdo that to him or to myself silence descended over the two girls as they both considered what devon had said so you re not going to tell him ginny guessed no and i hope i dontneed to ask you to keep my confidence as well devon replied of course ginny confirmed if you dontwant him to know i wontsay a word or imply otherwise thank you devon said with perhaps more earnestness than ginny had ever seen in her countenance how should we keep in touch over the summer ginny wondered aloud she had already informed devon of her summer plans with professor wrightman it will not be anything particularly strange for my owl to be seen traveling from my house to hers while perhaps it may not be possible often given your situation we will be perfectly able to communicate that way to a certain degree devon assured her good ginny replied i dontsuppose you could manage to get an invitation to tea could you devon humored ginny with a small smile i believe it is likely that professor wrightman has already made plans for your amusement and access to friendly contact for the summer it would not surprise me if theo or i were part of those plans she said in return there was a pause as the two friends took each other in one last time before separating for the summer i dontthink i need to tell you to be careful but if i thought it would have the slightest effect on your decision making i would enjoy the ball ginny thanks i will i hope to hear from you soon i glad i will have at least one trusted correspondent while i am there even if it is not as often as i would like take care that you learn as much as you can from her ginny i know you think she is very different from you but she knows how the world works and she could be of enormous assistance to you i ll write to you as soon as possible at this salutation ginny hugged her friend who was only slightly uncomfortable with such a forward expression of affection i ll be looking forward to it ginny replied have good summer and with a smile she left the room later that day ginny was sitting in the common room talking with a mixed group of students which included harry ron and hermione as well as andy kerney and nadine as it was raining outside they had few options for amusement or occupation while they passed the last couple days of the term ginny was laughing at something kerney had just observed about professor trelawney when nadine sister naomi who was one of the seventh year gryffindor prefects approached the group ginny she called as she came up to them causing all their joking and conversing to cease hey naomi how are you ginny asked kindly in salutation er fine thanks the older girl responded making it clear that she hadntcome over to socialize um professor wrightman would like to see you in her office ginny nodded in acceptance of this information figuring that her defense professor and summer mentor was probably summoning her to discuss details of their summer arrangement as ginny rose from her seat she was accosted by hermione term is over hermione stated rather obviously why would professor wrightman want to see you in her office unlike she had with devon ginny had not yet informed any of her other friends and acquaintances of her plans for the summer she had been intending to tell harry at the ball because she doubted she would get a chance to speak with him alone before then i dontknow she lied easily though she saw healthy skepticism in harry expression but he knew her better than to ask her about it now in front of everyone she probably wants to tell me something about the ball but harry going to the ball ron insisted why doesntshe want to see him too because i ve already been to see her harry interjected ginny smiled with approval she doubted very much that he had been summoned to professor wrightman office and she appreciated that he was helping to cover for her even though he didntknow why ron seemed to accept this response though hermione watched the two of them suspiciously i ll be back in a bit ginny said and made her way out of the portrait taking several secret passages and cutting through the kitchens allowed ginny to arrive in the defense corridor much more quickly than usual she knocked on the door to professor wrightman office and went inside when she heard an answer miss weasley gertrude greeted her indicating for her to take a seat in the visitor chair there were piles of graded and as yet ungraded exams neatly stacked all over the office you wanted to see me professor i did i wanted to explain the arrangements for the next few days certain aspects of the seventh year ball have made the details of getting you safely into my household much simpler than they otherwise would have been although not without causing significantly more trouble elsewhere okay due to the security concerns that come with holding an event like the ball in the current circumstances it has been decided that the event will be held at one of my summer homes at an undisclosed location ginny eyebrows raised at this how deliciously intriguing why is it at your house ginny asked with evident curiosity because i volunteered it that was nice of you ginny replied wryly that was necessary came the response since when since miss chang decided to put all of the seventh year students in danger by inviting harry potter to the ball like a short sighted twit ginny grinned unabashedly at her teacher uncensored annoyance this earned her an appraising glance from the older woman why you couldnthave simply asked him on a date that night a date to somewhere already warded a date where a massive group of students dontfeel it necessary to leave the school grounds is beyond me ginny smile turned into a gape it seemed that gertrude wrightman was feeling quite free to speak openly about her students this afternoon but no instead you have some infantile insecurity that prevents you from taking the lead like he so desperately needs you to more gaping gertrude shook her head and sighed please forgive me that was most un called for i apologize for my outburst i certainly do not blame you for any of this but the frustration of planning all the minute details of this ball have begun to take their toll we did not have this ridiculous event when i was in school and i feel there is little need to keep it up given the circumstances quidditch i can understand but this is pure foolishness ginny was rather taken aback at her professor blunt venting of impatience so it at one of your houses ginny offered in an attempt to steer the conversation away from embarrassing subjects her professor looked at her with sympathy and smiled perhaps i was a little harsh i simply meant that given his upbringing and life experience thus far harry very likely believes that his disposition toward expressing affection is worse than yours every person he was in a position to love has been taken from him his mother his father and then sirius he is very unsure about what love really means and he undoubtedly wants to keep you from joining the fate of those other three i know you have your own reasons for needing to be sure but you would save yourself and him a great deal of trouble if you would simply take the initiative then it was back to business having the ball on one of my family properties means that you can floo to the main estate or take a special portkey ginny eyebrows raised in interest at this portkeys were hard to get in england gertrude must have sensed her interest and explained the portkey laws in france are much less strict than they are in england many of the oldest families have long had tailored portkeys connecting their properties including mine this will make your mode of travel much safer you will need to bring me your trunk and all of your belongings tomorrow morning so i can see them home before i join the rest of the faculty and staff in setting up for the ball we will travel directly to my house from the ball okay ginny replied still not sure what to think about a conversation that was odd even by the usually strange standard of her encounters with this woman is there anything else not at this time just be sure to have your trunk here by ten o clock in the morning ginny nodded her agreement thank you professor ginny replied and left to return to the tower note chapter 14 will be all about the seventh year ball i would have begun the ball in chapter 13 but i afraid my last semester of school is going to be putting a serious strain on my time and i didntwant to leave you all with a very cruel cliffhanger so everything about the ball is going in 14 which probably wontbe up until the end of may sorry for the long wait but that probably how it going to work out just wanted to give y all a heads up chapter 14 throwing down the gauntlet as ginny walked back to the tower from professor wrightman office she thought about how she could possibly get her trunk from her dormitory without raising any suspicion about her post ball plans she could always borrow harry cloak but that would mean explaining to him why she needed it and even if she felt completely comfortable with doing so even if she wasntyet certain she could or wanted to do so she couldntbe sure she d get a chance to discuss it with him where ron and hermione couldnthear then again she rather fancied seeing hermione reaction to the news that ginny had been offered a summer internship at the department of mysteries but if there was any chance she could talk to harry alone she didntwant to pass it up it was practically the middle of dinner by the time ginny made her way through the portrait hole and into the common room she was about to go upstairs and finish packing when she paused and diverted her path toward the small fire that was crackling in the fireplace she stood before it crossing her arms and letting the light warmth embrace her face and neck it calmed her and allowed her mind to clear and with everyone already gone to dinner she felt like she would be able to come up with a suitable plan for transporting her things soon enough except that her calm thoughts were quickly disrupted by the feeling of someone gripping her arm only when she turned and looked up to see who it was no one was there her mind quickly jumped to the object she had been considering just a few minutes before and she questioned aloud harry the grip on her arm softened yeah i cantsee you she hinted his hand left her arm oh he said indicating that he had indeed forgotten that while she was perfectly visible to him he was still invisible to her his head and then the rest of him came into view as he slid out of the cloak sorry about that are you growing as paranoid as moody wearing your invisibility cloak everywhere she asked with a grin only when i want to scare unsuspecting sixth years too bad i am a suspecting sixth year she pointed out that did hamper my plan he said shrugging so were you really at dinner but just hidden under that thing she asked nodding at his admittedly awesome cloak merlin the trouble she could cause with one of those no i ate earlier in the kitchens with ron harry said waving a hand so what were you really talking to wrightman about what if i told you it really was about the ball she half stated half asked i d say you re lying how could you tell i ll have you know that i an excellent liar except that you wouldntin a million years talk to wrightman just about the ball harry said clearly proud of himself ginny sighed oh well at least she got to talk with him alone actually it kind of was about the ball she began causing him to start to protest but i ll tell you the rest dontget your knickers in a twist she finished quickly before he could say anything he nodded in acquiescence and moved to sit on one of the couches ginny followed but when she didntstart speaking right away harry prompted her you can start explaining anytime right okay first even though i probably dontneed to say it to you donttell anyone harry nodded as if it should have been assumed and if i tell you can i borrow your cloak what for harry looked a little wary considering that most uses for his prized family heirloom tended not to be above board i promise that it for something harmless nothing you do is really harmless harry pointed out sure it is she said trying to think of a mostly harmless prank she d pulled recently well okay most of the time i up to no good but this time it is harmless tell me about it then i ll decide harry replied well basically it like this she began i was offered an internship for the summer and i going to take it harry eyebrows raised in surprise at the news but he also looked curious where he asked in genuine interest it made ginny smile at the department of mysteries she replied somewhat tentatively she knew that place held no fond memories for him a look of surprise passed over his features before his expression returned to one of deepened curiosity and professor wrightman offered it to you he asked putting some of the pieces together ginny nodded okay so that why she wanted to see you ginny bit her lip yes but it not quite that simple she qualified ever since we were there last year they ve got all these new security measures one of which is that any new employee at the department of mysteries must reside with an unspeakable for the first six months they are there ginny paused to let this information sink in she could tell when it finally did because his brow furrowed a little and his shoulders drooped ever so slightly so you have to live with professor wrightman for the break he said yes but i not just doing it because i might want to work there someday she added cryptically immediately inciting harry interest oh yeah yeah one of the reasons i got offered the internship was because they want to study my connection with tom she finished her voice getting softer as she concluded harry suddenly looked serious and thoughtful she thinks you re dangerous he guessed ginny shrugged probably she admitted at first i was angry that she might think that but then when i thought about it well wouldntit help to know one way or the other i guess he admitted after a few moments of contemplation she thinks your nightmares and things are connected to the diary i think so she agreed tentatively plus well i the only living person that we know who was controlled by him makes me sort of unique they could probably learn a lot they could learn a lot by studying me too the boy who lived please she said dismissively you have way more important things to do that be poked and prodded by the ministry poked and prodded or hexed at i not sure yet ginny said jokingly i sure wrightman wontlet it get out of hand well that reassuring harry said sardonically actually i think it might be she said it d be nice to know if there are any lingering affects if i might hurt you or something i d rather know than not i d rather you live at the burrow while they figured it out i can t but i ll be safe at wrightman s she is the defense professor because we ve had so many good ones recently he said sarcastically she nudged his foot i excited about this working there and everything even with the experiments she shrugged yeah professor wrightman said that i ll get to help with projects and in my career meeting mcgonagall told me that she wasnteven allowed to mention the offer unless i demonstrated an interest in it first mcgonagall and umbridge had a row during my meeting harry said his eyes growing distant as he thought about all of this new information ginny grinned of course they did everyone thought you were evil last year remember it seems i thought to be evil every couple of years harry said shaking his head well you are pretty creepy ginny teased harry shook his head so you re going to live with professor wrightman for most of the summer when do you start i not coming home after the ball that what she wanted to talk to me about i need the cloak because i have to get my trunk to her office by tomorrow morning and i dontwant anyone to find out harry had frozen at first and then relaxed somewhat when she mentioned his invisibility cloak i ll come with you he volunteered ginny smiled a small smile and it made him grow more confident as he spoke if hermione and ron ask where we re going we ll just say it for the ball and that will match our story from earlier today we can shrink your trunk or we can cover it with the cloak and one of us can levitate it with wandless magic if we use the secret passages we wontbe in the corridors for very long sometimes i forget what a bad influence you are sneaking out after hours starting illegal clubs asking for clever subterfuge ginny said laughingly you re the one that told me that if you ve got enough nerve anything possible harry reminded her i guess i did she said smiling harry always made talking to him so easy that she now felt foolish for having ever worried about telling him her summer plans ginny eyes sprang open and she sat up quickly too quickly apparently since her head immediately started pounding and she struggled to breathe as if the wind had been knocked out of her she gripped the side of the bed tightly as she regained her bearings enough to look around she was in the hospital wing at hogwarts a glance to her left showed her harry fast asleep or unconscious in the bed next to her while a look to the right revealed luna slender form also unmoving and apparently asleep ginny finally looked down at herself clad in a thin summer nightgown with bandages covering her left arm she spent a few moments trying to suss out the type and extent of her injuries when it suddenly occurred to her that she couldntfeel her arm at all bugger and her head hurt a lot it felt as if bludger after bludger were repeatedly slamming into the back of her head it was at this point when she finally got around to wondering what happened to put her in such a state that the memory of the day before came rushing back to her as her mind was flooded with images of the ball she laid her aching head back down on the pillow and closed her eyes to relieve some of the pain it didnthelp ginny and harry had planned to meet each other early in the morning in the common room so as to escape curious and intrusive eyes namely hermione s but when ginny was halfway down the staircase to the common room she saw that their plans had been all for naught hermione was waiting for her and harry was nowhere to be found hermione she said out loud with some surprise and not a little exasperation what are you doing up so early waiting for you the older girl replied hermione didntappear angry or miffed so ginny was rather curious at what had caused her to get up so early in order to wait never mind how hermione had known or suspected that ginny would be up at such a preposterous time of the morning oh yeah ginny answered in as non committal a fashion as she could manage are you in any sort of trouble hermione asked well at least she wasntgoing to beat around the bush ginny wasntso obliging trouble hermione sighed again yes trouble the kind that i could help you with if you asked me to the brown haired witch looked so earnest that it almost hurt no ginny said i not in any trouble like that i ve already seen harry this morning and he canthide it when he plotting something and now you re down here too it wasnthard to put together maybe we re having a secret rendezvous at six in the morning hermione asked as if that were the biggest hole in that story fine ginny said setting down her trunk you caught me the big secret is that i not coming home this summer hermione expression quickly morphed into a furrowed brow and thoughtful countenance why not because i have an internship at the ministry of magic and i ll be attending to my living arrangements for the summer immediately after the ball hermione eyes widened and she looked genuinely happy for ginny that wonderful thanks and professor wrightman has something to do with these arrangements hermione guessed ginny nodded i need to move my trunk and harry is letting me borrow his cloak to move it hermione looked up when something occurred to her in what department is your internship ginny looked up and met the older girl eyes the department of mysteries she replied watching as several emotions washed over hermione face really hermione asked surprised ginny nodded that a really big honor i know ginny answered simply not wishing to implicate professor wrightman just yet she was sure hermione would figure out that connection eventually but it probably wouldnthelp matters now congratulations ginny hermione said ginny face didntattempt to hide her surprise you re going to learn so much and with all the smartest people in the ministry it ll be great ginny nerves betrayed her for a moment you think so of course hermione said i understand not wanting to tell everyone but you ll have such an amazing experience thanks ginny replied honestly softened by hermione attempt at an olive branch ginny decided she could give a little back are you doing anything over the holiday besides visiting my brother hermione immediately went stiff which ginny thought was a little odd were hermione and ron still not open about their relationship i have a few plans hermione said eyes flitting around the room as if she were going over a mental checklist or two i sure i ll be jealous of you being at the burrow and spinner end ginny said thinking of her brothers you wontbe you wonthave a free moment to even spend thinking about me hermione said confident once again it a long time away from home ginny admitted you ll be fine ginny hermione assured her how did your mum ever agree to it she added with honest curiosity ginny laughed and shook her head i dontknow honestly when i first got the offer i wouldnteven consider it because i knew she d never let me go but i guess someone convinced her it was right after my career advice meeting so maybe it was professor mcgonagall i not sure but ginny doubted that in fact it had probably been professor wrightman she would love to have been a fly on the wall during that meeting she paused for a moment in her own lingering disbelief i still kind of cantbelieve she letting me do it well it sounds incredible hermione replied earnestly i d love to hear about it if you have time to write she added this surprised ginny or rather the way hermione said it surprised her in a way that conveyed her honest curiosity at the department itself rather than any desire to intrude on ginny personal life ginny nodded in acquiescence i ll write about whatever i allowed to share i promise ginny agreed maybe this conversation could end up softening the tension that had long been developing between hermione and herself given the battles harry still had left to fight it couldnthurt to patch up their fractured relationship before they were all in more danger hermione smiled have you told ron not yet i wasntsure how he d react to my working at the ministry or even in the department of mysteries after percy and what happened last june not to mention that i going to the ball with one slytherin and my internship is with another oops ginny knew there was no way hermione wouldnthave caught the significance of the last bit sure enough the older girl eyes widened in realization almost immediately professor wrightman is supposed to be one of the very smartest unspeakables hermione said working with her should be really rewarding you know she was an unspeakable ginny asked surprised she herself hadntknown for very long i ve done some research about the ministry lately hermione admitted ginny wondered whether hermione knew that harry mother had been an unspeakable before she died there more to this than just your career options isntthere hermione ventured finally ginny smiled at hermione inscrutable ability at deduction ginny nodded but didntexplain choosing instead to smile at the other girl and let them have this moment suddenly it occurred to ginny that she might need to be concerned with her brother reaction she could hardly believe that he would take it as well as hermione had listen just so you know and you should tell ron this one of the reasons i doing this is that it might be able to help harry hermione visibly broke out of her previous thoughts and focused on ginny who stood steadily under the softened gaze of the seventeen year old they were very different people hermione and ginny but they certainly had more than a few things in common hermione took ginny hand in hers we re all going to do what we can i think i should go find harry now ginny said closing the subject hermione smiled knowingly as if she had already gotten more information than she had been hoping for and didntwant to disturb the progress they had made in repairing their relationship for a moment they shared a look of understanding for the first time in quite a while yes it seemed they might learn to get along after all i sure he waiting impatiently in the corridor hermione offered thanks hermione have a good summer dontlet them drive you crazy and be safe ginny added before disappearing through the portrait after taking a portkey to professor wrightman main estate with harry and the inimitable defense professor ginny had been led away to change into her dress robes by a house elf named shenny another house elf had led harry to a different guest room to do the same when she was putting on a few final touches to her make up shenny reappeared to take her to professor wrightman as shenny led her to a sitting room on the opposite end of the mansion ginny quickly took to the spritely little elf unlike dobby who was overly dramatic in showing his loyalty or winky who was weepy and emotionally fragile shenny was simply content and almost cheerful in her work as she padded ahead of ginny the elf appeared almost to be skipping as with everything else she knew about gertrude wrightman ginny thought that the little sashes shenny and the other wrightman house elves wore suited her persona perfectly they were a deep cobalt blue and appeared to be made of satin which judging by the wrightman crests that could be found all over the house were so colored to emphasize their association with the wrightman family in addition each elf name was embroidered in silver thread just beneath the shoulder the way the wrightman family house elves carried themselves ginny got the sense that they were all very proud to serve such a prominent and ginny could only assume benevolent master ginny and harry were arriving at the ball with the hostess because of safety precautions their formidable defense professor had stated to be necessary for her part ginny needed to be keyed in to the wards for the wrightman estate since she would be calling it home for the remainder of the summer while harry was getting the usual maniac dark lord is out to kill you treatment though gertrude made no move to key him into the wards that ginny could see when she thought back to the conversation where gertrude wrightman had explained that the whole reason for moving the ball was because harry was attending ginny smiled and shook her head she d keep that minor detail to herself poor bloke he d feel awful if he found out that the whole event was rearranged on his account baron had been very understanding when she had informed him that she would be required to arrive separately from the other students it probably helped that baron held so much respect for their slytherin defense professor ginny wondered if cho took the news quite as well all in all she believed that the evening would be rather wonderful baron had told her a few weeks before that they had reserved a table with his sister gretchen and theo who was escorting her a third pair both slytherin seventh years and friends of the ramseys rounded out their party she figured harry and cho would probably be sitting with the ravenclaws as ginny and harry were reunited with their teacher turned guardian they each received an examination which coming from the head of the most powerful family in wizarding europe made the two teenagers somewhat anxious professor wrightman actually appeared somewhat relieved relieved because they didntappear as unseemly as she had expected ginny wondered and gave instructions to the two house elves which were promptly carried out even as gertrude led them toward their point of departure for the ball when their special portkeys deposited them at another of the wrightman estates ginny noticed that harry dress robes which were a deep navy blue and made him look rather delicious shirt and tie all look a bit sharper than they had before ginny hair felt a little silkier to her own touch and her dress robes the birthday present she had received from her parents were now completely wrinkle free and she fancied she could detect a slight glow where there previously had been a rather less than stunning material for her part gertrude looked beautiful for once her hair was let down rather more literally than figuratively ginny noticed and elegantly styled her make up was so different as to give her a softer countenance than ginny was used to seeing at school and her dress robes were magnificent ginny now fully appreciated the petite defense teacher slight frame and she decided that gertrude wrightman could make a tea cozy look sophisticated to say nothing of expensive and individually tailored robes a glance at harry revealed wide eyes and a slightly gaping mouth causing ginny to snicker this drew harry attention to her and he immediately stopped walking his eyes roamed down her figure and then back up again before ginny came to her senses and grabbed his arm hustling them to catch up with their hostess who kept going when harry had halted so suddenly as ginny dragged him down the hall in an attempt to the close the gap between them and their guide she noticed him visibly gulping and got the feeling he was trying very hard not to look at her perhaps the house elves had done a bit more than merely enhancing the fabric of her robes and conditioning her medium length red locks thoughts of elf magic and the makeover she had received halted as they caught up to professor wrightman who was waiting for them in a small alcove just off the corridor they were rushing down gertrude finished her instructing of yet another house elf as the two teenagers approached and gave them another once over to size up their appearances a quick dash with her wand over each of them undid the minimal damage done by their hustling through the halls good enough wrightman said nodding harry seemed a bit perplexed by this so as gertrude turned to address still another house elf who had suddenly appeared at her side ginny leaned in and explained i think she means that you clean up nicely you know boy who lived and all that actually i meant that when you put in the effort you are capable of looking the part of the head of the potter family and a seventh daughter in seven generations that title doesntmean anything harry said bluntly gertrude watched him shrewdly for a moment and ginny could almost swear she saw a brief look of amusement flash over the blonde woman countenance it means that after the blacks the potters were the most prominent of the old families with a male heir ginny wondered if she would ever get away from all this family and heir business it seemed that the answer was probably no with the black line ended the potter bloodline has become one of the three oldest most prestigious and powerful in england ginny thought it was amusing that the professor didntblatantly say that her own family the wrightmans was another one of those families ginny wondered if the caldwells were the third they were certainly famous at any rate as the head of that family as the son of two people who were well known well liked and highly influential you stand to inherent more than just a bank account and a famous name i would have thought that was obvious by now harry looked a little taken aback by all this and gertrude turned to ginny and as for you miss weasley your relation to the prewetts will grant you another advantage the right to respect from wizards like the notts and the malfoys whose own allegiance to the purity of blood will force them to accept your prominence in society even if it is against their will ginny wasntsure why that was an advantage but she was willing to go with whatever gertrude said when it came to the subject of old families and tradition at any rate i was merely pointing out that you both should be confident in your place in this world you have few rivals in the country and none in this room she indicated a set of french doors several yards farther down the corridor save perhaps theodore nott the two teenagers stood mutely in front of their teacher somewhat taken aback by what she had said harry was the first to recover speaking as he glanced at the defense professor wand arentyou going to have a go at my hair he asked with curious surprise gertrude came shockingly close to a smile but contained it it never helped with your father hair and i doubt it would help yours she said with a slight twinkle in her eye she put her wand in a pocket of her dress robes unless you d like me to cut it harry offered ginny frowned at this idea because she very much liked that it was unruly and just a tad too long while the notion succeeded in drawing a small smile and a softer gaze from gertrude i would usually say you should cut it but somehow against my better judgment it suited your father and it suits you with a long look at harry she left them as she entered the party and immediately began arranging the room well ginny said turning to harry that was inspiring that one word for it harry said with a wry grin and a cocked eyebrow ginny smiled and nudged him with her shoulder let go find our dates and so they did or at least they entered the ballroom in that particular wrightman estate and looked around baron immediately caught ginny eye and smiled standing from his table to make his way over to her harry the voice came from very nearby and ginny turned to see cho chang standing in front of them looking terribly impatient hi cho harry said sounding rather like he d just swallowed a large rock ginny looked over at him and her eyes narrowed as she saw the way harry was reacting to cho who it seemed didntneed any house elf improvements in order to make harry appreciate the way she looked if ginny were feeling generous she would admit that cho looked rather stunning but she wasntand so she didn t want to go sit cho asked reaching out a hand for harry to take that snapped him right out of the trance he had seemed to be in as he stared at it like it was a doxy huh harry glanced over at ginny quickly to say goodbye before walking forward to go to the table with cho he never took her hand it was awkward to watch but also rather wonderful as it let ginny see and revel in the fact that harry did not want this ball to be considered a date ginny couldnthelp but feel like cho was a bit eager to socialize with harry ever since his celebrity was renewed and everyone loved him again you look wonderful said a voice to ginny left that she recognized before she turned but when she smiled and pivoted to face baron the first coherent thought that ginny had was we ve got to have more balls and you look amazing ginny said somewhat breathless and without thinking in her third year when she went to the yule ball with neville she had observed that all the guys looked particularly good in their dress robes but she had been young and overwhelmed with being there in general plus she hadntreally known anyone and couldntunderstand the real transformation that happened when everyone was well groomed and in formal attire dress robes enhanced baron ramsey who looked so very handsome normally but in this even more formal suit of robes he looked like he belonged in a different era altogether as if he had just stepped out of a different time in his crisp tailored robes and polished shoes he was clean shaven as normal but every single part of him looked sharp ginny doubted that professor wrightman could have found something to fix on him everything all right he asked bending slightly to look more clearly at her eyes ginny nodded and he extended an arm for her to take which she did what do you think of professor wrightman home it beautiful ginny said with awe and a smile she wondered if everyone knew that this was their defense professor home or if baron recognized it because he had visited she asked him as they made their way over to the table both actually i have been here before for a couple of functions but hogwarts cantkeep a secret so i expect most people know who owns this house house is a bit of an understatement despite the fact that ginny had fallen into the professor pensieve and seen a glimpse of a gigantic room that was a part of the wrightman estates ginny first impression of the ballroom was still awe how could it not be the room which was as at least huge if not bigger than the great hall was decked out to the nines there was a full orchestra in the back of the room near the dance floor continually playing soft classical music small round tables with clean white tablecloths were spread around the room with brightly colored dishes glasses and silverware that made the room look young soft white light lit the room from above and all seven double doors for the room were wide open but the thing that caught ginny attention was the back wall which was made up completely of glass windows that overlooked a large formal garden lit with gold light ginny was beginning to wonder what exactly was in store for her that summer was everything all right with you and harry baron was asking ginny looked over at him yes it was ginny said but i not sure cho was very pleased about the arrangement she is probably still upset about the quidditch loss baron said diplomatically his lips twitching at the ends ginny smiled happily yep she definitely had the best date they arrived at their table a moment later and ginny was happy to see theo and gretchen already sitting there laughing at something but standing to hug ginny hello nonetheless it seemed odd that they were acting as if they hadntseen each other in a while since she had just been at school with them but perhaps this was how things were done by aristocratic witches and wizards when they attended social functions it was slightly odd seeing theo after the revelations she d had about him hearing his conversation with harry in detention and then realizing that devon loved him he was still that tall skinny lovable friend she was insanely glad to have but now it was also very different knowing that he and she would never be anything more ginny didntknow quite how she felt about that in the long run but for that night she was comfortable enough to sit at his table with their dates and have a good time sitting with baron and the rest of the slytherins ginny noticed that olivia flint was at the ball as well glaring at her from several tables over her date was a slytherin seventh year that ginny didntrecognize plus it was obvious that olivia was upset about the fact that ginny was sitting with the cream of the crop from slytherin ginny didntknow the other people at their table but their names had been vaguely familiar while she was stuck with her awkward date ginny felt a fleeting pleasure at knowing her date was far more handsome flint still hates you gretchen asked noticing where ginny was looking she always has dontknow why she d stop now ginny said turning her attention back to the table sure but ever since that fight with you she been out for your blood theo said glancing casually at olivia i hadntnoticed an increase in hostility wonder what prompted it ginny said truthfully professor wrightman gave her five detentions and took away fifty points for her behavior gretchen said flint was furious ginny was surprised i only lost forty points professor wrightman is rather strict about slytherins upholding a certain level of honor gretchen said simply ginny acknowledged inwardly that the professor probably would have given her a detention if they hadntgotten into their screaming fight but that still didntmake sense as to why she would have given olivia five detentions five seemed excessive even by snape standards she may not be our head of house but she has helped change our house for the better this year in the younger years especially baron said the room they were in had a higher ceiling it felt like than the great hall the house elves in their little uniforms were barely visible though there seemed to be a dozen of them the china and even the silverware at the slytherin tables were decorated lightly in dark green though there was a bit of inlaid gold that was subtle enough not to be ostentatious she really something isntshe ginny asked rhetorically picking up her fork and resting it in her hand the way she held her wand dinner wouldntbe served for a short while so they had some time to chat and quite a few people came over to say hello to them while cho never left her table a different ravenclaw did venture over with his date hey ginny roman keselica said to ginny surprise placing one hand on the back of her chair and leaning down to kiss her on the cheek as the ravenclaw keeper stood up straight theo caught ginny eye and smirked she knew exactly what he was thinking that roman was one of the people that devon had approved for ginny how embarrassing ginny twisted out of her seat to stand to talk to him since there were no seats available and was surprised to see katie bell standing beside roman looking rather happy hey katie ginny greeted reaching out to hug her briefly no comments about consorting with the enemy roman jested when the girls broke apart ginny grinned we beat you if we d lost it would ve been a whole different story if we d lost i wouldnthave said yes katie said teasingly making ginny laugh because she knew that katie would never hold a grudge against someone like that though it was quidditch well i sure the ravenclaws at your table are being terribly gracious about the whole thing ginny said a look crossed roman face at that and katie smile became forced ginny scowled and began to think she knew why they d decided to roam the room we re at the table with harry and cho so harry can fend them off with me katie said attempting to lighten the conversation ginny peeked over her shoulder at their table and saw cho petting harry arm and then him reaching for a glass across the table and avoiding her hand in the process none of the other people at the table played quidditch but they were all ravenclaws including roman sister and ginny could see how they wouldnttake too kindly to the gryffindor quidditch captain and a senior chaser sitting among them we re just going around to visit with a few of my friends katie said i saw wanted to stop by to say goodbye roman said easily it hit ginny again that she would not be having a normal summer things were going to be very different this year even by recent standards then she realized that this was probably the last she would see of katie for quite some time they would never have ridiculously grueling practices together anymore ginny would be learning to play with a whole new player next season she would be the senior chaser on the team it was a sad sort of revelation ginny hugged them again and said her goodbyes somewhat more sadly than she would have liked baron shook roman hand and kissed katie on the cheek that a good pair gretchen said after they d left ginny slid back into her seat why do you say that she probably the only person in the world that wontwant to kill his sister immediately theo explained ginny laughed and gretchen looked pleased baron settled into his seat with a look of amusement they might even last a few months as a couple what with bell being too nice to hate his family for a least a month ginny thought briefly of katie fling with her brother gretchen took a sip from her pink glass and then took a moment to look at it cradled in her hand it is odd being here with so much color baron nodded but at ginny curious look he explained professor wrightman holds her annual black and white ball here on the winter solstice it a rather boring affair theo said resting his elbow on the table very stuffy and very full of self important people so a lot of people like you then ginny teased theo raised a single eyebrow but gretchen was the one who responded laughingly saying theodore is disenchanted with the affair because he had to attend it since he was seven you must have gone as often and you arentterribly weary of it like him ginny said jokingly gretchen shook her head and was about to say something when her face tightened she caught it so quickly that ginny might not have noticed if she hadntknown her so well this ll only be the second year we ve gone our parents normally attended for the family but we came last year baron said there was a long pause after his statement as ginny realized that the last black and white ball must have fallen close to the time when the ramsey parents were killed she felt horrible for having said anything they all felt the tension but theo broke it saying last year one of my cousins on my father side tried to attack me with her mouth gretchen saved me with a waltz and for that i owe her my life i dontknow about your life but i ll accept a very expensive birthday gift gretchen said her voice light though she was obviously still pained by thoughts of her parents so the colors ginny said picking up her spoon you think professor wrightman picked them out she supplied them i sure gretchen said running her fingers over her silverware but not picking any of it up i would have thought hogwarts would take care of things like that ginny said it seemed rude to impose on a woman who had already donated the use of her entire house even if this is just a school function it is being held in her home and professor wrightman rightly feels responsible for the execution of the event baron said it wouldntdo for this ball to be any less spectacular than any other she held here then i expect dinner should be delicious ginny said smiling baron nodded she is known for having the best of everything somehow that didntsurprise ginny ginny recollected anticipation of dinner was interrupted by a muffled voice which became louder and clearer as her vision of the ballroom faded into the stark whiteness of the hospital wing at hogwarts the voice became recognizable as madam pomfrey s and ginny opened her eyes wondering when her recollection had converted to a dream miss weasley can you sit up madam pomfrey asked thankfully skipping the tearful blubbering melodrama that would have overtaken molly weasley in the same situation i think so ginny replied attempting to use her good arm to prop herself up she was marginally successful and with pomfrey help was able to slump forward into a hunched sitting position just drink this and you can go right back to sleep pomfrey said holding out a vile for her to take ginny had never heard the school healer speak this softly before and it worried her she glanced to her left and right but saw harry and luna lying in their beds just as they were when she d woken up before as she turned back to her caregiver ginny was struck with a sudden sort of clarity how long have we been here she asked madam pomfrey cleared her throat two days she responded briskly offering the vial again ginny momentarily put off her alarm at being out of it for so long in favor basking in the comfort of the familiar tone that meant pomfrey was all business in the infirmary how did we get here she asked balancing on her injured arm which she still could not feel and taking the potion with the other professor wrightman brought you madam pomfrey replied in an odd tone you re safe now drink up and with that she did barely noticing the rather foul taste of the elixir before she was overtaken by slumber and more images of the ball she never noticed her weary defense professor sitting stoically in a chair next to harry bed baron and ginny danced after dinner was served danced as the sun set and cast pink and orange light over the garden and through the wall of windows and onto their formalwear it was a quiet dance and the musicians seemed to drag out the low notes and soften the high ones may i cut in ginny and baron both looked over to identify the speaker it was a girl that ginny vaguely recognized as a seventh year slytherin apparently a rather pushy seventh year slytherin who sat at the same table with olivia flint the song wasntover but they had stopped dancing and ginny decided that the only polite thing to do would be to let the girl dance with baron maybe another time baron said hand on ginny elbow she looked over at him and saw the steady way he looked at the girl whose face seemed to be frozen in place as she walked away i think you just made yourself an enemy ginny whispered i can accept that baron said looking down at her with his steady expression she been in classes with me for seven years now and i ll be none the worse for having avoided more time spent in her company you know i beginning to fear the things you say behind my back ginny joked are you so glad to have avoided me too the lights in the room began to gently spin no i normally enjoy the time i spend with you normally ginny repeated smiling fully now so you dont always enjoy me do you enjoy every moment spent with me he asked rather frankly ginny blinked at him yes i think i do baron looked a bit shocked but before he could say anything about her comment gretchen was standing beside them saying i cutting in now ginny grinned forgetting baron odd question for the moment another pushy seventh year slytherin feel free to ignore this one as well another has helen been bothering you again gretchen twisted her head until she spotted the girl who had tried to cut into ginny dance with baron the girl seemed to shrink under gretchen glare but when the ramsey twin turned back to ginny she saw nothing intimidating in her gaze she was like a quick change artist dontworry i not just stealing your dancing partner i am also providing one she nodded her head toward theo who stood quietly with his back straight and his ever present smirk as long as you brought me a replacement i suppose i cantobject ginny said sighing as if she were disappointed they switched dancing partners quickly and ginny immediately felt the differences between dancing with baron and theo baron made all of the correct steps never stepped on her feet or made her feel like she didntknow what she was doing and always felt like he was in control but theo while he led her through the same dance managed to make it feel like he was responding to her like he might make a mistake at any time though he never actually did you ve been avoiding me theo said suddenly ginny looked up at him quickly no i haven t oh really he asked a half smirk on his face ginny looked away okay sort of she said somewhat quietly theo nodded in confirmation so it harry then ginny looked up at him though she shouldnthave been surprised at his conclusion i think it always was she conceded but you only came to this mind blowing conclusion recently theo observed wryly ginny took a breath i overheard you talking to harry in detention you eavesdropped you mean theo said shocking ginny by not looking embarrassed in the least when he must have realized that she d heard him say how much he cared about her and how much he knew harry cared too you could say that and i just did theo replied not unkindly but what i d really like to know is what precisely changed your feelings ginny thought about devon i canttell you but but i d like to stay friends you d like to stay friends only you wonttell me why you changed your mind theo clarified letting her know that he was determined to get some kind of answer to his question eventually yep ginny said playfully theo shook his head and smirked my dance partner has been taken from me gretchen said suddenly appearing beside them again they stopped moving and looked around to try to spot the girl who had managed to take baron from his sister when ginny eyes landed on luna lovegood and baron stepping in time together on the other side of the dance floor she nearly laughed aloud that is one pair i never imagined dancing together she said nor i but apparently dancing with a single person for more than ten minutes can result in extreme julifritus gretchen said gravely the sides of her mouth twitching and her eyes sparkling with delight naturally theo muttered with a sly smile the three were still watching the girl with glowing blonde hair chatter away at the most refined student in the room they seemed to float across the dance floor so i back to reclaim my partner gretchen said forcefully ginny shook her head you cantrenege on a deal just because you ve lost your half of course i can gretchen said actually i was looking forward to sitting a few dances out theo said after a bit more talking the three of them left the dance floor though when theo left to return to the table gretchen grabbed ginny hand to halt her movements what did you just do gretchen asked watching theo walk away ginny wondered if gretchen would hate her for this i told him i d like to stay friends gretchen looked sharply at ginny why knowing she couldntreveal devon secret ginny tried to shrug and said a lot of reasons are you sure it isntjust one reason gretchen fierce eyes never left ginny s one person perhaps ginny froze was gretchen talking about harry or devon she had a feeling it was the latter no i ve never had my suspicions confirmed but i ve had a feeling about a pair of best friends for a while now gretchen hinted ginny heart was beating quickly in her chest now gretchen knew didntshe ginny couldntknow for certain and she certainly couldntsay anything to confirm the older girl suspicions but oh how she wanted to i canttalk about this yes you can gretchen said sternly who d you hear it from no one there nothing to say ginny tried she loves him doesntshe if i say no will you stop asking would you be lying i thirsty ginny turned to walk away but gretchen cut her off i figured she would have told him by now but pardon but raby is needing to speak to miss wheezy both girls stopped talking and looked down to see a little house elf standing between them me ginny repeated why could no house elf properly pronounce her family name the creature was wearing his little blue sash with the carefully embroidered name raby proudly shown yes miss the large elf eyes looked at ginny then gretchen who took her cue and left the pair though not without insisting that she and ginny would be resuming their discussion soon ginny almost grimaced at the thought of dodging gretchen ramsey for the rest of the night in order to avoid that conversation my mistress is wanting to speak to you the elf squeaked oh well why didntyou say so ginny replied good naturedly the elf looked stricken but also defensive as he said mistress is telling raby to tell miss wheezy alone that just ridiculous ginny muttered following the house elf out of the main ballroom and into one of the adjoining rooms gretchen could have heard the fact that ginny needed to speak with the defense professor without issue couldntshe ginevra her teacher addressed her as the door into the ballroom closed behind her you wanted to see me professor ginny greeted ready to launch into praise for the event but gertrude began speaking again directly i need you to do something for me the older woman began ginny nodded affirmatively and gertrude continued i think that something is interfering with the wards to the estate ginny heart stopped and she inadvertently held her breath well it wouldntbe the end of term without another run in with death eaters would it she thought grimly and sighed voldemort ginny guessed out loud more likely it a reaction to the mass portkeying her teacher replied alright ginny said an odd feeling jolted ginny wrightman glanced at the door to the ballroom what you just felt is the reverberation of someone or something attempt to break through the wards that you were keyed to if the wards are breached you will know it immediately harry has been keyed to my wards since he was born so he would feel it too ginny was more than a little shocked to hear that but now was not the time to reminisce about the past the hogwarts guards are patrolling the edge of the estate wrightman said and i need to talk to professor flitwick about what happening but the wards will hold you re sure they ve withstood worse wrightman said rather cryptically so what do you need me to do i need you to watch the students for any strange activity my house elves are also watching but you would notice any odd wand movements before they would wrightman said if you notice anything out of the ordinary have pim find me immediately i can do that ginny said intently turning to re enter the ballroom but first she stopped and turned back are you sure we shouldntjust leave the portkeys arentready for reactivation and the wards will hold wrightman said sweeping grandly out of the entrance and with that ginny turned back toward the dance as she crossed the room she noticed harry watching her in concern and she smiled to placate his worry she decided not to say anything to him until she knew for certain that something was going on easing smoothly back into conversation with her friends ginny occasionally scanned the room everyone seemed to be normal fighting with boyfriends dancing eating laughing and saying sad goodbyes the only anomaly was draco malfoy who was sitting at the table directly next to ginny he looked alert and engaging when he spoke with others at his table but he seemed to brace himself every so often as if he were forcing himself not to wince in pain several minutes later his back looked rather stiff and draco appeared to be very tense though still his face showed little to no alteration finally when ginny had been at her table for almost twenty minutes she noticed that when her eyes sought out draco back and shoulders the image blurred a little it was very odd as if she were looking at him through glasses that were much too strong for her as ginny walked back in the general direction of the slytherin tables she noticed harry at one of the buffets and he immediately began to make his way toward her ginny what going o he asked anxiously at first then cutting himself off she turned to follow his gaze and saw the eldest ryan sister walking towards them with her date now cho chang may have been voted the hottest girl in school by a league of blokes but it was naomi ryan who made people look twice as she walked past in her form fitting shorter than normal dress robes harry who was still standing beside ginny had an odd look in his eye for a moment as he watched naomi come closer is that your friend nadine sister harry asked slowly ginny turned to harry curious about his odd tone yeah why harry shook his head i dontknow she seems familiar well she is in gryffindor ginny said harry continued to look thoughtful as naomi and her date derek ferguson walked toward them they were another mismatched pair at first glance a lot like olivia flint and her not so attractive escort naomi was beautiful in a classic way and derek was frankly awkward very awkward he was tall gangly and had large eyes and ginny wasntsure if she had ever spoken to him despite him being in gryffindor hey naomi ginny said as the girl walked past hey ginny naomi said inclining her head towards ginny as she stopped to talk having a good time ginny smiled and looked over at baron who was sitting with theo and his sister yeah i am what about you oh yes i having a wonderful time she said honestly her eyes widened sorry do you know derek she said gesturing to her date ginny shook her head and stuck out a hand i dontthink so hi i ginny derek took her hand with an easy smile i know you re on the quidditch team it hard not to know all of you guys ginny smile widened then you probably know harry too she nodded in harry direction as she made to introduce them harry derek feigned ignorance no sorry i drawing a blank ginny glanced over at harry to see how he was taking the teasing but he was still glancing at naomi every chance he could as if he was trying to place her is his memory apparently i the one who easy to ignore derek said with a joking sigh harry blinked and looked over at him sorry no hello he muttered i harry i know derek said easily his smile still in place as he reached out a hand to shake harry s you re naomi ryan harry asked still watching her intensely hello harry she said smiling her soft smile i know you harry said which seemed very out of character naomi nodded i think we met in a bookshop once maybe the remainder of the encounter consisted of harry behaving oddly and ginny politely chatting with naomi concluding with several entreaties on ginny part for naomi to instruct nadine and andy to write her constantly over the summer interestingly enough the next stop naomi and derek made was at ginny own table where they chatted happily with baron gretchen and theo ginny didntrealize that she had been staring when she felt harry eyes on her baron ramsey he harry stopped himself and looked decidedly sullen he a good sort he concluded in a perfunctory tone ginny nodded looking over at the terribly proper and imposing figure of baron ramsey he certainly is she agreed though not in the way that harry interpreted it and there it was just recently she had come to the conclusion that theo nott was meant only to be her very good friend now it seemed baron ramsey was to have the same fate great as baron was and he truly was wonderful ginny could not see herself being with him not for long certainly not forever he was terribly handsome strong fierce and very nearly perfect but when she tried to imagine him sitting around her family table at christmas there was a decidedly uncomfortable feeling like choosing baron would make ginny not fit in realizing that the one person she could imagine had in fact seen at her dinner table was standing beside her ginny turned to harry impulsively and asked harry would you like to but she never got to ask him to dance as something unseen struck her hard enough to make her break off her question um ginny muttered trying to get her bearings she felt like she d been obliviated or something are you all right harry asked touching her elbow as if he was ready to lend her his support ginny opened her mouth to say yes but the broken feeling made her shake her head something really wrong harry looked around the room briefly his slightly concerned face darkening with alarm i was coming over to say the same thing and as ginny scolded herself for becoming distracted in her errand she straightened herself and became resolute its effect was apparent on her countenance and caused harry to look at her in surprise did you feel that too she asked him yeah what was that it the wards she said quietly someone must be trying to break through them as always harry took all this in without ceremony or making a scene but ginny could tell he was angry to be the cause of the danger harry we ll handle it ginny insisted quietly as she felt the wards tear and shift she and harry both hunched over hands on knees feeling like the wind had been knocked out of them as they panted and recovered harry spoke chilling ginny insides he cantbe defeated yet he said quietly you dontknow that she responded forcefully though more out of determined hope than actual confidence their conversation was cut off suddenly as draco malfoy cried out and fell to his knees not that anyone noticed well they looked over because of his exclamation but the great shimmering behind him was rather more terrifying as it grew bigger and bigger until what looked like a black hole or a tear in the atmosphere had simply appeared where he had been standing the doors and windows immediately slammed shut all around the ballroom glowing briefly silver to show some sort of spell had sealed them ginny thought this was probably not a good thing all the other hogwarts professors and order members had been strangely out of the room save for gertrude wrightman and now they couldntget back inside to help back against the wall all of you gertrude commanded shocking all of the students into looking at her in that odd moment her pale blue eyes appeared so powerful that most obeyed without question she was clad in only the first layer of her dress robes having discarded the outer layer ginny quickly copied her as ginny and harry along with a handful of others made to separate themselves from the mass their attention was attracted back to the portal as a shiny shoe followed by a leg came through the black opening followed further by the body of a man wearing a white mask and black robes he took a moment to look proudly around the room and said so much for the great lily potter wards harry sent the curse before the death eater even finished pronouncing his mother name as happened in the best of his moments he acted on instinct unfortunately the death eater who by his voice ginny and harry had recognized immediately as lucius malfoy dodged and two other death eaters stepped through ginny sent her own curses and both students began racing forward to attack these intruders to shove them back through that portal and in an attempt to stop any more from arriving they noticed no one else but they were observant enough to see that the two other death eaters who arrived bellatrix lestrange and a tall dark haired man whose body language ginny found to be somewhat familiar were doing strange things as they blocked the attacks while bellatrix exchanged hexes with an angry gertrude wrightman the man threw a bottle on the ground breaking it and thus releasing some kind of potion into the room the effects were immediate there was suddenly a shimmering wall between all of the students and the death eaters though the students had been quarantined into two main groups the slytherins and ravenclaws on one side of the ball room the gryffindors and hufflepuffs on another side actually it was three groups counting harry and ginny who had both been crossing the room when the attack began and who were therefore secluded from their dates and the other students just as they had been instructed but a glance around her made ginny realize that luna had been approaching them from the ravenclaw area when the death eaters arrived and was now enclosed in the shimmering cage with them the different walls of light that had sprung up from the potion absorbed the spells that students shot at them and blasted one ravenclaw student who had been so unwise as to touch it back into the wall where he slumped to the ground when ginny turned to watch him she saw baron ramsey standing up beside his sister and theo all three of them looked murderous but when baron saw ginny his eyes flitted to harry and he looked back at her with an almost imperceptible nod before turning back with his sister to watch what was unfolding on the other side of the shimmering barrier gertrude was also casting spells at the shield to no effect if baron looked murderous it was nothing next to how their defense professor looked at that moment you have invaded my home broken my wards and trampled on a pact that was maintained between our families for three hundred years lucius gertrude words were clipped barely restraining the disdain that was written so plainly on her countenance and for that i apologize the senior malfoy answered carefully obviously concerned with the reaction of the hostess bellatrix glanced toward draco who was now lying face down on the floor the portal was creeping out of his back as if it originated there apology not accepted gertrude said almost wryly feeling along the wall of light with her hand sparks ignited but she did not appear harmed ginny wondered why leave my home i have to take down this ward harry muttered to himself not even really seeming to listen to the conversation between adults as he looked at it i have to close that thing before more of them come there were already half a dozen death eaters in the room fanning themselves out how are you planning to do that ginny asked angry scared hating that she could do nothing but watch and listen we arenthere to harm you lucius was saying stepping closer to where gertrude stood by a part of the wall between where ginny harry and luna were sequestered and where the gryffindors and hufflepuffs were penned in you are here to harm my guests gertrude threw back adamantly an offense that i will never forget my lord sends his apologies lucius added with his usual arrogance we are under strict instruction not to harm you so this isntjust another horrid mistake like the ramseys gertrude demanded lucius visibly flinched and ginny couldnthelp looking over at baron again he was obviously on edge and gretchen was practically shaking harry was muttering again the whole ward is layered tied into that death eater who made it with blood magic it ll take ages to dismantle ginny said but harry was already working on it ginny wished hermione were here this was exactly the sort of thing the other girl did best figuring out puzzles if he is willing to enter my home gertrude wondered aloud is malfoy manor secure the black portal was shutting sucking itself back into draco malfoy back where he lay breathing raggedly on the ground there were ten death eaters in all we re almost ready sir a death eater told lucius you re safe where you are the pale blonde aristocrat told gertrude like hell i am she corrected turning her head slightly pim a house elf that ginny recognized as the one who had led harry away to change his clothes earlier popped into the space directly in front of her ginny lifted her head to stare instead of just listen as gertrude demanded take down the wards and banish these men yes mistress the elf piped before disappearing you wouldntdare command elf magic on us bellatrix exclaimed wild eyes swinging around to look at the wrightman matriarch whose own eyes dominated the staring match you broke the treaty gertrude announced still angry enough to spit tell your dark lord that he has lost his audience with the old families with this intrusion and the murder of the ramseys you ve guaranteed our collective animosity he means no harm to you lucius shouted obviously angry and not a little surprised at this turn of events ginny figured that his instructions were probably not to refrain from harming wrightman but rather to carry out their mission without altering what they believed to be her neutrality having failed that he was certainly in for a great deal of pain once his master became aware of it three hundred years malfoy gertrude exclaimed altering her course of anger the old families have remained stable for three centuries and you tossed it away harry kept working on the wards but ginny found herself unable to turn away from the heated exchange between the adults pim appeared in front of gertrude again but this time bellatrix tried to attack the elf who was protected by the shield and just kept addressing her master apparently the wards blocked all spells from any direction interesting door wards takes time mistress the elf sounded close to tears at having to report the delay and we is unable to banish guests why gertrude snapped we used the boy the tall aloof death eater answered motioning toward draco who was still unconscious on the ground we didntbreak in wrightman eyes flashed again but she addressed her elf what about the shield in front of me can you lower it you dontwant to do that gertrude lucius interrupted his voice softening in what may have been his attempt at calming and placating wrightman but only succeeded in sounding patronizing to ginny she doubted wrightman would hear it any differently we were told not to hurt you we re only here for harry potter we can pull him through the wards my guest you mean wrightman snapped avoiding indicating any special status that harry might possess in her concern without thinking ginny called out professor trying to show wrightman that they were all ready for the shield to come down but her cry did not distract the defense professor so much as it drew the attention of lucius malfoy stupid ginny thought to herself her own impulses didntseem to be as good as harry s well well well if it isntthe little diary girl he said mockingly harry stiffened next to her and finally looked up from his work luna took the opportunity to stand at her other side as malfoy continued ginny just stared back at the head of the malfoy family feeling as her anger and her magic swirled stormily inside her kill any students lately he heckled befriend any new dark wizards his eyes lit up when he noticed harry standing beside her or have you been busy trying to pleasure your boyfriend instead ginny smirk belied the torrents and storms of magic that were raging inside her is that really the best you can do lucius ginny taunted back without hesitation she could sense harry surprise at her brashness what did blondie lose his edge in azkaban lucius grew visibly angry as he waved a hand to indicate the area where ginny harry and luna were encapsulated nott bring them to me both of them he specified indicating harry and ginny nott ginny head swung around to look at theo in recognition and horror for what he must be feeling and her former potions partner looked like he d just had a sudden staggering epiphany he was already racing across his warded section of the room sprinting right towards them even as the tall death eater that had thrown the potion walked forward and moved to reach through the ward to them but stopping abruptly when theo came to a halt in front of him they stood alike ginny noted vaguely this doesntconcern you the elder nott was saying you made it concern me when you involved my school theo said unwaveringly panting slightly from his sprint across the room and reaching out his arm so that his hand came into contact with the shield this time it sparked green but as with gertrude it didntthrow theo back as it had the ravenclaw you wouldntdare snarled theo father taking another step forward he was still a couple of meters away let test that theory shall we father theo snarked turning to shout at his classmates get ready to block their spells theodore they need not be hurt nott said sharply yeah it was clearly becoming apparent that death eaters couldntdo placating without patronizing yes your mate lucius has already said no one gets hurt if we give hand over harry potter and ginny weasley theo spit out as he turned back around to face his father doesntseem quite right to hand them over after all the times they ve managed to get the best of you lot why not give the rest of us a chance see if you ve really trained me up to be the survivor you always wanted ginny saw harry shock out of the corner of her eye but she was watching theo as he put his other hand up to the ward his father hastened to do likewise but it was too late the shield collapsed theo falling with it as the entire thing seemed to pour into his hands bloody magic ginny thought and then after a strange moment of hesitation the spells started firing donttouch the students unless they fire first lucius yelled somehow banishing all those near him to an unknown location outside of the ballroom baron and gretchen were among the first to go followed quickly by the rest of the slytherins most of the ravenclaws and quite a few of the gryffindors and hufflepuffs theo father grabbed him angrily and shoved a portkey in his hand before he could wrench himself away sending him quickly out of sight with a look of horror and not a little fury on his face these numbers dontlook good ginny thought distractedly as she dodged spells and sent her own in return the death eaters were noticeably getting every student out of the room except for her and harry and luna who was doggedly covering ginny back in the chaos of hexes the boy shrieked bellatrix when only the three teenagers and their teacher remained with the death eaters get the boy a scan of the room as she and her two friends skirted and dodged around tables and decorations told her that three death eaters were dead or incapacitated seven on four not the greatest odds even with an unspeakable and the boy who lived on your side nott avery and flint sequester gertrude do not harm her lucius yelled motioning to where the defense professor had just taken out two more death eaters and disappeared behind a rather convenient grand piano that had been uprooted by the melee now three more were racing toward her and even ginny didntthink she could handle that many on her own but at least their odds were closer to even five on four they could swing that she thought as she and harry sent cutting and blasting curses toward gertrude attackers luna continued to cover them as they did and ginny flinched as one of the pursuers who was not theo father was struck by one of her cutting hexes followed immediately by harry impedimenta which had the effect of blowing off the body part where the cut sliced him in his case his hip and in so doing his entire leg four on four now ginny thought to herself turning to help luna fend off bellatrix and lucius before lucius left to replace the incapacitated death eater in pursuit of gertrude gertrude was able to move around as long as she remained hidden by upturned furniture and decorations and was getting in a few hits now and then but she was up against three grown men two of which were very powerful wizards and just as they began to close in on her the room was filled with the deafening sound of the wards to the estate finally collapsing it was like wrenching steel and a million elastic bands snapping around them but so loud and personal because of their inclusion in the wards that they could feel the vibrations in their chests and the wrenching in their bones more importantly however right as the noise began to dissipate house elves immediately began pouring into the room there must have been close to a hundred of them once all was said and done and most of them rushed to rescue their mistress who was dodging and defending herself rather formidably despite being outnumbered three to one unspeakable indeed once nott had been severely stunned and avery had apparently been killed gertrude shouted instructions at the elves while she dueled with malfoy many of the elves disappeared from the room on what ginny figured were gertrude instructions to find the other students and get them to safety suddenly a loud boom went up causing everyone even the two dueling slytherins to stop in their tracks and turn to see what was causing it bellatrix had cast some type of ejection spell presumably one involving very dark magic since vivid green walls of eerie shimmering light had erected themselves between the wizards and the elves and the elves grew agitated when they found that the walls could not be penetrated gertrude gaze shifted briefly to the teenagers and then quickly back to her opponent but not quickly enough lucius booming intonation of a summoning spell caught gertrude off guard costing her her wand and he quickly strung her upside down in the air in the back of her mind ginny noted with amusement that at some point behind that overturned piano gertrude had charmed her dress into shorts and a sensible shirt ginny immediately did the same and luna followed suit only to be hit and knocked out by a curse that harry would have recognized as the one that had struck hermione at the department of mysteries the year before chapter 15 the beat goes on ginny raced over to check on luna kneeling beside her and feeling the beginnings of real hysteria start to form as she saw the too familiar curse slashed across her friend stomach oh merlin it was the same curse that had hit hermione the year before the same curse the one that had put her in the hospital for forever they needed to get her out of there ginny harry called out banishing a table at lucius malfoy the death eater blew it apart causing splinters to fly at him he beckoned for bellatrix to take control of wrightman as he went and confronted the teen her friends were fighting or lying on the ground or banished the stain glass window looking over the formal garden had pieces of a human body stuck to it ginny and harry had done that they had killed a man they had it was too much the magic inside ginny began to grow to reach out to try to protect her ginny harry called again he was fighting still wrightman was still hanging upside down this was what the d a was about what her training was about what the department of mysteries had been like ginny tightened her grip on her wand and stood shooting curse after hex after curse until she stood beside harry and they fought together wrightman harry panted dodging a nasty looking jagged spell ginny spun out of the way she understood what he was saying the professor needed her wand back lucius had taken it ginny shot a bat boogey hex at lucius to distract him quickly followed by the spearing and crimineus charms even though the death eater managed to dodge all the spells the effort he expended doing so gave harry time to summon the wand from lucius pocket and throw it to the defenseless professor caught up in the feeling of triumph ginny didntnotice the impedimenta spell until it was too close to dodge though she tried anyway wandless magic was useless if she couldntmove her hand enough to release herself from this slow moving prison stuck where she was ginny was forced to watch bellatrix make a brutal motion with her wand that sent wrightman careening toward the ground even with her wand it seemed wrightman was unable to protect herself from such a swift plummet the crack of her left arm breaking made ginny magic flare once more it is only out of respect for your mother that i dontkill you now bellatrix shouted slashing her wand at gertrude and sending a bright blue spell at her a gold spell intercepted it which was a lucky thing since ginny wasntsure wrightman could have rolled out of the way in time however when she saw that the spell had come from lucius malfoy she was surprised you will not harm her lucius called out even as harry and he exchanged more and more rapid curses just try to stop me bellatrix yelled brandishing her wand as she and gertrude wrightman began to fight crucio you never were subtle wrightman proclaimed hefting herself off the ground with her good arm to avoid the spell one of the professor curses slashed bellatrix arm but the black haired woman didntseem to feel it as she continued her assault subtle i ll make you scream bellatrix called back a red spell flew past her you will weep with pain as you feel the power of the dark lord it used to be your own power that mattered wrightman called out sneeringly a dark blue spell hurtled toward her catching her foot and tripping her briefly it used to be you that mattered no longer you ve given up everything for him pride honor beauty spoken like a bloodtraiter bellatrix cried out wrightman entire body flew to the right crashing into the broken piano lying on the ground her left arm useless she was unable to move out of the way fast enough to avoid bellatrix lestrange kicking away her wand then the death eater pressed her shoe against wrightman neck with enough force to make it clear that she could kill the defense professor in a moment are you ready to die the woman asked smoothly you cantkill me wrightman bit back through her pain glaring bellatrix laughed crazily you can do only as you are ordered you re nothing more than a slave wrightman spat ginny felt a flash of pride watching the scene seeing her professor so unwilling to yield even though she was obviously hurting i not the one on the ground bellatrix shrieked backing away two steps and casting the bashing hex it hit gertrude broken arm which suddenly looked sickeningly lumpy and bled profusely despite screaming in pain gertrude managed to roll clutching her arm closer to her wand bellatrix gave a particularly condescending look to wrightman as the professor continued to slide backwards how far you have fallen from grace gertrude you a black want to talk about falling the intrepid professor panted from the ground you will not speak of my family bellatrix screamed what family gertrude shouted back you killed them all the counter jinx to the impedimenta caught ginny unawares she never did see who cast it and since she had been struggling against the spell she immediately fell forward scrambling to keep hold of her wand even as she rushed toward harry ginny saw nott had also obviously been awakened since he began firing curses at gertrude ginny changed directions and went to aid her professor but when she got there and started fighting back nott had shoved bellatrix lestrange toward lucius and harry nott was clutching his side in obvious pain gertrude and ginny could have easily taken him in such a state if the professor hadntbeen half broken and nearly exhausted and ginny hadntstill been shaking off the after affects of the jinx the boy we need the boy he wheezed it was obvious to a panicked ginny that he meant for bellatrix to incapacitate harry and steal him away while nott kept them busy harry she saw was covered in scratches and cuts red bloodstains making his blue shirt dark as it stuck to his skin but he was harry and ginny knew that meant he would fight to his death before he went willingly bellatrix lestrange however had plans other than mere kidnapping still angry from her exchange with gertrude and still needing to vent it the female death eater raised her wand and cast the second unforgivable crucio harry screams filled the entire hall the entire mansion filling ginny consciousness and making her want to explode with anger instead all it did was unlock the full fury of her magic and with gertrude taking on nott and lucius reopening the portal the black void growing even then ginny reached out a hand with nothing but malicious intent and yelled imperio the spell that pulled away from her felt unlike anything she had ever cast before unlike even her dream it felt like ginny was reaching out with her magic and wrapping lestrange up in it and with nothing more than desire ginny made bellatrix lestrange leap backward at the wall and break her own wand but then there was only darkness as ginny was hit with a spell she had not seen so consumed was she with the control she wielded she fell with an angry smile on her face in the hospital wing at hogwarts thinking back on the ball ginny felt the first stirrings of panic as she remembered those last moments she had cast an unforgivable she had cast an unforgivable in front a bunch of death eaters her professor and harry this was not good what if they sent her to azkaban no they had no proof she d done it wandlessly they didntneed to know but she knew and that was awful enough out of her daze of guilt and memories ginny recognized the sounds of someone moving about the room ginny sat up and recognized the blurry image of professor wrightman standing at the base of the bed next to hers professor ginny said voice shaky what the hell had she been hit with wrightman arm in a sling looked over at her you re awake yes how re you ginny asked pushing herself further up on her bed your arm will be healed by this time tomorrow professor snape provided a salve her clear blue eyes had dark circles underneath them how long have i been here two days you also spent one night and one day in st mungo s but i brought you here for further treatment wrightman said you did madam pompfrey is reliable and discreet she said sinking into the chair at the base of the bed it was the first time ginny had ever seen her look so worn but then she remembered the professor scrambling on the ground and sneering at bellatrix lestrange and decided that wrightman was never entirely weak the person on the bed next to hers stirred and ginny glanced over it was harry looking pretty awful what wrong with him a medley of curses and some rather awful dreams wrightman said watching the fitful boy but he ll be okay ginny asked not taking her eyes from harry wanting to reach out and hold his hand he ll survive he always does wrightman looked down at him with a thoughtful if grave expression and ginny couldnthelp but think of the memories in the pensieve that she had seen how many times had she stood by the victims of an attack how many hadntmade it then another thought came to ginny and she asked how luna wrightman looked toward the corner of the infirmary where there were curtains drawn around the last bed she recovering her father with her she was hit by that same thing that got hermione last year ginny said by a less skilled wizard wrightman said luna was one of ginny best friends and she didntknow what would happen if she lost her and everyone else the other students theo and baron the questions were starting to overflow but her professor seemed willing to answer they were banished from my estate to the outlying town theodore was portkeyed to his home none sustained serious injury how how did this happen ginny wanted to know you suspected it why did you keep us there why not send us away i didntthink they would be able to breech the property gertrude stared hard at harry now still face my wards have been infallible for close to twenty years it didntoccur to me that draco being the black heir would change that why should that matter gertrude eyed ginny unhappily you ve seen my memories miss weasley you know to whom i was betrothed and you know that old families can never fully break the magic in that agreement it is the reason i am able to visit 12 grimmauld place and if the black heir wanted to invite guests to one of my homes after he had been willingly invited in he had every right to do so she clearly would not speak about this anymore as for how they banished the students i have only guesses well that not exactly comforting ginny said balling the sheets up in her hand wrightman didntrespond for a woman who had been bleeding and beaten she still managed to look poised how did we get out ginny asked after you incapacitated bellatrix lestrange the barrier in front of my elves fell and they took all of you to st mungo s and you i stayed to watch the last death eater leave my home which happened rapidly once harry was gone and then i collapsed the old wards to let the aurors in gertrude said as if she had let herself down despite the impressive fighting that she had done about bellatrix ginny said voice scratchy but strong i did something cutting her off gertrude locked eyes with ginny and said if you re going to be vague dontbother continuing but i stopped her wrightman said firmly a glint in her eye so she did remember ginny use of the imperius but she was willing to let it go it seemed absolution on a gold tray that not right ginny said remembering the rush of power she d felt controlling that awful woman where the line wrightman laid her hands on the arms of the chair what line the one that makes you good good doesntmatter in war just choices and consequences professor wrightman stood i need to go home my house elf will collect you from professor mcgonagall office when madam pomfrey clears you gertrude swept out of the room in her light blue robes and clicking shoes she was a strange professor an even stranger confidant and ginny wondered if she would ever understand her but instead of trying to figure that out ginny rested her head on the pillow and decided that a little more sleep would be good for everyone the next time ginny opened her eyes harry was sitting up in bed clutching his head it seemed to be early morning harry what the matter ginny asked waking far more quickly than last time he happy about something harry muttered hands on his temples voldemort was happy despite not capturing any of them was it possible that the entire thing was a distraction for a grander plan but then why send such important death eaters what about she asked i dontknow it gone now harry said wincing as he shifted sitting positions ginny relaxed against the wall behind her closing her eyes briefly and trying to adjust to the light when she had spoken to professor wrightman it had been at night well at least you re up now i ll have someone to talk to i d get bored here all by myself ginny said he asked about everyone including their blonde professor and ginny filled him in on everything that she knew why d we get moved here harry asked probably because pomfrey treated you so many times that she has a secret cache of potions just for you ginny said harry looked slightly amused but more preoccupied he looked toward the door through which the matron usually came bustling luna going to be alright harry asked eyes darting to the curtain i dontknow sounded like she was in bad shape but you know luna she a fighter that kind of you to say luna herself said in her usual airy way then the strangest thing happened she appeared from behind the curtain on a chair with great big wheels on either side i ve gotten this wonderful muggle chair from father which is nice madam pomfrey said i couldntwalk yet because of the blood that gushes out when i move so i sit and push and it still bleeds a little but not as much the blonde girl had great big bandages wrapped around her middle there were a couple of red splotches that seemed to indicate it needed to be switched but those disappeared as all blood did in good magical bandages it was an exciting night though wasntit luna said now at the foot of the space between ginny and harry a bit like fighting at the ministry i wish i could have been more help you were brilliant luna ginny said covered me like a pro dumbledore army really is wonderful isntit if there was anything that luna was especially good at it was making the most of every situation and in this case she managed to make the entire night feel more distant and less threatening than it really was which ginny and harry both appreciated luna would be staying at spinner end for the summer and ginny was relieved not to have to be particularly concerned with her safety over the holiday the three talked until pomfrey came out and nearly had a fit that luna was wheeling herself about the room worrying that the matron would explode if she faced any more tension ginny took her potions quietly and without questions her family visited and they were generally very wonderful her mother brought her favorite cookies in a big tin and put them next to the bed her dad gave her a hug but couldntsay much beyond that ron and hermione visited harry and as always it was like he was a different person when it was jut the three of them engaged and adamant hermione fussed of course like anyone might expect she would ron gave harry a nudge and told him that he thought harry knew he was only supposed to get into trouble like this when ron and hermione were there to help him which made harry grin it didntseem odd at all to ginny that while only family was supposed to visit hermione and ron managed to lodge themselves next to harry until pomfrey cleared the room that night for them to sleep assuring everyone that they would be released the next day luna would have to stay awhile longer the next morning after they d had breakfast and dressed and said goodbye to luna harry and ginny left the infirmary together harry was heading to dumbledore office where he was going to use the floo to go to spinner end ginny was heading to mcgonagall s you re going to wrightman house now harry asked as they walked down the corridor yeah ginny said my stuff already there right harry said as if he d forgotten the one in france yeah how d you know that ginny asked stopping at the corridor where they had to split up we talked harry said scratching his ear i thought you didntlike her he shrugged she knew my mum really well like sirius knew my dad if there were one thing in the world that ginny could do it would be to fill harry life with people he could think of as family people like professor wrightman who would wait at the foot of his bed for days to see him wake up people like her mum who hugged harry like a son even when that wasntat all what he needed because that what family was the people who were there when you fell down whether or not you wanted them to see your fall well since i going to slave away under her watch you have to promise to have a fun holiday for me she said harry smiled his boyish smile looking every bit as handsome as the best looking guy in school i ll throw a party at spinner end in your honor with lots of firewhiskey and loud music and awful food she added it not a party unless there are at least three ways to make yourself sick then i ll have to invite the twins they ll bring a dozen ways to make people ill and make it the best party around he said my brothers are very special that way she agreed thinking fondly of fred and george only to feel a sharp pang as she realized that she wouldntsee them for a long time maybe i ll have to sneak out and join you though i sure wrightman could track the french version of the knightbus use muggle transportation harry said a plane and then the chunnel chunnel ginny repeated almost laughing what is that look it up this summer it not like you ll have anything else to do stuck all the way over in france harry teased still smiling i going to be working in london with a whole bunch of really interesting stuff she said sure like the giant brain that tried to eat your brother and the time turners that turned that death eater head into a baby harry said and they laughed exactly like that maybe i ll find a way to make ron grow up at last ginny said impossible hermione tried for years now harry said shaking his head and crossing his arms over his chest but she didnthave the mysteries of the ministry on her side i will and more i will have unspeakables fred and george ll be harassing you for information before the week is out harry said yeah and since you re their secret silent partner i suppose you ll want me to break the secrecy oath or whatever they make me take she said harry looked surprised i didntknow you knew about that the start up money you gave them please i am their favorite of course they told me she said casually how d you figure it out harry asked clearly not believing her lie overheard them talking about shipping you a big box of goods as a thank you she said wasnthard to manipulate out of them why they were doing it but i really am their favorite i could believe that harry said ron always talking about the pranks you pulled on him as a kid he was just a pansy she said waving it off but your bat bogey hex is legendary the twins told me about it harry said she grinned it really was her pride and joy malfoy could attest to that too he does seem to flinch away from you in class he said which made her laugh she supposed if she and harry were very different people that they would talk about what happened at the ball but while they both knew they could neither of them needed to go over it again having spent hours dealing with questions from friends and family instead they gave each other the chance to pretend for just that moment like everything was normal and right a long time ago he had saved her life but they had fought together twice now survived by gritting their teeth and fast instincts and even if he wasntlooking at her like he wanted to make her his second in command she knew that he never looked at anyone like that except ron and hermione at least he wasntapologizing for what happened or checking to make sure she was okay she wasn t he wasnteither but they were alive party or no have a good holiday write me sometime ginny said giving him a quick hug and if he held onto her a bit longer than was strictly necessary she tried not to notice as she attempted to squash the butterflies that had suddenly come to life in her stomach i ll try he said looking sheepish try she asked smilingly i not a very good correspondent he said and though his words were light he looked very much like he had right before going to umbridge class the year before tense and purposeful you re going to do something stupid arentyou she asked watching his eyes carefully because while he made carrying burdens look natural he kept getting a bit older than he should he didntreply just looked at her rather closely as if he were trying to memorize her face she wouldnthave noticed except that on the heels of a ball that she knew he would never talk about she worried that he was leaving for some reason but then he brushed the back of his finger along ginny cheek and she was forced suddenly to concentrate on trying to breathe you ll have a good holiday he said quietly and she couldntlook away from his eyes even as his hand dropped down to his side are you trying to say goodbye to me she asked he just gave her a half smile what could he possibly be doing that would make him act so strangely she comforted herself with the knowledge that she would be spending the holiday helping him in her own way and that ron and hermione would be with him fighting to protect him just like always i know you re capable of a lot she said but dontforget that we re here when you need us neville luna and i especially i won t he said sincerely good she said despite having accomplished absolutely nothing i ll see you in september i suppose have a good time with wrightman have fun at your party she said grinning and turned to leave it was hard to properly explain how surprised she was when he grabbed her hand looking questioningly at him she would have raised an eyebrow if she could but any words she might have asked stuck in her throat when he took a step forward and stood so close to her that she wasntentirely sure what was happening then he put his hand on her waist and she forgot nearly everything else they were so close so painfully wonderfully close that she could feel the hum of his body the steady if hurried beating of his heart the raggedness of his breathing on her cheeks the overwhelming rush of desire increased as she twisted her face to look up at him enhancing the already palpable heat between them and ginny honestly thought she was either going to snog him to within an inch of his life or pass out his eyes were smoldering and ginny felt like every nerve in her skin was buzzing and the look in his eyes was so bloody intense that she wasntsure if he wanted to kiss her or thrash the living daylights out of her and oh did she want him to kiss her but then his eyes closed off and he stiffened as though he d mentally withdrawn and dropped his hand she wanted to hex him are you just playing with me she asked yanking herself completely away from him what what the hell was that she asked pointing to where they just stood why did you i just i didntwant you to go so you did that you thought that was she cut herself off too angry to continue do you have no idea how i feel about you how much i dontjust play with me either kiss me next time or let me walk away if he ever did kiss her or love her or ask her out or what have you it had to be what he truly wanted ginny didntwant to be settled for and she sure as hell didntwant to settle for someone who didntlove her of his own volition they had just gone through yet another terribly harrowing sequence of events and a kiss right now could be the result of many other things besides love still she just wanted a sign any sign that she wasntalone on this that he wanted her all to himself quite as badly as she wanted him so against her own will against the will of her body that was practically screaming for contact with him ginny backed away from harry held his gaze for a moment and walked away living at gertrude wrightman s ginny found out the first day was rather like staying at a hotel her room was always clean whenever she came back to it the sheets were changed daily the food was never prepared by a family member and the first floor of the mansion was constantly housing various guests for tea dinner dessert or just a discussion so it was very important to always wear formal robes ginny was in the process of finding her way from her room to the kitchen and getting lost in the second dining room the china room and the second floor loo along the way when she heard professor wrightman voice and decided just to ask for directions she pondered the thought of leaving breadcrumbs behind her as a guide next time but already knew from her short stay that the wrightman house elves would pick up the crumbs before they hit the ground i ve heard that you have a houseguest a woman said to professor wrightman as ginny stepped up to the door ginny couldntsee her but the woman sounded friendly and casual and walked with purpose in her elegant sunrobes yes a new apprentice to the department of mysteries professor wrightman said extending a left arm to direct the woman a bit closer to ginny so she a troublemaker like you the woman said turning ginny caught a glimpse of her face and she interrupted without thought wotcher ginny called out the stranger who at a glance ginny had incorrectly pegged for the young auror nymphadora tonks turned professor wrightman merely raised an eyebrow at ginny yet with just that stupid eyebrow lift that tiny blonde woman managed to make ginny feel as though her mother had given her a thorough dressing down that irritated ginny a lot the stranger watched ginny weasley with a curious amused on her face wrightman gestured toward ginny as she said andromeda tonks i would like to introduce to you my houseguest ginevra weasley ginny inclined her head shocked to be meeting tonks mother it did not surprise her however that the name tonks sounded odd in professor wrightman voice pleased to meet you miss weasley though you seem to be acquainted with me already mrs tonks said ginny was so caught up in identifying the other faces that she saw in this woman countenance tonks for one as well as mrs malfoy and bellatrix lestrange that it took her a moment to realize that andromeda might not know about her daughter involvement in the order sorry about that ginny said trying to sound sincere you looked like a friend of mine is all i hope the comparison a good one i not a young witch anymore mrs tonks said her grey eyes watching ginny a flash of unexpected hurt stabbed ginny in the gut the woman served as a visible reminder of both sirius and bellatrix lestrange how could professor wrightman stand to talk to this woman were you looking for something professor wrightman asked ginny causing her to stop staring at andromeda tonks what oh yes i was trying to find the kitchen ginny said looking directly at her professor and not daring to give into her curiosity and stare again at sirius cousin shenny professor wrightman called oh no it not his fault ginny protested but the pop of the house elf cut her off yes mistress asked shenny the tiny green elf that professor wrightman had assigned to follow ginny everywhere she went miss weasley was having difficulty finding the kitchen wrightman said shenny is not knowing this mistress the elf said looking guilt ridden and horrible that of course made ginny feel terrible miss weasley is your charge until september i will not remind you again shenny is knowing but miss wheezy is asking shenny to be staying away shenny said large blue eyes focused on wrightman ginny wanted to stomp on the ground and pout when professor wrightman looked questioningly at her you asked shenny to stay away just for a little while ginny said trying not to sound ungrateful for the ridiculously nice gift of her own personal house elf for the summer merlin knows her mother had always said her life would be a thousand times easier if the family had one and life was but it was also creepy to turn around and have shenny right there all the time shenny was so good at his tasks that i wanted to give him a break and see if i could find my way to the kitchen on my own the professor gave her an odd look shenny job is to make your stay as enjoyable and efficient as possible i know and he been really wonderful ginny said then if you wouldntmind the company shenny can lead you to the kitchen now wrightman said effectively dropping the subject which was fine wrightman had probably been raised with her own house elf and couldntreally understand why ginny wouldntbe comfortable having a servant running around and generally making life easier miss be following shenny please the house elf said quickly leading ginny out of the room ginny spared a moment to incline her head at wrightman and tell mrs tonks it was nice to meet her she must know nymphadora people are only ever that interested in me after they meet my daughter on a pink or purple hair day mrs tonks said ginny stopped walking just outside their line of sight cocking her head to the side to listen to the answer to that potentially problematic question eavesdropping really was becoming a problem for her wasntit nymphadora aside from changing her features weekly left school three years before ginevra arrived ginny wanted to be surprised at professor wrightman effective brushing off of the comment but all she could manage was to wonder if wrightman actually knew that ginny was acquainted with tonks that young girl stared at me like i was a particularly complicated puzzle ginny was involved in that ministry business last june professor wrightman said and even if she hadntbeen the azkaban escape last january was on the front page of the prophet ah yes of course bellatrix the only person to leave a stronger impression than a spiky hair metamorphagus auror andromeda tonks said she always was rather special and mother claimed we looked like twins i have never noticed much of a resemblance professor wrightman said sounding oddly comforting in her detached way ginny began to walk away again trying to find her helpful little house elf even as she wondered how wrightman could be so calm talking about bellatrix the woman who had attacked her and her home less than a week ago horrible as it sounded it was difficult to forgive andromeda tonks for being connected to the people that had scorned and killed sirius but maybe ginny ought to focus on the fact that andromeda was also related to tonks and sirius himself and remember that sirius had pointed to her scorch mark on the wall and said that she was his one decent cousin ginny and the house elf had arrived at the kitchen and the little creature was running around making ginny all sorts of wonderful snacks and drinks if she ever thought she could be this pretentious ginny might have gotten used to this lifestyle after accepting a cup of tea and enough sweets to fill a plate ginny found herself wandering into the sitting room adjacent to the kitchen where gertrude daughter sat reading sheet music on the bench of the grand piano at nine juliette was perfectly adorable looking so concentrated her uptight piano tutor did not look adorable however and ginny felt very wrong carrying her food through the room but when the little girl began playing ginny stopped moving to listen it seemed hard to believe that a nine year old was playing that piece even with the piano keys moving close together to help her along her little hands could never reach the appropriate spots ginny peeked over the top to see that the girl hands were indeed the only ones on the keys excellent she made a mental note to pressure theo or devon into playing her something at school when they got back sure that all those old families took similar lessons after the song was done ginny felt like clapping but seeing as her hands were full she settled on saying you play beautifully the girl looked over at her with sharp blue eyes but she and her tutor started talking rapidly in french before juliette could say anything to ginny she would have to brush up on her translation spells before the end of the summer gertrude son demetrius was similarly occupied with a tutor in the study down the hall from the main entry that ginny passed on her way to find a table outside at which to eat juliette and demetrius ginny had found out quickly were really intelligent accomplished kids ginny found a nice table outside with a soft chair and settled down to munch on her snacks and look over the grounds shenny was happy to pop in and out and provide anything ginny needed yes the house was very very impressive is this where you meant to go ginny started at the sound of gertrude voice and spun around to see the older woman standing in the doorway looking over her estate with a content look on her face ginny wasntsure if she had ever seen her professor look like that and for the first time ginny realized that this place truly was her home actually yes ginny said it a beautiful view you have a lovely home thank you gertrude nodded as if to herself and said we ll be having company at dinner they had had company the night before two women from a board that wrightman was on who spoke french and andromeda tonks had stopped over for tea that day prompting ginny to jokingly say if you re going to have this many guests on a regular basis i ll need a few more formal robes wrightman nodded smartly i ll have a tailor come by tomorrow i was joking ginny said quickly wrightman looked at her it was a good suggestion and that was the end of that discussion yep ginny was certainly in for a very interesting holiday the new robes ginny got were exquisite the best materials and tailors there were about a dozen of them and though ginny tried to protest at first wrightman brushed it all aside and merely said that ginny would repay her by wearing the robes as often as possible which actually worked out well because ginny probably fit into wrightman house better in the new robes wrightman mansion was impeccable the walls were clean the floor was spotless the carpet was squashy and stainless the couches looked new voices were kept low even the portraits were polite it was such a stark contrast to the warm lived in feel of the burrow not that wrightman wasntlovely it was the details were incredible high vaulted ceilings gorgeous orange glass vases on old mahogany counters soft music playing whenever you entered a room lighting coming from invisible candles large glass windows and doors that looked out with a view of the alps and a large garden in the back maintained by thousands of spells it was overwhelming stunning the library was huge and the food delicious plus there were always interesting people visiting friends of gertrude husband who was in russia for months attending a conference concerning some kind of international treaty who spoke french but switched to english to ask ginny polite questions until gertrude subtly placed the french translation spell on ginny there were people from families whose names ginny knew but had never met she was pretty sure a spanish princess visited for tea the third day and all the while juliette and demetrius learned their lessons and politely presented themselves ginny admired their patience if she were eight or ten she would have been complaining too loudly for her mother to think let alone discuss the politics of the asian wizarding society those first few days were also a time when ginny had to fill out all the paperwork concerning her job sign an unbreakable non disclosure agreement and have a medical check up at st mungo for her job they also had her wand examined tested for jinxes and hexes and tagged with a locator spell for safety was the ministry this strict before the break in ginny asked gertrude yes gertrude said only the physical security systems have been updated oh we do a lot of work that the public should not know about until it has practical applications so we like to ensure its secrecy ginny could not be more excited to start work and learn all about those secrets her first day of work found ginny and wrightman walking through the ministry but not taking the same route to the department of mysteries that she and her friends had employed at the end of her fourth year through the lifts in the atrium to the black door and the revolving door room instead they used the lift to take them to the magical law enforcement level on the highest floor of the ministry well the second highest since the highest was thought to be the minister private chamber they walked through the rows of offices and entered a nondescript door a regular looking man glanced up at them and said good morning can i help you not today but thank you wrightman replied pulling a piece of parchment from her carrying case and putting it in the rubbish bin which promptly lit on fire wrightman then pulled a pinch of floo powder out of a satchel and threw it on the bin the man at the desk must have noticed ginny curiosity about the magic involved in creating what was likely a floo connection through a fire that wasntinside a fireplace it an internal network the man said to ginny smiling he looked at wrightman is this the apprentice she nodded nice to meet you the man said standing and extending a hand ginny shook it feeling a shock pass through her and quickly yanking her hand back ouch sorry about that just another precaution to let you use the internal network the man explained wrightman moved toward the fire ginny shook her hand out a bit and leaned over to examine the green flame in the bin i ve never heard of anything like this before ginny said impressed the unspeakables were such a mysterious group that it didntsurprise her to learn they had their own private modes of transportation she wondered if that might work for any house a closed circuit floo would ensure that it could not be monitored the order would definitely be interested in something like that especially if it could extend beyond a single building too bad she was magically bound to keep it a secret the man grinned it all a matter of thought the network functions not as an elastic conductor between two fireplaces for the travel of the witch or wizard and their physical bearings but rather as a focused tunnel between two infinitely smaller points and because of the size and the limited distance and number of passengers the portals can be redesigned to transport the ethereal matter that is your thoughts which your physical self follows i hope you ll explain that again to me sometime ginny sort of followed his reasoning but didntfully understand the mechanics perhaps at the end of the summer she d understand a bit better her excitement for her apprenticeship grew he started to say it works like you ll have time to explain your theories later carver gertrude cut him off which was a shame because ginny was hoping to know more about it but then the professor calmly said office 7 password imparare before stepping into the fire there was a moment pause and then the professor looked like she was sucked through a small hole in the ground after waiting a moment to make sure wrightman wasntstill in the floor ginny repeated office 7 password imparare and stepped into the fire just like her professor had and then she was suddenly yanked straight down instinctively she closed her eyes and tucked in her elbows like she always did when flooing it felt very very little like the floo there was no spinning just rapid falling and then an abrupt stop when she opened her eyes she was in gertrude wrightman personal office and ginny first thought was that it couldntactually be wrightman s the office was covered wall to wall with pictures pictures of gertrude in her school robes pictures of gertrude with her mother whom ginny had seen in gertrude pensieve and a severe looking man ginny assumed was her father pictures of gertrude looking unhappily at a cat that wound around her ankle pictures of quidditch games with gertrude in the stands and one of gertrude at a christmas ball as ginny circled the room looking at all of the hanging pictures a pony next to young gertrude jumped to one of gertrude and three girls ginny assumed were her year mates she said i really hadntexpected this gertrude looked around as if she didntdo it very often and the sight of the walls made her feel odd did you hang all of these ginny asked no ginny found the picture from the yearbook the friendship appreciation day one that had a young lily potter in it actually once she took the time she saw lily potter pop up quite a few times including one where she was standing next to gertrude while holding a tiny baby with tuft of jet black hair ginny gaped is that harry gertrude walked over to look closer yes she offered no further explanation he so small it was just after he was born wrightman said eyes trailing over the colorful pictures soon ginny had found pictures of wrightman with her two children as toddlers pictures of wrightman on her wedding day looking formally beautiful in her posed picture with her bride maids it was like the room was a scrapbook of gertrude wrightman life and the blank space on the wall behind her desk was waiting for more how did you do this ginny asked she wanted to do the same thing to her room at home wrightman moved to sit behind her desk lily did it she enchanted the room to display copies of any picture that had me in it as long as people cast a simple charm on it and you ve charmed all of these pictures ginny found a picture of what must have been the black and white ball that theo and baron and gretchen had been talking about wrightman dress was a striking white with a bit of a plunging neckline and a thick black stripe around the middle of her tiny waist the people in the background matched no lily told quite a few people about the mirror charm gertrude said including my house elves whom she recruited to put the charm on all of my photo albums ginny smiled you never asked them to stop i did but then there were people like christine mcgrath who insisted on continuing the tradition ginny remembered sirius staring at photos in the middle of the night and wondered if he had cast a few charms that night as well it s ginny couldnteven think of a single word wonderful amazing colorful so very not gertrude wrightman these pictures made the small little office feel more like a home than the giant mansion that wrightman actually lived in the one filled with couches no one used and portraits of people who looked absolutely stiff in their frames all day cozy is a word some people use wrightman supplied settling into her desk with one last look around i need to fill out a few forms before you ll be able to go in officially please sit ginny duties were soon assigned to her for the first two days she would work with each of the unspeakable groups over the course of her apprenticeship acquainting herself with everyone and their work taking notes for them doing any research they required and writing weekly reports about what she saw and how she thought it might apply to the research that other groups were doing once her internship started however it became clear almost immediately that most of the unspeakables expected ginny to pick things up without explanation she worked in all of the rooms in different capacities and studied some of the experiments going on in each the brain room was working to create a broom powered by thought which seemed impossible until carver started talking about the magic inherent in thought if we could channel the astronomical energy that the brain uses for everyday functions like controlling your toes and convert that into energy more like that which it uses to channel your magic from your magical core through your wand we could create a thought powered broom he claimed brooms today explained a woman working with him require many many charms and spells it makes them susceptible to hexes and jinxes but we worry that what we mean to create may require a magical core carver added which may result in a really large useless wand that would drain you of magic as you rode like the current ones do the woman was sitting at one of the desks surrounding the large green tank in the middle of the room that housed the pearly white brains carver stood next to her so we re trying to isolate the energy of a thought impulse to see how it works any suggestions carver asked he and his partner her name was luster looked at her quite seriously i ve never considered a problem quite like this ginny admitted carver smiled none of us had before we came here that half the fun they talked a bit more about the work they were doing and ginny took some notes then they segued into a discussion of the way non verbal spells were powered by thought and how the main goal of the room had always been to understand the relationship between thought and magic and whether it was the actual word that mattered or if it was the idea of the spell they wanted to know about how thought was converted into magic and ginny spent three hours talking to them about the various theories involved in their study she d written five feet more about the room than she was supposed to as part of her assignment actually she d written more than was require for all of the rooms though the brain room seemed to be the only one that was trying to find a way to create a specific object that harnessed the power of their subject other rooms focused more on general application for instance the end of the first week found ginny in the planet room working with five unspeakables to try to learn how to strip one of the planets of its gravity completely once we ve stripped it a man named kershner said we ll look into simply cutting its gravitational pull in half we re trying to find ways to control general household objects so that they dontfall so quickly to the ground in a way that doesntrequire a prolonged levitation spell to keep the objects from breaking ginny guessed the man nodded exactly the hall of prophecy actually asked us to find a way to protect the prophecies even if they were knocked off their shelves and we thought that if we could make them fall at half or one fourth the speed of gravity that would be a good first step she spent the second week working with them on that project she spent hours in the ministry library on the third flood looking up spells and then practicing them in the planet room when she and wrightman arrived every morning it was the first place she went looking up and recording useful information and trying to apply it throughout the day she was more engaged in this work than she had ever been in her schoolwork though she found her schoolwork helpful in fact she d had to brew a couple of potions to test a theory she had about dipping objects in a permanent solution that had enough dragon tongue to make it float it wasntharnessing gravity but rather using a spell she thought that they could study the behavior of the object in the planets room in order to see the specific changes they wanted to aim for almost unbelievably all of the unspeakables treated ginny like an equal they took her work and suggestions and commentary seriously she often found herself shooting off spells at a crucial moment in an experiment and writing up lab reports at the end of the day that they used the following day it was thrilling it was absorbing and it was frustrating to think about having to switch rooms at the end of the week so she went to the head unspeakable a woman named amelia allen and requested to stay in the planet room a little while longer why allen had asked i find the work they re doing really interesting right now and i think that if we worked on stripping apart the levitation spell breaking down its roots and seeing how each affected a different object in relation to the planets that we might be able to understand which part we should expand on ginny said wondering whether she d managed to convey her reasons coherently luckily for her amelia allen was one department head who made sure she understood exactly what was going on in each and every room she knew exactly what ginny meant and let her stay for an extra week but insisted that she switch after that time and learn more about the other rooms as well while they didntfind the solution to the problem during ginny extra week they made exciting progress as they discovered the affect of using a banishing charm against the pull of gravity she would have loved to stay but she was overdue in the death chamber to work with the three unspeakables who sat at the back of the room backs against the wall and studied the veil that had stolen sirius black from the wizarding world ginny had thought that seeing the veil would make her want to throw up or cry or break down but instead it made her feel empowered it also weirdly made her feel like she belonged more than any other room in the building ginny felt like she had a right to be in the room that had stolen her friend the unspeakables there were all soft spoken respectful people with a wide berth of knowledge about all religions even ancient ones we ve traveled to mycenae and studied the ruins the greek temples the aztec temples christian churches jewish temples muslim mosques the man said when the subject was brought up angkor watt was most interesting the carvings the beliefs the magic that exists in the land itself there are magical hotspots all over the world most of the accessible and many of the difficult to reach hotspots have some sort of religious building marking its location suggesting that muggles feel the affects while her work in that room required less spell work as she examined the indestructible veil and archway ginny found it just as fascinating as the planet room but it was wrightman work that had ginny most puzzled she worked with love a locked door that repelled every spell sent at it even avada kedavra ginny asked thoroughly intrigued on the very first day working there no one ever cast it on the door wrightman admitted it could kill you toward the end of the day when amelia allen was checking on wrightman and her team progress ginny asked how all of these rooms had been set up how had love been captured and shoved into that room how had the veil been made to kill people how did they control time the answer had been brief the first unspeakables built these rooms over two hundred years ago allen said did they write down how they did it ginny asked amelia allen looked critically at ginny their notes are in the department archives do you think i could read them ginny asked eagerly the department was everything that she could have ever wanted in an apprenticeship and seeing the notes about how the department had been founded sounded like something she could study for weeks this was the type of stuff binns should have been teaching i will see about giving you access within the week and send you a note allen said standing she left the room then stepping through the third door on the left the moment it shut the doors spun and wrightman and ginny moved over to where the love door had stopped she knows a lot about this department doesntshe ginny remarked working with allen had come to be one of the highlights of working in the dom all of the other unspeakables seemed to defer to the elderly woman who had such intelligent brown eyes ginny would have paid good money to hear a conversation between her and dumbledore their combined knowledge would be staggering she been here a long time she headed the committee in charge of restoring the rooms after the battle last june wrightman said without looking up from her notes after working at the department for a month ginny felt her stomach clench at the reminder of the damage that she and her friends had inflicted she knew that the magic inherently in the objects was unbreakable but she also knew that they probably set the department research back months if not years how long did the repairs take ginny asked they re still on going there were no windows in the department so ginny continued to stare at the door i feel awful about that don t wrightman said picking up her wand and prodding the bottom right corner of the door we learned a great deal about the effects of dark magic from that period which some in the department had been unwilling to use in experiments for moral reasons well if there was any silver lining to a death eater attack ginny was glad to learn that the unspeakables had found it while she was learning an enormous amount at her apprenticeship ginny felt she was learning just as much at wrightman dinners as the professor continued to have interesting and renowned guests drop by almost daily while her father knew many people in the ministry and often had them over mrs weasley had always sent the kids up to bed when the adult discussions began wrightman felt no need to send her children or ginny away so ginny learned about the inner machinations of both the english and french ministries and when the other unspeakables came to dinner ginny finally had a chance to really talk about all of the information that she was absorbing with people who seemed to care about it all as much as she did they made the work of the other departments even the games and sports division pale in comparison though ginny thought it would be rather funny to witness a dinner at the wrightman residence that involved ludo bagman one night ginny was in the sitting room listening to juliette practice the piano before dinner they were both wearing their dress robes already demetrius sat on the sofa reading a book ginny admired their concentration ginny stood and walked over to demetrius sitting next to him and waiting for him to look up which he did rather quickly he had his mother blue eyes but dark hair that probably came from his father whom ginny still had not met what are you reading ginny asked treasure island the boy replied closing his book to show ginny the cover but keeping his page with his finger i read that when i was your age ginny said excitedly she had been expecting him to be reading something non fiction and terribly boring do you like it he nodded it really good madame ortez told me it was jim hawkins meets all these pirates it really exciting he smiled dr livesey and john trelawney remind me of some of my dad friends they were the aristocracy in the book if ginny remembered correctly so that seemed natural ginny and demetrius talked about the book for a long time until she slipped up and talked about a couple of things that he hadntread yet then he politely told her that he d rather not be spoiled and went back to his book he spoke flawless english when ginny first met him he d been speaking french with a house elf and she d been concerned that she wouldntbe able to talk to either of professor wrightman children but he d quickly proven that being bilingual was the least of his talents juliette meanwhile had finished her first piece and was quietly putting her hair in a plait for dinner do you practice every day ginny asked pointing to the piano she knew the girl had practiced while she was there but since starting work at the department of mysteries she d had to work really late hours and occasionally the children were already in bed when they came home yes juliette finished her plait and tied her hair with a ribbon also calligraphy and drawing and i starting to learn chess my brother good at chess ginny said juliette twisted on the bench to look directly at ginny how good ginny couldnthelp but grin he hasntlost in years her eyes widened wow that good she looked like she wanted to ask to play him but thought it was rude if he ever visits i sure he d love to play you ginny said he always wants to play people who might be a challenge and i sure you re very good juliette smiled i d like very much to play him thank you ginny couldnthelp it sitting there in her tailored blue dress robes in that exquisite room with that beautiful grand piano beside her a fresco on the ceiling and a chandelier hanging delicately in the middle of the room she laughed juliette looked unsettled by her outburst sorry ginny said still smiling it just dontyou ever tire of being so polite you re just a kid juliette regarded her curiously i dontknow what you mean ginny opened her mouth to explain about the differences between her house and this one but closed it again when she realized that juliette would probably think the burrow was a horribly loud and unsettling place it made her feel a bit homesick sorry my house is just very different than this oh juliette thought about that for a moment how different i have six brothers for one thing juliette eyes widened that a lot ginny grinned yeah we have enough people for our own quidditch team with one reserve we own a quidditch team the quiberon quafflepunchers juliette said eagerly as if it were quite the same thing to have enough siblings for a team and own one of the best teams in france mum hates their uniforms they re bright pink but everyone says they re traditional the captain threatened to quit if they were changed and he a boy ginny had known the wrightmans owned a decent team in the league a number of years ago but they d sold them in the early eighties it was probably because wrightman husband owned the quafflepunchers it would have been a conflict of interest for one family to own two teams and the family lived in france so it made sense that they kept the local club ginny had to admit that the idea of seeing a quafflepunchers match from the owners box sometime that summer really excited her even if it was just a pre season match she would ask wrightman about that as soon as possible and are they your favorite team ginny asked juliette nodded music forgotten the chasers came to my birthday party last year and brought me a signed retro juliette obviously thought it was just about the greatest birthday present a little girl could ever receive ginny had to agree and not just because she herself had been given a retro but also because she was a quidditch fan just like the next witch and could appreciate a real collectors item have you ridden it yet juliette shook her head papa said i had to keep it in a case until i received proper flying lessons which wontbe until i ten it was only another year but ginny completely understood the girl sadness a house elf appeared in the doorway telling them all that dinner was ready it was probably for the best ginny didntthink she could resist teaching the girl how to break her retro out of its case and have a miniature lesson she might start teaching her a few things anyway if gertrude agreed and if they could find a slower broom for her to work with an old cleansweep maybe which was what ginny had learned on dinner was served in the second dining room that night as it usually was the main dining room had a table that could fit twenty and though it could magically adjust to fit fewer the room felt too big for a smaller crowd ginny had learned the translation charm well enough that she did it silently the moment she realized the guests were not english after the initial introductions the guests switched to english to ask her a question and smiled with delight when they heard her translated response one woman was so pleased with ginny foresight that she asked ginny if her plans after finishing school involved traveling abroad i still not sure ginny replied glancing at the delicious looking meal that had just appeared in front of them the vegetables were always so precisely cut that ginny was sure they d used a real knife instead of a spell which any potions student will tell you cut rather haphazardly my older brothers work abroad though so it always been a possibility the woman eyes lit up even as she picked up her fork to begin eating prompting ginny to do the same what do your brothers do my oldest brother works for gringotts and my second oldest brother is a dragon tamer in romania ginny said taking a bite of carrots just as delicious as always her mother was an excellent cook and ginny would never like anything quite so well as her mother spaghetti but eating at wrightman always felt like they were at a restaurant does your brother work for gringotts in england no actually in egypt ginny loved talking about her brothers it turned out the woman was the minister of finance for the french ministry of magic and had done a lot of business with gringotts she d talked about their protocols and ginny had laughed and said her brother wasntvery likely to follow them as a curse breaker a curse breaker now the woman seemed ready to leap out of her seat with excitement is your brother by any chance much older than you yes he is actually eleven years ginny said curious how she could have guessed that he wouldntbe william weasley would he ginny said he was and asked how she could have known that it turned out that the woman employed the girl that bill was currently dating fleur delacour they d become close when fleur had been sent to egypt to check on french ventures in local branches gringotts had insisted on assigning a guide for her and bill had been sent you mean fleur delacour the tri wizard champion ginny asked blown away by this story i didntknow they were dating yes that her first female champion in two hundred years the woman husband who worked on a committee of some kind with wrightman husband chatted with her all night it was one of the most interesting dinners ginny had had at the wrightman house as she learned about the way budgets were voted on in the french ministry like all of wrightman guests madame unwin was a fascinating gracious woman with a lot of experience who obviously had a lot of power in her ministry as always gertrude your home was lovely and we had a delightful time unwin said inclining her head to the hostess as she and her husband were leaving yes gertrude and please let your husband know we are eager for his return there are a lot of issues that he could help with monsieur unwin said gertrude nodded i sure he equally anxious to resolve those issues then just as ginny thought they were going to activate their portkey to leave mme unwin turned to her with a pleasant smile and said and miss weasley if you ever decide that you are tired of trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe in england feel free to owl me the finance department could always use a hardworking girl with a good head on her shoulders i enjoying my work but thanks for the offer ginny said grinning it is my pleasure you were a wonderful conversation partner tonight thank you ginny said again i had a nice time talking to you i ll have to tell my brother about meeting you the next time i see him please do after they left gertrude wrightman sat back down in her chair at the table a glass of red wine in her right hand as her left rested in her lap only ginny remained at the table the children had been taken up to bed by their house elves they were nice ginny said idly taking a bite of an extra piece of cake shenny had brought her her personal house elf always did thoughtful things like that and ginny was really quite attached to him wrightman took a sip of her wine and set the glass gently down on the cleared table when bill first went to work for gringotts ginny went on mum nearly killed him she said working for goblins wasntwhat a headboy should be doing then he told her the job was in egypt and she burst into tears it had been an unhappy day at the burrow mr weasley had come home early from a long day just to console his wife it was the first time i remember my dad telling my mum that she needed to accept the fact that voldemort was gone and that her kids would be safe on their own ginny and ron had hidden together in the broomshed pretending like they couldnthear their mum crying percy was the one that found them and told them it would all be okay that they could come out but then mum started ranting about how there were still serial killers like sirius black on the loose ginny said though she didntknow what compelled her she suspected that most people her age had grown up hearing about sirius black as a figure from nightmares a horror story older brothers used to scare you i take it that the first time you met sirius was interesting wrightman said fingers skimming the delicate glass i wasntthere when my mum met him but ron said she screamed like a banshee she still flinched when she brought me to his house later that year though and you ginny had been fascinated by the chance to meet him actually at the time she d thought that he represented what she would have become had harry not found that diary a prisoner of azkaban sirius from the start was imposing and larger than life ginny began noticing the beautiful yellow gem set in wrightman gold wedding band he fought with my mum a lot listened to me and loved harry fiercely he was always fierce about his loyalties gertrude said running her nail across the tablecloth much as he hated it he was a black even at the end yes he did hate it ginny said remembering the angry way sirius lived his life in that house he recklessly threw away heirlooms pictures paintings he wanted none of the legacy he d inherited does andromeda does mrs tonks what gertrude asked with the subtle reminder to use proper respect when talking about someone elder does mrs tonks hate being a black hate her sister ginny asked scooting forward on her seat to be closer to the woman across from her could you imagine hating your brothers no she said then thought a bit i mean i came close with percy because he being a moron but he still my brother and he still would be if he married a death eater or joined the death eaters himself even if he hated you wrightman said folding her hands on the table could you hate him them he wouldntdo that ginny said instantly wrightman gave her a hard look and ginny relented well okay hypothetically if my brother were to lose his mind and make an idiotic decision that even percy would never make i suppose i might find it a bit easier to hate him maybe you wouldnthate him wrightman said because your parents raised you well and you know that you owe your family loyalty shenny popped in to collect ginny empty plate and silverware asking if she would like anything else she asked for tea and he popped back out tomorrow night i ve invited the notts over for dinner wrightman announced the notts ginny asked surprised her professor had seen theo father when he d attacked her home at the end of the year had seen him set up the wards that his son destroyed ginny wondered if there was possibly a different nott family that wrightman had meant wrightman nodded sitting beside the large clear windows that overlooked the balcony with the sky and mountains in the background she looked like the picture of a queen yes theodore nott and his mother oh ginny said surprised and delighted she would love to see her friend shenny popped in and put the tea in front of ginny sugar and cream on the side that ll be great wrightman looked rather pleased with herself i thought you might like that i do but not to be rude and i am excited to see him but after everything his father did i just surprised ginny said curiosity eating at her no one has the right to question a guest i ve invited to my own home wrightman chided ginny rubbed a finger against the tablecloth and leaned back in her seat but i do not punish children for the sins of their parents ginny remembered theo conversation with harry and the way he talked about how an association with harry potter deeply irritated his father and unsettled his mother leading to lots of wine at family dinners ginny couldnthelp but wonder if his mother would be comfortable sitting next to ginny all night knowing that she was close to harry and that she had shot spells at her husband the night of the seventh year ball you were in the same year as his mum werentyou ginny asked realizing it a second before she asked wrightman nodded samantha caldwell right theo she tried to think of a delicate way of putting this never spoke very highly of her mrs nott was in my year wrightman said picking up her glass though she did not take a sip she avoided sounding judgmental she was in gryffindor though right ginny asked finally taking the time to add one spoonful of sugar and a lot of cream to her tea before taking a sip it warmed her yes though her son is a perfect slytherin she said i think he d appreciate hearing you say that ginny said smiling wrightman waved a hand casually he knows it himself but he respects you all the slytherins do all the students too really ginny said thinking of the numerous adults she d known all her life whom she didntrespect perkins was at the top of that list but mum hogwarts friend clarissa was a close second the woman was a moron they respect me because i am the head of the wrightman family and my children represent the unification of my family with the de boeldeius people respect you regardless of name ginny pointed out look at hermione and harry neither of them had ever heard of the wrightmans but they both learned to accept you though hermione did look like she was a bit harassed at the end of the year it drove her spare that you didntadore her i respect her that ought to have been enough wrightman said she a powerful capable witch who will go far if she doesntdie well of course there always that caveat ginny said for your generation wrightman said and especially the best friend of harry potter death must always be considered if not expected ginny decided not to say anything yes she knew that dying was always a possibility it was harry biggest fear but that didntmean that she would let herself worry about it needlessly all she could do was prepare for the future as best she could and hope that it was enough a house elf appeared refilled wrightman wine glass and disappeared just as quickly i ve been wondering about something professor ginny said at length at the ball when you were talking to lucius malfoy you told him that baron parents deaths were a mistake what did you mean wrightman looked at her wine for a long time their deaths were a mistake how do you know the ramsey deaths catapulted a strong slytherin family toward dumbledore side lucius malfoy was sent to smooth things over with them but young mr ramsey and his sister rejected his overtures it was a loss the dark lord would not have wanted especially as the ramseys were always so carefully neutral wrightman face took an odd look but neutrality never really protected anyone as christine once told me ginny thought she d heard her mention that name before but couldntplace it christine your friend mr mcgrath mother who hated neutrality with a passion people rarely saw in her wrightman said the half moon could be seen over her shoulder through the window she and lily both hated people who thought they could simply avoid fighting ginny tapped her finger against her teacup gently mrs merton acted like she knew them well of course remus looked like he thought she reeked of something foul but i thought it was those werewolf senses of his wrightman shook her head wryly mrs merton and i were never particularly close she thought i was a death eater and i thought she was weak all i know about her is that she ran away and doesntregret it ginny said thinking back to the woman ill received trip to hogwarts mrs merton had been the first female beater a legend and for all of her reputation she had proven to be nothing more than a menace remembering the way she told mr mcgrath to keep his sons away from ginny made the redhead want to smash something she took a breath and moved her hands away from the china teacup and i know that i only met her for less than a single day but i wanted to banish her off the astronomy tower wrightman smiled that close lipped predatory smile she regrets her decision every day since she was meeting the woman the next night ginny couldnthelp but ask does theo mum regret anything wrightman swiped her hand over her perfectly clean tablecloth as through to rid it of crumbs or wrinkles i believe mrs nott hates her situation even more than mrs merton hates hers and i believe she feels even more trapped than her old friend she chose to marry that death eater ginny said simply and she continues to choose to stay with him wrightman adjusted twisted his wine glass by its stem and gold sparkles fell from the cup only to disappear moments later it the old fashioned kind of trapped feeling wrightman said ask your mother about it someday and about how difficult it was to marry your father she told me about that ginny had heard the family stories about her grandparents disapproval of the marriage and how her mother brothers had been sent to see what arthur was really like they d liked him instantly and supported their sister choice from then on ginny turned to stare at the piano in the other room through the open doorway it was beautifully carved and decorated and the music that juliette created when her little fingers played did it justice thinking of that made ginny remember her conversation with gertrude daughter your children dontseem to feel trapped ginny said professor wrightman also looked at the piano i ve worked hard at that ginny considered her professor for a moment you know professor i still dontunderstand why you were friends with harry mum ginny said feeling very daring for bringing this up but they had talked about sirius and christine mcgrath and mrs merton and mrs nott lily evans seemed like a natural progression you were i imagine a slytherin princess and she sounds like she was a poster girl for gryffindor we were both prefects wrightman said devon a prefect but i doubt she ll be talking about any of her fellow prefects in twenty years let have an office covered in photos of them wrightman paused for a long moment setting down her glass before she began replying she was a smart driven girl of sixteen outspoken in her convictions and i had decided that she could never have acted in private as she did in public why not ginny had to ask most people arentsecretive you are wrightman pointed out well yes ginny admitted but that because i deeply scared by the traumatizing event of a dark lord possessing my eleven year old body gertrude smirked you say it like that to unsettle people dontyou i figure i ought to be able to get something positive out of the situation ginny replied smiling yes well lily evans wasntanything like i expected her to be either gertrude wrightman said smiling softly again she was better her voice grew soft and her eyes drifted back to her wine glass it was the most vulnerable ginny had ever seen her look and the saddest too she obviously missed her friend a great deal then wrightman sat up properly wrapped her fingers around the stem of her wine glass and looked at ginny as she said but it wouldntdo to linger on the memory of dead old friends sirius lily and christine are gone it would only make me sad once again and slow the work i am trying to do they went to bed shortly thereafter the knowledge that she was seeing theo that night should probably have made the next day at work feel like history of magic but work at the dom was never boring the department often had to work backward they would make a hypothesis test it have it fail and then have to figure out exactly what failed or if they were proven correct they needed to discover how that particular piece of information related to a larger question they had and when they succeeded ginny normally had the task of recording the whole thing and then telling the other relevant unspeakables about the discovery so when melissa kraus made an unexpected discovery in the time room near the end of the day it should have fallen to ginny to collect everyone instead melissa had turned to her in a fit of excitement and said let try it again wandlessly can you cast the spell surprised ginny asked excuse me like the space room the time room had been working to find ways to slow an object fall instead of playing with the magic of gravity they were working on activating a self activating time slowing charm that would recognize when a delicate object was falling they had bets within the department on which room would reach their goal more quickly and most thought that kraus and her team were currently in the lead the competition was friendly often the time room team would charm condolence letters to the planet room door saying they d traveled forward in time and knew they were winning the planet room responded by painting the time room doors with moving pictures of the party they would throw after they won ginny found the whole thing hilarious especially since her first day in the glittery time room a team member had looked up with a grin and said ah our spy arrives at last they loved to tease her about having been in enemy territory and lunch often included moments when they d call over to a planet member that they had a secret weapon as they wrapped an arm around ginny shoulders you see time unlike space is limitless a particularly enthusiastic teammate once said there are no laws that require time to move forward we are merely unable to comprehend the possibilities of oh merlin charlie you re boring the poor girl to death and she already had a turn at the death room a time room unspeakable called out across the cafeteria fred and george would have adored the time team that particular day found ginny shooting off a list of o w l level spells in the time room for one of kraus experiments the leader insisted ginny do them all wandlessly which was fine with her but after the list was done they d asked her if she d learned any of the advanced time spells like those used to create a time turner she hadn t so they spent a while teaching her some of them and had her cast them as well sorry that today so boring for you unspeakable west said as he jotted down some notes we needed all of this to be wandless to ensure that the core of a wand didntaffect the data you should have seen the fallout when we realized that a unicorn tail wand typically weakens a dieus charm allen had ollivander make us all a copy of the spells affected by the wand cores with detailed changes longest scroll of parchment ever we rolled the whole thing out and it went from the spinning room through this one all the way to the hall of prophecy so just using wandless magic really helps us out too bad allen the only one that can do it besides ginny another unspeakable said who knows maybe ginny ll have pity on us and come work here full time after she leaves school kraus said looking up at her from his work just long enough to grin she much too smart to work here west said glancing at the note taking quill she ll probably go into private research or work at her brothers wonderful shop what shop west asked weasley wizard weezes kraus said giving west a surprised look you didntknow west eyes lit up as he completely forgot about the notes so your whole family brilliant ginny smiled and shrugged we re creative at least we used a pair of extendable ears the other day on the planet room west said very useful those things dontforget the skiving snackoxes kraus said i sent my nephew an entire shipment of them wished they d been around when i had to endure care of magical creatures the professor kept losing limbs ginny laughed but soon they were all focusing on work again making adjustments and notations the day passed quickly despite the anticipation of seeing her friend and soon she found herself at wrightman hugging theo hello seeing him was all sorts of wonderful she hadntreally realized how much she missed people her age until she actually saw him standing in the morning room of the wrightman mansion that afternoon you look well theo said stepping back and appearing to check her for any signs of sickness it took a moment for ginny to realize that he hadntseen her since he d been forced to leave the ball and she hadntbeen able to write him he must have heard she was okay but as she was now realizing looking at him seeing a person is much more comforting than hearing a second hand report you too he grinned thanks your mum not here ginny asked looking around her personal house elf had told her that her friend had arrived but hadntmentioned anything about his family theo shrugged he looked tan i guess not but she might be coming later i not currently living with her what he leaned against the arm of the tan couch i told my mum about seeing my father at the ball she didntleave him we argued about that a bit then i moved in with my uncle chad ginny remembered seeing her friend racing up to the wards yelling at his father being spirited away he must have had a pretty awful time of it and she hadnteven been able to write him i sorry he shrugged it fine devon visits and my uncle and will andrew uncle you met him at the quidditch final have been good though they tease me quite a bit tease you about what ginny asked but he didnthave time to respond before professor wrightman walked in heels sinking in the deep carpet good afternoon mr nott theo inclined his head thank you for having me professor miss weasley was starting to look rather desperate for peer interaction wrightman said calmly ginny felt only mildly bad for how true that statement was not that she didntlove the people in the dom but they were rather older than she of course she really wanted to see a black haired bespectacled bloke with green eyes but seeing one of her very good friends was a really nice substitute now if only she could get in touch with her family the kernel and andy her life would really be perfect i heard mrs mcgrath had her baby wrightman said gesturing that they ought to follow her into the other room ginny who had been thinking about her friend faltered momentarily to understand that wrightman wasnttalking about andy deceased mother but rather his uncle will wife colleen theo smiled yes elizabeth christine was born a couple of weeks ago wrightman stopped walking briefly but since she was ahead of them all ginny saw was the tightening of the muscles in the older woman back the professor quickly shook off the emotion and kept walking saying please convey my congratulations they made their way to the dining room ginny catching up with theo unfortunately she couldntexactly tell him what she d been doing at work but she found the various guests who had flitted through the wrightman house were more than enough fodder for conversation he seemed especially interested in the head of the french finance department which surprised ginny but it wasntuntil dinner was cleared away and dessert was served that she received the biggest shock of the day you didnthappen to read the prophet today did you theo asked spoon out healthy portions of the sorbet piled into his crystal cup no why ginny asked poking through the surface of her cr me brule dessert at wrightman never failed to be awesome the front page article highlighted tips on how to survive wartime conflicts without being paranoid theo said taking another bite and there were two articles about the french support of auror movements and a recant of an earlier article that dragged dumbledore through the dirt that a change ginny said curiously i wonder what happened i bought it wrightman said pouring some tea into her cup she always passed up dessert theo and ginny stopped eating waited a beat and then looked at gertrude ginny asked you bought the daily prophet yes gertrude said taking a sip after around two months in this house ginny was rarely surprised by wrightman actions but this seemed so sudden why i had a long standing agreement with the paper that my name would not be mentioned without my consent and it came to my attention that a certain editor didntplan to respect our agreement when was this theo asked two days ago ginny and theo looked at each other ginny wanting someone to share her shock theo because he was surprised not to have known this information already did you fire rita skeeter ginny asked trying to think of a normal question to ask no gertrude said i reassigned her to fashion and trends for a considerable increase in pay why not just get rid of her altogether ginny asked gertrude gave ginny a look and said because then she would go write for witch weekly with the increase in pay i am able to require enough work from her that she has no opportunity to freelance besides skeeter not even the worst theo said at least she thinks she letting the minorities have a voice some of the others are just malicious remembering what she had written about hermione and hagrid ginny was rather inclined to label skeeter malicious too for that reason i ll be having the publishers of the quibbler witch weekly and some other publications in france and england to dinner tomorrow night gertrude said the quibbler ginny asked excited does that mean i going to meet luna dad wrightman face changed for a moment but whatever emotion she wanted to express was quickly hidden yes ginny couldntwait they live right near us in ottery st catchpole but i ve never actually met him mr lovegood is enthusiastic theo said surprising ginny when did you meet him after thinking for a moment theo said the first time was probably at his wife funeral ginny and luna had talked about her mother death but ginny knew practically nothing about the woman why were you there did you know her she was a knowles the old family knowles ginny asked realizing after she said it that she sounded rather pretentious but since it was a valid question she kept from laughing at her own expense theo tapped his little spoon against the glass dessert cup thinking yes luna mother cousin is the head of the family if i remembering correctly you are wrightman confirmed with a quick nod ginny blinked i would have never guessed miss lovegood cares not at all for her title nor for the influence of her name wrightman said sounding rather exasperated making ginny smile no luna wouldntcare about that ginny said certainly unless they knew anything about the invisible bears that live in gloucester that girl is frightfully weird theo said earning him a smack on the arm from ginny about a week after her relaxing dinner with theo ginny received a summons from department head allen asking her to report to allen office at the end of the day oh ginny in trouble a time unspeakable said spotting the note as he walked past but as ginny thought about the possible reasons why she would be asked to have a meeting with the department head reprimand seemed less and less likely still ginny couldnthelp but feel a little afraid as she knocked on allen door that afternoon you may enter the door said in a rather respectful tone ginny was curious about the office of the head of the unspeakables but at first she was rather disappointed by the results it looked a lot like her dad office except without the clutter clean lines neat desk a book self with hundreds of books a certificate of excellence on the wall oh an order of merlin second class on the desk ginny could barely keep herself from staring at the glittering silver statuette she d only seen one like it and that had been the one gilderoy lockheart had worn practically as a tie her entire first year department head allen used hers as a paperweight good evening miss weasley allen said nodding at the seat on the other side of the desk ginny took the hint and sat how do you feel things have been going for you here really well ginny said folding her hands on her lap only to notice a large smudge of green across one of them she tried to surreptitiously rub it away it been challenging and fun fun repeated he elderly witch her brown eyes peered out at ginny from under the wrinkles the folded up her face oh yes ginny said surprised that allen might not consider this work fun working to discover exactly why time only moves forward when every spell and calculation we do indicates that it should flow in either direction is fascinating playing with the one unbroken time turner has been an experience i ll never forget though that might also be because of the practical application of learning how to freeze a larger expanse of time and seeing how the room and the surround areas react to the change i d never thought to even wonder why time and gravity effect both magical and non magical people indiscriminately this work has taught me to think about every day actions in completely new ways and working in the thoughts room to determine the sequence of triggers required to make a thought skip certain default paths has also been fascinating allen nodded while ginny felt a bit foolish for babbling on too long did you read about the history of the department as you said you would like to ginny nodded yes and the notes about how exactly they broke down the mysteries and chose which ones would connect to the other rooms were very detailed you found them useful i suppose again ginny found herself going on for a long amount of time about the ways that learning the process of channeling love and a scale model of the solar system changed her outlook on the processes involved in keeping the department and room intact the doors leading to all the rooms are identical which i hadntknown but which led me to realize why professor wrightman spent so much time in the spinning room with the doors if they all have the same basic properties it makes sense that studying the differences between them would give indications to some of the unique properties of the item in the room ginny finished you have also studied the history of this department our policies ginny nodded and tried to keep the accusation out of her voice as she said i always thought that unspeakables were traditionally neutral so i was surprised to learn that you hired death eaters knowingly the outside world cannot be allowed to stop the work we do here allen said softly wars come and go strong men both good and bad rise to power sometimes they rule sometimes people fight them allen eyes lingered on her order of merlin but the department of mysteries like hogwarts school and ollivander wand shop must keep working we hire based on skill alone not personality power or beliefs ginny had talked about this at length with wrightman and while she did not agree that the department needed to hire death eaters to ensure their continued existence she was willing to admit that she wasntqualified to make that decision for the department amelia allen was so ginny let her eyes wander back to the order of merlin and noticed the inscription along the bottom est completus numquam labor boni if you are done examining my office i would like to discuss your situation allen said eyebrows raised ginny blushed and sat up straighter sorry allen nodded unspeakable wrightman has told you part of the reason why you were chosen to work here for these months oh ginny said nodding yes professor wrightman explained to me that part of the reason why i was here was so that you all could study me i thought this meeting might be about that it is allen hair was tied back in a loose professional bun ginny took a breath this has been such a great experience it ll be nice to give something back i appreciate your sentiment ginny waited a beat when will the first experiment be allen seemed amused and said there will be no experiments on you oh i thought i guess i thought you d need to test me somehow allen folded her ancient hands on the table we have been watching you during your stay here ginny was a bit confused but i thought you ve work in all the rooms we observed we learned what we needed to allen smiled i called you in to talk about the results now ginny was nervous the moment she heard the results however she decided never to mention them to anyone and allen promised to keep them secret as well ginny was in the sitting room near the entrance hall in wrightman house a couple of days after her meeting with director allen when a crack resounded through the room signaling the arrival of someone through apparation as far as ginny knew no one except gertrude had the ability to apparate inside the actual house so she was rather surprised when she turned around and saw a man where she expected to see her defense professor she stood up quickly pulling out her wand and prepared to fight him if it became necessary the man surprised her by raising a hand and wordlessly and wandlessly yanking her wand from her hand it is not polite mademoiselle weasley to point your wand at people pim popped into the room small older and terribly loyal pim was the head house elf if such a position existed the elf bowed deeply and said master as he took the stranger traveling cloak and hat while handing him two sealed envelopes please inform madame wrightman that i have arrived the man said from the tingling sensation in the inside of her ears ginny knew that he was speaking french and her translation spell was working he wore tailored black robes with gold buttons shiny black shoes a gold pocket watch and rectangular black rimmed glasses she also now knew who this man was mr wrightman she asked monsieur de boeldieu he corrected glancing up from unrolling the parchment of course wrightman was the professor maiden name if she was the head of that family and of course she had married a man who valued his family just as highly so that was the exact wrong thing to say way to make a first impression ginny i sorry about pointing my wand at you ever since the ball unexpected apparations make me wary he looked unaffected by her apology and explanation but he did walk forward and twirl her wand in his fingers presenting her with the handle as he said my guests do not expect to face a wand when they enter my home i know i am sorry she said taking her wand ginny had in fact received a rather long list of things not to do around guests from professor wrightman well not an actual list but more of a series of verbal cues even if she hadn t basic rules of courtesy would suggest that pointing your wand at someone who just arrived at a house that wasntyours didntseem like a very good idea mrs weasley would have really let ginny have it for that but these were dangerous times gertrude wrightman walked into the sitting room looking just as regal and put together as always she walked straight to her husband and kissed him briefly before they embraced there was a sense of relief at their reunion that shocked ginny her teacher had never looked more tired than she did in his arms it was as if she could finally show her fatigue because she trusted him to support her in return he gave off a sense of strength that gertrude seemed to absorb they reminded ginny in a much quieter way of her parents the day arthur weasley had returned from inspecting azkaban all those years ago except gertrude wasntfussing or cooking instead she just gratefully held him in her thin arms and he returned the gesture firmly it was clearly a private moment so ginny began gathering all of her notes in order to leave the room and not bother them you re home early gertrude said into his shoulder as soon as i could be he replied they spoke in french when they split both looked more resolved and gertrude asked did you really believe i needed a house elf to tell me of your arrival he looked down at her and smiled lightly no but pim likes specific instruction wrightman smiled then a big smile ginny had never seen and said it good to have you home he took her hand it good to be home dinner that night was a family affair one of the few times when no one came to visit but the food was just as lavish as always probably better the house elves doted on mon de boeldieu things at the daily prophet are still going well monsieur de boeldieu asked his wife as they ate salads professor wrightman glanced at him and smirked very he took a sip of his wine i hope you realize that i expect to see fewer articles denouncing the french trade commission and lax portkey security procedures and i expect to have less difficulty procuring marble from italy through traditionally french owned trade routes gertrude replied rising an eyebrow it was his turn to smirk have you had problems recently have you seen any articles with negative feeling in that time he tipped his head in acknowledgement but noted at least i know you ll never slander my family your mother was in the fashion section just yesterday professor wrightman replied and you know i dontcontrol everything that printed de boeldieu actually laughed of course you do dear wrightman tried to hide her satisfaction with that response still i cantcontrol what your mother wears to public functions he smiled your children grandmother has impeccable taste doesntshe children juliette and demetrius both insisted that she did they were practically glowing one on either side of their father but auntie regan wears some awful outfits juliette said making a face we donttalk badly about family juliette de boeldieu said but remember that yellow thing she wore to grandmere 70th birthday party juliette insisted professor wrightman shuddered a bit and changed the subject clearly uncomfortable remembering her sister in law awful choices dinner continued with her and her family chatting occasionally she and de boeldieu would segue into bargaining with each other about something striking informal deals and if it werentfor the fact that they were two of the most powerful people in europe ginny was fairly certain they d renegotiated a major international tariff policy over dessert ginny might have said they sparkled at one another as they bantered the ease and friendliness that both felt was beautiful and from the various looks mon de boeldieu shot ginny way she was fairly certain the couple would have a lengthy conversation about her once she d gone to bed and while she did feel awful about pointing her wand at him she couldnthelp but remember that she had been attacked in one of his homes not that she was foolish enough to bring that up or anything papa will you listen to me play now juliette asked the moment the last dish was cleared obviously just barely restraining her excitement de boeldieu raised an eyebrow have you practiced a new piece juliette nodded eagerly it was the most animated ginny had ever seen her for weeks now then i shall have to hear it de boeldieu said firmly as he stood demetrius jumped up and followed his father and sister out of the room leaving ginny and wrightman to stare at the ever lasting candles in the middle of the table the wax reabsorbed into the candle and the wick grew to replace itself as it burned he a very nice man ginny said tracing the spirals on the candlesticks with her eyes you and he seem really happy you seem surprised wrightman said ginny wrenched her eyes away from the centerpieces and looked at her professors even as the house elves appeared to bring them extra dessert or tea i sort of am i suppose i assumed that sirius was i dontknow the love of your life or something he was a good friend and a good match for me when i was a teenager she said but he was also brash and resentful and angry we might have balanced each other but when i learned of his betrayal for in my youthful arrogance i never doubted that he would be the potters secret keeper i turned him from my mind but you didntmarry your husband right after that did you ginny was so curious to hear about mon de boeldieu now that she had met him gertrude shook her head i had other things to attend to how did you meet him ginny asked gertrude looked like she was about to dismiss the question but then relented and said the department of mysteries sent me to france on the fifth anniversary of the dark lord fall to enter into negotiations concerning the border guards that had been established during the war minister fudge who had been appointed that year wanted to encourage international trade and travel she would have been young for that position twenty five at most but with a name like wrightman the ministry must have trusted that she would garner respect and your husband was the diplomat you worked with gertrude nodded he was head of the commission that had been created to hear our argument after the business was concluded he had a friend of his who was also my cousin introduce us we married a year later that was fast ginny said smiling at how clear cut and simple their courtship had been wrightman nodded what about your parents didntthey arrange another marriage for you after you were released from the one with sirius wrightman right hand curled into a ball a small gesture of tension that was almost unnoticeable my parents died during the war ginny felt terrible i sorry i didntknow wrightman inclined her head it was a long time ago and it was a natural disease nothing to do with the fighting so she had become head of the wrightman family just as the blacks were at their height of power at a time when joining voldemort had probably seemed like the surest way to protect her family yet she had resisted that temptation ginny looked across the room through the archway to where mon de boeldieu was listening to his daughter play piano while his son sat quietly beside him she tried to imagine sirius there and couldn t the teenagers ginny had seen in the pensieve seemed made for one another but now it was blatantly obvious that gertrude wrightman had married the right man one who challenged her respected her laughed when she lied about not controlling her paper thoroughly had powerful friends and worked as hard as she did they were changing the world the two of them and not through impulsive choices and rash mistakes but through carefully calculated maneuvers and trades i wish you d teach again next year ginny said surprising herself wrightman watched her through her clear aristocratic eyes i know that you have important work at the ministry but i think you might do more good showing the pureblood students that they can fight voldemort too wrightman ran a finger along the base of her glass but didntrespond work at the dom was particularly intense in the last weeks of ginny internship as she finished projects wrote up reports and continued working in the rooms of her choice she was really going to miss this place when she left she realized we could wrap a time turner around her neck and just keep sending her back twelve hours populate the entire department with ginny in every room we could accomplish a lot more a time team member said grinning nah then she d help out the other rooms and who wants that another timer asked joking true maybe we should just lock her up inside the office the first one suggested but ginny just laughed and told them that she needed to finish some reports before heading home she only had a couple more days left at the very least we should throw a party they muttered as they walked away ginny grinned she was sure it would be one hell of a party and it was on the last day of her apprenticeship every unspeakable piled into the cafeteria where they ate a floor under the research facilities and ate pieces of a giant cake decorated by the various departments it was the ugliest thing she had ever seen but it tasted good and ginny was surrounded by people she enjoyed even director allen stopped by for a little bit at the beginning to say goodbye to ginny and wish her well i expect to see an application from you by the end of the year she said quietly and ginny nearly wanted to cry it was true that the party was making her emotional in general but after this summer she knew that there was nowhere else in the world she could settle for working after experiencing an unspeakable work you will i promise the hugs goodbye lasted a long time and ginny ended up giving all of the people she worked with thank you notes it wasntmuch but she had wanted to let them know that they had meant a lot to her and so she entered the intra building floo network with a bag of shrunken gifts and a lot of very good memories she even hugged the floo operator goodbye it was all rather embarrassing when she later thought back on it she was still holding all of the papers she d wanted and was allowed to keep and trying to arrange them in the best order when she walked into the corridor into the minstry where she d have to floo back to wrightman one last time before the school term started ginny asked a familiar voice and she nearly dropped everything in her hands harry potter was standing in the corridor wearing black robes over a dark blue shirt looking very good indeed harry she asked so surprised that she thought she might be hallucinating or the time team was playing a very mean prank hi he said smiling at her hi she couldntreally think properly are you here for your apprenticeship yeah today was my last day she said he didntseem incapacitated by that shock like she that nice he said watching her closely what are you doing here she asked holding the parchment close just something with dumbledore he said cagily swiping at his visitor badge that clearly said harry potter search and destroy mission but you re really you right not someone polyjuiced she asked knowing perfectly well that she probably sounded mad he smiled ask me something only i would know dumbledore says we should do that anyway what was the last thing i said to you she asked without thinking immediately regretting it as she remembered the answer but unwilling to take it back surprisingly he grinned and stepped forward until they were as close as they had been last time they spoke you told me to throw a party he whispered leaning in and to either kiss you or let you walk away and suddenly he leaned in and they were kissing his hand was on her back pulling her forward and her hands were stuck between them holding the pile of papers his lips were soft and perfect and moved against her perfectly not really wanting to but having to understand this she pulled away what going on she asked a little out of breath i wasntplaying with you before he said touching the side of her face lightly good she said he nodded and then he kissed her again author note thank you all so much for all of your support and dedication to this story i know that holden has appreciated all of your feedback as she
