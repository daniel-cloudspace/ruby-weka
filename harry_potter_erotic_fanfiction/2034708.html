 disclaimer everything here besides the few things you dontknow belongs to jk rowling creator of the worlds of harry potter a n we el i know it takes me a long time to update and honestly i quite ashamed of myself but here it is chapter 9 i meant uploading it last saturday but as it turned out the site had had problems as you all must know and in the meanwhile i went to a five days long school trip and couldntupload it i ll try and write another chapter and update tomorrow or the day after i hope you will enjoy this and do not despair p s i have a question to you all me and a friend of mine gave each other challenges to write various drabbles on various ships normal ones weird ones het slash everything really would any of you be interested in reading them chapter 9 hatching a plan in the days before the founders had started their constitutional educating system of the younger generation teaching the children was in their parents jurisdiction there was no formal system and therefore the education was only partial and left a lot to be desired the house teaching system lacked in more than one aspect for instant every witch or wizard has their own talents in different fields of magic when only one parent the mother more often than the father was responsible of passing the knowledge of magic to the children they only received the part which the parent was well versed in therefore missing other aspects of magic in which they might excel another problem posed the parent other duties such as their own work or research house and garden maintenance and various other occupations often there was little time to teach an impatient child the art of magic a lot of children those days were prone to wand less magic which is uncontrolled and susceptible to emotional changes this situation was caused because the children parents never got around purchasing them a wand or teaching them how to properly channel their powers through a simple piece of wood the founders had changed it all with their plan of group education hogwarts a history author unknown take another step ruffian and i will make sure there will be nothing left of you for the lawmen to hang helga breath hitched in her throat it seemed as though salazar had either led them to the wrong house or that he had miscalculated their welcome the man who had salazar at wand point was big and burly he had a mass of curly blonde hair and the most light coloured eyes she had ever seen those eyes together with his tanned complexion made a fearsome combination he was wearing well made clothes and held himself proudly salazar raised his hands palms out please bran i need to you need nothing the man called bran spat go away and do not bother this house again if you would just let me i am not jesting slytherin leave this house dahlia leave dahlia out of it bran hissed his arm muscles bulging menacingly i am master of this house i will not have bran who is it a woman voice asked softly from inside the darkened house a vagabond dahlia go back to bed i will handle it no salazar called over the man shoulder dahlia it m he did not get the chance to finish his words for at that moment bran fist made contact with his jaw you insolent fool godric cried drawing out his wand and pointing it at the man petrific godric no three voices cried at the same time helga knew that one of them was her one was rowena who went as far as gripping godric wand arm the third voice came from a woman who burst from behind the man called bran she was very pretty with long sleek black hair and large brown eyes she was also tall and had the same presence both godric and salazar had that moment though she was tired and scared and very much with child salazar she asked softly kneeling next to their fallen companion are you all right the man in question groaned and attempted to sit up my head he muttered leaning back again touching a hand to his jaw why did you do that bran the woman demanded angrily my own brother bran shifted his weight from side to side looking mightily uncomfortable the woman was not done however i cantbelieve you bran you would rather believe that monster ambrosius without even questioning it than believing salazar and you she swirled her head to glare at godric you were always quick to pick a fight what good would it have done to attack my husband godric and dontthink you are getting out of this cleanly salazar not a letter in six months not a word what was i supposed to think no wonder bran believed the rumours and the council communications men helga suddenly heard a muffled sound she turned to look at rowena who had let go of godric arm and was trying to suppress a fit of laughter salazar sister also seemed to hear the noise only then did she realize that she had had a crowd up till then with reddening cheeks she clumsily clambered to her feet and lightly curtseyed the two women returned the curtsey come now she said briskly we might as well get inside it is a cold night but but dahlia bran tried his eyes darting from godric to salazar to rowena to helga they are he lowered his voice in fear of eavesdropping neighbours outcasts and he is my brother she said sharply helga entered after dahlia into the house behind her rowena and godric helped salazar up she could still hear bran grumbling as he closed and locked the door dahlia led them into a rather large kitchen she stirred the fire up with her wand and lit a few candles in the flickering light she made them all a pot of tea and gave out chunks of bread and cheese all this she had done in silence pointedly ignoring both her brother and her husband only when she was finished did she sit on the padded bench between godric and rowena well she demanded scathingly i want an explanation salazar and i want it now why is ambrosius after you what have you done or rather what have you done this time haltingly and with constant corrections and additions from the other three salazar gave his sister the short version of the past few months and so we ve been riding rather aimlessly trying to keep out of the way he finished looking at dahlia expectantly we donthave anywhere else to go dahlia i realize we re risking your lives but we needed shelter just for a little while just until we decide what to do with the rest of our lives and what if the council gets whiff of your presence here eh bran expression was livid you have easily decided your lives are more important than ours if they hear we are giving you shelter hush bran dahlia said quietly staring at her brother intently i will not be hushed dahlia he snapped if you are willing to risk your own life that is your choice but what about shane what about rhiannon and warwick what about them dahlia snapped what kind of a future have they if ambrosius captures salazar they are his kin that makes them a target even if they have nothing to do with him whatever we do our children will pay i am not giving up my only brother to the council bran then what about me if they are caught here i will die i know bran she shouted her eyes blazing i know they will kill you if they are found here did you think i had forgotten it so do i have to choose between the two men i love which will die and which will live what are you asking me to do the truth is that no matter how much i love you blood is important i cantbetray my own blood the rest is for you to decide helga felt horrible this was not something one would want to witness she remembered only too well the last time her mother and father had fought over something like that it was on the day they had discovered her secret no sigmund you cannot let them do that i can do whatever i want to do gunhild the girl is a monster she is not a monster she is just our little girl how can you cast her aside like this she is no daughter of mine she is the devil spawn she worships him on moonless nights she dances naked under the skies and sacrifices children to her evil master oh so you are now saying i fraternized with the evil one i gave birth to that child sigmund i should know her then you should have noticed that the evil one minions had exchanged our pure daughter with the offspring of the devil helga is ours i cannot believe you would let your own flesh burn she shall burn and she shall be cleansed of all sin you are the monster how can you there was the resounding smack of hand against cheek sigmund hufflepuff had never raised his hand on any of his womenfolk especially not on his wife never until the moment when all anger and grief formulated into that outburst of violence mother no voice had answered she had not seen any of her parents since then helga shuddered she hated remembering those hours waiting for the men to take her to her death she thought she was going to die that day and that fear had never really let go of her she wanted to be free more than anything in the world they had to make a plan something had to be done master bran she said catching them all by surprise i will make a deal with you you will let us stay in your house for a little while a month at the most and in return we will protect your family in case ambrosius and his men find out you have given us shelter what can you do that i can t he demanded bitterly we are all powerful master bran she continued in the same calm tone ignoring the sting he implied i believe you will find that we are much more powerful than all the members of the council including ambrosius they are afraid of what we may do were we ever to face them again i promise you will not regret helping us there was a long moment of silence in which she could see bran was mulling over the idea he then reluctantly nodded two weeks he finally said you will stay here no longer than two weeks after that i am turning you in myself fair enough she said coolly i am going back to bed dahlia do what you like he said tersely sweeping out of the room what an oaf godric said after a moment dahlia hit him but helga was surprised to see that she was smiling he may be an oaf godric but he is my oaf and i am the only one allowed to bully him and that means that you can t in case your brain is incapable of doing such simple math she then glanced around the room will you be all right sleeping on the floor tonight i am too tired to make accommodations for you and the kitchen is the innermost room so no one from the village would be able to spot you perfectly fine dahlia salazar said go to sleep little one not so little anymore i am afraid she said with a tired smile looking at her extended abdomen she then turned to leave oh and dahlia yes thank you she nodded and left without another word rowena padded quietly to the door and listened till she heard a door closing she then stared at helga with an amused expression on her face powerful helga she asked her voice brimming with mirth afraid of us where did that come from helga shrugged grinning despite herself he needed convincing and he looked like the sort of person to defer to power an excellent reading of the man my dear madam hufflepuff godric said couldnthave said it better myself never really liked the arse myself but dahlia loves him so that good enough for me i would have liked it better if you would have married the girl godric salazar said wistfully now i am stuck with this person as a brother in law for the rest of my life what made you throw such a great opportunity out of the window rowena suddenly seemed to stir helga saw some kind of emotion flicker in her friend hazel eyes it almost looked like you were supposed to marry salazar sister she asked in what could best be described as a condescending tone why would she marry a fool like you why yes godric said off handedly ignoring her snide comment a long time ago that was mother expressed a wish to godric mother that the two will marry when they grow older salazar supplied helga tried to tell them both with her eyes to drop the subject as she could see rowena eyes clouding she had no idea what made her friend so cold so nasty to godric again they seemed to be getting on so much better of late none of the men noticed her yes dahlia only a month older than me godric said so seraphine said that we would be perfect for each other then why on earth did you let her go you dunderhead salazar moaned obviously still disturbed by the fact that godric was not his brother in law how could i marry someone whom i grew up with godric demanded dahlia is like my own sister the shadow in rowena eyes disappeared almost as suddenly as it appeared we had better make ready to sleep she said in a rush helga managed buying us two weeks if we get up early in the morning we could make an early start on our plans poke poke poke drip poke i don wan t get up yet wena lemme sleepff helga muttered drip something was dripping on her it was sticky and someone was repeatedly poking her face with a sticky finger blearily and with much effort she opened an eye there was a huge amber eye staring unblinkingly right into her own eye with a shrill cry of panic she sat bolt upright her cloak falling from her shoulders in the process the owner of the amber eye continued staring at her err hello helga attempted the owner of the amber eye blinked a woman laughter made her look up dahlia smiled at her good morning helga is it i do apologize on my daughter behalf she seems to be fascinated with the new playmates that had arrived last night say hello rhiannon say hello to helga helloelga the small girl with the amber eyes and dark brown hair mumbled hello rhiannon she said kindly noticing in dismay that the sticky thing she felt was the girl molasses dripping fingers i have molasses on my face donti dahlia nodded stifling a grin helga looked around her ignoring rhiannon insistent stare where are the others oh godric and salazar left before daylight with bran to make sure the horses are well hidden and safe rowena i think she in the pantry hiding hiding from what hiding from whom rather this time the older woman did not bother hiding her grin the boys had chased her into there about an hour ago boys shane and warwick shane the eldest and warwick is rhiannon twin they saw her performing some sort of spell this morning and have been badgering her to teach them since then they are not allowed into the pantry so she deemed it a safe harbour sounds like rowena helga said rolling her eyes she likes quiet studying above anything else give her a book and she would be happy anywhere so where are the boys now playing in their bedroom they are not allowed out of the house now it too dangerous dangerous to you my dear they are only children children are not known for keeping secrets helga heart nearly stopped they had never considered that oh dontworry dahlia dismissed her worries as she read them on her face wizarding children are intelligent we will keep them inside for two weeks and after you leave have a small chat with them they will not grumble too much because of their confinement the weather is foul anyway dahlia was not mistaken the children did not mind staying inside the weather outside was indeed foul and the company inside was much more amusing in their eyes the boys were robust and loud they liked to play and run they loved seeing godric and salazar doing magic tricks for them and badgered rowena nonstop to teach them how to do more complex magic than their parents had ever shown them rhiannon was at first more shy and mostly kept to her mother skirt but soon enough she opened up to them she made helga her new pet always demanding attention and joined the boys in badgering rowena dahlia was delighted to have them there she enjoyed speaking with helga and rowena she had confided in them saying that the only women in the loch were horrible gossips especially that horrible bar wench called calanthe whom godric and salazar were very fond of and used to spend a lot of time in her company bantering with godric and criticizing her brother mostly for his lack of romantic interests bran was a different story altogether he hated their presence and wanted them out of his house as soon as possible but could not do so without angering both his wife and his children helga had decided that even though he was full of audacity and nerve he was very much afraid of his wife the first week in dahlia house they had spent brainstorming we simply have to find something we all agree on godric burst one evening the four were left to keep an eye on the children while dahlia and bran left for a meeting in the loch local tavern it is not that difficult we are agreeing dimwit rowena snapped gripping the table till her knuckles went white helga thought she was fighting an urge to hex godric we are all agreed that the council is a diminishing organization they are losing their ground they cannot be expected to do anything in favour of the community we are the only ones remaining who actually want to do something about it and that leads us nowhere he grounded back his eyes ablaze peace salazar shushed them both he pulled a piece of parchment from the pile on the table in dahlia kitchen the first thing we need to work out my friends is where to stay once our two weeks allowance ends we cannot underestimate bran he may truly hand us to the region lawmen everything else is rather insignificant at the moment dahlia said that there is no place in the area where we can hide salazar said and she has been living here for a longer time than either myself or godric furthermore when she was young she had time to make excursions around here she knows of no place how about the caves godric asked frowning the caves salazar frowned as well sir rhys once told me that there are caves nearby he just called them the caves and never said another word about them but for some reason the name stuck we can have a look around when the time expires helga suggested it seems like the best course of action right now if dahlia knows of no place the chances that we will find one by ourselves are very slim the least we can do it try rowena said with a shrug who is sir rhys my master godric said he taught me when i was young he was one of the knights of the phoenix one of your father men is he still alive there was a strange glow in rowena eyes why yes he lives around here can he be trusted helga interjected herself into their conversation can he be trusted godric asked incredulously he was one of the greatest knights he continues to teach young wizards the arts of the knights how can he not be trustworthy calm down godric she said in alarm i only meant to ask this so that i could determine whether we should go and ask for his help salazar was sure that we will be completely welcome here and he was mistaken can this sir rhys be trusted to let us in or not threaten to hand us in godric sighed i haventseen the old man in over a decade but i think he will help us we need trustworthy men rowena said we should start making enquiries around once we have a safe shelter people we can trust to help us were we to oppose the council openly what do you mean salazar was confused i mean if we decide to let say overthrow the council get rid of ambrosius do something our world is falling apart and they are to blame if we have a strong group of supporters to back us in case we want to tell the truth to the wizarding world we can make sure ambrosius will never cause harm to a living soul ever again that it helga said excitedly supporters look at us will you we have searlas slytherin son gawain gryffindor son raven lord daughter i may be relatively ignorant concerning the wizarding world but i do know that all three were powerful men they must have had supporters who still believe in them who are still loyal to them even after all ambrosius had done we should start foraging for these people they can help us with their help we will no longer have to live in fear but how will we contact them salazar demanded it is not like we can just walk into a wizarding holding and ask to use an owl that true helga excitement diminished but you can ask your sister and sir rhys dahlia voice suddenly said from behind them all four turned their heads in shock and please lower your voices the children might wake up we didntrealize you would be back so soon salazar said sheepishly what was the meeting about oh this and that she said evasively removing her damp cloak and hanging it on the back of a chair in front of the fireplace how are the children they are all right didntwake up once what is it dahlia what was discussed in the meeting you bran said from the doorway his face was unnaturally grey and he looked frightened alistair mcalister said that the lawmen managed tracking your trail to here they will be in the loch within two days anyone who had seen you must speak to alistair immediately or the results will be dire he cornered us when we were about to leave dahlia spat said he knows we re sheltering you and that if we dontwant him to tattle to the lawmen we are to hand you to him tonight i told him to stuff it alistair godric asked is he reid mcalister son you remember him vaguely big burly fellow squints in one eye that him never liked him very well then we have to leave tonight he will not be able to prove you gave us shelter where will you go dahlia demanded in the same time the other three asked where will we go to rhys just for a short while he will probably remember what he told me about the caves and then we will be able to hide somewhere where we dontrisk the lives of those who help us then i will make you dinner and some food that will keep you for a while dahlia said promptly bran take a look at the children all right see if they are still asleep right her husband said apparently glad to be away from their presence i sure the children are all right though dahlia waved him off i nearly had to hex him tonight she said in an undertone he was this close to admitting you are living here i needed to remind him that he may be risking the children all night long she made a face then we will go to rhys rowena said but that doesntsolve our problem having supporters and allies is very good but we are not going on an armed crusade what will we do once we are in a safe place i cannot help you there rowena dahlia said with a sigh were the children well behaved before we they went to bed there was a lot of mention of children this evening helga thought to herself not really listening to godric amused recounting of the botched dinner they had tried feeding rhiannon and warwick the word kept on ringing in her head she could not get rid of it dahlia and bran risked the lives of their children the children nagged rowena to teach them tricks the children are asleep do not wake the children so much worry for those little things that one day will grow up and continue the legacy of their parents so much trouble to go through just to raise one child let alone three or four or five how are the children the children the children helga choked what dahlia spun to face her what is wrong with the children did you hear anything no helga blurted out that the answer raven the answer to what you asked what will we do once we are in a safe place that it we will teach the children if we educate the children to stand for themselves and not let the council use them or neglect them then we can fight them without actually harming anyone rowena completed helga you

know how it is stares at feet in embarrassment if you detect any typos of some sort please forgive me i really wanted to update this before i leave for a couple of days tomorrow morning and i getting tired of sitting in front of the computer well on with the story then chapter 13 first trial after they had completely severed themselves from the council the founders knew it would not be long before some confrontation would take place it took ambrosius over a year to locate them but when he did he immediately sent his men to take care of the troublesome companions the man sent to command the operation was one marcus gregory former knight of the phoenix he had great resentment to both ryan ravenclaw and gawain gryffindor and he had no problem whatsoever on passing his hatred to their descendents he had sworn to bring an end to both lines by the means of the council command in almost no time gregory had managed tracking down the founders and discovered their base of operations was at the loch hogwarts a history author unknown rowena was irritated no worse than that she was livid she would be the first to admit that she liked a little bit of good ale at times but she would also smugly add that she knew when it was time to stop her three friends however seemed to have a remarkable lack of that ability the three were sprawled on various surfaces of the house main room be they chairs tables or floors luckily enough as they had dismissed their students for the summer the previous evening there was no need to go out and teach but she distinctly remembered that they had agreed upon continuing their rebuilding work that morning since the weather was so fine her mood was too foul to be considerate of the snoring trio in the house so rowena decided it was best if she would simply go outside by herself and get some work done as she stepped out of the house and started the walk up to the framework of the castle which perched above the lake like a foreboding bird of prey she felt her bad humour dissipate their castle was getting on beautifully and everything was well for as godric had said the previous night ambrosius failed to destroy them in the year or so that had passed since they escaped his clutches rowena was no fool she knew that ambrosius was aware of their whereabouts perhaps he could not as yet pinpoint their exact location but he knew that they had taken residence in the vicinity of the loch to make things worse the fact that quite a few former knights of the phoenix drifted to the area had made it clear to anyone aware of the situation that the escaped quartet planned something that will not sit well with ambrosius and his cohorts she dreaded what they were planning on doing now that all former knights lived in the loch there was no reason for them to put off the confrontation with the entirety of the village with a heavy sigh she climbed up to the castle and entered the shadowy doorway the large hall to the right of the entrance chamber now had a ceiling but it looked so empty and forlorn the floor was still covered by dust and rubble and the overcast sky let no light in grumbling to herself she began levitating the debris on the flagstones out from the hall when the others arrived there sometime after midday she was done with about a quarter of the hall and was feeling rather winded there you are she snapped letting her wand arm fall get to work already i not about to clear this whole chamber by myself will you please keep it down godric winced no she exploded i will not keep it down it your own fault that you re feeling this way now get to work before i hex you but rowena salazar pleaded we just woke up be gentle with us please gentle gentle i ve been slaving here since morning i want you all to help me and i want you to help me now grumbling and groaning the three joined her in labour about an hour or so later the four stopped for a bit of rest it so empty rowena voiced her thoughts from earlier on and it looks like a block of stone it is a block of stone rowena helga said her face still a little pale yes but we didntreally try to make it seem prettier we should have decorated the walls or something along those lines a bit of stone carving on the supporting arches would do wonders to the ceiling it too late salazar said flatly i calculated the weight of the arches precisely to chisel them now would impair the balance well you re the creative mastermind arentyou helga said cheerfully go to your drawing board salazar go play with your coloured inks i dont play he replied sourly of course you don t she replied generously winking in rowena direction women he spat though rowena noted that he did exactly what helga had told him to do while salazar was immersed in his drawing rowena pulled her friend aside away from where godric was removing the last bits of stone and rubble from the hall what going on between you and salazar she demanded pointedly going on helga replied innocently there nothing going on we re friends rowena snorted donttell me that helga at least one of you wants this to be more than friendship you had better decided what you want because i dontwant this interrupting our business here is the pot calling the kettle black helga asked mockingly what do you mean rowena asked suddenly alarmed oh you know perfectly well what i mean raven i d do something about this soon if i were you but never mind that the other girl diverted the conversation we had better start cleaning the floor before the men start asking why exactly we are doing nothing oh and godric told me this morning noon you mean yes noon helga grimaced he told me that dahlia wanted to have a word with me so i ll be going to the village after nightfall have fun and dontlet rhiannon coax you into spending the night again it hard enough for us to sneak in during the night all right raven they started cleaning the floor rowena sprouting water from her wand and helga drying it after shoveling the dirty water away rowena helga salazar said coming towards them i ve had an idea take a look at this and tell me what you think the two took the drawing board handed to them and observed the parchment in front of them this will never work salazar rowena said shaking her head after examining all the scribbling he had drawn paint all weathers on one ceiling and then make sure they correspond with the weather outside i cantsee a way in which we can make it possible salazar sighed the excited light in his eyes dimming then what you re saying is that these plans are as good as dirt basically yes back to the drawing board then i afraid so salazar crumpled the parchment on which he had sketched his plans for the ceiling of the large hall he then pulled a fresh sheet out of his cloak pocket and continued scribbling furiously after a few minutes of that his quill paused in mid air rowena mmm she mumbled tearing her attention away from sprinkling water into the dirtiest corners of the hall is there such a thing as a transparency charm she frowned transparency well not precisely no there something that called a disillusionment charm it a rather new one i think supposedly it will give anyone it is cast upon chameleon like qualities practically let one blend in with one surroundings it is some sort of invisibility or transparency if you d like i suppose we could try and modify it to apply to still life instead of living creatures let do it this way she decided you will go on planning your ceiling and in the meanwhile i ll go do a bit of research good he said i was starting to thing that i finally had had an unachievable idea and it was making me more than a little depressed rowena always loved a challenge it was a way to vent out all frustrations just close herself to the outside world and concentrate on the problem at hand the minute she entered the house that afternoon she pulled out a couple of books found a scrap of parchment a battered quill with its feather chewed through by diligent writers and an almost dried inkwell and settled down at the kitchen table two hours later she was still there only with many crumpled or ink smeared parchments surrounding her and far more books that she had to begin with godric prowled the kitchen around her searching for something with a gradually darkening expression on his face i hungry he finally whined why isntthere dinner you re a grown boy godric she said absently copying a certain paragraph that seemed about right to her feed yourself but but rowena you are the one always tells me to get away from the kitchen on account of you being completely inept yes she completed i busy godric go bother helga helga been invited to dahlia remember dahlia wanted to have a word with her that right she conceded putting down her quill then she brightened go bother salazar then at least he can boil water without burning three pots in the process salazar is snoring over his drawing board he informed her sullenly with an irritated huff she threw her quill down godric she said scathingly as i have told you repeatedly i am busy eat an apple drink a cup of milk i daresay you can still find some in the pot and go to sleep it should sustain you till morning you always treat me like a little boy he flared i older than you then by merlin act it she growled go away leave me in quiet angrily he stomped off muttering darkly to himself rowena stared after him somewhat in shock then she sighed and buried her face in her hands what am i going to do with him she thought mournfully godric puzzled her greatly she could never quite figure him out he was intelligent and resourceful and he could be unbelievingly charming if he really wanted to but he could also be so so childish sometimes she wanted nothing more than to grit her teeth and wring his neck but many times she wanted to hug him and maybe bring his lips down to hers feeling annoyed she closed her books picked up her things and left for bed when helga came back late that night rowena pretended to be asleep she could not bear seeing that smug expression that she just knew would appear on her friend face the week after the students were released for the summer the first real council took place they prearranged it a long time beforehand and now that they had the great hall roofed they had room for all those who had chosen to come the four of them spent an entire afternoon conjuring chairs and a long table around which the discussions would take place the rest of the time until the others came was spent in precise measurements of the ceiling of the hall rowena was certain that she managed adapting the disillusionment charm properly and they were ready to try and cast it she was quite sure that they had startled ceridwen and rhys when the two first entered the hall through the empty doorway for the first thing either of them had said was great merlin what in hell fire are you doing salazar and godric were standing firmly on the ground and levitated helga and rowena up to the ceiling the two women were busily measuring the length and breadth of the hall as well as its height measuring mother godric said laconically as he gently lowered helga down are you all here they are all right behind us ceridwen answered there were about two and a half dozen people in the council that first night phoenix knights and their wives dahlia and bran ceridwen rhys and his three eldest sons and a few couples from the village who had according to a rather sarcastic godric seen the light once they were all seated he got up and addressed the assembly welcome to our new council chamber godric said knowingly comparing the new hall to that of ambrosius council they had not discussed the matter beforehand but rowena and by their amused expressions quite a few of the knights present found it rather fitting it not completed as yet and this furniture will definitely change in a few years time but get used to seeing this place because you will spend here a lot of time a little less than a year ago my friends and i arrived here without any clear idea in mind we were exiled by ambrosius with a death warrant over our heads and all we really thought about at the time was how we could survive this has changed we took upon us two missions in the past year the first one and the most important in the long run at that is the education of the next generation we had already started working on that the second one however is much more important at the moment for if we cannot rid ourselves of ambrosius threat we cannot continue the venture of this school you all know why you are here many of us had been waiting for this day for a very long time we cantrush it however we need to plan and make ready for without it we are no better than he we invited you here in order to make our first plans rowena rowena nodded and stood up godric salazar helga and i came to one conclusion a long time ago some of you know of it but in benefit of those who don t i shall repeat it we can not do this by ourselves true we have many more people than we had when we first arrived here but this is not enough in order to make things possible for us we need the help of the entire village the people of the loch must support us or at least not be a hindrance to us therefore we have decided to address the people of the village as soon as possible we asked sir rhys to call for a village meeting it should take place during the next week or so and we would like all of you to participate and show your support are you out of your mind woman bran demanded from his place at the end of the table i beg your pardon she asked mildly from the corner of her eye she could see salazar putting a restraining hand on godric arm you will get us all killed not to talk about getting your heads right where ambrosius wants you in the noose and why should that happen bran salazar asked because the people of the village will hand you in ambrosius arm is long do you truly believe that bran ceridwen asked with an arched eyebrow he will crush the whole village down ambrosius is weakening bran sir brendan said calmingly his grip on the wizarding world is now ever so fragile there are pockets of resistance starting to crop up everywhere none of them has been successful so far that much is true but if we contact them and unite under one banner and what banner is it exactly the banner of hogwarts of course helga said quietly from her place she rose to her feet to stand next to rowena we have in our power to unite all the groups who oppose ambrosius and the council bran our connections are wide from muggle borns to born wizards from the poorest wizarding family to the richest we can get them all to participate it may take time but with your help we can make it happen talking to the people of the loch is just the first stage in our overall plan ambrosius will go down she then sat down and rowena continued satisfied she asked bran staring hard at him he swallowed hard but said nothing as we were saying then we want you all to come and be the grain of truth that will tip the scales in our direction that all we had done up till now it is time to start discussing our future plans beyond the support of the loch we can start by hunting down the members of the chamber guard the council had sent to kill you for sir gwilym suggested not a bad idea all in all sir deiniol conceded but i think our first action should be to contact every former member of the order not including those such as sir randolf i know that madam gryffindor managed to contact some of them but there are many others whom she cantget in touch with and only we can and what will we do once we contact them countered eanraig the smith we will have a military force in case ambrosius comes with a direct force against us deiniol answered once we reinstate the old contact system we can have the entire order here within two days at the most the system hasntbeen in use for more than twenty years deiniol sir reynard said shaking his head some of the knights are dead and others are no longer of us the probability of it actually working properly is minuscule but possible all the same deiniol said mildly i say we give it a chance rowena jotted the suggestion down and looked expectantly at the rest of the crowd once we contact the knights ceridwen said we might as well contact the groups brendan mentioned before i think it would do no harm to spread around the word that the ones leading the rebellion who said it a rebellion eanraig wife demanded fear etched into her expression my dear eilish ceridwen said softly when you go against the authorities in such a way as we are planning it is considered a rebellion now as i was saying i think we should let people know that the ones leading the rebellion are lords gryffindor and slytherin and the heiress of raven lord those names have a grand legacy surrounding them and should add more glamour to our cause silence fell after that suggestion while the participants mulled it over it was soon broken however by a villager by the name of wallace one of the first to submit his children to their care i think that we are overlooking one important detail he said seriously rowena immediately turned her attention his way oh well we really should consider how to protect both our children and our leaders we cantlet them go unprotected we already took those precautions godric said confidently we placed hexes and curses around the perimeter so that none could come near in order to harm us or the children no godric rowena said thoughtfully there something in what he says we should probably erect an apparition block an appa what apparition she said irritably she just told them about that the previous week it derives its meaning from the synonym to the word ghost phantom specter it means a spirit something invisible a but what is it the ability to disappear from one place only to appear in another miles away merlin godric you have watched my mother helga and i practice it for a whole winter sourly he demanded so why do we need this apparition thing you re the only one who knows how to do it she rolled her eyes we are going to need it because i going to teach our students how to do it and once we start teaching it ambrosius is bound to discover it sooner or later and then we will need the block or shield rather the rest of the evening was spent discussing how they will contact all those they hoped to be their allies all that time rowena felt her friends accusing eyes on her and wondered what she had done to deserve that she discovered soon as the meeting broke off and their guests left when exactly did you plan on letting us know that you re are going to teach the children apparition salazar asked coolly rowena stared at him in surprise it is our school as well as yours godric added accusingly you should share those things with us rowena helga said also she shook her head in annoyance but i did tell you she huffed last week ah now i remember you were to bleeding drunk to remember a word i said with that she left rowena erected the apparition shield herself it was rather small encompassing only the castle and the house into it the others wove anew all their curses and hexes it much stronger than the previous protections she told them with a somewhat self satisfied expression when she was done was it hard salazar asked in interest not too hard no she said flippantly in truth however the placing of the shield was one of the hardest things she had ever done in the same time she had had to concentrate on the thing it was supposed to shield the area from on pushing the bubble of protection further on and on not ripping the texture of the shield and by that enabling hostile forces namely ambrosius to break it she was sweating profusely by the time it was done but being rowena she would be damned before admitting that she wobbled just a little though when they prepared to go back to the house are you sure you re all right wena helga asked worriedly why of cou she never finished her answer a booming voice coming from the direction of the pillars carrying the winged warthogs roared come and face me cowards come and face marcus gregory the four exchanged glances they were not used to be addressed this way carefully they made their way to the pillars the man standing between the pillars was tall he was wearing full armour red as blood he had a flowing mane of blond hair and his grey eyes were cold who are you godric demanded in the most insolent tone he could muster i am called marcus gregory and i have come to take your lives that nice dear godric taunted and rowena slapped his arm warningly donttempt him she hissed oh dontworry rowena he cantgo beyond the pillars remember you imbecile we withdrew the protections until i can build a larger shield remember what do you want salazar took over i told you i am here for your lives come and face me and i shall kill you ah i dontthink so we re not so tired of living you see i shall get you slytherin i shall get all of you and ambrosius will have what he wanted and i shall have what i want and what is that none of your business when i say salazar whispered send your most powerful curses in his direction let get him in one piece i d like to question him dontdo that slytherin gregory said in disgust i have come here well protected this is but a friendly warning i shall be back with the chamber guard behind me then he flickered out of sight damned be he rowena swore he disillusioned himself we will not be able to get him salazar let go into safety shall we and the four companions retreated into the safety of their home rowena knew that this will not be the last they had seen of marcus gregory whoever he may be a n well tell me what you think please too dry too business like not enough action not enough background or descriptions i want to know it all aaaaaaaaaaaaaand now to all those lovely people who reviewed chenelle thank you d and now rowena starting to admit things too i rather liked the drunkenness part too now to important matters when are you updating cecilia orechio about your question concerning salazar and helga if you really want the answer then email me because i dontwant to ruin things for those who dontwant to know k now i hope i haventhurried the rowena godric too much in this chapter that last line was because helga was so drunk that it made rowena despair well technically the house now has two bedrooms one for the guys one for the girls the main room and a sort of an extra room for the kitchen there also the outhouse or the privy outside and they will add one room in order to house the students whose parents arentliving at the loch before the next school year starts well that an idea maybe it is where hagrid house was it a rather nice diea in my opinion waiting for your update eratosthenese

here well that all for today my friends please enjoy my story and keep in mind that even though at times it takes me ages to update i do not forget you or the story star of the north disclaimer everything here besides the few things you dontknow belongs to jk rowling creator of the worlds of harry potter a n the much delayed chapter is here for some of the month or so that had passed since i last updated i have no excuse i was just absorbed into something else that it never occurred to me that this chapter is long overdue for the past couple of weeks or so i do have a justified reason my net decided to stop working sorry well this is chapter 14 i do hope it not giving the story a ridiculous turn tell me what you think okay love you all for sticking on chapter 14 shockwave one of the most ancient now rendered null and void traditions of the wizarding world was the wizard abduction code to modern readers this may sound a bit like a contradiction in terms abduction is obviously a course of action unaccepted by society yet a code makes it somewhat legitimate to the wizards of ancient times however this seemed perfectly sensible political abductions were commonplace at the time as were assassinations and sudden disappearances the council under lord islay the third chief warlock had composed the wizard abduction code in which were fundamental rules concerning the behaviour of both abductor and abducted surprisingly enough the code was mostly followed what has this to do with hogwarts a mostly unknown fact is that marcus gregory was not exactly a law abiding man and to complete his mission he resorted to the foulest of means the abduction and possible murder of one of the founders of hogwarts hogwarts a history author unknown the village tavern had been converted to a meeting hall in a surprisingly short time to salazar who was standing with his friends at a dark corner shrouded by a thick cloak it looked as though they had it prepared in a matter of seconds the tables were swept aside with a wave of a wand as were the chairs the bottles and barrels were stored in the back room and low benches were levitated inside and put in orderly rows he could feel his heart beating strongly as the people of the village started coming in and taking seats one wrong word would send for the lawmen and from there to ambrosius reach the road was short there is nothing to fear salazar maureen hissed in his ear from her seat around his neck he missed her there for a long time since she went exploring upon the day they had settled in the ruins how can you tell he hissed quietly hoping not to get caught by a vigilant villager for all you know we could be clapped in irons and sent to ambrosius gift wrapped i wouldntput it beyond alistair mcalister and his bunch all they care about is their money many humans do so salazar for some it what they do best now calm down your heartbeats make my head ache sorry maureen dontsay sorry stop it salazar stifled a chuckle that snake was so domineering everything had to be done her way or no way at all when the tavern was full sir rhys got up and placed himself in front of the men and women of the loch in clear view of the four standing in shadow salazar felt more than saw godric give the old man an almost imperceptible nod ladies and gentlemen he began my friends i am sure you are all wondering why i have summoned you here on such a fine summer evening when we would all rather sit outside and enjoy ourselves well tonight i have a very serious subject to broach the issue of lord ambrosius and the stance we should take in the matter of his pursuit of lords slytherin and gryffindor and their two gentle companions next to him salazar heard godric murmur gentle my ar oof rowena salazar sniggered but kept his eyes on rhys in the beginning of this year we had a long loud argument concerning the matter some said that we should hide them some said we should give them to ambrosius as good citizens should since that time many things had happened for one thing the four settled in the ruins of cormag fort and renamed them hogwarts what is the meaning of this rhys alistair mcalister demanded jumping to his feet his eyes darkening if you would sit down mcalister eanraig the smith boomed from his seat at the back perhaps sir rhys would be able to explain but sit down mcalister the man sat down like a dog kicked by its master for disobedience sir rhys eyes twinkled mischievously as he resumed his speech as i was saying the four settled in the ruins and named them their home sealing the deal by renaming them you all found it very easy to ignore the matter at hand you kept talking about what should be done but never once did you lift a finger in any direction not so all of your neighbours in the past few months you may have seen some of the village children leaving each day sometimes before daybreak the area of the loch this was in order to receive education in the field of magic by the four at the ruins mingled sounds of outrage and surprise rang in salazar ears mark the angry looking ones he whispered to his friends they are the ones we ll want to avoid later on yes yes sir rhys continued i understand the alarm that some of you might be feeling this very moment but i assure you your fears though founded will not come to pass not if you listen to what the four have to say ah ha mcalister crowed you have been assisting the enemies of the government all this time rhys you will receive what coming for you when ambrosius arrives here to finish them off you will be the first one to go few villagers voiced their agreement but those voices were drowned by others who wanted to hear sir rhys out salazar heartened things were looking up for them sir rhys simply looked at mcalister a slight smile on his lips you were always the hothead alistair this will not help you in this case then he turned to the entire hall now we have come to the point of my words so far i ask you all to vote will you or will you not consent to at least hear our four neighbours out and allow them safe passage back to their home at the end of this evening no matter what you final decision is all in favour raise you hands there was an awkward moment when no one moved men glanced at their wives women glanced at their friends none dared say anything salazar froze on this moment everything hung if the answer to sir rhys question was no then there was no way for them to come out of the tavern without fighting none of the new villagers namely the knights who had taken residence there in the past months could raise their hands first because that would turn the village against them neither could ceridwen dahlia or sir rhys family for reason of their kinship to the four companions finally someone held up her hand defiantly moira the mother of one of their students raised her hand challenging everyone with her eyes you know rhys tells the truth she called out ambrosius council is done for it doesntfunction and we are the ones who suffer for this malfunction we pay tolls regularly and do our civic duties making sure the loch is a safe place for wizards and witches to live in and what do we receive in return nothing that what more tolls more demands more injustice those four whose life we re discussing have done nothing wrong but angering ambrosius for failing to do as he ordered tell me is that fair is this the justice of the council moira right eanraig called out rising to his feet his hand in the air if what we are seeing these days is the future our children are going to have why then we should all simply pack our things and leave this is not what i have planned for my boys a future where they can be turned servants at the slightest pretext a future where they cannot be certain if some simple transgression will award them death or worse i refuse to let them grow up like this they are free men let the outcasts speak an old man called out raising his hand the least we can do it hear them out a few others concurred slowly most of those seated in the tavern raised their hands very well rhys mcalister said grudgingly glaring at his fellow villagers send summons for the outcasts that we will meet them here tomorrow who will go there was a dangerous glint in his eyes that salazar did not like we probably should avoid the loch in the next couple of days he whispered he up to something well mcalister jeered why dontyou send for them too scared that they might kill you that wontbe necessary my dear master mcalister a voice said surprised salazar whirled to see godric stepping from the shadows near the door pushing back the hood of his cloak mcalister jerked his eyes suddenly wide what when he then recomposed himself and demanded how long have you been standing there enough now that you have all decided to hear our words godric said softly i believe that it is time for us to introduce ourselves he motioned the other three to join him wary salazar complied drawing into the light walking through the aisle left between two rows of benches the two women close behind now my friends godric said we are as you see the fearsome outcasts that you have heard so much about in the past year or so there were several sniggers in the crowd and salazar had to stifle his own smile with one proclamation godric managed to disarm a considerable part of his audience the four of them truly did not look fearsome rowena had ink stains on her cheek and fingers her hair was all over the place aided by the fierce wind they had to ride in when they came to the village helga always appeared wide eyed and innocent salazar was tired and blinked often a thing that made him feel ridiculous but he surmised that it was all in a good cause so he did nothing to stop it and as for godric godric always had the ability to charm almost anyone godric continued his introduction inventing it on the spot i am brave lord gryffindor of wild moor this brooding man beside me is shrewd lord slytherin of the fen the darling looking girl is sweet lady hufflepuff of caerwyn valley and last but certainly not least if i want to keep my health that is more sniggers and a painful looking jab in godric ribs by rowena is the fair lady ravenclaw of the glen we are as sir rhys pointed out your new neighbours and anyone wishing to enjoy our company is invited to visit the lovely though still under construction castle of hogwarts do not be shy we love having guests oh do get on with it godric rowena growled they re not here to hear you smart mouthing most have children and would like to get back to them before daybreak godric did not let her deter him brightly he said now i glad my dear rowena reminded me why we are here children as the smith here said deserve to have a good future that is why we are here you realize we are not fighting ambrosius in order make riches for ourselves or to get more power his face clouded to be honest about it we re as powerful as powerful get ambrosius is nothing to us in that aspect we do not wish to rule nor do we want dominion over the wizarding world all we ever wanted was a safe peaceful haven for ourselves but ambrosius will have none of that he wants us gone and because of that he does not hesitate to hurt the entire wizarding world you included our task therefore is to stop this man before he can cause serious harm we came here to ask for your support and help and what can we do to help if we choose to do so a gnarled old woman asked the first thing is let us be what we want to be let us teach you children to become great wizards and witches we have between us knowledge of most of the important fields in the arts of witchcraft and wizardry those amongst you whose children we already teach can attest to that we have much to offer how can you expect us to believe that we can get all that for free snorted a young man i dontknow about some of the people here but what i do in life does not earn me a lot i have three children how can i afford giving them all this so called greatness of magic of course it is not entirely free godric began but was cut off by the man again see what kind of please helga suddenly said hear us out friend our teaching may not be free but the payment is nothing more than you can afford what we need for now is your help in building our castle furnishing it helping make doors and windows cleaning building anything that you can think of is welcome think of it as a long term investment your children who i assume are still too young to be tutored will benefit from your help today they will have proper classes and proper meals anything we can do in order to make their lives more wholesome in that aspect will be done with your help say that we let you teach our children another man said this is clearly not the only thing you want from us you as good as said so only a few moments ago what else does the bargain include i d like to know that before i sign my name to it the bargain as you so aptly named it salazar interjected smoothly seeing that things were going more or less the way they wanted them to indeed includes more than that by letting us tutor your children you are contracting the loch to us you are making us legitimate you are defying ambrosius this leads me to the second part of what we wish to ask of you he looked at them giving them all a chance to meet his eyes we need your support in defying ambrosius and ultimately removing him and his good for nothing council from their position of power the uproar that this caused nearly made salazar ears explode you re asking us to die you will bring the end of the loch upon us there is no way ambrosius is too powerful we will all be killed you are ridiculous salazar winced noticeably when he heard that this was not said by a scared villager it was not even directed at them it was rowena and her quiet voice penetrated the noise making everyone stare at her i am sick and tired of listening to this babble she said angrily her voice rising together with her temper yes what we are offering is dangerous but so is not helping us one way or another we will pick up the fight against ambrosius with your help or without it you cannot get to us hogwarts is well protected what will you do then either way you will be dragged into this business you cannot remain neutral if you do not help ambrosius he will accuse you of treason bring his soldiers and wipe out this village we will do our best to help but our best might not be enough for lack of actual need if you help ambrosius you will be our enemies but worse that that on either occasion you will be trapped right in the middle of the war zone ambrosius will bring his men to fight us your children will be taken your wives and daughters taken too only for other needs i telling you what will happen not threatening you the choice is yours to make i think we are done here discuss it amongst yourselves and let us know without another look at her friends or the villagers rowena strode off glancing at helga and godric salazar followed this had better work he felt i hated doing that rowena said angrily as they sat around the table in their small house she had not touched her dinner drawing straws is not fair someone had to do it raven helga reminded softly they needed it said bluntly and unadorned i know it doesntmake me feel any better they are going to hate me now they hated you anyway godric said sweetly shut it before i shut it for you she growled threateningly a gentle knock on the door made them all alert gingerly helga got up and opened it heaving out a great sigh of relief she let in sir rhys and ceridwen they bought it ceridwen announced a tired smile on her face they will assist you in your every need and after the summer season they will start sending children in so soon godric frowned forgetting in his excitement to retort rowena i thought it d take them two days in the least eanraig wallace and the others had to give them a demonstration of why saying no is such a bad idea sir rhys said with a broad cheerful grin oh mcalister and his gang are going to have a horrible headache when next they wake ah are they likely to be any trouble salazar asked we had better head off that sort of thing not likely ceridwen said shaking her head rowena declaration made them scared to even move without you assenting that good did you manage contacting some of the other knights and the groups opposing the council deiniol and reynard are still out there picking the knights one by one as for those groups we haventreceived word as yet my personal belief is that they are waiting to see that we are serious about it they want to see some action taking place let get on with it then helga said salazar salazar helga called from the general direction of the still crude stairwell that led to the dungeons the two were working on restoring the dungeons and making them habitable rowena and godric were working up in the northern tower helga left a few moments before to ask whether they wanted to have lunch already tearing his attention from the wall he was carefully strengthening salazar looked up to see her running towards him at first he smiled sure that she was going to tell him something good then he saw her expression in the dim wand light what is it he asked urgently gripping her shoulders did something go wrong in the northern tower are they all right are they all right she cried they re ready to kill each other they re at each other throats they wouldntlisten to a word i say we have to do something about it already sighing salazar calmed himself sometimes he simply wanted to kill his best friend godric could not resist teasing rowena and rowena being her patient self responded by exploding i coming he said then he hissed come maureen it time to distract godric and rowena again the small snake slithered her way to his arm hissing as she went i dontsee why they keep repeating this salazar it becoming ridiculous they feel the same way towards each other so why not simply mate and have little ones salazar nearly choked on that as he followed helga up the stairs this is not how it is done maureen not with humans you humans are strange beings salazar you make the smallest matters complicated just tell godric and rowena to stop being ridiculous tell them to make up and mate his strangled what was apparently not said in parseltongue for helga looked at him with a raised eyebrow what what she asked nothing dear he muttered glaring at his snake simply that maureen had some weird ideas about our two friends up there she refrained from prying deeper into the matter her eyes were still worried he heard them long before they were halfway up the spiral staircase that led up to the top of the northern tower where godric and rowena were supposed to be finishing the placing of the carved wooden beams which helped support the tower roof arrogant foolish prat rowena voice rang you donthave to be so sensitive about it godric replied sourly sensitive i not being sensitive the fact of that matter is that you groped me salazar had to stop an involuntary snort i told you they were at it again helga said desperately as they peeked through the opening at the top of the stairs watching the combatants they wouldnt listen they never listen anyway why even try he said with a shrug observing his two friends salazar fine fine though if you ask me he deserves it this time let see of we can separate them you ll help rowena here and i will take godric to work down at the dungeons with me how does that sound like a bloody stupid way of delaying the inevitable i know he admitted but have you a better idea she shrugged helplessly her blond locks shaking and sparkling in the light of the sun coming through the not quite completed roof everything will be all right dear he said softly his hand coming to rest on her cheek they will realize sooner or later what they are missing for now let just keep them away from each other she nodded taking a deep breath salazar walked into the small battlefield that enough now children he said catching the two attention if looks could kill salazar was sure he would be burned to a crisp he raised his hands in a gesture of peace none of that please i just here to make a bit of order in the mess godric pack up you re coming down to the dungeons with me helga will remain here and help rowena finish up are we clear i d like to keep the two of you away from each other till you cool down glaring at rowena godric picked up his cloak and wand and followed salazar down the stairs once they reached the bottom and started making their way back to the dungeons he salazar said you deserved that you do realize that dontyou i dontsee how any of that is your business godric replied petulantly godric if you groped her you deserve everything she had to scream at you i didnt grope her the other man said though his eyes did not meet salazar s i merely brushed against her as i was reaching for another beam a brushing that may have included a lingering touch on her front salazar asked archly maybe godric said evasively godric you should know better i half in mind of taking you back and letting her hex you to hades and back with a sullen godric at his side salazar made much more progress down in the dungeons than with helga he supposed that it had to do with the other things he and helga did whenever alone it was mostly innocent mind you really as afternoon wore on salazar suddenly remembered something with all the excitement of the night before and the need to entertain the annoyed godric it had completely slipped his mind that their stores were dwindling and that it was time to take the supplies wagon to the loch hoping it was still not too late he told godric to go on working and that he would be back in a little while no godric said let me go if i have to spend the evening with that wench i ll lose my mind i will visit my mother make sure that we can walk undisguised in the streets of the loch and close up some unfinished businesses i need this outing salazar please shrugging salazar nodded his agreement it was truly for the best to keep the quarreling couple away from each other he grinned to himself in his mind he already let maureen suggestion shape his thoughts it was almost midnight all the lights in the little house were supposed to be long out this was not the case however light flooded from the half shut shutters and voices were heard salazar and helga were sitting on a low bench by the fire and watched rowena as she paced restlessly to and fro he should have been back more than four hours ago she growled it doesnt take that long to load a cart and drive back irresponsible fool please rowena salazar tried to sound composed calm yourself he must have stayed at ceridwen for a while but it not like him to disappear without a word and it been too long ceridwen will never let him stay up late look if it makes you feel any better i ll take cian for a ride and go get him then when we come back you can scold him for all you are worth her expression doubtful but her eyes lit with hope rowena nodded tell him that i ll kill him when he comes back if he doesnthave a very good excuse and if i discover he been drinking himself senseless in that calanthe company smiling though not waiting for her to finish up her sentence salazar got up squeezed helga hand to reassure her and went out as he started on his journey to the village he was humming happily rowena was good for godric he had been too wayward for too long salazar could not say that his friend was irresponsible nor could her deny the fact that he could be much more serious than he normally let on during the past year and a half but godric needed someone to pull him up short and rowena was just such person in his heart godric knew that of that salazar was sure he decided that this was the reason for the other man taunts and teasing godric realized just as salazar did that a commitment to rowena was a commitment for life there was no going back and godric did not want that just yet it was obvious however to anyone but the two involved that in the end they will give in and the greater they are the harder they fall rowena ravenclaw and godric gryffindor were in for a long hard inevitable drop salazar first stop upon reaching the village was their usual loading point a place just outside the tavern on the outskirts of town where their supporters hid the supplies he could see tracks in the earth around that point of a horse a cart and a man godric had reached there of that he had no doubt however as he was obviously not there anymore he turned in the direction of sir rhys house salazar knocked on the front door firmly hoping that someone was still awake it took a short while but finally lleulu opened the door cautiously her face concerned in the dim hallway light when she saw it was him she smiled though her eyes still showed concern welcome lord slytherin how may i help you i apologize for the hour mistress lleulu but i am here on an urgent errand is godric here lord gryffindor he left over five hours ago she said with a frown he came over briefly talked with ceridwen and then left he said madam ravenclaw would skin him alive were he to dawdle oh i see do you think he may have gone somewhere else maybe to calanthe tavern i dontknow i doubt it but i ll look thank you lleulu give my regards to ceridwen and again i apologize for the hour of my coming not waiting another moment he turned mounted his horse and rose off back to the tavern it was not very likely that godric stopped there as he got an earful from rowena every time he came back with the smell of ale and smoke on him her excuse was that it was dangerous for him and that he might be discovered but salazar knew better it was still an option though salazar slytherin long time no see how fare you the hour is late calanthe greeted him cheerfully as he pushed through the door the tavern was almost empty most of its clients either too drunk to go home or already asleep on the floor indeed i mustntstay here long i expected back home is godric here godric i haventseen him in months that rowena keeps him on a tight leash does she not calanthe took it all in good spirits she often confided in salazar telling him that she truly admired the stubborn young woman but that it would do her no harm to let go a little of herself it would seem so so he wasnthere tonight my thanks leaving the tavern salazar was starting to feel the faintest thread of concern gnawing at him where could godric be it was late too late less than two hours remained till daybreak and he could already see the early risers coming out to the streets holding lit wands spotting eanraig the smith stepping out of his front door salazar called his name lord gryffindor the smith yawned rubbing his eyes i ve seen him loading that cart of yours just before nightfall yesterday he went to rhys i think that was no good salazar hurriedly caught the baker next door attention i sorry lord slytherin the man said helplessly his eyes showing his awe i haventseen him since the meeting the last person salazar asked was a young woman who was cleaning her doorstep the sun was already peeking up the horizon gryffindor been here yes she said politely i recognized him immediately been at the meeting you see he rode off right after sunset he said he ll be back next week and then took off in the direction of the ruins salazar was worried all the people he had talked to said that godric was no longer in the village if he was not in the village and not at home then where was he he was afraid for his friend not knowing whether he was hurt or if something else happened to him a chilling thought made him freeze what if ambrosius men no he refused thinking such unbecoming thoughts with a sigh he mounted cian again and left the village he made his way down the track leading to the ruins hoping that by the time he will reach home godric will already be back being shamefacedly listening to rowena reprimanding and what a reprimanding that one would be missing for hours rowena would be frantic out in the gloom a horse neighed cian ears pricked and he whinnied in return salazar was startled there was only one horse cian got along with godric he called is that you there was no answer aside of another neigh lumos he whispered wishing the sun would be up already ahead trapped within a thicket of trees stood godric palomino stallion griffith hitched to the cart of supplies there was no godric in sight a n ta da what d you think dontbe shy good bad could do with a bit of a change review and

rowling creator of the worlds of harry potter a n i have no idea why but it seems almost like the farther i go with this story the longer the chapters grow funny thing shrugs now my dear readers i have a riddle for you what are the benefits of being home sick well for one thing you miss school which is always a good idea but the more important thing is that you get to update your story in about a week since you have last updated so here you go chapter 15 see i nice i didntlet you hang with that annoying cliff for too long enjoy chapter 15 knight little is known of godric gryffindor time in gregory hands he said little of it not even to those he cherished the little he did say much later on in life was that during the time of his captivity he came to terms with his ideals and beliefs among other things that he will keep locked in his heart forever hogwarts a history author unknown while marcus gregory was waiting for gryffindor to wake up he was contemplating what to do as a matter of fact the big oaf fell into his hands much earlier than he had expected he certainly almost missed him when gryffindor entered the village grumbling to himself about the unfairness of life marcus had been hunting at that specific moment and had finally managed to corner that dratted rabbit when it had been scared away by the passing cart he had been half in mind to curse the cart owner into oblivion when he had realized who that owner is after that things were easy marcus had followed gryffindor as he visited certain places in the village and then when he left it was only too easy to stun him from behind and then drag his limp body to his camp he could not resist delivering a few fists to the unmoving man though it helped calm his nerves now however as he watched gryffindor starting to move a little he was somewhat at a loss he was not sure of the attitude he should take with this man was godric gryffindor an oaf as many of his fellow servants had said or was he in truth cut of the same cloth as his father his father bile rose in marcus throat as he thought about that man brave to the point of idiocy noble to the point of exaggeration he was too smart to be allowed on the ground gryffindor opened his eyes and then closed them again the blows marcus had dealt him blackened them considerably marcus stifled a chuckle at the wince of pain in the man face he certainly made sure that gryffindor would have a headache the minute he would wake it was very satisfying it was an interesting thing to watch to say the least gryffindor was trying to remember where he was and what he had done last and all this time he was not aware of marcus sitting not far from him calmly smoking his pipe finally after much effort it seemed like gryffindor succeeded in opening his eyes and keeping them open the sky was dark and dotted with stars and marcus was sure that this was all that gryffindor could see from his point of view gryffindor groaned and tried to pick himself up the moment he raised his head however it turned out to be a very bad idea when he finished emptying his stomach on the sodden ground he flipped again on his back and breathed heavily from the expression on his face marcus knew that he was trying to ignore the burning feeling in his throat the one that came after vomiting and which marcus knew only too well in the days after what had happened between him and his commander anger rose in him once again he shall have his vengeance even if the two responsible were long dead at present he decided to speak make sure that gryffindor knew he was there having fun he asked in amusement his voice a little scratchy from years of smoking a pipe he had taken to that vile habit when he had discovered that drinking really did not help him much and only did to befuddle his brains from the look of concentration on gryffindor face he realized that the man somehow recognized his voice and was trying to place it his lips curled in contempt gryffindor attempted to sit up but apparently found that his stomach still heaved presumably wishing to avoid a second performance of his previous engagement he settled instead on raising his torso by leaning on his arm now that he had raised himself he had a much better view of where he was and marcus allowed himself to hope that the games could start even that very night the two men were sitting in a small enclosure between undersized scraggly trees it was quite a distance from both the loch and the castle marcus did not want anyone to catch sight of his fire or of the deeds he intended to commit the ground admittedly was a little sodden of last night summer rain but marcus had been in worse situations during his career this was simply a minor inconvenience gryffindor was surveying his surroundings his eyes swept over himself then moved to consider marcus large roan horse honoratus who was standing to one side of the small campfire honoratus was a proud animal large and strong he had carried marcus for years without showing a sign of yielding to age he watched gryffindor as his eyes met with the polished blood red armour that was neatly stacked over his packs again recognition appeared in the captive eyes finally gryffindor spotted him he was sitting in the shadows caused by the fire and he knew that all gryffindor could see was an outline and the smoke of the pipe he waited why am i here gryffindor finally croaked the burning in his throat evident in his parched voice i commend you gryffindor marcus said delighted not where am i or who are you no you re going straight to business he laughed very well i will tell you why you re here you are here so that i can kill you and deliver your body and your friends to ambrosius in stonehenge was that blunt enough for you quite gryffindor mumbled there was a certain glint in his eyes that marcus was not quite sure he liked he started to get the feeling that this man his rival had all the characteristics that made his father such a dangerous adversary the young man was already thinking of a way to defeat him pity that marcus had to prove him wrong so soon gryffindor however was not aware of certain knowledge that marcus had in his possession so he continued now that we ve settled the pressing question who are you marcus laughed again a shrill scratchy sound that he knew will set gryffindor teeth on edge merlin only knew how many times ambrosius had gritted his teeth and told him not to utter that laughter in his presence i may keep you alive for a while just for the sake of amusement my boy trying to find out who i am are you the first step in order to defeat one enemy is knowing against whom you are playing lord baldric rules of engagement the knights of the order of the phoenix most prized set of rules my my rhys has trained you well things were going well for marcus his quoting of lord baldric rules was bound to make gryffindor think just a little no one was supposed to know about the rules only knights were allowed to read that document only knights knew this document existed gryffindor froze marcus could practically see the wheel turning in his head he rose from the shadows and stepped into the flickering light recognize me now gryffindor gryffindor had seen him only once but if marcus assessment was correct and the man had his father talents then once was enough he was almost elated to be proven right as gryffindor said marcus gregory isntit you came over by the pillars a while back very good gryffindor very good you said you want to kill me why we shall keep that information for later on though i dontsee much reason to hide it from you it will not help you much for now let just say that i have my reasons if you re waiting to gloat then you ll be waiting for a long time gryffindor spat hoping to goad him into saying something that will reveal more about him my friends will not fall into your hands easily marcus snorted you fell into my hand like a ripe fruit gryffindor your friends will not be different deciding he had played enough for the night he pointed his wand at gryffindor and with a couple of sharp commands tied him and silenced his voice he needed sleep tomorrow was going to be a long day marcus stands together with vitus his best friend they are both of the last lines of roman magic those last proud families who refused to mingle their blood with that of the common magic britons they are disdainful of the men surrounding them but they both realize that they have to at least pretend to be respectful if they want to become an integral part of the order so you are out new recruits then are you a tall man about five years their elder calls as he strides near them he has a commanding presence and marcus instantly recognizes him as someone with power amongst the knights the man black hair is long and he is tall and impressive his presence almost overwhelms them well the man asks somewhat in amusement name yourselves do not be shy we are all brothers here i am marcus gregory of herminius line marcus replies proudly and this is my friend vitus of gallus line the tall man seems to be amused this is not the awe filled expression marcus is used to receive when he introduces himself and i am gawain of the gryffindor line the man smiles this does not put me above my commander though does it do yourselves a favour my boys keep your high and mighty approach to yourselves this will not earn you friends amongst the knights i am one of the training masters you will do as i say do not argue with my commands for arguments will get you nowhere around here are we clear marcus tossed and turned in his sleep he did not want to dream these dreams those things were in the past long dead and buried the man who rides into camp scares marcus he is grim and tired but a lot of the knights there cheer him as he arrives he wears blue armour with the figure of a bronze eagle painted on its breast the armour is battered and battle worn and so is the massive sword he wears at his side and the big shield on his arm with the eagle crest painted on this must be one of the great commanders who are fighting the muggles on the southern lands who is that vitus asks him in awe he looks like a god amongst men marcus shrugs he has no idea who that man is he taps one of the knights shoulder the man turns a slightly irritated expression on his face what is it he asks who is that marcus demands i have never seen him before the knight laughs of course you are new around here only a couple of years this is raven lord the commander own prot g he has been trained for leadership from the moment he had enrolled as a knight he is here to say goodbye to the commander i warrant and to take command from him but he must be no older than twenty five marcus protests he cannot be commander at such a tender age the knight laughs again raven lord is not yet twenty years of age but he is the most competent among us unless you count gryffindor and he cannot accept the position and why is that why is that the knight splutters because he is of the council that why one cannot command the order if one is a member of the council then the knight turns and ignores marcus further attempts at drawing his attention the man called raven lord rides through the crowds with a morose expression on his face when he reaches the commander tent he dismounts and stands before gawain gryffindor who stands guard by the tent it has been a long time raven lord he booms so it has lord gryffindor raven lord agrees then clasps the other man hand there is a resounding clang as the two gauntleted hands meet how is he gawain raven lord asks in a much less formal tone asking for you ryan gryffindor answers he has been asking for you for three days then i must see to him raven lord answers gryffindor puts a comforting hand on the other man armoured shoulder and marcus perceives that these two men though separated by seven years of age and coming from two different lineages were close friends no closer than friends brothers for a moment marcus woke up in cold sweat this was not like him at all he had not seen those faces in years and those occurrences he was dreaming of happened more than thirty years ago this was not boding well even in his sleep fuddled mind there was no escaping those dreams however and he soon sank back the muggles run they run screaming the knights of the order of the phoenix ran them down moments ago and now they are watching from the top of the hill as the few remaining are letting go of their pitchforks and torches and run for their lives marcus will have none of that though they killed vitus his only friend among the knights the only friend left to him from his childhood ignoring raven lord commands he puts his heels to his horse flanks and thunders down the hill screaming as he goes he only manages to kill two of the fleeing muggles before a gauntleted fist takes hold of his reins and another wrestles him of his sword that is enough gregory raven lord roars over the sound of screaming muggles i commanded the killing to cease they are escaping these men will do no more harm to our people and you know it will do no more harm marcus screams trying to get hold of his sword which is being held by gryffindor just out of reach tell that to vitus tell that to wybert cadeyrn and hefin tell that to their wives and children i will kill them all and what will you say to their wives and children gryffindor says angrily or to the wives and children of those knights who will lose their lives attempting to save yours think man marcus moaned in his sleep knowing all too well even in this state what would come next for atrocious deeds done against muggles and fellow knights sir marcus gregory hereby stands trial raven lord calls out his eyes hard as he looks down at the bound marcus read his alleged crimes if you please lord gryffindor yes raven lord gryffindor says from his seat next to his commander his eyes are just as hard and dislike shines from them sir marcus gregory is accused of killing muggles on five separate occasions after the order to cease killing had been called he had been seen going on personal killing journeys where he and several others hunted down muggles tortured them murdered them abused their bodies and raped their women several villages had been burned to the ground their fields ruined and their water supplies contaminated furthermore we have testimonies that sir gregory and his cohorts crucified muggles as was common in the days of the roman empire and hung others from trees to make things even worse raven lord these atrocities were not confined to innocent muggles but done to knights as well from testimonies gleaned from gregory cohorts who had had a change of heart at that point from spies that had followed the man for the past year or so and from surviving muggle witnesses it had been discovered that gregory had killed several of his knights who attempted to pull out of the deeds openly and not only so but torturing them and doing unmentionable things to their bodies for those crimes i ask for him to be put to death marcus takes in a deep breath he still has a chance raven lord was a soft hearted man at times if he is lucky this was one of those times my lord gryffindor raven lord finally says fellow knights there is nothing that will make me happier than condemn this miscreant to death it was fully my intention to do so when first i had heard of his crimes a glimmer of hope blossoms within marcus chest perhaps the fool will let him go however i have been commanded by the entire council not to do so raven lord eyes shine in distaste as he says these words venom drips from each one therefore with what little power those pompous asses left me i condemn sir marcus gregory thus from this day onward you are no longer a knight you are a man of contempt and i remove all protection of a knight from you i give full permission to any knight who may happen across your trail to wreak vengeance upon you you are a hunted criminal marcus gregory and shall remain so till the end of your days lord gryffindor will take you bound and gagged to a place far from here you will have three days to disappear for after that i am sending my men after you with the council permission or without it officially or not gregory i will see you die at the hands of a knight this time when marcus woke he was not able to go back to sleep he got up and looked around his camp in the dim morning light his eyes met gryffindor icy blue ones you had nightmares the man said with certain satisfaction and with a startled jump marcus realized that the silencing charm must have worn off during the night i did not he denied searching for the remains of his rabbit in his packs yes you did gryffindor said gleefully i ve been watching you all night you ve been tossing and turning and more than once you screamed you lie marcus hissed pulling out the leaf packed remains i never uttered a sound you are trying to make me tell you something it will not work oh but it has worked gryffindor expression was smug you are much less confident of yourself this morning and i distinctly remember hearing you mumble something about my father and raven lord something about committed atrocities as well your knowledge of the rules of engagement points to a knight but your dislike and the tone in which you said my father name point to something entirely different you have no idea what you are talking about marcus growled savagely tearing at the cold meat but i do sir gregory you were once a knight but for some reason you decided to go against everything the knights held dear and you were none too gently removed that why you want to kill me isntit you couldntget my father so you decided to come for me and what if i did then you are a fool that was too much for marcus in less than ten minutes since he had woken gryffindor already succeeded in making him reveal much about himself the man had the same irritating qualities of his horrible father gawain gryffindor had that annoying self satisfaction as well and that certainty that everything he did was the right thing to do a fool am i he gritted drawing his wand and pointing it at him a fool who managed to take you prisoner gryffindor shrugged he was so infuriatingly calm you cantkill me yet he said with a slight smile if you kill me you will not be able to get the rest they re going to find us you know he was so infernally calm that it made marcus grit his teeth the man was a captive bound and on the ground held at wand point and he still held conversation as though he was sitting on a chair near a fireplace gryffindor continued that same half smile on his face my friends will realize that there a reason for my absence they re waiting for the supplies cart that what i as doing when you so kindly decided to make me you guest you should have checked marcus ignored him and after swallowing the last of that rabbit felt around one of his packs for his pipe gryffindor went on how much did ambrosius pay you why marcus sneered his nerves wound tight after the night visions so that you could pay me more to stop me i dontthink there anything i can offer you that will stop you from doing that gryffindor said cheerfully no i just want to know how much i worth to him you re worth plenty marcus said softly his eyes narrowing but my payment is not in gold oh no ambrosius agreed to my terms almost readily what terms were those the lives of both you and raven lord spawn once ambrosius had had his fill with you of course but i dontthink he will mind me killing one of you on the way why us why not salazar and helga marcus laughed a bitter laugh he realized that sooner or later gryffindor will be able to discover the reason for himself so there was no point in delaying the inevitable after all he had already made a very good guess only minutes before the muggle born and the slytherin brat he snorted what do i need with them they dontbother me it been a known fact for a long time that i am after you and that wench you were right you know for years i ve been trying to get raven lord himself but i never had the opportunity since he hid himself so well after ambrosius did us all a favour and exiled him your father well the fool had himself killed too early on so that left only you to begin with i am going to have my revenge gryffindor your father had asked for my death and i will bring your death raven lord condemned me to years of a fate worse than death and i will bring his daughter a fate worse than death before i kill her too with certain amount of satisfaction marcus saw gryffindor stiffen at these last words my my have i touched a sensitive spot there he smiled at the man pitiful attempts to regain his composure you know what my boy i think i may have changed my mind i will not kill you immediately upon capturing your friends no i will leave you alive long enough to see what i do to your lady friend you will enjoy the sight of what i do and then after i kill her i will rid myself of you too bad that raven lord had had to leave a girl behind and not a boy too bad marcus went out for a lookout that afternoon after re administering the silencing charm he left gryffindor at camp and slithered his way to his hiding place near the village he immediately realized that it did not take the companions at the castle long to understand the reason behind gryffindor disappearance all three were at the village center discussing matters with a woman he recognized with something akin to fear as ceridwen gryffindor and with sir rhys one of the men most trusted by gryffindor and raven lord marcus could not make out what they were saying but by the grim expression on lady gryffindor face he guessed that they had by now deducted who was behind the disappearance cursing he slinked back to his camp where gryffindor was methodically attempting to draw himself nearer the horse stop that marcus said irritably and removed the charm from gryffindor voice what is your mother doing in the loch gryffindor smiled smugly she been living there for a few years now you did not expect to have to deal with her now did you a minor obstacle soon overcome ambrosius never said anything about not killing her what do you have against my mother gryffindor asked in puzzlement what do i have against ceridwen gryffindor marcus barked that nosy wench is the reason for my fall from grace if she wasntso damn nosy the knights of my company would never have let on anything she was to blame i should have killed her long before but i had to flee for my life for some reason ah gryffindor said his eyes alight now i remember you re the one she always called that monster in human skin you re the one who murdered and tortured all those muggles against the phoenix lore and against raven lord commands you re the one who was the disgrace of the order and raped and hurt all those women you re the one who was only spared because the council interfered the one who betrayed the lore betrayed the lore marcus said his temper rising i betray the lore the lore says to protect the lives of the magic people against all enemies the lore says to eliminate that threat for a better life for all our people your father and that raven lord scum sold their lives because of so called morals they were too soft hearted and by that they betrayed the lore they let muggles get away with murder of knights and with murder of simple people they let them get away with it you call me a traitor they were traitors ten fold i was a true knight of the phoenix and they were nothing but frauds you call yourself a knight gryffindor seethed his eyes burning you i am more a knight than you are and i was never knighted the minute you began slaughtering innocents the minute you started killing your brothers the minute you turned from the path of the phoenix you stopped being a knight you call yourself defender of the community helper of the needy why you are nothing but the muck that clings to the mud on a knight boot i was making sure no wizard or witch were ever hurt again you made sure to cleanse the world of muggles how is that annihilation any help to us the muggles would have taken vengeance not if there werentany left and with that he kicked gryffindor hard in the ribs and the man fell silent gryffindor was silent in the next couple of days marcus took advantage of that silence to prepare himself to the fight that he knew would ensue he now knew that there will be more than the three companions of gryffindor to contend against lady gryffindor and sir rhys would help them that meant he had to prepare five different traps to get them all then he would kill the lady and sir rhys and take the other three captive ambrosius would be happy on the fourth day since gryffindor capture something changed in the man his sullen silence gave way to a once again cheerful manner this is the last mistake you ll ever do you do realize that dontyou the man said with a twinkle in his eyes and why is that lord gryffindor marcus asked mockingly because you and ambrosius and all the others who support him have already lost in your cause gryffindor he said in an exaggerated patient voice let me try and set things straight for you you have been taken prisoner i have already set the trap for your friends when they come here they will be taken by the trap and then i will take all four of you to stonehenge after killing your mother and sir rhys of course of course and pray tell how do you suppose you will be able to control two wizards and two witches of unknown limits that is none of your business then the other man fell silent though that slight smirk was still on his face ignoring the annoying man as best he could marcus started weaving his spells around wishing to capture the three alive he was never a particularly strong wizard though descending from a noble line his magic was very limited and only allowed so much before he would tire once he became a knight things were different one of the central things a knight learned after taking the oath was how to combine swordsmanship and magic marcus had always been a good swordsman he learned how he could intensify his magic by working it through his sword he was one of the best he had learned it from the best raven lord had taught him himself for that marcus admired him for a while but raven lord betrayed him betrayed the oath of a knight he had let other knights die he and that hulking ape of his with distaste he glanced at the all too cheerful man sitting upright in his bonds looking at all that marcus did he decided it was time for gryffindor to lose some of his smugness and cheer thinking back to the few conversations he had had with the man in the few days he had him under his power he returned to that weak spot of his that had gryffindor so upset do you know what i going to do to raven lord girl when i get her he asked putting the finishing touches on his encompassing spells no gryffindor replied warily and i sure i dontwant to know well marcus said licking his lips i think that you are going to hear it anyway he then settled himself on the ground in front of gryffindor just out of his reach lit his pipe and with a predatory smile on his face he began the first thing i ll do is rip her magic out of her flesh the method in which i shall do it is not very complex half an hour later he was still having fun describing in detail what the women was to go through once he were to have his hands on her for inspiration he used those countless women he encountered during his years as a knight when all he had had in mind was how to kill torture and otherwise hurt muggles with more than slight satisfaction he watched gryffindor face turn green and then white and finally reaching a murky grey he obvious had no stomach for such things much like his father the man could not bear to watch the results marcus executions and finally he said in a soft whisper i shall take her for myself just before i kill her and i shall enjoy her screams as will you for you will have to watch every single moment of her treatment just like i promised now that wouldntbe nice marcus sat bolt upright gryffindor was too busy being sick on the ground he could not have said that he slowly rose to his feet and turned an auburn haired woman smiled at him rowena ravenclaw at your service sir gregory i believe we werentintroduced properly how could she have passed through his defences he may have been a mediocre wizard at best but this was his grand work he drew his wand and pointed it square at her chest she did not bother even reaching for her own ah i wouldntdo that if i were you gregory another voice said just to ravenclaw right he whipped his head in that direction rhys he hissed the old man smiled i glad that even in your befuddled state you still recognize your old companions as i was saying i wouldntrecommend on hurting rowena you re surrounded from the shadows to either side slytherin the muggle born and lady gryffindor stepped into sight wands in hands ah marcus said softly but now that all five of you are here my trap can open with a flick of his wand blue flames erupted all around surrounding the five people setting their clothes on fire then before any of them had the time to react he started shooting thin snakelike cords from his wand that wrapped themselves around the trapped fools something was not quite right however the five did not look panicked at all a stunning spell beam of light missed his head by fractions of a distance he whirled around and on his other side there were five others smiling wolfishly why hello marcus one of them said hissing long time no see eh practically since gawain hurled you by the hair as far as he could where have you been hiding all this time yes another said with an ugly undertone to his voice we searched everywhere for sudden slaughters of muggles even after the order disbanded we were hoping so badly that you would slip and we d be able to kill you and bring gawain your head as a present marcus mouth went dry brendan alban gwilym hallsteinn deiniol he said trying to keep his eyes on all five at the same time what are you doing here oh deiniol smiled evilly look my friends it seems like gregory has missed a very important thing you should have done you homework more carefully dear boy we happen to live here no marcus stared in disbelief no it cantbe i made sure he had time just for one thing he whirled again and trained his wand on ravenclaw who stared at him defiantly die he screamed and let go the most powerful curse he knew then there were beams of light all around him he dodged and ran sending his own hexes and curses in every which direction he knew that whatever happened at least he managed to complete his vengeance on raven lord then something hit him and he knew no more a n okay i admit that was somewhat evil and i really didntmean things to get to that but that was how it turned out now that this is out of the way halftime yes you have heard me right with the end of chapter 15 we have hit the precise middle of tale of

it i also hope it not too long but i simply could not cut it any shorter enjoy chapter 16 heart aches long before the school became a fact the founders realized that in order to have a united establishment that could in time pull others in its wake they had to create a symbol for themselves a coat of arms this of course was easier said than done for the four had much more pressing business at hand but as the first couple of years had passed they understood that the need for the banner for the symbol was much more urgent than they had first surmised therefore urged by others supporting their cause they had created the crest that in years to come would appear on each and every official document leaving hogwarts castle hogwarts a history author unknown rowena opened her eyes she dared not hope that she survived that spell without a scratch it was obvious enough that it was not used in its full potency for had it been the matter she would have been gone she was on her back and there was something that felt like a tree root stuck in the small of her back all around her she could hear spells being shouted someone stumbled over her making her shoot upright the hasty movement resulted in a feeling of dizziness that soon subsided taking a deep breath she looked around her four of the five knights who had accompanied them to gregory hideout were to one side running after the apparently fleeing man while the fifth remained behind to untie the others she looked around but failed to spot godric rowena helga cried the minute she was released and threw herself into rowena arms dont ever do that again do what she asked in bewilderment i didntdo anything scare me like that you gave me such a fright rowena laughed weakly she had given herself a fright when the words had left gregory mouth she wished the world goodbye and her last conscious thoughts revolved around godric she was quite mortified of what that might imply and resolved not to speak another word of it to anyone ever she tried to get up but found herself gently restrained by salazar hand on her shoulder you may cause yourself further damage rowena and godric will never forgive us that ignoring what this may mean she asked speaking of godric where is that man the moment deiniol set him loose he went after gregory the others will make sure he doesntdo anything stupid define stupid she said dryly masking her worry shaking his head in suppressed mirth he replied anything that godric did does and will do that according to normal people definition correct then assuming that godric went after gregory unarmed and after he spent almost a week in captivity very likely without food water or much sleep what can this be defined as he sighed very stupid true then what are you going to do i m going to bring him back and make sure he in one piece so that you can make his life a living hell for giving you such a cause for worry yes with a shrug of resignation salazar drew his wand and left helga stayed by rowena side taking note of any bruises and abrasions that she may have suffered by the failed spell you had better not move she said gently we have no way to know whether this has gone without internal injury i ll have the knights carry you to the loch when they re done with gregory is there a healer in the village ceridwen godric mother who was speaking quietly with deiniol and rhys knelt beside the two women yes though not a very talented one he ll do i think you dontseem to have any external damage my dear rowena but helga is right i dontwant you moving as yet we ll take you to angus first thing in the morning then she got up again and resumed her conversation with the two men are you going to tell him helga asked softly looking directly into her eyes tell who what rowena answered evasively knowing only too well what helga meant tell godric of course helga replied with exaggerated calm tell him what rowena honestly i dontknow what you re talking about the day i d believe that is the day i see ambrosius dancing in front of the entire magic community wearing only his undergarments i ll ask this just once more are you going to tell godric now how you feel towards him rowena lowered her eyes refusing to look at her friend helga always knew how to read her most covert secrets i dontfeel anything towards him she denied and then knowing that helga would not let her be otherwise she feigned a swoon and fell back closing her eyes and stifling a grunt as she hit the ground again she could hear ceridwen letting out a surprised cry and felt the earth around her shudder as the older woman rhys and deiniol knelt again beside her next to helga she not well helga said for the others to hear but then her mouth was next to rowena ear and rowena could clearly hear her whisper you and i are not finished yet raven i know that you re faking i ll get this out of you at another time dontyou dare thinking i let you off the hook after a few minutes had passed rowena allowed herself to blink her eyes open and groan loudly she did not think helga believed any of that but it was the best she could do on such a short notice are you feeling better mistress ravenclaw sir deiniol asked as she raised herself slightly y yes i think i do are the others here no not quite but we heard them thrashing about in the trees ahead from the sounds i d say that they ve got gregory good she said in a hard voice i d like to have a few words with master gregory before they kill him ah she then heard helga you re awake i believe the men are coming back now rowena did not miss the hard look the other woman sent her way a few moments later the six men entered the enclosure dragging behind them the limp body of marcus gregory making sure his head would skim the ground and bump against every stone and tree root hidden in the damp earth salazar was keeping a tight hold on godric arm godric himself looked a little unwell but his eyes were angry his expression however softened noticeably as he spotted her rowena arentyou a sight for sore eyes he said nearly weeping in relief well if i a sight for sore eyes then you are what made them sore in the first place she said snidely she had no idea what caused her to say that but it did not look as though he minded he knelt beside her and hugged her tightly she stiffened it was the first time he had touched her in something that was more than a restraining hand or a friendly clap on the shoulder it was not unpleasant she let out a squeak of pain as his arms squeezed her he immediately let go what the matter he asked sharply we still dontknow dear ceridwen said calmly we re taking her to the loch and from there to angus first thing in the morning she ll be fine i warrant but we had better make sure are you all right yes yes he muttered still searching rowena face for anything out of the ordinary she averted her eyes only to meet the cunning expression of salazar eyes he was up to something as she was carried on an improvised stretcher made of a few cloaks and held between four knights rowena did not stop talking she felt sharp pains in her abdomen and in the region of her rib cage and even though she had little background in healing she knew that this was not a good sign by talking she managed to keep her mind off the pain and apart of that she had to make sure that godric would not do something foolish again salazar she called to her friend whom she knew what holding one of the corners of the stretcher yes rowena he asked in a voice that mirrored his concern oh dontworry yourself over nothing i sure i all right i hardly feel any pain she lied what is godric doing he lurking near gregory i had rhys keep an eye on him he wouldntdo anything that will cause himself harm how is he faring well enough i dontthink he will collapse anytime soon but rhys is also keeping an eye on him in this aspect if he sees him so much as blink the wrong way he will put him to sleep and they will carry him the rest of the way we re not too far from the village though so he should make it in one piece i sorry i such a bother i can walk by myself you know you donthave to carry me rowena he said in what could at best be described as a hard tone i dontbelieve you so stop it you re in a lot of pain i can see it in your face she grimaced i am not all she got in response was an indignant silence when shall we begin the new tutoring year she asked again attempting to ignore the pain first of all you have to get well raven helga voice said dryly from her left you cannot expect to teach in this state nonsense she said airily i ll be back on my feet in hours bed rest for three weeks the scruffy man named angus said with finality impossible rowena said angrily trying to get up but finding herself being firmly kept down by the healer i have things to do those things can either wait or be done from bed he said in a voice that brook no argument if you do not rest then there will be irrevocable damage to your rib cage and various internal organs i will have certain potions prepared for you you must take precise amounts of them as i will prescribe now lean back and rest grumbling she did as ordered she had attempted leaving the bed a few times that night only to discover that there was someone nearby at all times to prevent her doing just that they had woken her very early in the morning and loaded her on the improvised stretcher again she felt like a cripple and did not like that one bit once angus the healer had brewed his potions he handed them to godric who looked much better after a night of good sleep and two big meals and instructed her friends in the amounts she must receive then they moved her unto a borrowed cart and freighted her back to the house you know she said acidly to godric who did not leave her side for a moment you were the one we were supposed to carry home in pieces not i he smiled though his smile was only half hearted what did you do with gregory she pressed she knew fully well that the knights had taken the unconscious man somewhere right after they had placed her in rhys house under lleulu and helga care she had no idea what they did with him however his semi smile turned into a full fledged wolfish grin dontworry about that rowena he said suddenly cheerful we took care of that mongrel he will not be bothering us again he refused to say another thing no matter how much she attempted coaxing him rowena made the best out of her three weeks of forced rest from the room she shared with helga restricted to her bed she issued a string of commands concerning the future of the school sitting up in bed she conducted whole discussions concerning the lesson plans for each subject they would teach sat with salazar over the plans of the castle of the things still needed to be built played wizard chess against helga and screamed at godric who was usually to be found on the other side of the house they had accomplished much in those days even though she was reluctant to admit it she hated every minute she was kept in bed and started loathing the mere sight of the walls of her bedchamber when helga finally proclaimed the three weeks over rowena shot out of bed like an arrow and ran outside whirling round and round and laughing like a little girl caring little of the impression she made behind her she could hear her friends laughing she stopped her mad twirl and glared at them haughtily i can make a fool of myself if i wish so she said sniffing in what felt like no time at all the summer season ended and all children were no longer employed in the various family businesses giving them the time needed to study again on the first day of the second schooling year the four friends could accompany their students all the way from and to the village without fearing detection now that they were a legitimate part of the loch society everything seemed to be easier they could get their supplies in broad daylight from the center of the village and could be often found discussing all matters from studies to reaping fields in calanthe tavern or next to the smithy what did not grow easier however was the teaching itself when rowena came on that first day to escort the children to the house she was greatly surprised to discover that she had over forty children on her hands the chatter was unbelievably loud and she started fearing that they would not be able to handle so many students when only two of them taught every day it was hard to say the least they soon found out that when the two women were the ones teaching then the boys would take it as a sign to make noise and stop the process of studying even dahlia sons and rhys sons joined the mayhem though in the year before their behaviour was impeccable they also discovered that when it was godric and salazar turn then the girls will hush up and pretend to be shy in an act of desperation the four decided that they needed to change tactic and so it was that rowena found herself teaching alongside godric one day when autumn was just showing its first colours it was a stifling hot day and rowena was in a bad mood helga and salazar had insisted on drawing straws again in order to decide who was to teach with whom it was only her bad luck she felt that had caused her to be stuck with godric on a day she found it hard to put a lid on her temper the day started out rather well they sorted the children into groups by their age and set a task for each the younger ones were given some simple charms to practice while the older ones gathered around godric to study the rudimentary rules of phoenix lore those students who had studied with him during the previous year helped him demonstrate it was then that the accident happened rowena was with her back turned to godric patiently helping a teary eleven year old in doing a simple levitation spell she was so busy with that that she missed hearing the dull thump and the scared intake of breath she did hear the scream that followed though terrified of what might have happened she whirled around with her wand drawn when she realized what she was seeing she rushed over to the almost petrified students who were gathered around their fallen friend move she said harshly pushing through them and kneeling beside goronwy sir rhys son who was writhing on the ground clutching at his bleeding arm a practice sword stained red by his side she never had much success with healing charms but helga was too far off and she feared that by the time someone would get her goronwy would lose too much blood godric was already at work tying a bit of cloth he had torn off the edge of his tunic tightly around the boy upper arm to stop the bleeding muttering things that she probably should not have said near such young impressionable children rowena touched her wand to the gaping wound and applied the most basic healing charm she knew luckily enough it had work catching her much by surprise after the crisis was taken care of she had waited till the children went home for the day goronwy with his arm in a sling clutching a letter full to the brim with apologies and explanations for sir rhys to have a little talk with godric what were you thinking she hissed stopping him just outside the house how could you have been so irresponsible what are you talking about he demanded though his eyes shifted uncomfortably i talking about letting them play with those bloody swords someone could have lost a limb or worse killed you re exaggerating rowena you do that a lot you know that exaggerating am i she said scornfully then how would you explain this little accident we had today you were in charge of that group and you let goronwy get hurt he could have lost that arm do you realize that he wouldnthave lost the arm you re always making such a fuss over everything fuss fuss godric we are responsible for the lives of these children when they are under our care this could have been so much more serious but it wasn t now was it he gritted stop your self righteousness rowena you re not better than me in any way i see you letting the children under your care experiment with simple charms she burst throwing all pretenses to the winds no longer keeping her voice down i let them experiment with simple not harmful charms not swords godric never swords you re so full of yourself he shouted also losing his temper you re so sure that you re the best thing that these children are ever going to have you think that you re a better teacher than the rest of us and you re sure that you could have done better without us well guess what mistress ravenclaw you are nothing without us you are a petty woman who keeps grudges and delves into dislike long dissipated you wrap old hurt around you like a man would wrap a mantel grow up will you people dontlike self righteous women like you who think they are merlin gift to the world you are nothing but a woman there are dozens others of your kind and i could go anywhere to get someone else do you understand what i saying rowena do you he was so close to her his breath so warm against her face as he drew nearer and nearer until all she could see were his cold blue eyes he seemed to search something in her face but after a while in silence he drew back no he said in disgust i now see that you have no idea what i talking about i have wasted my words grow up rowena grow up and with those words he left in the direction of the castle and helga and salazar who were still at work there she would not cry no matter how hurt she was she would not cry but the tears did not stop flowing leaking from her eyes even though she tried her best to dam them in she sat in her bedroom on the bed and stared determinedly at the open window it was stifling hot inside the house worse than the outside and she wanted nothing more that go up to the much cooler castle but he was there now putting the finishing touches to the last tower they had to complete most likely she did not wish to see him right now but then why would she be the one to hide her face he was the one who said all those awful things he was the one in the wrong he should have been more careful more watchful and the tears went on flowing you need a symbol ceridwen told them one evening when she and the others arrived at the castle for their weekly meeting a symbol godric asked frowning at his mother words rowena wanted to know the same thing but agreeing with godric would mean having to talk to him and she had successfully avoided doing that for over a month she waited for ceridwen to explain herself last year someone mentioned something in passing i think it was brendan that the groups that will come once we manage to have their cooperation will need to be gathered under one banner your banner and right now well you dont have a banner we re more or less stuck on the matter of the groups they need us to prove ourselves oh we ve taken care of that little obstacle salazar said with a rather ugly expression on his face oh rowena noticed that the five knights who had helped in the rescue a few months earlier were also grinning evilly well let just say that we made sure that when ambrosius underlings found marcus gregory there were enough people around to get word to those who also resist the council i d expect messages to arrive soon enough they are sometimes slow but it ll come to them they will want our help ceridwen dontworry she smiled good then as i was saying as this is more or less of a stalemate we can think about those lesser matters for the time being so please think it over well it easy for rowena godric said after the village people left but what about the rest of us pray tell she said angrily speaking to him directly for the first time in a month why is it easier for me because your family already has a symbol rowena dear do you forget you father coat of arms the eagle she said skeptically yes the eagle a bronze eagle on a blue background why not salazar butted in blue is your favourite colour isntit i suppose so salazar easy too helga said oh salazar asked mildly well you re a parselmouth arentyou make it a snake salazar closed his eyes and rowena thought it looked as though he was trying to picture his coat of arms after a while of silent thinking a smile spread on his face why not he asked and i ll take the colours of my line silver and green it should have a very nice effect i have one for godric rowena said with a grin i have a riddle for you my friends what is imprudently brave outrageously boastful and extremely protective hey godric exclaimed that not fair i didntinsult you now did i it wasntmeant as an insult godric she replied placating him deciding that the month of silence was good enough a punishment i was merely reliving your run after gregory last summer without a wand and in a weakened state i think it quite appropriate i dontfollow your reasoning rowena salazar admitted what kind of beast is it why a lion of course she replied cheerfully they are very brave boastful of their power and very protective of their territory oh she then added almost as an afterthought they also let their females do the hunting for them the lazy things i think they d have them cooking their food for them if only they knew how to cook she gave godric a cheery grin he growled threateningly but his eyes showed otherwise he liked the idea scarlet and gold i think salazar said finally again with his eyes closed your line colours and besides lions are golden it fits perfectly rowena i proclaim you a genius they still had to find something for helga and that proved to be difficult she was not of a noble line so she had no coat of arms nor did she have hereditary colours they all sat around the table pondering that problem for a while all right godric said we three have animals as our symbols right so most likely helga should be an animal as well it a bit simpler if we think about it this way what can helga be described as err friendly salazar offered rowena caught a certain glance between the two and saw helga blushing she felt her lips curl into a smile sweet she added good natured loyal protective perceptive bloody stubborn are we finally admitting something about ourselves rowena shut it godric why stubborn salazar asked with a frown helga is the most placating quiet and self effacing person i know she never insists much rowena snorted you re blinded by your own heart salazar she said may i remind you that you did not want helga to accompany us to begin with she managed to come all the same did she not when she wants something our sweet little friend has a will of iron that aside helga interrupted her cheeks red that brings us no closer to finding me a symbol maybe we should offer you animals godric asked how about a gazelle too cowardly helga is no coward rowena countered a dove perhaps too timid salazar said shaking his head a bear no that horrible a fish that disgusting godric a fox it simply not enough helga cried that quite enough thank you frankly i dontcare if my symbol is a rabbit or an earthworm or a or a or a badger for all i care i dont care i just want us to have a school coat of arms already so that we can unite our allies under one banner can we please get on with it the other three exchanged glances fierce when angered godric said i told you she was stubborn rowena said with a grin but what of the colours salazar asked well godric frowned gazing at the confused helga the animal black isntit black and white rowena corrected it striped but i suppose that in the banner it can be just black true physical appearances dontmatter much in heraldry as far as i can see what about the background yellow salazar said with finality like the colour of her hair what are you all talking about helga demanded rowena almost laughed at her friend discomfort why about your coat of arms of course didntyou just say that you wanted a badger i think we re done for tonight then come along helga let us go to sleep and with that she swept her confused friend with her to their rooms by the time the snows set in that year salazar had finally planned and drawn the final version of hogwarts coat of arms it had taken him a long time longer than she had first estimated he was often found at the hall up at the castle scribbling furiously and then crumpling the parchments he had been working on and throwing them as far as he could the castle itself was mostly completed by that time there were no longer open roofs through which snow could come in not everything inside was prepared though there were still dungeons to repair flights of stairs to complete and many rooms to furnish however as the winter snows became deeper and the little house made them all feel cramped and closed off they made a decision and so while salazar was still firmly attached to one of the benches in the council chamber drawing and redrawing the other three furnished a few rooms for their own use and moved all their personal effects to the castle they had abandoned the house and planned on making the castle a habitable place during those weeks when the heavy snow did not allow their students to come when salazar came to them with the complete drawing rowena godric and helga were busily converting the huge space beneath the council chamber into kitchens they assumed that they would have many students in the future and that was the deciding matter in choosing the cavernous room for that use i ve completed our coat of arms salazar came bounding through the door waving his parchment aloft he halted when he saw the big brick fireplace they were constructing what in merlin name is that this my dear salazar helga said with a smile is the kitchen you were going to feed all those children that will come to study in hogwarts were you he grimaced but did not have the opportunity to say anything for rowena took advantage of his preoccupation to snatch his newest work of art from his hands her eyes grew wide when she saw the results of so many weeks of work around a large elaborate h were four animals each in its own boundary within the shape of a shield a golden lion on a scarlet background a silver serpent on a green background a bronze eagle on a blue background and finally a black badger on a yellow background beneath the shield there was a legend written in latin draco dormiens nunquam titillandus she looked up from the parchment with a raised eyebrow never tickle a sleeping dragon he shrugged with a bright smile on his face it never hurt to enter a piece of wisdom into coats of arms now did it would you tickle a sleeping dragon you would not find me getting near a dragon salazar ever rowena and godric relationship suffered a great drop as the year went on no matter what they did they always ended up fighting even the most casual remark often ended in an uproarious fight rowena did not understand why she was doing that she would tease godric or insult him and he in return would flirt outrageously with calanthe when they entered her tavern after he did that she could not stop herself from making snide remarks that made his face cloud over and then verbal fights would ensue then they would not talk to each other for a long while then it would all start over again and she did not know how to stop it she simply did not you stupid arrogant pig rowena screeched it not like you are any better godric shouted his face growing red not better am i she growled deep inside she knew that what she was about to do next would be real trouble but she was simply too angry too insulted to stop herself i ll tell you what makes me a better person than you are godric gryffindor for one i am not a notorious drunkard who canthold her ale for another i am not the one often seen in the tavern groping that that slut of a tavern wench any given time i not the one making a fool of myself on constant occasion i not the one who has the image of a buffoon in the loch i not the one who is content wallowing in the mud with the pigs at the end of an evening i not the one who comes home late every night reeking of ale and spoilt foods singing loudly for all the world to hear you are slimy idiot with the brains of a bird who thinks he is all high and mighty because he is the heir of gawain gryffindor so let me tell you something you are nothing but a stain on your family tree you shame your father name and you are not worthy to carry the surname of gryffindor you are she did not get to finish the sentence for at that moment godric said in a low deadly voice all you are about to tell me now rowena you say about yourself spare me your need of self bashing grow up and with that he turned on his heel and left his shoulders shaking in some suppressed emotion rowena stared after him for a while and then ran away whimpering there was a knock on the door it was more than a sharp rap than anything else and it conveyed the meaning of the one behind the door this person meant business rowena mumbled a quiet come in the one to enter was helga whose face was like a thundercloud dark and menacing i hope you re pleased with what you have done rowena she said turning on rowena the moment she entered the comfortable room they had built on the ground floor for them all to sit and simply enjoy evenings there where rowena had taken refuge after her fight with godric what are you talking about rowena muttered bitterly hugging one of the frilly pillows helga liked so much to her chest i talking about the things you said to godric helga snapped that what i talking about what else could it be rowena you made the poor man so depressed i wouldntbe surprised if he wanted to simply die after the things you said godric would never do that rowena scoffed he sensible sensible my arse helga cried it was this more than anything else that made rowena sit up straight and stare at her friend helga never cursed he in love with you you foolish girl he loved you for so long that i canteven pinpoint the moment i noticed it and you you feel the same and you never allowed him to see that you ve both been miserable for ages snapping at each other and snapping at us hurting each other more and more and not once did you admit your real feelings to each other well i have had it helga voice rose to a near screech godric stormed off now and if he does something idiotic just because of the things you said then i will never ever forgive you do you understand never rowena was appalled she had never seen her friend act like this helga was angry with her many times before but never like this and what was worse she knew that the other woman was right she knew that she should have spoken with godric before but her pride did not let her say anything where is he she finally asked fearing the answer outside helga replied coldly probably catching his death in this rain letting out a muffled cry of alarm rowena jumped out of her seat and dashed out of the room in the direction of the entrance hall and the grounds behind her she could hear helga desperately shouting wait take your cloak but ignored her the corridor leading from the room to the entrance hall never seemed longer as she ran down it she felt as though it had lasted for hours finally she broke into the hall nearly slipped on the cold stones as she whirled right sharply and bolted out of the open doors she skidded into a halt on the slippery wet cobblestones of the grand entrance and looked around squinting to keep the rain out of her eyes it was hard to keep her eyes open because the wind that howled around her made her want to squeeze them shut but she had to find him before something would happen she saw nothing the lake a sheet of steely grey was the only clear thing she could recognize the forest was a hazy dark mass against the cast sky and the falling rain obscured everything else godric she screamed godric when she received no answer rowena half ran half slipped down towards the lake screaming his name against the howling gale every few steps tears streamed from her eyes warm and salty mingling with the cold drops of rain that fell on her face and drenched her dress and hair the wind released her hair from its careful binds slapping it against her face with force it snagged the hem of her dress on rocks and thorns and torn it into tatters her dress was muddy and wet as it clung to her flesh but she did not care she had to find godric and she had to find him immediately godric she cried again her voice cracked and choked with tears without warning someone grabbed her arm a big hand clapped around her wrist rowena godric roared over the scream of the wind what are you doing out here in the rain with no cloak come on numbly she let him drag her along she had no idea where they were she knew they were not that far from the castle but he was not taking her uphill then they were in front of their old house godric wrestled the door open and pushed her inside and then firmly set her on a stack of hay and scurried off only then when she was out of the rain and wind did she realize just how wet and cold she was she started shivering in the back she could hear godric muttering profanities as he did something in what used to be their kitchen when he came back he again unceremoniously took hold of her arm and pulled her up dragging her into the other room sit he ordered gruffly and as she obeyed she saw that he had lit a fire in the grate he settled himself beside her and stared at the flames for a while she shivered uncontrollably once the shivers subsided however he took his gaze away from the fire and started scolding her what were you thinking rowena he asked in the same gruff tone out in the rain with no coat or cloak without your wand just in what can be at best called your nightshift you could have frozen to death if i had not found you you could have died rowena did you even realize that if helga hadntcome and told me you ran off rowena suddenly in control again flared helga helga told me that you stormed off after our her voice died out that preposterous he exclaimed helga knew perfectly well that salazar and i were in the tower she they tricked us rowena said angrily they wanted us to talk again after our our our she could not bring herself to say it our what rowena he asked softly cantyou even say it our fight she looked up at him tears in her eyes for a few minutes she was certain that she had lost him forever she was sure that he had been swept into the lake or froze to death or any number of unpleasant ends for a few minutes she thought she had lost everything because of a foolish fight she looked at him his face still wet his eyes gleaming in the firelight i dontwant to believe that you d be foolish enough as to run off into a storm like that over nothing he said softly his voice barely over a whisper he slowly raised his hand and touched it to her cheek his thumb caressed her skin rough and callused against it she did not want him to let go rowena he began his hand slowly withdrawing sadness in his eyes godric she said firmly all former anger worry and tears gone do i have to do everything around here by myself smiling softly at his obvious confusion she held his face between her palms and closed the distance between them for a moment godric sat frozen as her lips met his own but before she could start wondering whether she had misinterpreted his meaning his lips softened over hers and returned the gesture she felt his arms leaving his sides and wrapping themselves around her for the first time in a very long while rowena ravenclaw was happy a n well that it for today are

jk rowling creator of the worlds of harry potter a n wow i have just arrived back home after a mind numbing body abusing trip and opened my email and saw all your wonderful reviews and felt like hugging you all thank you if anyone who reads this is a the story of four friends reader chapter 15 will be uploaded either later on today or as on schedule tomorrow so here we go chapter one of the story chapter 1 the dictation of fate during the tenth century the witches and wizards of britain lived under a shadow of fear the non magical community more commonly known as muggles was very aware of the supernatural and abhorred its very existence many of the magical community were persecuted and often killed by fire by hanging or by drowning the reader must remember that at that time the bubble head charm and the flame freezing charm were yet to be discovered thus most of those executions were successful to fight these persecutions the magical community founded the council of warlocks an establishment that would create a separate world for the magical community hidden from the eyes of muggles the council succeeded in creating the protected environments but as soon as that goal was achieved like many other political institutions the council main aims turned to the well being of the representative warlocks and their friends and families they stopped caring for the wizarding world as a whole and the natural procedures of life stood still magic capable children were left to fend for themselves and those of muggle heritage were not notified of their abilities this often resulted in death hogwarts a history author unknown five years later find rosalind ravenclaw and bring her to face the councilor face the consequences who does he think he is a livid godric gryffindor mimicked lord ambrosius chief warlock of the council of warlocks he and salazar were going back to caerwyn valley for the first time in five years they were commanded to bring a witch by the name of rosalind ravenclaw to the council gathering at stonehenge for what reason they were not sure who is this rosalind salazar asked attempting to mollify his enraged friend supposedly she is a great charmer and one of the only people to master travel by magic i heard from calanthe remember that witch from the loch the one who tried to seduce you anyway i heard from her that rosalind ravenclaw has been working in the past few years on a method to turn travel by magic a lot simpler for less able wizards i suppose wait wait wait salazar stopped the flow of godric speech back up a moment what were you doing with calanthe nothing he replied innocently i keep in touch with her every time i pass in the loch salazar narrowed his eyes he was not sure he entirely believed godric so what do you think ambrosius has to do with this charmer i have no idea i will tell you one thing though whatever it is he wants it very bad for this rosalind woman he has been gathering talented wizards and witched lately and no one knows what for or what happens to them after the council had them brought in front of him did ambrosius tell you where she lives he only told me she was somewhere in caerwyn valley nothing else there are quite a few villages there so i suppose we ll have to go from village to village and search for her if you ask me she might not even be alive anymore with all the prejudice going on in caerwyn these days and the council not caring about the lives of common members of the magic community quite possible i afraid oh salazar please let not get into culhwch why do you not remember salazar the girl the one they pressed us to marry the thirteen year old one we never did reject them oh i forgot it was five years ago you know she is probably happily married and has a dozen whelps by now that is not a nice word i think you took a fancy to her back then eh godric salazar scolded i barely looked at the poor thing i will have none of that from you i am still your elder whether you like it or not godric sniggered yes salazar i know you are older than me you never let me forget never have never will you have twenty eight years of experience in this world and i have only twenty five i bow before you greatest of the fen people he who wallows in mud quiet you salazar hit him playfully on the shoulder hand me your map will you godric pulled a rolled up map from one of his saddlebags and handed it to him what do you need the map for i dontreally remember the way to caerwyn were we supposed to go left in the second fork after that last town or was it right left now let get going i freezing my godric salazar tried to sound exasperate godric unlike many wizards of his station tended to resort to the rougher more common side of language he had a very colourful vocabulary and salazar to his horror has recently started picking up a lot of it sorry sorry i wontdo it again how far is it to the valley it ll probably take us the better part of three days i am really going to hex ambrosius next time i see him sending us out in the middle of winter hey i told you we should have hexed him before we left but goody goody salazar had to be all noble about it and tell me that it wrong well i am your elder and it is my responsibility oh stuff your responsibilities up your arse will you that man asks to be hexed you know it as well as i do and dontbother arguing i know you too well and can read you like an open book down to the most grubby and grimy corners of your impeccable soul salazar made a noncommittal noise at the back of his throat and went back to consulting the map that your answer to everything godric huffed indignantly godric and salazar finally reached the first of the caerwyn valley villages a small place called bronwen field it was in godric words bloody freezing and not even the many layered warming charms they cast repeatedly could take the edge out of the bite of frost you know godric began conversationally for the past three hours i ve been contemplating the best way to turn a man into a donkey eared radish indeed salazar replied dryly and may i hazard a guess concerning the identity of that man you have one guess thought as much look godric dwelling on it will do you no good let s let just concentrate on our mission all right how can i just forget about it salazar we both know that our credentials are far better than his we both can trace our ancestors as far back as the second century all he does is claim he merlin descendent where is the proof where is the family tree he has none and yet he treats us like dirt what right does he has to send us here like some snot nosed apprentices he has the council backing him up godric salazar said in the air of someone who has explained the same thing over and over again it was just our misfortune that both our fathers died when we were too young to assume their places in the council now let it go please godric grumbled a bit but complied they had discussed this before both men were offspring to two of the most powerful wizarding families in the magic community it was traditional for such families to have a representative in the council of warlocks however the number of seats in the council was limited and when both gawain gryffindor and searlas slytherin were killed with only a short interval between them twenty years before both godric and salazar were too young to replace their fathers two members of weaker and less noble families joined in their steads barring godric and salazar from joining back and continuing the work of their fathers the two young men headed to the village center and cornered a random villager upon hearing the name ravenclaw the man shied away from them and made signs to ward off the devil giving no answer so did the next three people they tried to question interesting reaction salazar said softly as they rode out of the village empty handed obviously this mission is not to be as simple as we had hoped godric frowned there something fishy about this do you reckon the villagers know the ravenclaws are not muggles it a possibility but we canttake it as a fact till we have some proof of it two days later they were about to give up they had combed caerwyn valley thoroughly and rosalind ravenclaw was nowhere to be found in every village they had entered there was one out of two reactions the frightened look and the sign against evil or complete bewilderment no one seemed to want to tell them anything only one more place to visit godric after this madam ravenclaw or not i heading back to stonehenge i have had enough of this wretched climate salazar said on the morning it started to snow blowing his nose on his handkerchief what wouldnti give right now for an anti cold potion is that one place named culhwch i am afraid so godric sighed let go the sooner we get it done with the better the pair rode into culhwch late that evening the snow fell heavily on the ground and they were grateful for the prospect of a warm bed and meal they received neither everything went as planned in the beginning the owner of the bear spear had a room to spare and a hot stew cooking in the kitchen he also seemed to remember them from five years prior and was very friendly they had just finished haggling for the charged price and settled to wait for their dinner when godric caught sight of a man he recognized sitting by himself next to the closest table drinking a pint of ale hello there you are master hufflepuff are you not sigmund hufflepuff raised his head both godric and salazar were astounded to see the redness of his eyes and his bloated face the signs of intensive alcohol abuse the five years that had passed were not kind to this man do i know you he demanded we ve shortly met five years ago when my companion and i first passed here how is your daughter helga i think her name was safely married i assume up till then salazar was not aware of the background noise in the inn the sound of cheerful talk laughter and clinking of cutlery only when it was cut off so abruptly he missed it something here was not right i donthave a daughter master hufflepuff growled oh but of course you do godric continued in the same cheerful tone salazar wished he could cast a silencing charm on his friend the man could be so thick at times you even wanted one of us to listen you great fool hufflepuff burst pulling godric to face him by the front of his tunic catching him by surprise i telling you i have no daughter he then released him and strode off godric and salazar both stared at him in amazement the silence was then broken by a feminine voice bitter and cold good job the pair of you reminding him of that that witch witch the two asked in unison exchanging glances and then turning to look at the young woman who spoke she was vaguely familiar to them both but they could not quite place her oh yes a witch i was a friend of hers as much as i am ashamed to admit it i should have noticed the signs it was entirely that raven girl fault that rowena she was always whispering in her ear it was she who turned her from the path of righteousness it was she who goaded her to worship the evil one oh we knew she was weird but never in our lives did we imagine we had such wickedness in our midst raven girl who is she salazar asked slowly understanding dawning on his face i remember the two of you you came here a few years back you must have seen her never away from her elbow always whispering and never giving her a moment peace she convinced her to push us all away she told her she was her only friend that all of us wanted to harm her i dontrecall he began only to be interrupted you mean that wild looking girl dontyou godric exclaimed the one resembling a haystack that her alright the woman said disdainfully that ravencrow girl she once punched me ravencrow surely you dontmean raven claw do you salazar asked in alarm you know them the woman asked in suspicion before salazar had the chance to stamp on godric foot or something after that fashion to stop him from talking godric said know them we have been looking for them for days where can we find them if the silence after master hufflepuff departure was profound it was nothing in compare to the one spreading after that question get out the owner of the inn hissed after the moment of shock had passed get out and never come back you are the servants of evil if you are looking for those people thank goodness we ve managed putting our hands on the man witch he wontbe consorting with the evil one any more get out get out they did not need any further prompting it was quite obvious to them both to what a nest of vipers they had walked into without another word they went out mounted their horses and rode out of the village with angry shouts behind them you just couldntkeep your mouth shut could you salazar said glumly that night as they huddled as near as they could to their miserable fire under the shelter of a few trees i sorry godric said sadly i suppose i was too alarmed to think rationally they killed someone you know the man witch i suppose they meant that girl father burnt him or drowned him is my bet burnt him probably it becoming more popular these days the muggles decided it was better leave the occasional wizard or witch they do catch no room for escape it getting ridiculous salazar said in a depressed tone we have to protect ourselves from the muggles they just cantlet us live in pe what is it he stopped seeing godric raised hand his friend put a finger to his lips then pointed to his ear and then to the direction they came from he also had his wand out and carefully aimed it in that same direction alarmed salazar pulled out his own wand and tried to listen for any suspicious sounds and see movements of someone hidden godric hearing was far better than his but his eyesight was better she tried her best to get there silently and unnoticed but she had not taken into count their being beings whose talents could put them in mortal danger and were always on edge she certainly did not expect godric pouncing on her from the dark and pushing her to the ground pointing his wand to her throat when he did very well godric salazar said dryly you have had your fun let see who this person is lumos his wand flared suddenly making the girl on the ground close her eyes protectively she looked about eighteen and judging by the way her hair was made as yet unmarried she too seemed familiar please donthurt me she whimpered covering her face with both arms oh i wonthurt you salazar almost purred but i cannot speak for godric here see he really doesntlike being sneaked up on and he was really annoyed today i sure you understand we really dislike hearing about our people being burnt to death because of a muggle whim please she begged i i came here to tell you something important mother comes to check up on me every night i donthave time to waste please what do you think godric godric glared at the girl but release her well he demanded i i am alis i was i am a friend of helga s helga hufflepuff ye yes she a witch it was not a question that what everybody thinks two years ago when she turned sixteen gwyneth that the woman that talked to you in the inn today just for a lark pushed her off one of the stones not far from the village where we used to play as children and she she just floated down wasnteven the least bit hurt and some of the girls well we were all taught from birth that anything unnatural is the work of the devil and that was unnatural no one could have done such a thing without the help of the evil one she sniffed and looked at them fearfully you are man witches are you not if we are it has nothing to do with your story salazar said sharply before godric could say anything get on with it for all we know you are a decoy sent to distract us while the rest of the villagers surround our camp and attempt to kill us as well with a cry she continued no i not i am still very much a friend of helga s i wontdo anything to hurt her the adults immediately had her confined and planned her execution for the next day they had everything ready the stake and all it would have happened had rowena not been there she seemed very shocked just like the rest of us and ran away she came back though with her parents and they managed to free helga at a dreadful cost rowena father was taken they burnt him instead of helga what happened next where are the women these days godric asked in a soft voice salazar was not deceived inside godric was furious while his own father died due to foolishness of his own trying to invent a new potion godric father was killed by muggles something his friend was not likely to forget alis seemed to sense it as well so she hurried to continue her story no one knows for sure but every time helga went to visit rowena she went in the general direction of the glen that up north that way she pointed people from the village went inside to search for them but they never found anything in fact they all came back confused at what they were doing there in the first place muggle repelling charms salazar muttered someone there is immensely strong to repel so many have you anything else to tell us girl godric asked alis shook her head intimidated then run along she did so not even attempting to hide her relief why didntyou memory charmed her salazar asked as they watched her depart it wasntnecessary she loyal enough to her friend besides i wontbe surprised if everybody in culhwch is already aware of our peculiarities put the light out will you you re lighting a beacon for anyone to see nox salazar whispered and followed godric back to the fire if they thought it was hard going through the snow in the valley it was nigh impossible in the glen they had to dismount their steeds and walk them an only half frozen stream also proved a test for them did you catch any whiff of magic godric asked quietly as he cast another warming charm on his horse wet legs nothing but those spells we use the ravenclaws are very careful i believe salazar replied drawing his cloak close around him considering everything i am not surprised it would have been easier had we had a muggle with us then we could have seen when the muggle repelling charms start their work as they entered deeper and deeper into the glen the weather got steadily worse by the time night had fallen a storm started blowing around them we must find shelter godric roared above the howl of the storm i cantsee a thing how will we find shelter we cantsee our own noses i see a light to your left can you see it far to his left salazar managed to glimpse that light a dim faraway light but real nonetheless yes come on they turned their horses in the direction of the blurry light it took them well over half an hour to reach there fighting the howling wind and battling through deep snow pulling their horses by their bridles they were not even aware of reaching the light until salazar was bodily slammed into a wall of a sturdy stone house blindly desperately they groped for a door i found it salazar shouted to godric he wrapped his hand around the frozen doorknob and pushed it open with all his might catching them both off balance still holding to their horses bridles the wind threw the two men into a well lit room crashing face first into a well worn clean floor ow godric whined i think i broke something me too salazar groaned next to him feeling a burning sensation flowing from the general area of his ribcage who on earth are you a n well did you like it did you hate it please review and tell me what you think to my reviewers window girl thank you bb thank you very much oh if i tell you there are any romances i will

the magical community takes in harry days are much more advanced eratosthenese glad you like it here the promised update and i cantwait to hear from you again cecilia orechio heh thank you very much d they will turn into companions pretty soon i hope you had all enjoyed this chapter and will do my best to update soon disclaimer everything here besides the few things you dontknow belongs to jk rowling creator of the worlds of harry potter a n okay okay i know that this was not quick enough to those who repeatedly and quite rightly keep reminding me that i should update okay i know it isn t but considering all i had to do this week i think i ve done fairly well so without further ado star of the north late update excuse s between studying intensely thought i got rid of that when i finished school a few months ago planning surprise birthday parties and being unwell twice i very sorry for the lateness of this chapter my sincerest apologies friends wonthappen again yeah right i can hear you all say just that end of excuses as is the custom of every fifth chapter in this story this one from another person pov can you guess who it is before you start reading hmmm bounces about happily okaaaaaaaaaay too much sugar in the system may not have been such a good idea so anyway shorter chapter than usual but i could not add more to it and i should probably warn you ahead that this chapter does a little rewind it starts before the last chapter ends somewhere in the region of just before billius arrival at hogwarts but i have good reason for that so keep on reading please enjoy the big p s okay so erm it would seem like i overdid it again but anyway it for a very good reason i have realized right after uploading the previous chapter that tale of a time long gone has celebrated its one year birthday on the 29th of august i cantsay that i ever imagined it would take me more than a year to write it but there you go shrugs so that that enjoy chapter 20 a time for vengeance not a lot is known of lord ambrosius last days during those days there was a massive amassing of military forces done under his command but we are yet to discover why the final attack on the founders of hogwarts had been annulled we certainly have enough proof to point at his arrival to the region of hogwarts why had the attack not taken place this is the question we shall attempt to answer in this chapter hogwarts a history author unknown ambrosius of york liked to think of himself as a patient man after all no one could possibly stay sane and calm after conferring with tedious argumentative old bats for so many years as he has without having a generous amount of patience he had to admit to himself however that at times even a mild mannered man such as himself is tested to the limits of his patience and that therefore he could not be blamed for his wish to put his hands around lord gaius thick neck and throttle him at that particular moment the aforementioned member of the first house was droning on and on about the foolhardiness in his opinion of the chief warlock ambitious plan to fell the four miscreants of the north finally tired of the old man single minded babble ambroisus held up his hand to signal silence i think we have heard quite enough lord gaius he said please sit down with all due respect my lord gaius said affronted i think that what i have to say is of utmost importance yes i know ambrosius cut him again delighting in the confused expression on the old man face but as it were it is not of great importance to this meeting which had been called especially to discuss what should be done about the hogwarts four and not whether it should or should not be done in the first place if you are unable to participate in this conversation due to your dislike of doing any kind of physical activity then by all means you are excused his expression not changing ambrosius gloated inside at seeing the humiliation colouring gaius face red how he loved showing the pompous old fool who was in charge instead though he just stared down gaius until he settled back into his seat glowering once that was taken care of he felt as though the discussion could resume its original direction lords the hogwarts four whether lord gaius here wishes to acknowledge it or not are a great problem to us they undermine our authority question our ability to govern our people i said it once and i will say it again until you will all understand the importance of these words they must be eliminated we can not allow this to go on once they set a precedent many more would follow in their footsteps questioning us we cannot let this happen what power over the common people would we have left if we allow this none this discussion is our utmost priority what are we going to do with the hogwarts four lord we cantactually do anything before we know the extent of their forces who supports them what kind of resistance we should expect lord keegan of the second house said mildly otherwise we would be like blind men plunging into a battle unarmed i understand that you have already ordered lord severn to build training camps and that the order of the drafting has been issued which are all reasonable precautions considering what we are up against but we cannot continue this venture without further information what are you saying lord keegan severn asked disdainfully that we should stop the training of our warriors not at all the second house lord continued in the same mild voice which always managed to calm his most agitated opponent what i am saying is that before we send these warriors out to do war upon hogwarts we should first collect information about the forces opposing us i propose that we should begin by checking the ground in our areas of control each of us see who amongst our subordinates is inclined to support hogwarts and if needs be eliminate them this suggestion delivered in such a mild manner sent a chill into every heart in the chamber even ambrosius but while the others may have had qualms concerning the subject of eliminating their opponents ambrosius found this rather refreshing he liked having things said to the point very well he said this is the first thing we should do once we know the full extent however when their meeting was over the lords of the second and lower houses dispersed and started making their way to their quarters each readying themselves to send their men out to spy in their own realms and deduce who was loyal to the council and whose interests lay with hogwarts the first house lords stayed behind for a little while conferring quietly among themselves finally leaving only ambrosius and gaius in the echoing chamber seeing that gaius did not seem inclined to leave ambrosius turned to face him well he said in a condescending tone you are making the worst mistake of your life ambrosius gaius said harshly staring into the chief warlock eyes this this ambition of yours would bring about the council end your actions are foolish and you disregard a thousand rules in the process of achieving your goals i will not stand aside watching you ruin our life work in one single rash decision i will not let you bring about the end of the wizarding world as we know it no matter what means i have to take in order to stop you i have warned you ambrosius remember that the two men stood in tense silence watching each other one waiting for the other reply and the other simply simmering in his own anger they were both of the oldest members of the council both of great rank in the magic community both powerful in their own rights ambrosius knew gaius could be a formidable enemy but he also knew that the old man was set and comfortable in his ways and therefore may argue with him in meetings but would never turn against him at length he spoke i appreciate hearing your opinion gaius and when the information reports arrive it would have a mighty weight in our discussions but for the time being stop trying to undermine me or you and billius would be the ones to destroy the council for good now get out of my sight i am tired of seeing you here with a stiff bow gaius strode off this was the last time he had seen gaius until the time several months later when an all members meeting was called the men sent to gather information had all returned and it was time for review the damage that may be done marius of cornwall and his people have declared their allegiance to the hogwarts four lord adrian said with a grave look in his eyes the first to actually dare speaking as have ariadne of the woods and her female thugs arvel aneirin and gethin of wales have done so just last night after a consultation with all the heads of the welsh magic communities while geraint hopcyn llew pedr and urien still support us the other twelve houses have agreed in the basic level to an alliance with hogwarts added lord keegan frowning apparently he had not expected the numbers to be so great i checked about the rebel bands my lord said lord larkin of the lower house most of them have already sent representatives to hogwarts my spies did not come up with any details but it would seem as though most of them would join with hogwarts were they to openly go against us with each report made by the lords of the second and lower houses ambrosius patience grew shorter and shorter he needed to hear some good news something to break the continued fall of horrible information but none of the lords seemed able to supply those good news what was most frustrating was that incredibly smug expression on lord billius face quite clearly stating i told you so there was something unbelievably consternating in someone on his own side looking so happy at your direst of moments billius was leaning back comfortably in his seat his arms and legs crossed in the very expression of satisfaction occasionally exchanging an amused glance with gaius who had been suspiciously quiet during the entire report apparently he was not the only one to feel that billius was too happy to be allowed for a very sour faced lord llyr said i have something to contribute to this discussion my lord you may speak ambrosius said liking the glint in the other man eyes while the people in my own realm seem quite content to stay on the side of the council one of my spies has come up with a fascinating piece of information which pertains to one of our number would lord billius like to enlighten us as to why he did not inform the council of the doings of a certain relative of his though he did not change his stance billius seemed to be more alert less comfortable in his secure amusement he did not however respond to the allegation ambrosius could almost smell his uneasiness and impatiently waved for llyr to continue the lower house lord seemed almost delighted in what he was about to reveal it seemed that ambrosius order from so many weeks ago had not gone unnoticed llyr had managed digging out filth on the lord billius resting his hands on his lap ambrosius settled down to listen i wonder how it is that our esteemed lord billius has forgotten to tell us of his kinship to one sir deiniol a former knight of the phoenix i failed to notify you on my kinship since it is not the business of the council to keep a record of all my kin billius said in a calm voice but ambrosius could see his body tense being of welsh origin it is hardly questionable i have many kin and deiniol happens to be one of them what has this got to do with our discussion then you do not deny your kinship to this knight of the phoenix llyr said a triumphant spark in his eyes most certainly not billius said indifferently i would insult both myself and our ancestors were i to do so and would be considered an outcast deiniol is my kin by blood and i cannot say otherwise i have not seen him in some years now not since the last of the knights of the phoenix stopped trying to do their obsolete duty again i ask what has deiniol and my kinship to him to do with anything discussed here then would you mind explaining your loyalty to someone who is proven without doubt to be a supporter of the hogwarts four and one of their inner circle ambrosius leaned in with interest wanting to see how billius would try to weasel his way out of llyr accusation he noticed others doing the same thing breathlessly waiting for billius reply sadly enough the second house lord did not seem too impressed whether he is my kin or not i have no control over him deiniol is his own man and as i have said i have not seen him in a long while i do not know how he fared since the knights of the phoenix went their separate ways and i do not see how i can be held accountable to whatever he had chosen to do with himself your petty accusations mean nothing to me llyr so why dontyou take your seat and for the time being quench your ambitions to become one of the second house with this dry tones answer billius had successfully managed to fend off any more questions but ambrosius was not happy he had seen what none of the others had that small glance between billius and gaius as llyr settled bitterly back in his seat as he had been told and it had told him that billius had known all along of sir deiniol involvement with the hogwarts four it was disconcerting and something needed to be done more inquiries to be made gregory had been found my lord said cane with dread in his eyes and a tremble in his voice oh ambrosius said not looking up from the report in his hands he enjoyed making cane jittery and marcus gregory disappearance did not bother him much the man was his best killer and he had utmost trust in his abilities to eliminate the troublesome four if he needed to disappear in order to get them then ambrosius was not worried in a stable at a seedy tavern north of here cane finished ambrosius frowned and finally looked up to scrutinize the manservant with narrowed eyes what was he doing in that stable exactly please tell me he was not messing with one of the prisoners i asked him to bring in i did tell him i needed them all intact at least for the time being he cane faltered he was stunned tied and gagged and well it isntpleasant my lord what the owner of the tavern found him stuffed in the corner he said he heard horses coming late at night they stopped for a while and then went on when he went to feed his horse the next morning he found gregory there said he smelled like manure did you get him to talk we re bringing him over right now you will be able to question him yourself he was still unconscious last time i received the report minutes later two bulky menservants entered ambrosius chambers carrying between them a lump that was only vaguely recognized as human much less as marcus gregory the knight monster it looked as though someone had gone through a whole tome of hexes jinxes and curses maybe even two to create this mess that barely resembled the proud man gregory once was a collection of boils extra limbs fungi growing in objectionable places and many other repulsive questionable marks covered the man he seemed to be cut in several places bruised and otherwise maimed there was no way telling what kind of internal injuries have been added to the external mess but the chief warlock could imagine he had a very active imagination where it concerned bodily harm someone did a very thorough job on his best killer he just woke up my lord one of the menservants rumbled as they put the man down on the floor where he collapsed into a hip trembling lightly sir gregory ambrosius said after getting up prodding the figure on the ground with the toe of his slipper what he presumed to be a face looked up at him little cracks opening in the puffed skin sir gregory where are my prisoners he hissed leaning close enough to smell the rank sweat and stink of human wastes covering the man body and clothes where are gryffindor and slytherin ravenclaw hufflepuff where are they the lump on the ground gave out a small whimper and the cracks tightly shut themselves the man curling into a ball as well as he could ambrosius gritted his teeth the memory still the most sour of recent years next to him a goblet of wine delicately made of the finest glass blew into shreds gregory never did come back to himself whatever it was those pests of the north did to him it made him a paranoid and a coward he kept to his house living out of the yearly allowance ambrosius had promised him before he set out on his last mission their presence haunted him he could not pass a day without hearing about another loyal supporter going down eliminated by their supporters or another group of magic families announcing openly their full support of hogwarts and the rumours mistress ravenclaw could pluck thoughts out of a man head miles off lord slytherin could make men disappear in a flash of light never to be seen again mistress hufflepuff could fell solidly built houses on the heads of men who had angered her lord gryffindor could chop a man in half without even swinging his sword even more fantastic rumours traveled around each growing bigger and crazier with each telling from mouth to ear rumours were normally so and usually died out after a short while but these only seemed to grow wilder and wilder they had the powers of gods and deities some said their eyes bright with wonder others said they were invincible or invisible looking about them and speaking in a hushed voice they could fly without a broom according to some and those same people also claimed that they could be in two places at once which was preposterous of course but tell that to country idiots even magic could not make that possible ambrosius alliance was falling to pieces all around him its shards slipping through his fingers unchecked in the council the section that quietly supported lords gaius and billius in their opposing to his plans grew stronger with each passing day none of them would openly say anything like those two but the shifty glances that did not quite meet his eyes said enough they thought he was losing his grip he had to do something and do it soon or he would lose his grip on the council and with that his grip on the wizarding world my lord his personal manservant voice interrupted his dark musings what is it edwin ambrosius asked tiredly his eyes trained on the map spread on the table in front of him showing the estimated locations of all rebel bands and the various hogwarts connections each day added more marks on that too small piece of parchment i have a letter here from lord gaius personal manservant for you he said his master says it is urgent and should be delivered to you posthaste edwin replied holding out a carefully folded parchment with gaius horned owl crest on it i came as soon as i got it very well let see what that leprous imbecile wants this time i am tired of him and his proposals his manservant handed him the letter with a reverent bow and retreated a few steps back taking his customary place by the door ambrosius slit the seal open with the tip of his wand and started reading disinterestedly however as he took in what the words within spelled his face grew redder and blotchier his eyes narrowing dangerously what later it would be said that when lord ambrosius of york had heard of lords gaius and billius defection to the side of the hogwarts band his cry of fury could have been heard all the way to london his tantrum of rage would become famous in the high society a lesson to be learned a few minutes later found edwin cowering in fear as ambrosius paced back and forth in his extravagant sitting room the crumpled parchment of lord gaius succinct message sizzling merrily into nothing in the roaring fire there was no telling what was more dangerously fiery the man or the flames how dare he how dare he turn against me i who had gotten rid of those meddlesome slytherin and gryffindor lines i who have brought the council more success than all the chief warlocks before me he should be groveling at my feet and billius that scabby weasel i should have known he was a no good lout the moment i learned of his relative involvement with those four nuisances another roar of rage escaped the chief warlock throat making edwin jump yet again how could this have happened at the worst of times at that he was already losing supporters in the council rapidly and now that those renegade lords had done their deed who was to say what would be left of that meager support he needed to act quickly and the worst thing about it was that he no longer had time to think his actions needed to be decisive and they needed to be complete at that very moment chief warlock ambrosius made his decision turning his anger contorted face to his cringing manservant he bellowed summon the lords of the council tell them that those who would not come shall suffer the consequences as soon as ambrosius thundered into the chamber he was surrounded by worried lords who all shot questions at him made too anxious by the rumours going around to take consideration of his foul mood is it true that hogwarts has declared war where is billius he hasntbeen seen in two days what shall we do are gryffindor and slytherin invading why isntlord gaius here will we be in danger where is billius should we call for truce what is going on why the urgent summons my lord what happened to billius silence he roared finally too angry and too agitated to show any patience or manners sit down and be silent if not i shall gag you all alarmed the lords of the council settled in their places quietly their eyes wide open all wondering why they were missing two of their number they watched as ambrosius paced back and forth in front of them his face a thunderstorm his eyes practically shooting lightning not an hour ago i had gotten a letter from gaius a letter the filthy coward had not had enough courage to face me while he informed me of his treachery yes my lords of the council treachery it is my unhappy duty to tell you all that as of this evening two of our number have left us for good they are as good as dead to us now and if any of you is to see them you are charged with the sacred duty of eradicating them and all those in their company gaius and billius have betrayed us they have decided to side with the hogwarts filth and therefore their fate is to be the same as those of the four as shall be that of any of you who decide on following their dastardly deed i shall wreak vengeance upon you and it shall be worse than any you could have imagined you shall be tainted with the same brush as that of gryffindor slytherin ravenclaw and hufflepuff you shall lose everything starting with your land and families and finishing with your lives do not test me the lords of the council all stared at their leader with horror written on their faces none of them had ever thought ambrosius wrath would turn on them and seeing what would be gaius and billius fate they did not want to follow at long last ambrosius stopped his pacing and stood at the exact center of the chamber his smoldering eyes trained on them all lords this morning was the point of no return you can thank gaius for that this is an act of war and we shall respond to it as we shall respond to every threat he and his friend billius have forced my hand our plans are to be set into action there is no more time to waste the lords exchanged glances worried anxious glances they all thought the same the timing was wrong they were not even near to being prepared for that final step the warrior recruits could barely hold a straight line not to speak of fending off an attack of some of the most vicious warriors out there none of them dared open his mouth and protest none that is but lord severn who appeared to be the most outraged of them all and for good reason if the warriors in training would fail to win ambrosius his ambitions he as the commander of that operation would be the one to be punished lord ambrosius surely you do not mean to go openly against them now of all times severn protested from his seat it is the dead of winter and we did not yet have time to study the lay of the land and what we might encounter on our way there our plans are not yet ready our people not well trained enough in my opinion this is a foolhardy decision and i think you should reconsider it the entire council including severn realized that this was the wrong thing to say at that exact time just as soon as the words had left the first house lord mouth ambrosius face darkened and turned a murky shade of red in an alarmingly short time his eyes narrowing and his mouth thinning so much that his lips were almost not to be seen i dont care what you think severn he roared at the surprised lord the next one to open his mouth would spend an eternity wondering where he did wrong i ll have silence i ll have obedience do you understand me do you follow my meaning now i will have them dead and buried their names wiped off history no one will ever know such people had ever existed their legacy shall be destroyed their homes put to the torch and their lines broken should any of them beg for mercy they shall be cut down even more cruelly than the others we shall give no mercy they shall be killed all of them men women children all of them all those who would oppose me shall die in ten days he snarled at the cowering lords of the council we are setting out for war ah edwin ambrosius called delightedly as his manservant entered the room on the dawn of the preordained day the chief warlock was contemplating which of his robes he should wear for the momentous occasion that would begin in only a few hours he had been up ever since three hours past midnight trying to plan his appearance ahead wishing to look at his most impressive for that day already awake my lord edwin said in mild surprise i do believe you have asked to be woken only at dawn ah i have changed my mind ambrosius replied with a small smirk edwin my good man i have a job for you i need you to pack clothes for me and all my potions and magic tomes as well also i would need a good horse with the proper attire to carry a man of my status and for you to make sure that my tent would be packed and put atop the rest of the gear do you understand my lord you cannot possibly mean to go there yourself edwin cried out uncharacteristically his thin face the very mask of horror the community needs you you can not put yourself at such risk oh my dear edwin ambrosius smiled mirthlessly putting on his most elaborate of robes and smoothing its front almost absent mindedly your care for me is commendable but this one thing i cannot leave to my underlings to do you have seen through the past few years how they have failed me again and again this shall not recur here i will crush the hogwarts four and i will be there to witness their grimy end no matter what this has gone too long edwin and i intend to be there at the finish now go and see to that that they prepare my horse properly and then get to packing i have utmost confidence in your abilities and i expect you to be ready yourself in two hours you are coming with me if edwin did not like the sound of this plan he did not show it his face resumed their practiced mild indifference yes my lord his manservant said with a curt bow and retreated out of the room leaving ambrosius to primp himself alone in his chamber this would be a great day to lord ambrosius this day was the first real step in his plan to wipe out the hogwarts four and by merlin he was going to destroy everything associated with that crowd two hours past dawn the chief warlock of the council stepped out of the formal entrance to the stonehenge his richly gold stitched black robe easily the most wondrous garment there his deep red cloak billowing in the wild wind his hair trimmed and his expression cold he surveyed the forces massed before him and a thin smile graced his lips this had to be the greatest power ever amassed in the history of the wizarding world hundreds if not thousands of people all geared up for war stood in front of him in straight lines true every now and then the lines were crooked and quite a few of his wonderful warriors belched scratched their behinds or yawned in his face but either way they were a formidable force armed and ready prepared in both muggle warfare and magic hogwarts and its supporters had no chance they would be crushed my people he cried out his voice magnified so they could all hear this day shall appear in the pages of history as the day that marked the downfall of the people who had marred the perfect harmony of the magic community of the british isles you will all be part of that downfall your names recorded in that great book of heroes ready to sacrifice their all on the altar of all that is good today we march to eradicate their presumptions today we march to correct that which is wrong today we make men out of boys today my friends we march out for war there were half hearted cries of praise coming from his army most coming from the members of the chamber guard implanted in the rows ambrosius ignored this lack of enthusiasm knowing that those who did not call out would do as he commanded anyway knowing the repercussions of refusing to follow orders he had no doubt anymore though he would never admit to ever having any he would win he would prevail they marched a forced march for days the commanders of the army under ambrosius orders did not allow more rest than absolutely necessary had this been a muggle army many would have been lost to exhaustion and broken limbs as this was not so however they were merely sent to the healers and then mercilessly brought back to their war bands only few were lost and then finally one evening almost without warning they were there that night ambrosius had allowed the opening of many wine kegs and ale barrels tomorrow they would go and fight tomorrow his victory would come the castle of hogwarts loomed in the hazy distance perched like an overgrown vulture at the top of a cliff overlooking the steely lake dawn was slowly coming and all ambrosius feverish mind could come up with was that hogwarts would not wake up to see another day this was the day where all would come to an end with ambrosius as victor when sun dawned again he swore hogwarts would be in ruins a n ta dah end of chapter 20 which means 10 more chapters to go two thirds of the story are over and done with and so we discover what had happened to marcus gregory after all this time the exact hexes and curses used

rowling creator of the worlds of harry potter a n heh well umm err well i didntreally mean to have two godric chapters in such close proximity to each other but that the way it happened this is what happens when you write bits of a chapter before you have an actual idea of the order the chapters are going to be oops i hope none of you feel sick of reading from godric pov it the best pov to right this chapter from anyway but if it makes you feel any better the next and last godric chapter is a long way away wheeeeeeeeeee squeals did any of you notice the fact that the ff added the founders to their list of characters i ve been waiting for that to happen for ages isntthat wonderful so now i have changed the settings of this story so they can be found under rowena r and godric g i know it a bit of a letdown to those who would rather see helga or salazar but that what happens when there are only two characters available and this is the main ship warning there a little bit of violence and blood in this chapter nothing too graphic but if you re squeamish just know that it there enjoy chapter 21 protect that which you hold dear in the records of times past there was never any mention of an attack taking place on hogwarts grounds this is presumably due to the immensely complex defences built around it from the day it was built constantly being remodeled and improved throughout the ages the question we as modern scholars must ask is has there never been an attempt to breach those massive defences records of the time of the beginning of hogwarts are very much muddled and unclear the story of the founders as we know it has been assembled after years of hard work picking through what little material was left from the tenth century records and embroidering it into the more or less complete story of their lives therefore we are not sure of whether or not there was an attempt of breaking into hogwarts in their time we know for a fact that the chief warlock ambrosius of york had wanted the four wiped out but did he actually manage even one attempt that is yet to be revealed hogwarts a history author unknown the four friends stood at the entrance hall quietly conversing ryan was toddling on the floor at a safe distance from his parents and ceri was sitting right next to rowena feet babbling happily to herself waving a piece of cloth about the front doors were flung wide open and the entire young population of the castle was happily enjoying the once again fine weather playing out on the grounds this was the topic of their discussion what should they do with the children when ambrosius would arrive it was too late to send them back to their homes the army on the way would jeopardize them for ambrosius might kill them to teach the four a twisted lesson of sorts they did not want them to stay at the castle for if they would lose ambrosius would surely slaughter the lot of them the village they surmised was their only real choice we should send them tonight helga said her expression worried the children were always her first priority in every discussion we cannot delay much longer ambrosius is almost here helga right of course salazar agreed smiling at her reassuringly two of us should accompany them to the village tonight and distribute them between the willing families someone should go ahead and call for a village meeting at the tavern so we can have it done efficiently and quickly the castle should be emptied tonight i will go before the children godric volunteered i need to have a word with my mother anyway so it would take care of two issues at once i will take them to the village then salazar said immediately after him only a fraction of a second before rowena demanded to know what exactly he was going to discuss with his mother godric did not meet his wife eyes at first he did not want to hurt her but he knew that she still did not realize what must be done while she would willingly part with the students in order to protect them her first instinct was to keep her own children as near her as possible to protect them herself he himself felt the same desire but he knew that there was no other choice i want her to take care of ryan and ceri for us while we are fighting ambrosius rowena lips pursed and he could see an argument coming however at that precise moment they all saw a figure racing up the front steps and towards them the man who slid into a huffing halt in front of them barely missing hitting them with full force after veering off course to avoid stumbling over ryan was ilar who had been acting delivery boy between castle and village for the past few weeks ilar rowena asked seemingly forgetting her intended reply to godric idea what is it he coming he said breathless with the effort of running all the way from the village ambrosius is coming ignoring rowena renewed protests that had started almost as soon as she had processed the news godric left for the village immediately after ilar dramatic entry telling salazar he would meet him back at hogwarts at sundown and asked that the children would be ready to depart at that time they all knew the cover of dark was best for them if ambrosius had sent scouts ahead if the scouts would notice a large group of children meandering through the distance that separated hogwarts from the loch it was quite possible that whatever attack the chief warlock had planned would be canceled and moved to that precise moment they could not risk their students being harmed taking his horse who in recent years saw less and less action old as he was godric arrived at the village quickly as he dismounted he gave griffith a sympathetic rub sadly knowing that it was probably time to find himself a new horse not that he really needed one these days tethering the horse outside sir rhys house he went to find his mother it was not hard to guess where he would find her as usual ceridwen gryffindor was at the very center of what was happening the spacious kitchen of sir rhys house was packed full of concerned villagers pacing knights and groups of messengers who had arrived from various potential allies and at the very center of the room was his mother talking loudly over the din assuring everyone that the hogwarts four would soon enough send word due to the noise and the mass of people it was unsurprising that no one had noticed godric come in it was only when he surreptitiously tapped his mother shoulder that his presence was noted godric she called in relief causing the whole room to grow silent everyone present breathlessly awaiting to hear whatever he had to say so good of you to come where are the others not now mother he said softly i need to speak with you alone before i address anyone else where can we speak in private frowning at his secrecy ceridwen led him out of the kitchen and to her own quarters the rooms his mother lived in were so obviously hers that he almost laughed nostalgically nothing had changed in all the years that had passed since their very first home they were still tidy to a fault almost compulsively so the furniture was placed exactly as it had been in all her previous dwellings and all her personal artefacts were placed with such precision that he felt the impulse to move them just a bit to see if she would put it back at the same angle as before motioning him to take one of the straight backed chairs next to the small fireplace she took the other and sat primly waiting for whatever he had to say knowing his mother all too well he cut straight to the point we need you to continue the resistance in case we fail he said shortly not trying to hide anything that would require you to stay here and not join in the fighting not a chance she said calmly it not negotiable mother you are the only possible choice you are the only one to whom everyone would listen the knights respect you for being lady gryffindor the nobles respect you for being lady gryffindor the rebel bands respect you for your subversive acts against ambrosius and the council throughout the years and anyone else will take orders from you because all the aforementioned groups would there is no one else who can shoulder the burden if you are gone at the same time as us we dontknow if we re going to survive this and while we hope to end it quickly and cleanly with ambrosius being the only one hurt the likelihood of that happening is almost nonexistent you have to be here so that our mission will not fail i have to be out there with you you need me godric i am one of the most powerful witches of my generation you cannot just discard me like this she said calmly though her eyes narrowed i am not discarding you mother and neither do the others we are trying to preserve you to leave one who is capable of leading on if we fall we will not allow you to go with us we will deal with ambrosius on our own this time you have to stay at the sidelines unless something catastrophic happens and ambrosius will continue to the loch from hogwarts you dontknow what you re saying godric you put yourselves at too much risk i have to be there i told you i not here to negotiate you are staying at the back i not going to sit in the village while ambrosius attacks you she cried her normally composed face a livid contorted mask she completely ignored his rational explanations for she could not counter them retreating into emotional responses mother we need someone to continue the fight if we fail he said again his tone more pleading that he had intended and the village is currently the only safe place in miles also we need you to protect ryan and little ceri let dahlia do it she not nearly powerful enough and you know it he said coolly unimpressed as i have said aside of your impressive magical powers you are an upstanding member of the community respected by all if ambrosius tries attacking a woman such as you and two babes not yet two years old it will be the end of his status in the wizarding community he will be as good as dead either way he is doomed you must see it her expression of anger crumbled leaving a tired sad woman behind i see it very well godric you are going into the fray head first as you have done since childhood and like in childhood you dontwant your doting old mother holding your hand you are right of course i am not fit to go into battle anymore than you are fit to play in the political arena i shall remain as always the one to unite everyone in case you fail he was now startled he was not sure how to take his mother suddenly submissive behaviour and wondered if he had somehow gone too far then however a spark returned to her eyes and she tilted her head sideways looking at him sharply however she said slowly and clearly if i do stay behind it means that i am left to my own volition if i see that you are in trouble do not expect me to remain here i am my own woman and i keep my own council so do make sure to end it as cleanly as you plan to dontmake me come out there again to separate you from the overgrown bullies you have chosen to go against you know how much i hate doing that you cantpunish me like you did when i was a child he said defensively do you want to test this presumption of yours she asked with a pleasant smile err no he mumbled in his mind reduced to being a seven year old once more by the mere tone of her voice i suppose i don t fine mother you have yourself a deal now i going back to the castle could you please circulate a request that all the people of the village assemble shortly after sundown at calanthe s we are bringing the students to the village and ask them to be housed with families from the village for the duration of the fighting we will address them personally when they assemble but i want it known that we need hosts for the children also could you ask the knights and all other members of our council and the messengers from the various allies to come to hogwarts immediately we had better start putting things into motion very well my boy she said smiling now that she won some ground back now run along and play grimacing he did as he was told vowing that rowena would never hear of that conversation as though he needed to give her more blackmail material by the time he was back in the castle the other three had all children assembled in the entrance hall carefully bundled in their warm clothes and carrying tightly packed bags with all necessities the atmosphere in the hall was heavy the children were pale and several of the younger ones were reduced to tears everyone was worried though their teachers kept the reality of the upcoming fighting away from as best they could they could not help but hear rumours and whispers whether from their village dwelling peers who heard things from their parents or from the occasional student who had managed eavesdropping on the councils taking place late at night in the council hall there was not one child standing wide eyed at the four that did not know what was going on rowena was holding ceri in her arms and salazar was keeping a tight hold over ryan helga moved among the students comforting where she could whispering words of reassurance and encouragement children rowena voice rang over the din please be silent as usual all children immediately silenced at her request the only sound in the hall was the occasional sniff from a distressed child all looked at their teachers waiting to hear what is to happen now children she continued in a clear voice you are going to be taking a short journey tonight a short walk to the village i know you are all aware of the fact that these are dangerous times and i know you are all afraid i will not say that there is nothing to be afraid of for the world is full of dangers unknown while you are out there on your way to the village you are to listen to everything headmasters gryffindor and slytherin say this is not a lesson and in order to keep you all safe you must all obey every order without question i know we can trust you all to behave at your best when our business here is done you will all be returned to the school safely and lessons will commence as usual in the meanwhile you are to be guests of families in the village behave or face the consequences a student who will not behave and cause trouble to their hosting family will be sent home when this business is over and their return to hogwarts will not be promised are we clear a low murmur of yes headmistress rumbled in the hall good she said with a warm smile salazar godric all yours be careful will you godric gave his wife a reassuring smile and then raised his voice all right children let get going shall we follow me and so with godric at the front and salazar at the back the students of hogwarts left for the village under orders to be silent they were all put into pairs and numbered each student told that if their partner would disappear from their sight they must inform either one of their heads the journey in the dark was not easy because they did not dare light their wands therefore having to count on their night vision and the wane light of the sickle moon though the children made no conscious sound there were many low whimpers and still the occasional sniffle he did not blame them many were still at the age children tended to be afraid of the dark they never bargained for nightly trips when they arrived at the school it was a frigid night and he felt his fingers stiffening over the hilt of his sword he dared not lose alertness for they did not know if ambrosius had sent scouts this far he thanked all forces involved that there was no wind that night no wind meant that he could hear anyone coming near them and that should give them all the warning they needed he could practically hear the collective sigh of relief as the lights of the village appeared on the horizon the brightest one appearing to be the tavern where the people of the village gathered he found himself stifling a sigh of himself releasing a breath he did not realize he was holding in the first place he had not been so on edge in a very long time stumbling over loose pebbles and overgrown vegetation in their hurry to enter the warm circle of light surrounding the tavern the group arrived at the village pale rosy cheeked children finally allowed themselves to smile again some of them even dared whispering excitedly to their friends about what a great adventure it had been as far as the children were concerned the danger was over godric smiled wistfully as he watched salazar counting the children before they entered the tavern how much these children did not know they were so lucky not knowing that the worst was still ahead for them this was a passing fear nothing to really worry about their elders will make it all better soon enough he only wished it were true satisfied that no child had been lost in the dark salazar nodded at godric and the two led their students into the tavern where most of the villagers had gathered peering anxiously at the new arrivals friends salazar called to have their attention we thank you for coming here tonight as all of you know the forces of lord ambrosius are nearing hogwarts and are expected to reach us in the next week or so we do not want to risk any of you we do not ask you to join us in our fight we have only one request take care of our children while we cannot they are only a few two dozen or so we ask you to take care of them take them into your homes for the duration of whatever will come to pass when ambrosius arrives here this is all we ask who of you will agree to do as we request slowly one by one men prodded by their wives raised their hands it took a surprisingly short time to find lodgings for all the students after all children were taken away to their temporary hosts godric and salazar answered questions of anxious villagers there were a lot of those people wanted to know when exactly he was coming where he was expected to launch his attack they asked if the four had all they needed to withstand siege if such a thing would happen and if they had all the resources needed to battle with such a huge force as the coming army was rumoured to be some timidly asked if there was anything they could do to help and others blatantly asked when and where they needed to be by the end of the gathering godric felt drained and tired he and salazar trudged in the dark back to hogwarts accompanied by a few knights that had waited for them all other warriors were already in the castle ordered there earlier by ceridwen both men wanted nothing better than to go to bed but this was not to be there were sleeping arrangements to be made now that all the warriors who had camped outside the loch all this while ever since they had sent word that ambrosius had declared war on hogwarts were at the castle those men had arrived swiftly after receiving the summons and with each group that had arrived godric and his companions had felt slightly better plans needed to be set in motion finalized agreed on checking the weapons and armours were all in order making sure everyone was healthy and prepared to do battle by the time godric staggered into bed it was almost dawn he slept soundly that night the moment he woke the next day there were even more things to be done scouts were sent out to search for the forces promised by gaius and billius from which they had heard nothing ever since they had sent the summons others were ordered to keep an eye on ambrosius army make sure to warn them if they appeared to be moving faster than expected godric and salazar ordered by rowena to keep an eye on ryan and ceri spent the day discussing tactics with the leaders of the various groups congregated leaning over maps and bits of parchment scribbled with arrows dots and circles as for rowena and helga accompanied by several of the more powerful knights they spent that entire week fortifying the defences of hogwarts weaving newer more powerful spells into the extended apparition shield they did not tell the men precisely what they had added but from their shifty glances they gathered the spells were on the nastier persuasion those seven days preceding ambrosius arrival could not have been more intense and surely could not have gone any swifter godric could practically feel time running out and then almost sooner than any of them felt it right the scouts had returned there was still no sign of billius and gaius but there was no doubt about the other matter ambrosius was at the gates of hogwarts the air around the castle of hogwarts had never been this somber this deadly and cold no laughter of children was heard no chanting of another charm learned nor the sound of wooden swords clanging against one another complete silence encased the huge building and its grounds the sloping lawns that reached down to the very shore of the lake were empty no children graced its grasses playing and enjoying the afternoon sun they were empty of all but four figures the four founders of hogwarts stood on the front steps of their home and watched the slowly setting sun each wondering whether they would see it setting the next day ambrosius was coming and there was nothing they could do to stop him the armies of the council camped outside the castle borders that night inside hogwarts men in armour and without walked in groups somberly discussing the upcoming battle the council hall was filled with the people who had slowly continued filtering into castle over the past week groups of those who called themselves rebels that managed to infiltrate the blocks set by the coming army of the council choice warrior bands from various lords and ladies who had decided to show their support all knights of the phoenix who were still able bodied and prepared to fight people of the village who would not leave the teachers of their children alone in their time of need the hogwarts four walked among them thanked the newcomers greeted people they knew from before exchanged words with random warriors there was not much to be done the defences were set orders been given all they had to do now was to be ready for ambrosius the next day at some point godric noted that salazar and helga had disappeared he had no doubt where they went and he wanted to do the same this may be his last chance in a while to be alone with his wife and he wanted to use that time to the fullest catching her eye he nodded at the doors to the entrance hall he watched her as she excused herself from the current group she was speaking with and strode purposefully towards him no words were needed as he took her hand and led her away she wanted to be alone with him as much as he wanted to be with her silently they walked up flights of stairs until they reached their destination the most secluded part of the castle where they could be sure no one will intrude where are the children he asked her softly as they leaned on the battlements atop the tallest tower watching the winking lights of dozens of campfires being lit as night darkened and grew colder it would have been a beautiful sight had he not known its potential lethality he knew very well where the children were supposed to be but he did not know if rowena had been true to her word and had taken them down to the village as she had promised he had spent most of the afternoon discussing tactics with the more experienced members of their makeshift council as did salazar and helga but rowena had excused herself early in order to spend a little more time with their children only returning somewhat later and resuming her duties safe in the village with your mother and dahlia as i have promised she replied just as softly there was a strange choked note in her voice that caught his attention a note that did not belong there turning to look at her he noticed that in truth she was gazing far beyond the camps and into the distance her eyes watery but no tears escaping her tight control it was then that he came face to face with the possibility that he might not see his children again the odds were against them and if the reinforcements promised by gaius billius and several others would not arrive the next morning before ambrosius has the chance to launch an attack a sick feeling settled in his stomach but no this had to be resolved or young ryan and little ceri would live under the shadow of threat for the rest of their lives if the price for a safe future for his two children would be his life then he would gladly give it no questions asked no regrets feeling somewhat reassured in his conviction he wrapped his arm around rowena the babies would be all right no matter what wena you know that mother wouldntlet anything happen to them and ambrosius knows that attacking the only all magic village in britain is sheer folly whatever may happen to us rest assured that ryan and ceridwen will grow up to be fine people he pretended not to hear the sniffing sound coming from her direction and just held her more firmly he knew how hard it was to her as he felt the same way but they had to be strong and go through with it he did not know how long they had stood there just watching silently each thinking their own private thoughts let get to bed rowena he said after a while we are going to have a long day tomorrow and a few hours of sleep is what all of us need without another word they left the tower slowly making their way to their quarters comforted by each other presence drawing courage from one another there would be time to be afraid they both knew and time to face death and defeat but for the time being they allowed all thought of it go away and simply enjoyed the company of the other who knew if they would ever get the chance to do that again morning dawned cold and grey the early morning mists hung from the hills of the countryside surrounding the lake obscuring godric vision as he stood at the doors of the entrance hall they would move out soon enough and the tension that had culminated since the day before would come into an abrupt outburst on the field he only half listened to helga voice ringing in the silent hall behind him too occupied at staring outside he knew that rowena and salazar standing by his side were most likely not listening either remember helga repeated once more talking to the somber group filling the entrance hall stun only offensive spells are only to be directed at members of the council and members of the chamber guard they are the real enemy not the men that were drafted against their will by ambrosius drafting order take as many of those out as you can just so that it is easier to handle those that really need handling i repeat stun only helga more than the rest of them was most conscious about the fact that hurting the drafted men would serve no purpose and realizing she right they allowed her to emphasize that idea to those who would be fighting on the hills outside hogwarts territory where they had intended it to be though possibly allow was not the right word godric thought wryly the normally diffident helga would probably have fought nail and tooth were they to try and stop her there was an assenting murmur from the gathered men which made helga smile slightly before returning to where the other three were quietly standing no words were needed between the four it was time helga and rowena were the only women in this small improvised force some of the knights and quite a few members of the small resistance groups had commented on that trying to convince the four that it was a bad idea to have a woman on the field that they would end up having to save them since they could not possibly defend themselves the two women had only exchanged frosty glances and coldly challenged anyone who would dare question their right to fight to a wizard duel no one had answered their challenge calling for the men attention they strode out of the front doors of the castle and started the journey to the pillars it had long since been decided that they would not allow one enemy foot step within the borders of hogwarts they would be stopped before the winged boars or not stopped at all no words were exchanged during the march all sound was muted by the morning mists to godric who happened to look back as they marched it looked as though they had a legion of ghosts behind them he could barely discern the creak of armour or laboured breath to all purposes they were silent as death almost as though no time had passed he could see the massive pillars that marked the edge of their territory looming ahead in the early morning gloom there was something eerie and uncanny about everything he could not believe that they were really about to end it for once and for all he could barely remember the time before ambrosius had taken steps against them they were always afraid that his denunciation would lead to an open confrontation and here they were at the culmination of it all about to face him on a battlefield with as little speaking as they could possibly manage the orders went through the ranks and soon the small force took position a short distance away from the pillars using the naturally hilly countryside as a barricade for a while at least they would have the advantage of higher ground then they had to wait it did not take too long it seemed as though the commanders of the council forces wanted this to end quickly just as much as the hogwarts four had wanted out of the dissipating mist the first figures appeared taking their places atop the next rise in the terrain i did not really believe that he would come himself salazar said as they watched the oncoming mass at the very front on a big stallion was ambrosius a staff in his hand shouting something indecipherable at his forces i thought he would rather stay safe back at stonehenge and gleefully wait for news of our defeat so pessimistic salazar helga chided squeezing his hand think of it as pointing at ambrosius uncertainness of who will win this fight in his own private thoughts godric found himself wondering why he had not thought of that himself ambrosius appearance on the battlefield could very well mean that the chief warlock distrusted all of his underlings and that their previous failing to stop godric and his friends had given him something to think about for all they knew ambrosius could be just as apprehensive of the upcoming battle as they were he could not blame him watching the men gathered a short distance away they were not warriors they were farmers artisans simple men who had done nothing wrong apart of being at the wrong place in the wrong time even from that distance he could see the fear in their eyes or so he fashioned while outnumbering the hogwarts defenders greatly they were still facing practiced warriors who knew what they were doing men ready to die for the cause however he could shake away the fact that the forces promised by gaius and billius had not yet arrived and that there was no sign of them from what their scouts had reported while he did not think that the two would go back on their word he certainly considered it entirely possible that they had encountered trouble on their way either way by earlier reports they were vastly outnumbered and if the two lords would not arrive soon they may be overridden it started almost before anyone could realize what was happening a nervous young man standing at the very front of the council army lost hold of his senses and with a shrill cry shot some sort of curse in the direction of the hogwarts force while it did not hit anyone and he was cuffed violently by the guard of the chamber standing just behind him it was enough to make the inexperienced warriors to think that they were meant to start the attack not hearing the piercing shouts from their commanders a wave of men started down the small rise straight into the range of the hogwarts curses remember helga voice by his side screamed stun only and then chaos started while they no doubt had the advantage of higher ground the wave of ambrosius army was too large and soon engulfed them all shouting curses and sending stunners all around him godric found himself separated from his friends to one side he saw someone in a knight armour fall but he could not recognize the insignia nor had he time to check behind him he could see someone running straight into the grounds line of defence with a blinding flash of light the figure was incinerated he did not want to know how his wife had keyed the curse to work and at that point did not have the time to ponder over it a fire jinx missed him by fractions of a distance singeing the side of his face sending him back almost making a stray stun spell hit him he had no time for the poor men drafted to that army he needed to find and eliminate the threat of the chamber guard it had been decided that several of them would concentrate on those and he was one of them unsheathing his sword he whirled it around daring anyone to get within reach of him he would stun anyone in his way if he needed to but his main aim was to avoid being targeted in the confusion around him he suddenly spotted the dark green of the chamber guard battle gear among the simple clothes of the drafted men it was easily spotted holding his sword in one hand and his wand in the other he carved a path through the warring masses going straight for the unfortunate guard who was in the process of aiming at an oblivious knight the guard only barely noticed him in time he whirled to face godric his own sword in his hand quick as lightening upon recognizing the face in front of him godric found himself grinning wolfishly he almost felt lucky why sir randolf never thought i would see your ugly face again he taunted relishing in the memory of what had happened last time he had met the former knight all healed from your close acquaintance with the ground for quite some time gryffindor the guard shouted over the noise of battle attempting to hit godric with a mighty swipe of his sword which godric parried easily i ve been waiting for the day i would be able to wipe that smug look off your face i was out of commission for months because of that fall good more blows were exchanged around them people were still being hit by curses and stunners people were screaming not too far off though neither of the men knew that salazar quite calmly terminated the threat of lord severn and several knights had cornered lord llyr all bent on making his last moments very unpleasant your side is losing gryffindor randolf now taunted back seeing the men of the hogwarts side dropping around them outnumbered what will you do now still have a few tricks left to play godric grunted with effort the exchanging of blows becoming much more rapid much more confusing the two blades contacted and the guard put all his weight on the hilt pushing at godric oh yes he laughed as he drove godric to his feet with the sheer bulk of his weight such as his laughter was cut short as he stared at a long slim blade that his chest seemed to have sprouted all of a sudden its tip bloody he looked up at godric a confused expression on his face before a gush of blood came out of his mouth spluttering all over godric and his eyes glazed over neatly sliding off the blade sir randolf body revealed the ginger haired billius grinning like a madman at the nonplussed godric such as me the wiry lord of the council asked with a gleeful tone been wanting to do that for ages he confided conversationally in godric as he pulled him back to his feet almost as though they were not in the middle of a bloody battlefield with enemies all around them the man looked none too clean and he had a fresh bruise on his cheek but other than that appeared to be in very high spirits watch out godric cried bypassing the man cursing the guard who was just about to send billius into the arms of death standing back to back with the now fighting lord he shouted over the din where have you been we ve been waiting for you three days ago gaius and i ran into a spot of trouble billius shouted back hexing another poor man away ambrosius had expected us to come to your aid so he had set an ambush several days march away from here we needed to break through that before we could come lost a few men there but nothing too substantial we got here at a very forced march i ll have you know we were just on time i think no question about that after that there was no more time for words the addition of the forces led by billius and gaius tipped the scales their way while still outnumbered they now had more trained warriors on their side and in front of godric wondering eyes quite a few of the drafted men turned on their commanders and unobtrusively started fighting on the hogwarts side what felt like hours later separated from billius he found himself at the very center of the confrontation from the corner of his eye he could see rowena lithe form moving back and forth viciously fighting against two guards he could only imagine what was driving her to this ferocity she was most likely thinking of their children he found himself thinking as he stunned someone out of his way to yet another guard and that in order to see them again she had to dispose of the danger not far off he could see salazar and helga fighting side by side almost matched in their movements defending each other of the surrounding attackers from the corner of his eye he saw them separated as a wave of attackers forced them apart somewhere in the direction of the pillars a great fire had lit itself among the fighters on the field blobs of fire ran screaming and godric realized in alarm that these were men he could only assume that they had tried breaking the defences around the grounds and then then he saw him still on his big horse ambrosius was at the very center of the field shooting curses every which way he did not seem aware of the proximity of all four to him in fact it seemed as though he was certain nothing could hurt him godric itched to prove him wrong he aimed his wand carefully distractedly thinking that he had better disable him and not kill him he did not see the other three doing the same he was not aware of the fact that they all had the same pattern of thought all four hit ambrosius at the same time they had not practiced it and had not meant it to happen they all knew the threat of ambrosius who was a formidable duelist even at his age had to be eliminated one way or another and in the back of his mind godric knew that they would most likely have to kill him soon they could not allow themselves to be compassionate in this matter while ambrosius warriors were merely hit by the stunners or mild curses and hexes to disable them and remove them from the fight the chief warlock and the chamber guard had to be disposed of for good or they would come back to haunt them the simple warriors were drafted by force most of them wanting nothing better than to get as far as possible from hogwarts but the hard core of fighters was there for a purpose he recognized the amplified cutting hex rowena had sent and the blue beam of helga bone breaking curse he was almost certain that the dark orange beam from salazar was a curse meant to cause internal damage and he knew that those three in combination with his own curse intended to blast the man off his horse would cause him substantial harm if not immediate death the four beams hit the man from four different directions the force of the impact throwing him neatly into the air and then in an alarming speed down to the ground at the peak of his rise the light surrounding him created by the four ill matched spells grew so bright as to draw the attention of all combatants on the field for a moment all movement on the hills in front of the pillars of hogwarts ceased all fighting stopped everyone watched as the leader of the forces of the council made his spectacular fall down to the soggy ground and hit it with a sickening crunching sound ignoring everyone around him godric hurried to the side of the fallen ambrosius vaguely aware of the other three arriving almost at the same time he kneeled down beside him and peered into his bloodied face rowena hex had done its job creating so many incisions in the man flesh that it was difficult to see from where the blood issued as he continued to survey the man he could see his legs and arms were in unnatural positions and from several places yellowy pinkish bone protruded through flesh and robes helga curse in addition to the nasty fall was not pleasant ambrosius was still alive though as he weakly coughed blood stained his lips no doubt salazar curse hit him as well godric knew the man had little time left and that they should by all morals and ethics just take him out of his misery but as he watched the man who had haunted them every step of the way sent assassins after them tried to destroy their home and their families was responsible to godric father death and had threatened to kill them so many times in the decade or so they had opposed him he felt no twitch of sympathy towards him in fact he felt that ambrosius was now paying for all his sins against them amazing he said dryly his face very close to that of ambrosius you are human after all the mortally wounded man attempted to spit on him only succeeding in staining his own lips bloody again you shall pay for this he whispered choking how exactly shall we pay you are dead ambrosius and your legacy shall go with you you have no heir no one to mourn you you have no one to love you to cry over your remains in your years as chief warlock you have made nothing but enemies and cowering subordinates you have nothing left and hogwarts has survived no ambrosius cried out his voice hoarse this is not the end of it i shall come back with greater powers and kill you all i shall wipe your lineages i shall kill your children there will be nothing remaining of the four fools who had dared oppose the invincible council of warlocks you his insane rant died out in a racking set of coughs that shook the broken body causing the man to moan in pain the council has defeated itself ambrosius salazar voice said somewhere to the left of godric it has grown bloated and slow over the years and has destroyed itself all that remains is a shell which is more than will remain of you for you are dying and there is no one in this world that will want to cure you you have lost ambrosius struggled to open his eyes a baleful expression in them as he looked at the four surrounding him for a while he fought his dry throat to make a sound when his voice finally came out it came in short gasps and as he spoke the pauses between those gasps grew longer and longer and godric knew that soon enough he would be gone you will never be able to defeat us ambrosius whispered hogwarts will fall one day you can not stop it from happening it shall feed on itself crumbling from within the end is coming for you you will become rotten and malicious just like what you see in the council killing me will not stop it you have wrought your own destruction ambrosius voice died away his wasted face twisting and trembling in his last moments of life and in that last moment on the exhale of his last breath one word could barely be heard though all four leaned very close to hear it rosalind a n hey there what did everyone think about ambrosius little prophetic moment okay so i admit that hogwarts didntexactly fall afterwards though we still dontknow what jkr is about to do thousand years or so later and would not know until book 7 comes out but as we all know what happened with salazar ambrosius last moment of spitefulness was somehow rewarded wasntit now the battle is over and a new phase is entered what shall happen now only i know for the moment muhahahahaha ehm also what did you think about ambrosius last word and now da da da dum da da da dum yes you have guessed right it is reviewers time fizzingwhizbeez thank you very much yep just

you do anything fun for your birthday 404 thank you annukii heh glad you liked it as for your question i suppose that a part of his information is either magnified or not exact some figures too great but all in all hogwarts does have a growing support among the people at least to the idea of opposing the council at this point in time the council is not very much liked these are its last days of glory after that comes the decay and its replacement by what would one day be the ministry of magic what would remain from it essentially in my mind is its judicial job which would be represented in harry days as the wizengamot and the title of chief warlock mmm chocolate chip cookies d my all time favourites thank you very much shadow n the dark heh heh ambrosius rashness brought to his end as you can see he was so angry that he completely lost it and allowed himself to be eliminated oh i know what you mean i read a few good time travel fics but they are very few as you said they tend to be clich d and it just not my style no matter what so how was the turkey frozen bits still lurking at the back of your fridge developing their own lives dan thank you very much nosilla i hope it is

reasons beyond me i nearly could not update today a little behind the scenes for you a part of this chapter was originally supposed to go at the end of chapter 21 but after i read the entirety of the chapter it seemed too anticlimactic to me so i moved it that of course meant that i had to convert all godric pov into rowena pov and i hate doing that once i had to rewrite one of the earlier chapters entirely because i wrote it from the wrong pov p silly me important to those of you who did not know it as of last week ff has decided on a new replying system due to that decision replying

reviews while logged in as members of ff if you are not a member and would still like me to reply your review or questions in your review then please add your e mail to the review so i know it last thing thanks very much to all those who had reviewed and to whom i did not have the opportunity to reply and thank personally thanks for making my days happier ones coming up the life of the founders without ambrosius in the picture warning lots of angst p emotions and little hyperactive children chapter 22 brothers in arms it is a well known fact that in its early years of existence hogwarts did not host many students of muggle lineage while they certainly existed they formed a very small percentage of the overall number of students attending over the first couple of centuries it was only late into the twelfth century or possibly early into the thirteenth that the great muggle boom as some cynical members of the historian community devoting their career to the research of hogwarts have dubbed it had occurred this massive wave of muggle born students came into being with the decree that enabled the headmaster of hogwarts at the time herald berwick to actively search for those muggle children blessed with magic this entire reform however could not have taken place if it were not for the original idea made by at least one of the founders who had decided they should allow the aforementioned children to enter the school as well which one of the three for slytherin certainly is not the one was the one to voice this idea we may never know hogwarts a history author unknown to say that rowena was surprised at that dying man last words would be an understatement surprise did not come near what she was feeling upon hearing her mother name she sat back on her heels and stared at the lifeless body eyes wide eyebrows climbing up on her forehead as she did that in silence allowing the others to fuss over the dead man she contemplated the truth of what godric had said only minutes before amazing you are human after all and in that single word pronounced directly after the expected flaming denunciation ambrosius had proved he was just as human as anyone else in his last moment his thoughts had been trained on one person the only person he had ever loved anger shock and pity all battled for dominance in her how dare this monster of a man say her mother name as though she had been his lover if ambrosius would have survived even a while longer she would have killed him herself this was only her first thought though for soon after she felt a curious wave of remorse while she most certainly despised the man who would have killed her children in a blink of an eye she could not help but wonder he had been human he had loved and he had cherished he had wanted to be loved back like any other human being disgusted at herself and even more disgusted at the dead man in front of her who had ruined with his own two hands any chance he had ever had for happiness she got up and turned her back on him and her friends walking a short distance away from the group she just stood and watched the now unfolding horrors of the battle the drafted men of ambrosius devoid of a leader and their cruel taskmasters wandered off confused expressions on their face everywhere there were people down many bloodied and hacked off she did not know how many of them were dead and how many were just stunned she did not know how many of their men had gone down and how many of the enemy had it did not matter at the moment at the moment she was numb and frozen unable to believe that it was over unable to grasp the fact that their greatest of enemies lay dead behind her she watched as the knights and some of the members of the resistance groups started gathering the confused men of ambrosius others started enervating the stunned ones gently guiding them to where their comrades were being assembled to one side several groups started lining the dead of hogwarts in somber rows while the enemy dead were collected to the other all over the hills there were still pockets of fighters guards who had not been subdued as yet feeling a shudder going up her spine rowena hugged herself her whole body shivering such carnage she had never seen in her life for the first time in her life she felt the urge to retch her heaving stomach rebelling against her tight control warm arms wrapped themselves around her from behind and soon godric was putting his chin on her shoulder whispering soothing words in her ear holding her until she calmed sufficiently there there dear he muttered it all over now no more ambrosius we are free i know but she could not make the words leave her mouth they were lodged in her throat refusing to be said he tightened his hold on her as though not needing words to understand what she was thinking tears slid down her cheeks during the battle she had been all but emotional she had been cold and calculating not allowing one guard of the chamber get past her guard now that it was all over she turned and buried her face in godric chest needing the warm scent of his body and the comforting presence that was her husband in her dazed state it took her a little while to realize that in addition to the smell of sweat she also smelled blood her eyes wide she drew back from him her hands clutching his shoulders godric she cried seeing his torso was drenched in blood where were you hit he tensed frowning at her words not comprehending the question then glancing down at himself relaxed little of this is mine rowena he said with a faint smile as though remembering something not entirely unpleasant i only have minor cuts and abrasions nothing to fuss about but but but all this blood she was too anxious to form a coherent sentence how was he still standing with all this blood out of his body her hands flew to his armoured leather vest attempting to find the straps and remove the garment from him before he bled to death in front of her rowena he called over her panic his dirty bloodied hands grasping her own non too clean ones he leaned down until his face was level with hers wena i swear to you this is not my blood billius had skewered sir randolf when the man attempted taking me down it his blood not mine please calm down her breath coming in great gasps she nodded she needed to get out of that place the smell of blood and the gruesome sights obscured her sense of reason would you would you mind if i left for the village now that ambrosius was gone and his minions hunted down and taken as they spoke and godric was more or less fine her thoughts made a drastic change of direction and honed on her children back at the village godric looked down at her and in his eyes she could see that he wanted nothing more than to come with her smiling he nodded go rowena merlin knows they are probably driving my mother insane take someone with you though all right i ll go with her helga voice came behind them she was limping slightly but otherwise looked to be all right her blond hair was out of its binds and her face very dirty but she was smiling as the two friends accompanied by two knights godric had pulled out of their work and drafted to the two women made their way back in the direction of the loch rowena decided that the first thing she would do after she would make sure her children were all in one piece would be to write a long due letter to her mother and tell her of the demise of the man she had despised more than anyone else as they entered the village the men who had been dispatched to form the last line of defence in case the defenders of the castle fell hailed them and eagerly questioned them concerning the outcome of the battle rowena ignored them all leaving the knights to deal with them with helga at her side she plowed through the crowd of women and children who had heard the commotion and wanted to hear the story as well in a direct unwavering line at the front door of sir rhys house stood dahlia lleulu and ceridwen all anxiously awaiting the news ryan was standing by his grandmother tightly clutching the hem of her dress little ceri was in ceridwen arms watching wide eyed at the gathering in front of her typically the baby was also the first to notice her mother suddenly struggling in ceridwen arms her chubby little arms stretching for rowena her face contorted in an expression that forecasted tears rowena knew that if her daughter would start crying she would break down as well she only barely dammed the tears that tried to escape her losing all sense of dignity she ran to the waiting women and plucked ceri out of her grandmother arms burying her face in her short soft auburn hair murmuring softly to calm to baby now clutching her hair almost painfully mama she felt someone clinging unto her legs ryan before even looking down she bent settling on the damp earth holding tightly unto both her children relief pulsing through her veins it had almost been unbearable to leave them there the day before ceri had screamed for her mother and ryan had clung to her skirts refusing to let go it had taken the combined forces of all women to make the two children stay the children did not care about dirt nor did they care about the blood splotched on their mother clothes all they cared about that they were where they belonged in the background rowena could hear helga reassuring the anxious women that everything was set to right but at the moment she could not have cared less after the battle was done and families reunited there was still much to be done the bodies of the men who had died on the field surprisingly few as they were needed to be collected identified if possible and prepared for burial some were sent to their homes where they would go through the ceremonies of their people wounded needed to be taken care of and the people of the loch and the hogwarts four offered their service to everyone friend and foe alike we cantjust let them rot helga had persisted when a surly looking knight had asked for the reason behind their lenient policy they did not come here of their own desire they dontdeserve to be left to die it was weeks before the school could resume its day to day activity and much longer than that to erase the fear of war from the minds of the children attending hogwarts letters from worried parents who had heard of the conflict in the north arrived without fail almost before the fighting was over they all had to be answered and sent back and while hogwarts began flourishing again more people hearing of the exploits of its founders and liking what they had heard started sending their children there the council had all but crumbled ten of the twenty four lords of the council had died during the battle outside the gates of hogwarts the others those who had not wanted to work openly against billius and gaius but were too afraid to work against ambrosius were still tarred with the same brush as ambrosius and there was almost no one who had heard of the battle who would again listen to any of their orders the only trustworthy people left to lead the magic community were billius and gaius and perhaps a few of the lords who had covertly helped them the four friends at the north however did not concern themselves with it small communities as proved by the people of the loch could govern themselves adequately without the upper rule of the council the council had turned into a burden rather than a necessity to the magic people of britain and they were all better off without them so they felt now that everything was at peace relatively they were bent on working only for their school and so for a few months everything seemed to be peaceful and going according to plan it is the nature of things however to always gravitate into chaos and discord or perhaps it is just the nature of humans the castle of hogwarts and its inhabitants could no more continue in peace than the world could stop turning it was early into the next school year that a letter had arrived by owl to change everything and to turn the serene existence of the four friends into a chaotic whirlpool that would eventually bring unexpected results as they were sitting together in their private antechamber on the ground floor relaxing after a long tiring day helga entered the room holding a roll of parchment tightly in her hand as though afraid it might run away if she loosened her grip you wouldnt believe what we had just received she called surprising them all salazar and godric who were in the middle of a game of chess looked up from the board godric stopping bouncing ryan on his knees rowena who was playing with ceri on the singed hearthrug looked up at her friend questioningly listen to this said helga excitedly brandishing the roll of parchment in her hand as though it was a weapon she then unrolled it and without waiting for response read them the contents to gryffindor slytherin ravenclaw and hufflepuff greetings as you must know my two children nathan and john have been attending your fine school for the past year during that time i have heard nothing but good things about you and the castle of hogwarts and i find myself having to congratulate you all on your way of conduct throughout the years i hope that since you are widely known nowadays as great benefactors to the magic community you will listen carefully to what i have to say and judge it accordingly i have a neighbour a girl of thirteen who has always struck me as a good hardworking young woman with great patience and an insatiable craving to study this morning i have seen her do magic i have no doubt of what i have seen but i do believe she was not aware of what she was doing her parents however seem to be aware that there is something unusual and different about their daughter but to my eyes they appear to be more curious than afraid i believe that the questioning nature of her father who dedicates his time to the research of the influence of herbs on the human body makes him and his wife more open and accepting he has a keen interest in everything that is usually explained by the superstitious as magic and tries to find a logical answer to why things happen cautiously aware that i may have to do something drastic i made inquiries with the parents and they sound ecstatic that their daughter may be special in some way my lords and ladies may i be so bold as to ask that the girl be admitted to your school her mother is the maker of fine wools and i do believe they will keep children warm at night hopefully waiting your reply master william cutter looking around at them all her face flushed with delight and unsuppressed excitement she waited for their response it could be a great opportunity godric finally said after digesting what the letter meant after all one of the motives driving us this far was to give a chance to anyone and everyone with magic to come to their full potential i dontsee a problem with bringing this girl here other than convincing her parents not to say a word of it to anyone and mind you this could pose a problem as much as this man thinks they are open minded even open minded men see the narrower view of the world whenever magic is mentioned privately rowena thought that he had a point back in the days when the idea of a school was only a vague plan in their minds their prime objective was to enable children of magic to protect themselves from the council and its negative approach to anyone who was not of use to them at the time they may have not put words to it but they considered the children of muggle blood amongst those who needed teaching indeed they were the ones who needed the most protecting to stop muggles from turning them into firewood i agree she said nodding at helga there are definitely unexplored talents out there that can only be discovered by taking that step and gathering those of muggle blood who can use these talents we may be able to learn a lot from observing such a child as this one maybe even learn something of our own origins i say we allow this girl to come here all three turned to look at salazar who had been very quiet since helga started reading rowena was a little surprised at the reluctant expression on her friend face though being honest with herself it was not all that unexpected salazar had always been more cautious when confronted with anything muggle that the rest of them his original objections to have helga join them all those years ago were centered at her muggle heritage however there was something in his face that she could not quite read and that inability disturbed her i dontknow if it such a good idea the tall man finally said with some difficulty his eyes shifting this way and that not precisely meeting the others what do you mean helga asked with a frown her excitement diminishing a notch she was now surveying salazar with something between hurt and puzzlement and rowena could not blame her she had expected salazar full support on the matter and by all rights she should have had it salazar who started moving uncomfortably under the concentrated scrutinizing from all three of his friends tried to explain muggles are not like us they think differently they have different morals or the lack of them rowena had no doubt to what he was referring by that they have their religion and their beliefs which set us even further apart they dontthink magic should be allowed and therefore they are bound to pass these beliefs to their children be they magic or not those ideas drilled into them from childhood cannot be easily removed maybe even impossible to do so they will bring them here with them and they will pose a threat on our ideals and patterns of thought some might even persevere in their insistence that magic is evil we cannot let that happen now can we what a foolhardy thing to say salazar godric protested this doesntbecome you pose a threat on our ideals and patterns of thought this is a school they re supposed to come here to learn new ideals and patterns of thoughts helga did not say anything but her reproachful eyes were fixed on salazar her hands on her hips in that all too familiar gesture of displeasure to rowena who had often felt the power of that displeasure growing up it seemed as though salazar quite rightly shrank for a moment before straightening and looking slightly more determined i not keen on the influence of muggle bred children is all i saying he defended and rowena wondered how her friend who had always considered every word carefully before uttering it could be so foolish salazar helga cried finally too appalled at his words to remain speechless oh you dontcount helga the unfortunate man dug himself deeper into the mud you re practically wizard raised to rowena her mouth trying to open and say something to stop what would inevitably come it seemed like the air in the chamber had grown considerably colder and she could see helga quietly steaming in her anger even maureen the snake seemed to realize that her master and friend had said something incredibly wrong for she made one of her rare appearances out of salazar sleeve and hissed something at her master who seemed mortified at whatever she had said in the meanwhile helga seemed to reach a conclusion if you dontmind she said primly getting up from her chair her face cold i would now retire to my quarters for the night i seem to have become suddenly tired ignoring salazar who half rose from his chair with protest on his lips and godric who started with an objecting helga the golden haired woman swept out of the room her anger at salazar apparent to everyone the man in question stared after her with his mouth slightly open he looked as though he had never seen anything more shocking in his life were it not for the situation being so grave rowena would have considered her friend expression almost comical she did not allow any of that show on her face her eyebrows knit she looked pointedly at salazar her arms crossed in a show of impatience she was not about to let him hurt helga just like that and not apologize what salazar who had stopped gaping at the closed door demanded finally noticing his irate friend what do you mean what she growled go after her you fool you have hurt her feelings with that flippant remark of yours you are a smart man salazar dontprove me wrong on that account go apologize or i will fry your privates on a low fire and stop you from ever having children she could see the man paling at the threat and beside him godric face was sporting the same painful contortion at the mere idea it appeared to be efficient however because salazar got up from his chair and got out of the room in a quickened pace left alone with her husband and children and certain that salazar would make things right again with helga she turned back to her baby girl and started humming a happy tune she remembered dahlia singing her little boy after he had been born and tickled the child stomach making faces that she would not be caught dead with on any other occasion from the corner of her eye she could see godric glancing at her she knew he wanted to ask something but did not make it apparent to him finally he gulped and asked would you have really done it were he not to go after her she looked up from their baby and rolled her eyes of course not godric she said allowing him to expel a breath he probably did not realize he as holding i would have made his life a living hell for a while however helga is my best friend she is almost like a little sister to me and i would hurt anyone who would dare harm her even if it is salazar and ryan get off that chair godric cantyou help as though realizing that his parents attention was not on him and having been released by godric during the previous happenings young ryan attempted climbing one of the empty chairs in the room as he was not tall enough he had to pull at the rim of the seat and bring his chubby body up this however caused the chair to dangerously slope in his direction unable to just drop ceri and stop the boy she pleaded for godric help oh no dear he said with a grin directed at his firstborn i see you are handling them beautifully by yourself i think i ll go outside for a bit of sword practice before the rain starts again he left the room closing the door just as she let out an exasperated godric and almost as soon as he did there was shrill cry as their boy lost his footing and fell off the aforementioned chair fuming rowena put ceri down and hurried to where her son was bawling his eyes out more for show and pity from his mother than anything else grumbling at the inconsideration of men she calmed the boy down morosely wondering if those children would be the death of her almost as if she had heard her thoughts ceri had chosen that moment to reach a fascinated hand at the flames in the fireplace nooooo rowena almost shrieked leaving ryan and snatching the girl away with a swish of her wand she extinguished the fire cursing their foolishness at not fencing the grate off in a way that would prevent the children from reaching it ceri having her new toy taken away so abruptly started crying as well soon to be joined again by ryan who had decided to copy his little sister although nothing had happened to him yet sometime later relieved that the two had tired she had taken the exhausted children back to their quarters and gently tucked them in making sure they were deeply asleep before casting the charm that would alert her if something was wrong and then returning to the antechamber to wait for godric to return as she waited she plotted ways in which she could get back at him for leaving her alone with two overactive children but as time passed she become sleepier and more inclined to forgive him if he groveled enough that is it took him longer than she had expected to come back and by the time he did she was already on the verge of sleep she only vaguely heard the sound of the opening door and the footsteps that neared her only when he put a hand on her shoulder did rowena smile sleepily as godric leaned over her and kissed her gently the children he asked softly in bed over an hour ago she mumbled struggling to clear the sleepiness from her voice i came back here to wait for you didntknow you would be gone this long well i here now so how about we just proceed to bed you look exhausted and she was exhausted ryan had worn her out entirely that evening and she was dreading the day ceri would learn how to run as if keeping an eye on ryan was not hard enough let go then he said with a smile helping her to her feet i dontfancy carrying you all the way to our quarters if you happen to fall asleep on me and why is that godric gryffindor she asked entering a dangerous overtone to her words he seemed to notice that thick as he was for he grinned at her why because you need to lose some weight dear he said impishly godric she growled he laughed and in his laughter was the carefree note she had missed so sorely in the previous months without warning he put his arms around her and whirled her to face him now now wena he whispered into her ear his breath warm and even you wouldntkill your beloved husband now would you i might consider that she said if you dontlearn not to be this flippant ah but you love me so much as i already am not being flippant would make all the difference in the world now wouldntit it would take my innate charm away flattering yourself are you she uttered with difficulty as he kissed her cheek once twice always his lips touched hers as soon as they did however the two sprang apart at the sound of two voices talking loudly and obviously in the middle of a confrontation they exchanged glances having no difficulty at placing those voices so you mean you never loved me helga voice said flatly making rowena wince you allowed me to delude myself for so long just because you cared for me and didntwant to hurt my feelings great judgment salazar absolutely wonderful helga please it wasntlike that salazar protested and rowena could just imagine the pained expression on his face but helga did not allow him to speak the normally cheerful happy woman was in a very foul mood nine years salazar you allowed me to delude myself for nine years that longer than rowena and godric had been together and they are married and have two children great merlin salazar i honestly thought you were going to ask me to marry you i ve waited this long for you i would have waited more but this goes beyond limits if you dontlove me then there is no point in me waiting anymore now is there you will never ask me to become your wife helga i really do care about you salazar sighed but i dontlove you the way you deserve you are such a sweet loving person and you give me more love than i can ever give you back rowena who knew that to be untrue found herself glancing at her husband for reassurance the look on his face told her that he was wishing he could just jump into the adjacent corridor and shake some sense into his friend she herself felt much the same way though if she was to do it it would be angrily and in an outraged manner how dare he to this to helga he was lying and for what reason salazar did not know what he was saying this had to be a mistake rowena knew how much he loved helga dontgive me that nonsense salazar slytherin helga practically screamed losing all veneer of self control and rowena could only imagine in how much pain the other woman was you should have said so a long time ago instead of allowing me to weave fantasies of our future life together why salazar why did you do this to me you say you care but really you don t helga please i gave this a long deliberation before i said it please i just i just think it would be better off if we remain friends and nothing more it would be for the best rowena could hear the defeated tone in her friend voice and a second glance at godric told her he had heard it as well but apparently neither salazar nor helga noticed it very well helga said coldly we shall remain friends thank you salazar for breaking my heart now before i would have approached you about marriage with that the two eavesdroppers heard her footsteps walk away or rather storm away now they could hear salazar walking in the opposite direction and that soon enough he would see them neither of them moved the expressions on both their faces were shocked and rowena felt anger bubbling inside her how could this have happened standing there the pair waited for their friend to emerge into the corridor when he finally did he stopped as soon as he saw them horror in his eyes you are a foolish foolish man salazar rowena said softly and before the startled salazar could utter a word she hurried past him and after helga something told her that more than anything her friend would now need a shoulder to cry on after salazar and helga relationship fell into pieces rowena was afraid for both her friends the worst thing about it was that if she would comfort the one the other would immediately feel betrayed the reason behind their fallout was so complex and so obscure to her neither would divulge exactly what had happened before the point where she and godric had heard them and therefore she could not exactly help either one she did not know what salazar had said to helga so she could not address his points nor could she try and counter them it was too hard and too confusing in the meanwhile the school suffered helga and salazar could not bear be in the same room at the same time meals were an awkward affair with godric and rowena firmly wedged between the two so that they would not have to look into each other eyes helga was constantly on the verge of tears whenever salazar was not around and salazar was incredibly moody when helga was not there to see it their enthusiasm in teaching lessened to a level where the students repeatedly complained to godric and rowena that they were bored out of their wits in the other two lessons seeing the two wandering listlessly on the grounds tore rowena apart and she could see that godric was feeling the same way they could no longer sit in pleasant companionship in the evenings idly comparing notes of the passing day instead rowena and helga had to closet themselves in rowena drawing room and godric and salazar stayed in salazar quarters whenever the former couple had accidentally met in the corridors they would murmur an embarrassed greeting and then hurry on their way then one day without warning more than a month later helga returned to her cheery self again she laughed easily once more sang in the corridors when she thought no one could hear her and danced around the drawing room with ceri as she had done before the fallout with salazar she smiled widely at everyone and even initiated a conversation with the brooding salazar without prompting from rowena or from godric though she wanted to believe that helga had gotten over the ordeal by herself rowena suspected that such was not the case the silly expression on the younger woman face was reminiscent of the one she had when salazar and her had grown closer all those years before and rowena was afraid of what it might mean though she could not quite form an idea on why she was afraid or for whom over the next few weeks she closely watched her friend noting how she started spending a lot more time at the loch after schooldays and on free days coming back late at night with flushed cheeks and wide grins with a sinking feeling in her stomach rivaled by a feeling of happiness she concluded that her initial suspicion was true all she had to do was find some proof so she continued watching the sunny woman and made discreet inquiries that confirmed her notion and while she knew now for certain that this would break salazar even further she realized that this was helga choice and her chance to be happy and start a family at first she was the only one who had noticed but soon enough godric approached her on the matter proving to her once more that he was not as dim in those matters as he seemed rowena was in her drawing room her eyes affixed to the dusty tome in front of her ears alert to any sounds of distress from ceri who was playing on the floor with a few rag dolls given to her by dahlia when a firm knock on the door made her look up and invite the one on the other side of the door in she had no doubt who it was for years of hearing him rap his knuckles on doors left an imprint in her memory returning to her book she said good afternoon godric finished with your training so soon i wouldnthave been here if it was not for this he told her making her look up once more at seeing what he was pointing at she sighed what is it with little children and the urge to get dirty the moment they are washed she asked the world in general looking down at a not at all remorseful ryan who was grinning brightly at his parents his new clothes covered with mud and a fresh bruise starting to form on his cheek she then took firm hold of his hand and led him into the main chamber where she conjured a tub of hot water no mama the young boy protested mightily as she extracted him out of his mud stiffened clothes i don wan a bath he wailed his small fists clinging to her skirt as she attempted picking him up and putting him in the tub mama ignoring the boy complaints she deftly deposited him in the hot water immediately starting to scrub him clean at the end of the ordeal there was one sullen and cleanly pink boy in a fresh set of clothes rowena ignored ryan antics and instead turned to godric who was standing at the door to the drawing room with a giggling ceri in his arms you can go back to training now she said i ll keep the little scoundrel in here hopefully nothing would be broken this time thanks wena he said with a smile putting down ceri and striding to the front door of their quarters his hand was already on the handle when he stopped his back to her helga seems to be spending a lot of time at the village he then said in a would be indifferent tone that fooled no one as he turned back to face her his expression too nullified his tone with his eyebrows raised in question rowena knew very well what her husband wanted to know sighing she turned her back to him picking ceri up and pretended to check if the child had soiled herself after a while knowing that he was still behind her waiting for an answer she said i spoke to your mother the other day helga spends a lot of time at sir rhys house and i can tell you one thing it is not ceridwen or lleulu company that she looks for one of the boys he asked without hesitation ilar they ve been spending a lot of time together since helga and salazar fell apart i do believe that he had feelings for her for a very long time and was afraid to admit it since it was so clear that helga was with salazar almost all his brothers are on the way to marriage or at least found themselves their hoped for wives but he hasnteven been looking i see she could hear the troubled tone in his voice and knew that he was contemplating whether to tell this to salazar or not it was his decision to make godric she said softly for better or for worse he had made it helga owes him no allegiance and it none of his business if she sought for happiness in the arms of another man he had hurt her when he told her he did not love her she would have given him everything and he threw it back in her face while i am worried for salazar i am happy that helga is on her way to joy be it lacking as it may he sighed and nodded knowing that she was right as he left however rowena threw herself on one of the chairs in the main chamber and buried her face in her hands she did not know what to do she could not approach helga about it because then the sunny woman would be angry with her and would say that she was trying to control her life but she could not help but think about what it would do to salazar who was only just beginning to recuperate from the whole matter either way someone was about to suffer from this helga notified rowena of her new relationship a short while later the two women were sitting in the isolated drawing room while the men sat at the main chamber keeping the children with them rowena was keeping ryan firmly attached to her building a palace from roughly hewn wooden blocks made for the boy by one of the knights she was too tired to run after him as he made use of his energy helga who was holding ceri chattering to her in a childish voice had not said much since entering the room then however she let out a peculiar giggle and said do you want to know a secret raven she asked the grin she was wearing wide enough to reach her ears oh rowena said raising her eyebrows in question then in a low giggling voice the same one helga used to use when they were little girls in caerwyn valley she told rowena all about her relationship with ilar she spoke of it as though it was something naughty but was delighted in it she talked in length about how much ilar loved her and how he was not afraid to tell her that and show it to her rowena grimaced inwardly knowing perfectly well at whom this finely pointed dart had been aimed soon after that conversation the rumour passed through the village ilar son of rhys and helga hufflepuff were seen together they were expected to announce their marriage any day now they were about to elope mistress hufflepuff was about to leave the school in order to raise a family with ilar ilar was about to move into the castle in order to be nearer his girl rowena was talking with salazar the day he first heard those rumours they were arguing over what kind of change could still be done at the castle what kind of d cor could be added and if they should teach one of the house elves how to do a proper bit of gardening they were standing outside on the front steps leading to the castle it was break time for the children and they were going in and out the castle chattering loudly as they went a passing pair of giggling girls walked into the entrance hall and as they did a part of their conversation drifted into salazar range of hearing cutting over his argument with rowena so cute together arentthey i mean ilar is absolutely perfect for mistress hufflepuff they re the perfect pair i know have you seen them together it looks like a fairytale at hearing these words salazar froze in mid sentence his dark eyes practically bulging out of their sockets rowena tilted her head to one side looking at her friend cautiously not sure of how to read the passive expression spreading on his face at length he spoke is that true is what those girls had said true she could tell that he had a hard time even pronouncing these words let alone voice what he now knew his face was still unreadable to her but his eyes betrayed him hurt disbelief and anger floated in those dark depths and she did not know how to calm him knowing he was waiting for an answer she sadly looked straight into his eyes and said it true salazar every word of it every how long have you known the words were uttered in the same expressionless voice and she could now see betrayal in his eyes in addition to the other emotions for a while i only suspected it at first but she told me a couple of weeks ago it been going for quite a while she said not trying to apologize as much as she loved him it was none of his business i should have known he said softly his entire face now showing defeat not just his eyes this time his eyes were dead and it frightened rowena more than his anger and his pain is she happy she is without another word salazar turned his back to her and walked back into the castle dragging his feet as he did behind him rowena was left shaking her head and feeling helpless she felt that feeling so often lately ever since the fallout and she did not like it at all raven i getting married helga excited squeal made rowena look up from her children to see a bright helga practically jumping with the joy of finally having ilar ask her hand in marriage a treacherous part of rowena mind said in a small voice something along the lines of that didnttake long now did it and the less treacherous part who was exceedingly happy for her friend was still rational and continued that errant thought logically wondering whether helga was acting so quickly was not a rash action meant to cover for a still broken heart and a pain that would never really go away that wonderful helga was what she said however smiling when is the wedding planned to be or have you not discussed that yet in half a year time helga almost sang picking up ceri and dancing with the giggling girl all about the room as was her wont ceridwen said it was the best time because then you will all have time to plan the best wedding for me i wouldntmind marrying him next week if it was up to me she laughed but when i told that to her she almost had a fit she said it would give people the wrong idea i told her i didntcare and she practically threw me out of the house and told me to tell you rowena knew precisely what wrong ideas people could get ceridwen had made sure she and godric knew that when they had timidly mentioned getting married as soon as possible privately she entirely approved of ceridwen rationalism thinking that maybe it would give helga time to think if this was really what she wanted as months rushed by though helga mind was still set she wanted to marry ilar and she thought that it was the right thing seeing nothing wrong with the idea she was so excited that she counted down the days to the wedding on a piece of parchment she hung on one of the walls of her quarters which rowena was helping her redecorate and prepare for the second occupant that would arrive soon it was decided early on that helga would not leave the castle and that ilar would have to move into the castle and into helga quarters after the wedding the quarters were spacious and therefore it posed no problem all there was to be done was to freshen the appearance of the room because it would soon have a very changed purpose helga wedding gown was made of a fine pale purple cloth painstakingly embroidered with gold threads the women who made it laboured for weeks before they thought it worthy of her when it was finally ready helga twirled girlishly around the ground floor antechamber showing off the garment to the three of them once she was done admiring the masterpiece rowena shifted her attention to salazar she and godric had both watched him carefully since the announcement of the wedding and as they had spoken alone late at night they had both noted the deadened look often seen in his eyes while around helga he smiled and tried to seem happy for her in an older brother sort of way whenever her back was turned lines of pain would appear on his face when ilar came visiting every so often sitting with the four of them on their evening relaxation salazar would be cold to him whenever helga attention was away his tone of voice bordering on the vehement helga to all appearances noticed none of it and now as she was dancing for their benefit around the room excited at the upcoming wedding more than ever now that she had a solid affirmation that this was not but a dream salazar looked as though he was on the brink of tears rowena could see his handsome features contort as he tried keeping his emotions in check she could see that no matter what he had said he still loved helga very much and was regretting his rash decision greatly she also knew that his suffering was far from over for two weeks from the day the wedding was scheduled to take place in the great hall of hogwarts to be attended by all the village people and the students rowena could see the light dying in salazar eyes when a smiling helga said the final words of bonding all the love in her small body projected not at him but at a deliriously happy ilar her heart ached for her friend but she knew that this was his choice as mistaken as it was she shook the tears away this was helga big day rowena refused to show any trace of sadness for her friend sake standing there with godric and her children watching her childhood friend marrying the man of her choice she could not help but smile though tinged with sadness there was no reason denying that this day proved beyond anything else the great change in their lives since the day two strangers had stumbled into their home front room in the middle of a blizzard how innocent they were then how certain they were that things would forever stay as they were they were so na ve thinking that the world was divided into rights and wrongs they had been proven wrong on so many accounts since that day over a decade before they had learned about wrong truths and true wrongs they had made mistakes and they had done right they had made friends and they had made deadly foes the world was not black and white there were many shade of grey in the middle and at that moment standing by a family of her own and watching her friend about to start one herself rowena could see them all she was sad for salazar she truly was but as she stood there all she could think of was that it would all end well it had to because with all the pain and the tears they were still one big family and family ties were stronger that anything else of that she was sure and that was what had won the battle in favour of happiness as the conductor of the ceremony pronounced the couple married and the bonding complete rowena ran to her friend and engulfed in a crushing hug yes she thought tears of joy falling from her eyes everything is going to be fine less than two months after the wedding a deeply flushed helga entered rowena and godric quarters without even knocking immediately throwing her arms around rowena neck hugging her tightly the shocked rowena drew back and looked at her ecstatic friend critically you re with child she said after a moment not asking surprised at the calm tone of her voice helga nodded excitedly then she let go of rowena and twirled about the room picking up a giggling ceri and dancing with her across the room the girl enjoyment clear to everyone in the room it was one of her favourite pastimes and she did not object it when he aunt flung her up into the air helga laughed with the girl and hummed happily and she danced making rowena smile in spite of herself does ilar know she asked helga paused in mid step then putting down the girl sat down by rowena not yet i thought i d surprise him tonight you know a special dinner just for the two of us in our quarters something romantic and magical i just wanted you to be the first to know because you are going to be the child guardian and everything i am of course you are really raven what kind of thing to ask who else could be rowena just smiled the next three months were a hectic collection of days the students of the castle were once again ecstatic to hear of one of their teachers pregnancy replaying their behaviour during rowena two pregnancies ilar could be often spotted walking around the castle or in the village with a ridiculously silly expression on his face mirroring his pure delight at being a father soon enough his brothers all congratulated him repeatedly often taking him to calanthe to celebrate helga did not seem to mind so rowena grudgingly allowed godric to join in the festivities he had often dragged salazar along with him but both he and rowena knew that their friend heart was simply not in it he had of course congratulated the expecting parents profusely but as soon as he turned from then rowena could clearly see the tears and anger burning in his eyes the women of the village many now related to the couple via ilar many brothers entered a frenzy of preparing for the baby gifts from them once again piling in the chambers of hogwarts sir rhys who had often complained that he would get no grandchildren from this son of his was possibly the happiest of them all stopping by at the castle much more often that he had previously and in the midst of it all late into the fourth month of helga pregnancy a guest had arrived at the doors of hogwarts covered in a dark cloak all her belongings in life on the back of a packhorse rosalind salazar exclaimed as rowena mother entered the entrance hall making rowena whirl around from her place where she was discussing a subject from her lesson with a curious student what are you doing here i thought i d surprise you all i here for good children i left the glen for the last time the older woman said with a sad smile i couldntstay there anymore i wanted to spend a little more time with my family now that i have a good man who had married my daughter and two wonderful grandchildren the glen is just too far off rowena could barely contain the happiness coursing through her at hearing this she loved her mother dearly and the long years apart had hurt them both more than either woman was prepared to admit this was all in the past now however now rosalind was here and everything could return to being happy and peaceful asking the young girl she was speaking with to postpone their discussion to a different time she walked toward her mother with a bright smile i brought a letter rosalind continued in an off hand manner as she undid the brooch holding her cloak closed clasping godric hand as he approached her she was only waiting for her husband to pass away to send it i dontknow how she located me and she was lucky to find me before i had left but she begged me to give it to her daughter if i ever see her again she was not so sure whether it would be welcome or not but i think she did not so much care about that as much as she cared that it would at least reach her rowena stared at her mother in confusion not really understanding what the older woman was trying to say whose daughter who wanted to send a letter to them rosalind who was now holding a crumpled piece of parchment in her hand tapped her foot impatiently come now i not going to allow you to ignore it after i have gone to all that trouble to take down what she was dictating are you going to read your letter or not helga i want to see my grandchildren this was it for this time people next update again unless circumstances make it impossible shall be on next tuesday if i am on schedule and everything goes according to plan this story would last nine more weeks for i intend on uploading a chapter per week can you hold that long love you all star of the north disclaimer everything here besides the few things you dontknow belongs to jk rowling creator of the worlds of harry potter a n salazar is gone woe on us sniffs it was such a difficult chapter to write emotionally wise but i glad i went on with the plan despite that now the last couple of chapters deserve a special introduction after the tear soaked few chapters we had gone through we are now taking a sharp turn from that line into the tranquil waters of an ending before any of you scold me and say that the content of this chapter has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the story this is my explanation to you i needed to end this somehow the best way to end it from my point of view is with a sort of a beginning for after all every ending is the beginning of something new so even though i have no intention of writing a sequel because a there not enough stuff to write about b it would be rather redundant and c i already working on the prequel that means so much more to me and i have little time as it is i am leaving this story with an open ending of sorts for your imagination short chapter but the next one is much longer and will sadly conclude the story cept for the eiplogue naturally it was very fun to write an oblivious godric and a somewhat slytherin ish ryan i ll have you know and so i hope you will enjoy these last two chapters chapter 29 a father difficulties after the destruction of the old form of government with the death of ambrosius the founders did not involve themselves with the matters of rule anymore they wished no connection to the rebuilding of the ruling establishment having had enough of it they wanted nothing more than to concentrate their efforts on the continuity of their school choosing to separate themselves from those few people who had decided it was their job to renew the council while the founders themselves did not engage in those matters anymore those who had in time recreated the form of government in the british magic community all came from hogwarts they were all educated there and had formed their opinions there therefore it is no doubt that the body which in years to come would transform into the modern ministry of magic was in good hands hogwarts a history author unknown helga was silent throughout the journey back to the farm where they burrowed the horses from a considerable distance away tears fell down her cheeks unchecked but she made no noise her blond hair was limp and her skin pale and sallow much as salazar face had been in those last moments she rode close by godric not caring that he could see her at such a state rowena rode ahead and there was no way he could tell what she was thinking without looking deep into her eyes or at least seeing her face her back was straight her hair in its orderly tight bun and her posture rigid he knew all too well that until they would be alone in their quarters at hogwarts she would show no other emotion as for himself he was puzzled he wanted to cry wanted to cry more than anything else no matter how hurt he had been from that fight with salazar this was still his best of friends who had just died and there he was dry eyed as a stone was his heart this cold why could he not cry why could he not shed one tear for the sake of a man that had meant so much to him throughout his life they did not stay for the burial maeve expression when she had told them it would take place in a couple of days had told them they were not wanted there though she had been hospitable enough upon their arrival at her home it became obvious that she wished nothing more to do with them godric supposed it was a combination of having them steal salazar last moments from her and the fact that the woman whom salazar had loved all through their years together namely helga had been the one to hold his hand before he died not her knowing they would most likely be greeted with hostility by maeve relatives rowena had sadly said that they might as well leave and not participate her voice never wavered as she said it it never did godric knew that she needed to cry but how could he tell her that when he himself could not shed a tear as they returned to the home of sir cedric they did not dally they gave their profound thanks to the man and to his family politely refused their offer to stay for the night and then immediately apparated back to hogwarts it was late by the time they reached the castle and a steady drizzle had started gradually soaking them to the bone as they trudged up the stairs and to the front doors strangely enough none of them seemed to mind none of them even attempted to use magic to shelter them from the rain they did not care godric his face wet with rain felt that this was in some way a substitute to his own tears that refused to come the world wept for salazar slytherin the castle corridors were empty when they entered it empty and echoing no students were outside at this hour even the most mischievous of them all opting to remain in the warmth of their commons during such a night the castle their home for so many years never seemed so bleak to godric even the building itself mourned for its lost builder a whole crowd of children was in their quarters when he and rowena entered the main chamber apparently ryan and ceri had taken their cousins under their wing for the night sparing ilar the trouble aunt rowena rhian called being the first to see them enter is mother your mother is back as well yes i suggest you go and greet her before she panic and start wondering what had happened to you you dontwant that to happen now do you godric was surprised that her voice did not even shake as she spoke he was sure that his own voice would have come out shaky and distressed if he was the one to speak helga brood all squealed in excitement bolting out of the room stumbling over each other only pausing to kiss their aunt and uncle briefly before running to see their mother ceri and ryan much statelier than their cousins got up and stopped before their parents uncle salazar ryan asked softly meeting godric eyes gravely he he died godric croaked the tears that refused to fall choking his voice but did you make peace between you before then he was extremely surprised by his son question he had expected him to ask if they were all right he expected him to offer his condolences or even to cry he did not expect him to ask that he did not even know that ryan was aware of the entire situation y yes w we d did the tears were more evident in his voice now than ever he felt more than saw rowena smiling slightly and then her hand took hold of his and squeezed it reassuringly why dontyou go and rest godric she said gently we all had a very long day doing as he was told he kissed his children goodnight and left for the bedchamber to change out of his wet clothes and go to sleep long after he had extinguished the dim lights he could still hear rowena and the children speaking in soft voices he supposed that she was telling them of their beloved uncle last moments sharing her experience there with them he felt the first tears coming but did nothing to stop them godric gryffindor wept finally he sank into an uneasy slumber of which he woke abruptly when he heard the door to the bedchamber open and then close he did not know what time it was only that it was rather late he could hear rowena moving in the dark doing whatever it was she always did before going to bed then he felt her slip into bed and burrow into him seeking to be as close to him as possible he knew it would happen long before he heard her first sob but soon enough he could hear her soft barely audible weeping accompanied by cold tears that soaked into his nightshirt penetrated the quiet of the night moving so that he could hold her tightly in his arms he kept them in that position until her grief ran its course and she could finally fall asleep after salazar death things slowly settled back into their normal routine there were classes to teach a school to run and a whole lot of children just wanting to get into trouble every other day to keep an eye on soon enough to his great surprise and feeling of guilt godric noted that the memory of salazar was pushed to the back of his mind and that he only rarely thought about his lost friend there was nothing to do about that however salazar was dead never to return but life went on without him as it always did godric could not allow himself to shirk his duties again as he did after salazar had left hogwarts three years or so before he would not do that to rowena again and so he allowed salazar to become only a vague memory that would come out at night before sleep when all that troubles a man creep up returning to his cheerful old self during the day a month after they had returned from london he agreed to go with ilar to the village for the evening to pay a visit to calanthe and her tavern it was the usual thing meeting with all of sir rhys sons and other friends from the village talking drinking and laughing until calanthe firmly sent all of them home most of them walking unsteadily some falling asleep on her floor and dragged home by sympathetic and more sober friends nothing had changed about those nights this time too he had to half carry his younger friend back to the castle ilar loudly singing bawdy songs and he attempting to keep him quiet it always amused him to no end that the normally reserved and quiet ilar would become this vulgar after a few tankards of ale he shook his head in amusement and dragged his friend all the way to the quarters he shared with helga knocking politely on the door it was almost immediately opened by a worried helga her worry soon dissipated making place for the wry expression she displayed every time her husband came home from the tavern after an outing with godric couldntget him to drink less this time either i presume she asked dryly taking hold of the foolishly grinning ilar couldntand wouldn t my dearest helga he said with a mock bow the man deserves a little bit of drunk time he will learn one day i hope i getting too old to carry him home every time she snorted at that and pulled her husband into their main chamber goodnight godric she said with a smile thanks for bringing him home again always here to serve old friend goodnight whistling softly to himself he made his way to his quarters content of the night he had spent in pleasant company and ready to go to bed rowena must be fast asleep by now he thought to himself for he had told her he planned on coming back late it would be nice to wrap his arms around her as she slept soundly smiling he almost missed the streak of colour in front of him the colour he had caught glimpse of was deep auburn disappearing around the corner and since he knew rowena would never run if there was chance anyone would see her wondered what ceri was up to at this time of night he had lately noticed that she always had a rosy blush in her cheeks and that she was often flushed and tousled when she returned to their quarters in the evening when he had commented about it to rowena suggesting that their little girl may be ill his wife almost choked on her tea and then hurriedly assured him that there was nothing wrong with ceri it sounded a bit crooked to him but he let it go if rowena was not worried then he should not be either then he heard the sound of laughter that he recognized without a doubt as ceri and then a mirthful shriek and the sound of running feet seconds later he saw his daughter bolting from around the corner closely followed not by ryan as he had expected but by none other than aiden before he had had the chance to make his presence known to the laughing pair ceri ran straight into him and would have fallen had he not caught her looking up her eyes as wide as two full moons ceri seemed to gulp but then her usual smile reappeared and she hugged him tightly saying hello father i trust you had a good time in the village that i did he said at ease but the two of you should have long ago been in bed it past midnight and i would not want to punish either of you for trespassing school rules the two looked thoroughly ashamed of themselves and aiden his face pale for some reason said i do apologize headmaster we hadntnotice the time goodnight ceri goodnight headmaster and with that he hastily withdrew let us go too ceri your mother could be out of her mind with worry what were you thinking staying out so late and doing whatever it was you were doing he stopped at that and gave his daughter a questioning glance what were you doing um she mumbled playing the chasing game we re childish like that some times donti know it he laughed come now i sure your mother thinks you re safely in bed by now if she still awake then i will distract her and let you slip into bed but mark it that i want this to be the last time she nodded with a somewhat guilty expression on her face the two of them walked in comfortable silence the rest of the way to the family quarters he never grew tired of spending time with his children even if it was without speaking their presence was enough every time he remembered how close he had been to losing them all those years ago he appreciated the time he had spent with them even more finally they reached the quarters and ceri slipped quickly into the room she shared with ryan as godric did as he had promised and distracted rowena who was wide awake and waiting for him to return despite having been told not to wait he wondered how it was that their daughter managed to escape her mother hawk like watch for by his wife calm he surmised that she had not discovered ceri was missing as yet later long after the couple had gone to bed godric remained awake staring at the dark ceiling above him listening to rowena quiet breaths as she slept he was such a lucky man he had two wonderful children who were for the most part obedient and loving they were well educated and were bound to have a great future in front of them ryan in particular with his inclination to protect everyone he held dear perhaps one day he would rise to be the true grandson of gawain gryffindor and ryan ravenclaw giants of their time and as for ceri she was bound to be as great a lady as her mother and grandmothers before her he was not worried he also had rowena who was an outstanding woman and even though they had had their disagreements quite often at that he knew she would always be there for him through thick and thin through ice and fire his life could not have been more perfect with that comforting thought he finally fell asleep after that night he had chance to find ceri and aiden together on more than one occasion often with their head bowed together whispering and laughing the boy was a little too close for comfort to his daughter spending a little too much time with her godric had always known that due to certain things not least of them the fact that she had grown up almost bodily attached to her brother ceri had always preferred the company of friends of the male persuasion over any other her only female friend relatively close to her age was helga eldest rhian and recently he had noticed that the two spent much less time together as ceri apparently opted for her age group friends and yet she seemed particularly attached to the potter boy and he found it somewhat disconcerting still when he had asked rowena for her opinion she vaguely dissipated his suspicions saying that friends would be friends and to let them be so he did after all ceri was his little girl and he was very proud of her she would never do anything bad or something that would embarrass her parents or earn their disapproval this belief as sweet and trusting as it was in the end brought him the worst shock of his life even if godric was somewhat worried about ceri close relationship with aiden soon he had worse things to deal with it was a few weeks later that ryan entered godric study without warning practically floating a wide grin plastered on his face he was holding a roll of parchment in his hand and was humming happily in a good mood are we godric asked his son fondly that we are father ryan said his grin broadening even further i have great news and i think you ll like them i got this letter this morning and i was rather surprised because no one ever sends me letters all the people i know live in the castle or at the village at worst so i was very curious to see who it was from can you guess who sent it to me your future wife godric asked chuckling father ryan seemed outraged be serious please first of all i would not even consider taking a wife before i get to know the girl properly and second that is not the person who had sent it to me cantyou guess sighing and putting down his quill godric shook his head no my dear boy i cannot surprise me lord billius father ryan called excitedly now bouncing in place lord billius himself had sent me a letter he wants my help for something i think it a great honour isntit what are you saying ryan godric asked warily the youth was smiling so broadly now that his smile almost split his face in half he dropped very ungracefully on the chair in front of his father and said in excitement what i saying is that billius wants to talk to me father lord billius asked to arrange a meeting he wants me to come to stonehenge to meet him i can only imagine what he wants me to do there but it great isntit godric felt only dread at this declaration what could lord billius one of the last remnants of the council and one of the two men who had held the ruling body together against all objections ever since ambrosius death want with his son there were several options that immediately jumped into his mind and none of them was very favourable still he could not bear watching the delighted expression on ryan face evaporate and so he forced out his words yes it is wonderful are you going to go of course i am ryan delight intensified i can apparate and so it shouldnttake long should it i ll be gone just the few days less even will you tell mother at this a warning signal flared in godric mind if ryan did not tell his mother about the letter he had received then he was quite possibly afraid of her reaction he scrutinized ryan hopeful face and crossed his arms in front of him why dont you tell your mother he asked suspiciously ryan face fell and he stared at the desk separating the two of them as though it was the most fascinating thing in the world because she wouldntlet me go he said in a small voice and why wouldntshe let you go godric pleasantly asked knowing how uncomfortable the boy was and somehow enjoying that discomfort ryan was too independent for his liking because she wouldntagree with it the boy said in an even smaller voice she would say that i shouldntinvolve myself with the government because they are all corrupt and evil at the base even though gaius and billius had helped us during the war against ambrosius and do you understand the truth behind what she would say in defeat ryan shoulders slumped and he nodded i know they are not the most honest people alive and i know that they are backstabbing bastards when it suits them but here ryan eyes flared with determination but that why i want to be involved father i know i can do better than them i can rebuild the council in a different way in a way that wontallow those holding reign to have infinite power over everyone else i can make a change father i know i can billius and gaius are relics of an old world an old system of government while they are at the top there is no chance to make that change that we so sorely need but if i can be there i know i very young but i can influence them i can outwit them you know that and here godric smiled and unfolded his arms he raised a hand in order to stop ryan speech my dear child he said still smiling it is the job of a parent to be overprotective of their children and so i cannot help but worry that you might not be doing the right thing however your grandfather my father was younger than yourself when he had taken my grandfather seat at the council and look how far he had gotten i dontwant to see you go ryan but i am not about to stop you if it is a mistake then it is your mistake to make i cantcoddle you forever and nor can your mother i will tell her boy just make sure to come back in one piece so she can dismantle you on her own when you are back the grin back on his face ryan profusely thanked his father and then disappeared back into the main chamber by nightfall he was gone and rowena was on the verge of apparating to stonehenge and dragging him back by the ears godric found that very amusing and was waiting for her reaction when their son would return he completely understood her worry she did not have a very good experience with the council none of them did but he also knew that ryan was a man now and that he could no longer hide behind his mother skirts no matter how much rowena wished it otherwise ryan could not and would not stay a child for ever and so when he saw rowena putting on her cloak and preparing to leave after her son he took hold of her arm and made her sit down it was a long night and included a very loud argument between the two godric did not remember having such a heated fight with her for a very long time she was angry at him and at ryan but most of all she was worried and that made her crankier than ever she paced for a while and then sat down tapping her foot impatiently as she argued her case then got up and paced again all the while talking and shouting and saying horrible things that little children should never hear it had been a very long time since she had let loose that side of her vocabulary it was only a couple or so hours after midnight that they had finished their fight and even that was only because a sleepy ceri opened the door to her room and curtly asked the two to kiss and make up and let me go back to my bloody sleep because there school tomorrow that had shut them both up and so they had retired to bed even if he did not know how upset rowena really was the fact that she kept to her side of the bed that night would have made it obvious it was not a very comfortable night it took ryan three days to return and by the time he did rowena anger had simmered down enough for her to keep a tight lid on it godric knowing her ominous silences only too well did not envy his son rowena was furious he did not blame her of course for he himself was not very happy with the boy having time to think it over he wondered what had possessed ryan to become so involved with the matters of government they had always made sure that they had nothing to do with it and they were sure their children would do the same how did things go so wrong he was so worried that ryan would do something foolish it is only one of the troubles and difficulties of us fathers sir rhys told him on the night of ryan return as the two sat in the older man house over a cup of ale we must watch helpless as our children grow up and fly away from the nest ryan is no longer a child godric and i can see it in your eyes that you are fully aware of that it is time to let go consciously as well as unconsciously how do i do that godric asked tiredly swirling the remains of the ale at the bottom of his cup it takes time but you will manage it sooner or later it not over yet godric you still have ceri after all and she is a good girl and still is a child you re right i still have ceri she not going anywhere for the time being he agreed smiling slightly she will always be my little girl and no one is taking her from me just yet when godric returned from the village that evening he found rowena scolding ryan by the defeated expression on his son face he guessed she had been at it for quite a while seeing that he entered the room she planted her hands on her hips and said and this is the last time you are doing such a thing without giving me fair warning first yes mother ryan said in a monotone but godric thought he caught a sigh of relief somewhere in there now may i tell you about what i did in stonehenge surprisingly enough she smiled and sat down then straightening her skirts said you most certainly may godric slightly stunned by her reaction settled next to her and listened to what ryan had to say as it turned out their mischievous son had gone there in order to achieve his own ends i only wanted to see what they were doing and how they were doing it mother he explained grinning i followed billius everywhere and noted how he and gaius handled things they only want me there for my name because they couldntget father or uncle salazar in his time to sit there with them i am only to be their puppet as far as they are concerned but i saw the flaws in their system it is mostly based on the old council and not many people are happy with that they want something new billius and gaius though they had worked against the council in their time know nothing else but the way it used to work they are too old and set in their ways to make major changes but i can and i will i talked with a few junior clerks that have been helping them for a while they have virtually no say in anything billius and gaius handle everything with steely hands most of those people my age or a little older disagree with a lot of the decisions that go around there but since they have no say they cantdo anything about it if billius and gaius induct me into their circle i can pretend to cooperate for a while and gather strength from those ranks that are smothered by those two and when i have a strong enough base of support they will have no option but allow me leeway that way i can finally make a change and completely reform the system of government what do you think godric and rowena exchanged glances godric could see her fighting a proud grin he did not even bother to hide his smile he got up and clapped his son on the shoulder ryan he said i think that this is a plan worthy of your uncle salazar he would have been very proud of you and so are we just bear in mind dontlet that get into your head it may be a fantastic success or the worst failure but even if you fail at first dontgive up there is merit to your plan and i am sure that you can make it work after that ryan made frequent journeys to stonehenge sometimes he would be gone for a whole week sometimes for just a day every time he came back he had more news to tell of new supporters he had managed to get of something he managed to convince gaius and billius to do or of any number of things that often would leave godric in stitches thinking of the expression on billius face were he to understand that his young prot g was undermining his authority but while his troubles with ryan subsided he once again became aware of ceri numerous disappearances she would often come back late or sneak out when she thought her parents did not notice rowena had said to let it go that she was only having fun her being a young girl youthful and mischievous as her brother she said that they should let her be not keep a tight watch on her considering his wife reaction to ryan decision only a little while before he found that very strange it was as though her mind and views were completely changed where ceri was concerned she was just a little girl their ceri his heart clenched whenever he thought of one day letting her go godric had adored his little girl practically since the day she was born how could he not she was his little girl she was a beautiful child with her mother auburn hair and his blue eyes she was stunning and he had always known somewhere in the back of his mind that one day he would have to accept that she like all children has grown and is ready to start a life of her own he was preparing himself for it for years he just did not expect that time to come so soon she was so young therefore twinned with that belief that she would never do anything he disapproved of what his daughter had in store for him that day when he was peacefully playing a match of wizard chess against ryan in the cheery main chamber of their quarters took him completely by surprise say that again dear he said absently his mind on the match i going to get married this time he did catch her words he shot out of his chair like an arrow from a bow his eyes wild and wide you re what getting married father she beamed her lovely face brightening up as though lit from the inside isntthat just absolutely wonderful for a moment all godric could do was to stare at his baby girl she was wearing an exquisite green gown a gift from her aunt which complimented her figure for the first time he finally realized that this was no girl in front of him but a woman and whom may i ask is the intended bridegroom he asked in a much chillier tone than he had planned he stifled a wince knowing that he could not back down not this time why aiden of course she said still smiling aiden he gritted aiden the potter y yes she mumbled her smile faltering her big blue eyes much less bright i going to kill him ryan said behind him getting up his voice cold as godric own i am going to strangle him with my own bare hands ryan ceri cried you will do no such thing father really i thought you d be happy for me happy yes happy i thought that my getting married would be a joyous thing for you you are wrong ceridwen wrong about what you are not getting married ta da end of the last but one chapter what did you think would ryan kill aiden would everything go well for the young lovers wasntgodric completely oblivious tell me what you think next chapter is on tuesday in a week as per usual i would most likely post it earlier

rumours and mysteries that shroud the latter years of the hogwarts four we are aware of one fact alone by rowena ravenclaw final command all four were entombed within one crypt side by side including salazar slytherin body which had been buried several decades prior and several hundred miles away once all four were together again sir raymond of the loch rowena and godric grandchild had sealed the tomb with a block of marble on which the school motto draco dormiens nunquam titillandus was embossed along with the hogwarts crest when all was done according to rowena orders sir raymond had hidden the whereabouts of the tomb and erased all mention of its location from all records in years to come many a witch and wizard would attempt penetrating the mystery and locate the hogwarts four final resting place but none would succeed for it is too well disguised with the final entombment of the four an era had ended the story of salazar godric rowena and helga had reached to a close but the tale of hogwarts still continues as does hogwarts a history hogwarts a history author unknown seeing her standing at the lake shore watching her supple youthful movements and innate grace one would never guess that she had passed her hundredth birthday almost two decades prior it was evident perhaps in her slightly hunched posture and the occasional tremble of her hands when she was not concentrating her silver hair knotted in a thick tight bun still had traces of auburn in it hinting at the luscious shade that rich mane had once been her hazel eyes still showed neither fatigue nor tiredness of the world of the living she carried no extra weight and was still considered attractive in the eyes of sixty year olds down at the village those who were born long after she had arrived there so many years ago yet rowena ravenclaw last living founder of hogwarts longed for rest she had had enough of being alone she had lasted longer than anyone should have the right to expect and in her heart she wanted nothing more than for it all to end she was ready for death to come she had seen to all the needs of her children be they her real offspring or her numerous students she loved them all and had watched over them years after they had left her care the children of her grandchildren grandchildren were already expecting babies of their own she had made sure they would all live in comfort it was the least she could do knowing that she will not be there for much longer enough she had seen to all their needs and closed all unfinished businesses she had had she had no doubt that hogwarts would go on flawlessly without her her actual part in its running had ceased to exist long before she had had her fill of life she had lost too many loved ones to go on living happily both her children had departed a few years before her old friends were gone for many years now and her beloved godric had left her almost painlessly a little over six months prior the thought of him still hurt every time he had still kept his charm and humour until the last possible moment she remembered with a tight feeling in her chest even when he had gently held her hands in his big callused ones and said farewell he still had that slight twinkle in his eyes the one she learned to associate with fun and mischief after years by his side he had known she would not last long without him when he had kissed her goodbye and said see you in a bit love merlin knows she had wanted to lie beside him and die the moment his eyes closed for ever but deep in her heart she had known there were still things to complete duties to perform rowena ravenclaw knew the importance of duty and was not one to shy away from it so she lingered on now she could finally join him no one would miss her she had slowly withdrawn from the world of the living over the previous six months getting her friends and family used to the idea that she will soon be gone she would be just another old little lady passing away rowena tightened her cloak around her fragile body and shivered as a cold gust of wind swept leaves from the forest in her direction how many times had she watched this happen with the turn of the years she remembered times when helga and she would give the children a break and the little ones would dance and laugh amidst the swirling golden leaves the daring ones would also attempt to sneak under their watch into the forest but they would never let them get near enough summoning them back if they got too dangerously close those had been the happy days when they had only few children to teach and their responsibilities were fewer it had been before the final confrontation with ambrosius and the beginning of the attempts on their lives it had been before salazar departure and the breaking of friendships long wrought in fire children still did that these days she mused they still danced and twirled and the daring ones still attempted to challenge authority the children were different but their behaviour was just the same she had watched so many generations of children copying the actions of their elders resolutely she turned her back on the sparkling surface of the lake and the memories that were tied to it in unbreakable binds and back to the castle that had been her home for nearly a hundred years they had built it out of nothing and the result was now this jewel that was admired all around she still remembered the ruins of the fort of cormag who remembered these days that ancient name practically no one it had been long since forgotten drowned by the glory of hogwarts she stepped into the entrance hall still feeling awed even after all these years by its size and magnificence she had seen this place when it was mere rubble a pile of rocks long since abandoned it amazed her each time anew that they were able to build all that just the four of them four they had not been four in such a long time she walked in the empty hall passing the massive doors of the great hall on her way they had been a gift from sir rhys son ilar when he had married helga snatching the sunny woman from salazar they had only been fitted a year later after the birth of fair rhian it was so long ago ah sir rhys she had not thought about that kindly old man in years he had lived even longer than his good friend lady ceridwen living long enough to see a multitude of grandchildren born to all his boys he had died peacefully in his sleep long after her little ceridwen wedding even though he had often said that all he needed for his life to be complete was to see that girl married and expected to die after the wedding a wedding that had taken place right there in the great hall ah little ceri her bright ray of sunshine her beautiful little girl marrying the man she loved in a hall that had such a weighty history and as for the great hall itself they had once called it the council hall they had named it thus as a joke at ambrosius expense she remembered all too well those had been days when they could not be certain that they would not wake to find their home surrounded by a hundred guards of the chamber those had been days when she was afraid afraid for herself afraid for her godric afraid for her children and her friends now she had nothing to be afraid of anymore soon enough all she would know is peace after ambrosius demise there had no longer been need of the joke no need to counter fear with humour so they had changed the name and together with the name the remnants of fear soon dissipated feeling nostalgic rowena stepped into the hall it had been quite a while since last she had seen it she found herself loath these days to face the students in the castle they were so young they reminded her all too keenly how old she was and how out of place but now the hall was empty and she could admire it at ease she was still proud of the ceiling salazar had planned it up to the most miniscule detail and she and helga had done the actual work she could still remember it all good day headmistress a young girl greeted her startling her from behind headmistress she had quit heading the school over a decade ago finally agreeing with godric that they were not quite as young as they used to be and had stopped teaching long before that she still remembered the row she had had with godric when he had first suggested that they might give up running the school in the end however she had relented and it turned out to be the right thing to have been done she had thought that they would be soon forgotten but the new headmaster and the teachers instructed all students to address them as though they were still holding that position rowena thought it was a rather nice gesture pointless but nice all the same good old tristan he was one of their first decade students those who still had only the four of them as teachers before the numbers became too great for them to handle the children alone he was one of the few still living who had known hogwarts at the time when all four founders had lived and walked its echoing halls soon there will be none of them left rowena had completed all her missions in life and was ready to join her friends and beloved on the other side of the veil there was only one thing left to be done cathrine she recalled the girl name without difficulty always a knack of hers please run to the village and ask sir raymond to come here at once i need a word with him and feel too tired to go there myself do tell him that ah the village once simply called the loch the village had taken on the name of hogsmeade in honour of the four people who had brought it to its station of these days that also had been so long ago the children of the day did not even know of the old name it had been forgotten cathrine nodded and hurriedly ran out of the hall ecstatic that the headmistress asked her to do something for her and that she had actually known her name rowena stifled a chuckle young people were so eager to please she then gathered her thoughts again telling herself that this was no time for nostalgia there were still things to be done she made her way briskly to the rooms she had shared with godric all those long happy decades she entered the circular drawing room that always belonged to her alone godric had been allowed there only at request just as she would only be allowed in his study after asking permission they had loved each other greatly but they had needed their private space once there she did not sit down but started riffling through boxes and shelves pulling out parchments and parcels which she had meticulously wrapped and addressed over the past week or so when she had everything she needed she carried it all to the main chamber and set them on the great mahogany table at its centre once upon a time its shiny surface would have been covered by parchments books used quills and various documents not to speak of used plates and cups of tea now it was clear most of the time rarely used she settled to wait conjuring herself a cup of tea to pass the time she did not have long to do so raymond was soon there huffing slightly she supposed he had guessed the meaning of her urgent summons sir raymond who like his uncle before him had busied himself with the new government of the british magic community was a tall man taking after his grandfather he resembled godric more than she was willing to admit what with his tall stature and that full mane of dark brown hair albeit his was much longer and godric hair had been black his hair started graying too now that he was approaching his seventies godric only started graying when he had turned eighty she remembered teasing him about it flouncing her dark auburn hair that at the time had shown no sign of graying it was so long ago raymond fathered a massive clan of children to continue the ravenclaw gryffindor legacy and rowena could not help but still feel amused at godric first reaction to his little girl choice of a groom it had taken her forever to convince him rowena had always gotten along with raymond and knew that he had favoured her over all his other older female relatives all of those women but her were long dead now and she felt a certain pang of regret when she realized that this good man was going to lose the last thread to his childhood quenching that errant feeling she got up from her padded chair and approached her grandson with open arms and a smile raymond my dear she said it has been too long hello grandmother he greeted her with a light peck on the cheek holding her as though he feared she will fall apart in his hands i am not that fragile you know she reprimanded him and stood on tip toes to kiss his cheek in return do sit down my boy we have business to discuss eyeing the parchments and parcels on the table gingerly raymond sat down in a chair facing her his eyes darted back and forth between rowena and the table she could see that whatever suspicions he had when he received her summons were now confirmed grandmother he started his voice rough but she sharply shook her head just once but it was enough raymond mouth fell shut generations of children were practically conditioned to obey that particular gesture and raymond was no exception none of this now raymond she said firmly knowing that she could not allow him to break now we all knew this day would inevitably come it had delayed long enough and it is time for me to take the last journey and rejoin with the rest of my generation the words rejoin my godric were left unsaid but grandmother he protested pain contorting his face you are not that old she laughed a sound still pure and young as it had been when she had first met godric her beloved used to say that it reminded him of the sound made by silver bells i am one hundred and seventeen raymond i daresay that i am too old pushing the antique i should say she said and then pointed at the collection on the table these are a few things that i would like taken care of after my departure dear first and foremost is to find and re bury salazar slytherin body in the same crypt as helga godric and myself our separation had not been natural and it is fitting that the rift would be healed in death i have discussed this with your grandfather before his death if you fear this is being done against his will rest assured that he had been the one to suggest this several months ago i had made certain inquiries i believe salazar great granddaughter selena lives with her family at london you will go to her and give her this letter she handed him a sealed parchment and do whatever it is you have to do in order to bring salazar to rest here if i remember correctly salazar had been buried in the magic burial grounds outside magic london under a snake marker selena should be able to tell you for certain after all four of us are buried the crypt beneath hogwarts must be sealed and hidden i do not want us disturbed here you will find my burial outline and the writing i want engraved on the seal covering the crypt she handed him two parchments and plodded on here is a list in which you will find we have dictated where all of our earthly possessions are to be distributed i expect you to follow the instructions explicitly there was a thick scroll sealed by the hogwarts crest among the things on the table this she said pushing it towards him must be guarded carefully raymond i entrust you to keep it and hand it to headmaster tristan personally after i am buried and the crypt sealed it contains all of our plans for this school and details what we expect him to develop all secrets a headmaster of hogwarts must know are also included he a superstitious man raymond tell him that if he would not do as said i will know of it and return to haunt him for his actions she surveyed the few things left on the table these are addressed to certain people this parcel is for salazar great granddaughter to be given to her together with the letter do not lose it for it is one of his few belongings that remained after his wife death the rest had been taken by strangers but this she had sent to me before her death since she could not reach her daughter this one is for helga youngest grandson and the last one is for your own granddaughter i ask you to deliver them as soon as news of my death reaches you that is all that is all he asked his voice thick with emotion just like that no goodbye to the family nothing personal to tell them nothing personal to tell me grandmother i rowena sighed she could clearly see the little boy he had once been her first grandchild her little ceridwen firstborn the bridge that healed the aching chasm that had opened between godric and ceridwen following her union with aiden raymond you know i love you all more than anything you are my family but no one will really miss me when i go i have lived my life to the fullest and i regret nothing it is simply time for me to go let me leave raymond i have nothing left here allow me to leave peacefully she felt her eyes well up as his lip trembled causing his six and a half decades old body materialize in front of her eyes to that of the seven year old she had cradled in her arms after he had fallen and scraped his knees she blinked and the figure faded a grown man nodded and hugged her fiercely for the first time in over twenty years a real hug that was not the cautious embrace all of her offspring gave her these days i will grandmother he said his voice cracking he picked up the parchments and the parcels give my love to grandfather will you with those words he turned from her and left without looking back sir raymond of the loch denizen of the village of hogsmeade was the last one to have seen rowena ravenclaw among the living rowena footsteps echoed in the empty halls beneath hogwarts the students were all in the great hall eating their dinner as were all the teachers she was grateful for that the dungeons had always been salazar domain he had liked them because only there all his pet snakes felt at home and he had liked making his friends comfortable she still remembered him hissing softly to maureen his very first slithering friend she had known and chuckling at some obscure comment she had made she did not venture into the dungeons a lot after salazar had left it held in store too many memories it ignited a chain of recollections that always ended with the same questions it always left her wondering whether she could have done something to stop him or what would have happened were she to convince the two stubborn men to talk things over calmly she also agonized over what would have happened were she to run after salazar instead of after godric godric would have forgiven her in the end so many what if that will remain unanswered that was why she disliked going there truth be told she had been there only three times since salazar departure once when helga had died and they had decided she should be buried beneath the castle once during that horrible winter almost thirty years before when the lake had overflowed and filled the dungeons with water and once when godric had died pain flooded her heart she missed him so much soon though she dispelled the thought from her mind this was strictly business she reminded herself just as long as she thought of it as business she would not break down and cry risking being discovered her footsteps went on echoing as she descended down that last flight of stairs it would be sealed soon enough she knew the crypt was cold two of the four tombs standing at its precise center were closed and had elaborately carved stone effigies on top of their lids hello helga she greeted softly her fingers caressing the cold cheek of the figure of the woman who had been more of a little sister than a friend i ve been neglecting you have i not i promise that i will make it all up to you she then continued to the second closed tomb and bent to kiss the stone lips of the figure of her husband i miss you she whispered more than you would ever know rowena could not explain why she needed to do that she just felt like she had to see them one last time with mortal eyes with a sigh she left the crypt she snuck out of hogwarts almost like thief in the night a black cloak covered her entire body hiding her enveloping her within the darkness she did not want to be seen people might think she had lost her mind and try confining her to her rooms effectually denying her what she still had to do she walked quickly almost at a run around the lake to the place where it met with the stream feeding it she stopped at the stream bank and gathered her skirts up above her ankles chewed her lower lip for a moment contemplating whether it was really the wisest thing to do then she took a deep breath and walked into the icy stream it had better be there helga or i will have your head for it next time i see you she thought as she grimly pulled out her wand and charmed her shoes dry it had been over thirty years since helga had told her of the place it had been right before her death rowena found herself wondering how her friend could have had gotten herself all that way away from the castle unaided wena wena please just listen to me helga pleaded coughing there time enough to speak when you are feeling better rowena said firmly rest and be well i not going to be well again rowena dontlie to yourself and dontlie to me i respect and love you too much to allow you that please just listen to me for a little while then i will rest there was almost nothing left of rowena old friend she had only her cheerfulness left and even that abandoned her at times since she fell ill when the pain was too much to take helga was so pale so old she looked older than rowena with her hair turned snowy white her face a mask of delicate lines and her eyes no longer seeing well rowena sighed very well helga speak but only for a little while i ll be gone soon raven but i need you to promise me one thing only one thing rowena tried to jest a little but helga would have none of that stop it rowena i donthave time for that listen carefully at the edge of the loch where it meets its source there a shallow crossing much like the ones we used back home back home rowena interrupted surely you dontmean but i do raven helga laughed home is still caerwyn even after all these years rowena started protesting for her the glen and the valley stopped being a home a long time ago but as helga broke into another fit of hacking coughs she kept it to herself and let her friend go on once you cross the stream you will find yourself walking through a slightly rocky area a little distance to the right of the crossing you will find an old oak between its roots i have put something for you i want you to go there when you know your time has come no one knows when their time comes helga you cantexpect me to i know you rowena helga said stubbornly holding tightly to the sleeves of rowena gown if anyone can know when their time has come it you you will go there i know it i know it but rowena tried again promise me rowena i promise me i promise soon after that helga had died she died in her sleep and when the grief stricken ilar had called rowena and godric over in the morning rowena vowed to keep her promise there was no question about it rowena was not going to disrespect her friend no her sister last wish the time has come and helga was right rowena did know her destination was clear ahead it was a giant oak so similar to the one at the mouth of the glen under which they had met so many times all those years ago the one from which branches they had pelted passersby with acorns rowena stifled a sob it had been such a long time ago those two girls were long gone all those memories seemed to belong to someone else these were the memories of a simple country girl not those of an old teacher a teacher that was all she was known as these days all those who had known her when she was a mighty leader of the anti council act were long dead with fresh determination she neared the tree and bent in the damp soil to pull the small watertight box she knew would be waiting there from between its roots she stared at the box for a long time her fingers lingering over the moist wood lightly touching the tiny lock at that touch there was a small clicking sound and the box cracked open ever so slightly with trembling fingers she opened the box inside was only a slip of old parchment on which was written in helga loopy handwriting to the well organized mind death is but the next great adventure my dearest sister i cannot wait to see you again come home beloved friend yours for always and for ever helga when they found rowena ravenclaw still body the next morning after an extensive search conducted by worried students teachers and family she had a soft smile on her calm pale face it seemed like the wrinkles on her thin face straightened and that she was once again young sir raymond who was the one to carry the feather light body back to hogwarts could only be comforted in his grief by one thing in his imagination his stern grandmother was once again the young woman his grandfather had fallen in love with the one he had only known through the portraits done for his mother and uncle births he could see her well her auburn hair flowing in a light breeze her hazel eyes glowing with ill suppressed excitement pushing through a dark veil and finding herself with her beloved godric again she was home and thus with the departure of the fourth founder of hogwarts and the last of the great wielders of magic of the time ended the golden era of the wizarding world and the earth itself prepared to enter a new age in which many an adventure would occur but those adventures are someone else to tell our tale ends here and remains entombed within the pages of history a tale of magic a tale of knights a tale of love a tale of a time long gone the end a n that was it goodbye my friends hopefully we shall meet again i sorry for pilfering dumbledore line but i felt as though rowena needed that comfort knowing that her friend was still with her even though she had died long before and that line was just perfect for that and now my announcement next week i am planning on uploading the first chapter or rather the prologue of this story prequel it is called fall from grace and will feature the lives and loves of ryan and rosalind ravenclaw gawain and ceridwen gryffindor searlas and seraphine slytherin ambrosius sir rhys and the whole lot before the founders came along if for some reason my plans are foiled then the aforementioned prologue would appear in two weeks i hope to see you all there for the brand new adventures or rather age old ones of all those characters who were only mentioned or appeared at the sidelines of tale in the meanwhile for those who liked my style i have another story posted here which portrays the marauders era if it interests you then i d be happy if you go and take a look thank you all once again for reading my story and sticking with it through thick and thin ice and fire four months of update lack and all my other weird quirks i love you all and i hope to see you all again hugs and kisses star of the north disclaimer everything here besides the few things you dontknow belongs to jk rowling creator of the worlds of harry potter a n here another chapter for your enjoyment i really feel like i should apologize to all of you who read the story of four friends i should have updated it before updating this but i already had most of this chapter written down and nothing of chapter 16 of four friends so i promise to update four friends by saturday deal chapter 3 daughter of the warrior it was always presumed that godric gryffindor was a rash man he was best known for his impulsiveness and hot temper most records of the time describe him as the one first to attack and last to retreat a habit that commended him in the eyes of many yet condemned him in the eyes of others one of those others was lord ambrosius chief warlock of the council of warlocks a man considered by many to have doomed the destiny of the council lord ambrosius recognized godric as a powerful enemy and made to weaken him as much as he possibly could even before gryffindor realized the extent of his strengths his first step was to ensure that gawain gryffindor godric father place at the council was given to a member of a family holding a grudge against the house of gryffindor upon the great wizard death thus blocking godric from receiving the full authorities of his house what he did next was so heinous that it is a wonder that no one had protested lord ambrosius made both godric and his best friend salazar slytherin servants of the council being a servant of the council meant two things the first the servant is forever bound to the will of the council and has to obey to every whim of any member the second the servant can never become a member of the council even when a place had opened lord ambrosius had sentenced the two young men to a life of servitude without repay he believed that this way he managed to get himself rid of two nuisances at once he was wrong and because of his mistake the council was soon to lose all its powers hogwarts a history author unknown the girl no longer resembled a haystack for certain godric barely recognized her at first which he felt weird because he had a good memory for faces and her face was on his mind ever since they visited culhwch only later on when her mother sent her to bed did he realize that he did not recognize her because she had changed when last he saw her five years prior she had a gangly scratched and neglected sort of look to her he distinctly remembered a smudge of mud on her face now however she had her auburn hair severely pulled back its curls dropping to her shoulders in a bright cascade her dress was not ripped as before and she had all skirts and knots in place she also held herself differently back then she was haughty and even in company of the other girls seemed isolated when he laid his eyes on her that night however the haughtiness turned into simple pride and openness she knew what she was and no longer felt defensive of it blue certainly complimented her and the dark shade of her dress looked fantastic in contrast to her coppery locks she had a mouth on her never in his life had a woman opened her mouth on him they were always demure and submissive letting him have his way never had he met a woman who dared retorting to whatever he had to say it was refreshing if somewhat irking he noticed salazar sending him pointed glances and realized her was staring and that the girl mother was in plain sight i do apologize for my daughter noble lords the older woman said suddenly i tried weaning her from this directness of hers but nothing seems to work now i would require your names and your mission it has been a long time since any of the magic community had tried contacting me it is us who must apologize madam godric said with a quick bow we are the ones who burst into your house i am godric gryffindor of wild moor and this is my friend and brother salazar slytherin of the fen we have come here by the will of the council of warlocks to search for one rosalind ravenclaw would it be imprudent of me to assume that you are indeed madam ravenclaw she watched him unblinkingly through her almost golden eyes finally she said yes i am rosalind ravenclaw lord gryffindor now would you be as kind as to tell me what the council wants from me straight to the point godric liked that he hated it when people walked round and round matters for hours skirting the pressing issues without actually getting there truth be told madam salazar said is that we are not entirely sure what the council wants but it would be a safe assumption to say that it is not the council that wants your presence as much as it is the chief warlock the chief warlock she asked softly is it still old lord fenwick i am afraid not madam godric said gravely lord fenwick died in mysterious circumstances four years ago his second in command and might i add murderer has taken his place godric salazar said in outrage what if someone would have heard you ambrosius could get you executed for this who could have heard me here there are no wizards or witches in miles and that is the truth we all know very well that ambrosius murdered fenwick because the old man just wont die it a guess it was never proven that doesntmean he didn t ambrosius madam ravenclaw was silent for so long that they almost forgot she was there you said ambrosius is chief warlock ambrosius of york you know him salazar asked know him as much as someone could get to know that byproduct of filth madam ravenclaw who up to that moment was sitting calmly in her chair flared all of a sudden i used to consider him one of my greatest friends then what happened godric asked in interest salazar disliked ambrosius that much was true but he never seemed to hate him with the same fervour as godric he was delighted to find someone whose views on the chief warlock were as negative as his what happened ryan happened she got up and went to the fireplace with gentle hands she removed a polished sword from above the mantelpiece then she went to the corner of the room and opened an old cabinet with a rusty creak godric could not see what it was she pulled out until she returned and laid both objects and the sword on the table in front of them the sword was one bearing the signs of extensive use it had been sharpened constantly but bore the dents of long years in battle the leather sleeve covering the sword hilt was well worn so were the scabbard and the belt she pulled from the cabinet the second thing she pulled from the cabinet was a shield carrying a crest of a knight an eagle beneath the eagle were the words raven lord godric stared at the shield and sword in awe without even looking he could tell that salazar was doing the self same thing it was not every day that you were facing the artefacts of a legend you you were married to he managed to let out ryan ravenclaw yes i was ryan raven lord yes dear merlin she smiled sadly i am sure he would have loved to meet you to had he lived that was not an end fit for the most celebrated knight of the wizarding world he spluttered why didntthe council do anything to help madam ravenclaw sighed only now did godric realize that this was no young woman in front of him not old certainly but someone who had lost so much and aged considerably in the course of years the council especially under ambrosius rule no longer cares for us not since ryan left it all those years ago ryan raven lord was a legend in the ranks of young wizards of the wizarding world his adventures were told and retold so many times that he seemed a giant even while alive he was the leader of the knights of the phoenix an order long since disbanded warriors who used both magic and muggle weapons in battles it was their mission to protect the magic community of enemies godric was one of those who walked their path and lived according to their lore the most famous story told of raven lord was his departure it was made even more so because of the mysterious reasons which caused him to leave the story told was that one day raven lord was summoned to face the chief warlock and his second in command when they were done he was furious he stormed out of stonehenge and faced his knights his speech became legendary and almost every one in the country soon knew it by heart with the slight adjustments of mouth to ear telling gawain gryffindor however who was one of raven lord most trusted knights and was there stored his memories in a pensieve and godric would listen to it again and again since childhood and knew it word by word just as the knights had heard it my brothers in arms my friends i have grave news for you ryan raven lord cried facing all his knights his long hair flowing wild in the violent wind his cheeks tear stricken and his voice cracking this is the very last you will see of me i have talked and conferred with the chief warlock and his minions for the past few hours they want to make the knights of the phoenix a guard of honour to our illustrious council members they wish us to become nothing but bodyguards they claim that there is no need to waste the money of the people and continue funding our operations they claim that the money will be better used in us standing like dumb muggles in colourful costumes and parade for the enjoyment of all those petty lords they say that the community can protect itself and that their amusement is much more important than the safety of anyone else i have argued with them and refused to receive the position of general if the meaning of this is the degradation of everything we ever stood for for that they had given me an ultimatum i am to do as they say or face eternal exile on the pain of death raven lord paused for breath there was deathly silence in the air all the knights knew beyond doubt what their leader decision was he took a deep breath readying himself and said i have chosen exile i was given a day and a night to pack everything i have and leave the wizarding world once i bid you farewell i will take my lady rosalind and remove myself from the reach of the council in a matter of minutes lord ambrosius will come and speak to you he will command you to take your new position and leave all your duties the only thing i can ask of you is that you refuse this goes against everything we ever believed in stand united against him i warn you this ambrosius will be the end of the wizarding world if he is not stopped do not listen to him he poisoned lord fenwick mind but you are stronger stand firm and spit in the face of the false contender you are the knights of the phoenix you are invincible go to your families and protect them leave this abomination of a ruler you are all my brothers and it was an honour beyond measure to lead you and serve alongside you farewell and to the sound of a hundred knights hailing him ryan raven lord mounted his proud steed and thundered into the sunset never to be seen again godric almost shivered as he looked at the weapons craving to touch but not daring madam ravenclaw sighed everyone knows that ryan refused a change of job and that caused the great rift between him and the council and ended up in his exile but that only half true ambrosius loved me in his own twisted way he was cruel and possessive but in whatever concerned me he was the gentlest of men but then ryan and i fell in love merlin how that cankered his soul he fashioned himself the greatest of wizards of his time and the most irresistible of men you have seen him i sure you can see how impressive and formidable he is can you not even in his old age and there you have my ryan all knees and elbows and scrawniness and yet he was the one i chose she wiped a tear that fell on her cheek and godric heart clenched inside him he wanted to say something but she went on so ambrosius tried everything in his power to humiliate and discredit ryan but all was in vain here she smiled a small victorious smile even his final plan where he knew ryan would rather take exile than watch the desecration of everything he held dear came crashing down on him in the end making ryan come out the hero and raven lord also got the girl didnthe godric said with a smile oh yes she laughed that too ryan got the girl and ambrosius remained this bitter old man i wish rowena could have known her father for what he really was there was a note of regret in her voice then why dontyou tell her madam salazar asked gently she can know now she shook her head ryan did not want her to grow up in that shadow she doesntknow why we live so much apart of anyone magical she doesntknow that her father was an exile ryan made sure of that he also made me promise to never tell her who he was before she was born he did not want any reminders of that time it hurt him till the day he died we hid his armour and shield only leaving the sword out she knows her father was a warrior that she does know but we made sure to never say a word on her father legacy that was how he wanted it they sat in silence for a while then she said so what does ambrosius wants from me all we know madam salazar said is that it has something to do with your charming abilities and your research on long distance travel by magic ah she said with disapproval godric hoped it was not directed at him she seemed to read his mind she let out a short bitter laugh and said oh there is nothing wrong with what you did lord gryffindor are you gawain son i expected that much you look just like him as i was saying it not what you did or you for that matter son of searlas slytherin yes i do recognize the name i grew up knowing both your fathers ryan was devastated when he heard of their deaths no i should have expected this i have been researching this even before i married ryan and ambrosius knew it i assume he knows me well enough to guess that i would not abandon my field of interest even for my dear ryan she paused and then said i will not come godric and salazar stared at her as if not comprehending her words you will not come godric finally uttered she shook her head not for all the galleons in the world but salazar started it the council will i dontcare if it the council will madam ravenclaw burst suddenly godric was afraid this was a woman who suffered a lot this was a woman who knew very well whom she was facing and she did not care one bit what is the council to me had the council not exiled my husband many of the magic community would still be amongst us if it was not for ambrosius the knights of the phoenix would never have disbanded their order if it was not for his stiff necked decision they would have been able to continue and save lives if it was not for him ryan would not have died if it was not for the council your own father would have lived her fiery eyes locked on godric eyes and he knew the truth of her words his father was murdered by muggles if the knights of the phoenix were still doing their job gawain gryffindor would still be alive enough of this for tonight she said with finality accio clothes she summoned dry clean tunics and trousers flew to her she handed them to the two men unceremoniously they belonged to my husband wear them till your own clothes will be fit to be worn again you may sleep in front of the fire goodnight and she stormed out of the room taking her husband shield with her godric looked at salazar helplessly and said this is going to be much tougher than we thought salazar shrugged and changed into the dry clothes then curled in his cloak in front of the fire and fell promptly asleep godric followed his lead almost immediately falling into a sleep punctured by dreams of his family and how much he missed them all at first godric was not sure what woke him up it was only when he heard the front door close that he realized that someone had left the house it took him a while to get his bearings right he was not at all sure at first where he was or how he got there once everything came back to him he groaned that was really not the correct way of handling things he would have to make amends once madam ravenclaw was up he pulled himself from the floor his neck creaking after staying in an unnatural pose all night long he was used to it and besides sleeping on a floor in front of a fireplace was much better than on earth and stone in front of a meager campfire the air in the room grew stuffy he really needed fresh air but he was also very hungry eating nothing since the night before when they left culhwch he contemplated what to do what am i thinking he chided himself this is not my home i have no right to go and rummage in madam ravenclaw pantry what i should do is go for a walk and hopefully by the time i back the woman will be awake and offer us some breakfast with that settled he opened the front door cautiously making as little sound as possible and sneaked outside he stood just outside the house and marveled at the great difference between the night before when he and salazar cursed every inch of the way and that morning when everything was an unblemished white as he watched the snow he suddenly realized that the snow was not as unblemished as he first thought it was it was dotted by light prints of small feet going hither and thither curious he followed the trail of feet as it turned about the area surrounding the house finally walking towards the small outcrop attached to the house which he recognized as the stable where he put griffith his stallion the previous night the door to the stable was slightly opened and he had no trouble to slide inside without disturbing the occupants two horses and a girl the girl rowena ravenclaw was rolling in the hay laughing wildly as though she had just heard the funniest joke in the world her hair was out of his sever knot and was full of bits and pieces of hay and earth she was only wearing her gown and nothing more making her slimmer than he thought and he felt with a start much more attractive as if she needed me to think her even more attractive he thought bitterly this girl could enchant kings he made a noise of disgust it was then that rowena noticed his presence she stopped laughing and looked up to him their eyes met and he felt his heart climb to his throat he stared at her for a long time until she started blushing and he understood in what an embarrassing position he found her he felt the corners of his mouth twitch and then without warning he began laughing he laughed and laughed till he had no more air at which point he fell to the floor and leaned against the stable wall dear merlin girl you look so funny he chocked and instantly knew that this was a mistake rowena got up to her feet her pink blush of embarrassment turned into the red tinge of anger she was furious i am not funny you pompous windbag if you must know i ve been laughing at the image of you riding that poor horse of yours and him bucking from under you and dropping you to the mud at that moment a picture appeared in godric mind a picture he did not see himself but witnessed in his father pensieve have you any idea what you could have done gryffindor raven lord stared hard into gawain eyes gawain felt a compulsion to say something to placate his commander but could think of nothing raven lord continued staring at him his cheeks flushed red in anger his long hair full of dirt from the scuffle he just had had to break gawain had never seen him that angry before oh sure he could cuff a young knight for being foolish or say something harsh when someone was out of place but angry never not ryan raven lord he had been foolish and rash attacking lord llyr when the man insulted gawain choice of a bride ceridwen but he could not let it lay raven lord must realize that he tried to explain but raven lord turned his head in disgust i need none of this gawain you are a better man than he is never forget that never descend to his level he is a creature of ambrosius and therefore an enemy of what we stand for one day i may not be here and i need you to promise that you will go on in my footsteps just remember that and make sure that this never happens again and he strode off living gawain to ponder the mystery that was his commander rowena glare intensified each and every moment until with an indignant huff she strode off angrily godric smiled to himself she was truly the daughter of her father and who is better to change the destinies of the wizarding world other than the warrior daughter a n liked it it was fun writing please go now and review and tell me what you think to my reviewers freespirit65 oh yeah shudders homework is the worst thing ever is ignoring the glaring pile of homework beside her nope d not telling you ll have to wait and see eratosthenese why thank you cecilia orechio well i suppose you re right but then what would be written in hogwarts a history if not the tale of hogwarts from the very beginning it has to have something on the founders and it a pretty heavy long book isntit the thing about apparation is that rosalind has been developing it for the less able wizards and witches she one of the few who can actually do it rowena father couldntdo it unfortunately you know i didntthink of it

starting from wednesday seeya all disclaimer everything here besides the few things you dontknow belongs to jk rowling creator of the worlds of harry potter a n well i didntget to write as much as i hoped i would and i update this later than i expected but i do hope this amounts to your expectations chapter 4 the long winter rowena ravenclaw is credited to many of the protections surrounding the castle of hogwarts one of her chief contributes is what came to be known as the anti apparration field around the castle what makes this field so rare and unique first of all it is one of the largest and strongest fields ever to be erected secondly it is the oldest field that ever existed in the wizarding world and has held for over a thousand years the field was cast by rowena herself though she was aided by the other three founders she was the only one of the four who knew exactly how that field was operating where had rowena ravenclaw come across the magic of the anti apparation field the answer to that is yet further into the past rowena own mother rosalind ravenclaw was one of the first to master apparation and taught her daughter accordingly back at the time apparation was one of the most difficult magic accomplishments to manage and only a rare few could do it together with rowena rosalind developed an easier method of apparating which is used to this day by many of the wizarding world armed with her first hand knowledge of the process of apparation rowena ravenclaw studied every single aspect of it and after a long and tedious time of research she managed to perfect a spell that will erect a permanent field to stop people from apparating inside its borders this was one of the very first accomplishments which showed the council of warlocks exactly whom they were facing hogwarts a history author unknown rosalind ravenclaw woke up the morning after the arrival of the two men feeling old and bitter you are barely halfway through your fifth decade she chided herself pushing the covers off her just think what ryan would have said were you to tell him that this made her feel instantly better she never told rowena that but she no longer felt empty when thinking of her lost husband she finally managed to find calm in the middle of her pain she loved ryan very much they were married for nineteen years and knew each other for far longer than that before he died and his death shattered her world to pieces another thing she will never tell her daughter was just how much she helped her during the first few months after they had managed to get hold of his burnt remains and gave him a proper burial she could still remember his face clearly as she told godric and salazar the night before he was tall and gangly and when you tried putting him in finery he seemed so ungainly his long hair was auburn just like rowena but in recent years the stress of his less than self imposed exile started showing and it had silver streaks shooting through it oh how she loved pushing her hand through those long locks and his eyes those endearing pale blue eyes showing what he felt immediately he could always control his face but his eyes betrayed him every time she wiped a tear from the corner of her eye she wished she had taken that portrait that hung on the wall of his room when they had to flee from the wrath of the council the portrait in which the artist had drawn ryan in his full battle gear only when he was in his armour and holding his weapons did ryan look at home but he said the portrait would weigh them down and anyway what would she do with it it was just another portrait and now all these years ahead of that day she hated herself for listening to him she had nothing to remember him by apart of the sword and the shield the armour he had hidden somewhere refusing to tell her where he wanted to hide it all from rowena he wanted her to grow up happy and unaware of his past life but ryan could not stop rosalind from telling rowena of her previous life it was true that she loved ryan but not even for love would she give up her main interest in life charms rosalind ravenclaw was one of the best charmers still alive she could do practically everything with a wand from knitting socks to cooking banquets there was nothing she could not do she was a very strong witch but the council of warlocks refused to acknowledged that and aid her various researches it was common knowledge that witches could not be stronger than wizards after all nothing they said however could contradict the fact that she was one of the very few who could transport themselves from one place to another in mere seconds it was a dangerous sort of spell it could go wrong in so many places it was rosalind mission in life to turn this method of travel into something most if not all of the magic community could do and it was proving to be harder than she ever thought she fondly remembered a day back when rowena was a small child when ryan was out in the garden trying to convince his vegetable patch that actually producing vegetables is a good idea and rowena was sitting with a tome almost as big as her propped against a vase reading she had decided it was time to get back to work she knew that before rowena was born she was very close to cracking the way but had abandoned her works in favour of taking care of her daughter she struggled with it day by day ryan knew nothing of it since he was always outside trying to make their lives a bit better growing his garden fixing the house or feeding roland his old warhorse after a year of struggling she felt like giving up guessing that she had lost the touch during her long break it was then that rowena walked into the room took a glance at her sketches and asked mother isntit possible that if you change the pronunciation of this word the magic will flow better and there will be less resistance of physical substance rowena was seven back then that day she began her magical education and so for the past thirteen years rowena has been assisting her in her research they almost managed it the year before they had actually succeeded in making helga travel to a location almost quarter of a mile off in a blink of an eye up until then helga had never managed the spell it was very encouraging but still it needed perfecting shaking herself from her reminiscing rosalind pulled on her clothes it was very cold the winter was going to be longer than usual she could feel it in her bones shivering she picked up her winter cloak and wrapped it snugly around her thin body she twisted her hair into a tight knot covered it with a simple net made of copper and tucked a few stray locks of hair back in feeling like the dignified matron she was supposed to be rosalind ravenclaw walked out of her bedroom and marched purposefully into the house main room upon entering the room she noticed a few things someone had stirred the fire back to life using the limited supply of wood they kept inside the girls would have to go and fetch some more when they get up she thought the fire was crackling merrily in the fireplace throwing every now and then a spark on the already singed threadbare hearthrug the strangers clothes were spread on two chairs in front of the fire getting dry she avoided drying clothes by magic if she could it always made them stiff and unpleasant to the touch for a long while after the men were no longer asleep and for that matter only one of them was to be seen salazar slytherin was sitting calmly at the scrubbed dinning table and read a book from rosalind small library she had acquired many of these books with great cost she even filched a few from her own father library salazar did not seem to notice her presence he was engrossed in a thick book bound with blue velvet she could recognize it without even looking at the name the legacy of the phoenix it was a book that many would have given their right arms so they could take a mere glimpse at there were only three copies ever made two of them were in rosalind possession though she did not know where one was it was a book that told the history of the order of the knight of the phoenix all four hundred thirty six years of it from the day merlin had initiated the first knight before his disappearance into the pages of history and to the day when ryan raven lord had called for the disbanding of the order it was written by ryan himself who meticulously made two more copies of his book after he finished writing it in exile one copy he sent to lord ambrosius who thinking he had the only copy hid it and said that whoever will try reading it will be sentenced to death the second copy he kept in the library the one salazar was now reading but had rosalind charm it so that rowena would never be able to read it the last copy the original one he hid together with his armour and rosalind had the feeling that he was hoping that one day rowena would find them both and realize what kind of man her father really was she cleared her throat lightly making salazar jump she smiled sorry for startling you my lord good morning would you like a spot of breakfast he nodded getting up and putting the book back in place it frustrates rowena to no end that she cantread that book she answered his unasked question turning to her pantry and taking out various commodities she needed for making breakfast yes i was wondering just that he said seeing as you told us last night raven lord did not want her to know i charmed the book to his request rowena nor helga for that matter cantread this book i thought the only copy existing is in ambrosius clutches may i help you with something she snorted while mixing flour water and spices in a big wooden bowl ryan had many faults but stupidity was not one of them lord slytherin he sent ambrosius the book from our exile just to tweak his nose just so he would know that ryan was not completely out of the picture here you can cut the meat make the slices nice and thin otherwise helga will not eat it she handed him a lump of salted venison and a sharp knife in any case ryan made three copies i dontknow what happened to one but i in possession of this one you may read it but if you dare telling rowena anything about that i ll hex your ears off she knew that even with her kitchen apron and a bowl of dough she could look threatening she had been perfecting it for years to prevent rowena from stealing cookies before dinner was served salazar seemed to catch that as well and did not continue that specific discussion cutting the salted meat into the thinnest slices he could where is your friend she asked suddenly i haventseen him when i came here godric he said he usually likes to get up early and look in on his horse he very attached to griffith his father gave him that palomino when he was five just before gawain was murdered i think that animal is more than half magical living that long and still looking as young as he does he twenty years old rosalind felt a wave of pity washing over her i knew gawain very well she said softly and your father as well though for different reasons gawain was ryan best friend even though gawain was seven years older than him they were almost inseparable back in the days when gawain was ryan second in command he used to bring ceridwen and godric over for dinner many a time when they were not off on missions for the order and your parents i knew searlas mainly because your mother seraphine and i were such good friends she being lord fenwick daughter and i being the only fitzpatrick girl we were bound to become friends when she died however searlas needed someone to cheer him up so sometimes he came together with gawain and brought you and dahlia along though you were probably too young to remember he stopped bringing you when ceridwen started tutoring godric dahlia and you in magic she sighed ryan formed a really close friendship with the two of them i thought he would die as well when news of their deaths reached us in the silence that sank after she spoke a sound of feet rushing from the back of the house was heard and into the room burst a wide awake helga good morning she said brightly arranging her half open dressing gown into a more respectable position with a slight blush when she saw salazar rosalind assumed that her prot g simply forgot they had guests good morning helga she said with a smile is rowena awake as yet helga frowned i thought she was already up and about didntyou send her to collect a bit of wood rosalind was about to say something when the door to the house slammed open and inside stormed an angry rowena for merlin sake girl rosalind said appalled at her daughter scanty attire go and dress yourself appropriately we have men in the house rowena did not even spare her another glance before disappearing in the direction of her bedroom i terribly sorry for my daughter behaviour lord slytherin i cannot imagine what got into her i afraid i am somewhat to blame madam a new voice said from the doorway godric entered with his arms full of firewood he put his load not far from the fireplace and went to shut the door close rosalind waited for an explanation her eyes frosty if he had done something to my rowena godric settled himself in a chair next to the table and said i stumbled upon her when i went to have a look on my horse she was sitting on a heap of hay laughing she just looked so funny that i started laughing as well i think she took offense rosalind released a breath she was not aware of holding and here i was expecting the worse she scolded herself for thinking so low of her guest breakfast was a rather simple affair a fresh loaf of bread sliced salted venison with mustard sauce helga favourite dish she could eat it morning afternoon and evening just as long as the meat was sliced thin homemade raspberry jam and a few winter vegetables miserably small but edible when they were all done rosalind managed making rowena be civilized to godric and vice versa by simply telling them that the first to say something snide to the other will spend the night in the stable rosalind decided it was time to tell the men something that they were unaware of because of being strangers to the glen are you aware of the fact that you will be spending the entire winter here she asked what godric asked surprised you have been outside have you not yes only snow we can no she cut him short you cannot the snow is about ten feet deep the only reason the house is not bogged in is the magic defences which rowena erected here a few years back to replace the old ones ryan and i put everywhere else is covered by feet of snow then there no problem you did not let me finish when you get closer to the mouth of the glen however the snow becomes treacherous and you are more likely to sink seven feet down and die even magic will not help you once you are down you are stuck here whether you like it or not salazar and godric exchanged worried glances the women were silent and therefore the sudden hissing noise was clearly heard what was that helga demanded in fright you should tell them godric said to salazar but salazar protested they ll find out sooner or later they had better learn it from you salazar sighed then to rosalind surprise he hissed something to the general direction of his wrist when the hissing was over a small scaled head appeared tentatively from inside the cuff of his borrowed tunic a tiny forked tongue darted out of the creature mouth tasting the air snake helga shrieked her name is moreen salazar said in an insulted tone you are a parselmouth rowena said softly he nodded in appreciation moreen is my friend and constant companion she just said that madam ravenclaw is right and that godric and i will have to stay here until the winter snows give in very well rosalind said briskly then we need to reassign the house chores she felt like smirking when she saw the panicky look shared by the two men the winter was long just as rosalind expected it to be it seemed to go faster because they all had their own chores to do they would start the morning with rosalind making breakfast she usually got up long before them all and by the time they all picked themselves out of their beds or improvised mattresses in godric and salazar case she already had food on the table then godric and salazar were shooed out of the house a hard fit to accomplish as it was freezing cold outside and they were reluctant to leave the warm interior and were sent to get a fresh pile of firewood for the day rowena and helga would go to the stable helga to milk the old goat salazar and godric made faces when first they tasted cheese made of goat milk but got used to it after a few weeks time who shared the stable with the two horses griffith and cian and rowena to take care of the horses and replenish their food stocks rosalind wondered where her daughter got the oats and hay since they didntkeep much just enough for the goat she suspected rowena traveled to culhwch every now and then by what ways she had no idea and filched enough food to last the horses and the goat for a week she never asked since the time when rowena told her rather grimly ask me no questions and i will tell you no lies after they had all done their morning chores rosalind settled them down to dry the cleaned dishes and put them all to place it was a rare event if godric and rowena did not fight during the half hour they spent in the kitchen every day it usually started because of godric for example there was a time when he dropped a very valuable crystal fruit bowl rosalind received from one of her brothers as a wedding gift rowena who needed only the mildest excuse to explode started berating him for being such a clumsy oaf and destroying such an important thing of her mother and that it was so beyond repair rosalind merely pointed her wand at the bits of crystal and muttered reparo putting it all back together then there was the time when he had accidentally on purpose stepped on her foot and bruised her pale skin she let out such a blood curdling scream that rosalind was sure the muggles ten miles away could hear her godric sulked around the house all day after that sporting a pair of hairy ears after their morning chores either godric or salazar would take hold of the legacy of the phoenix and read it while the other one practiced magic or sword movements in the corner of the main room whenever godric was in possession of the book rowena would send dirty glances in his direction and mutter profanities under her breath she thought her mother could not hear her but rosalind was just tired of threatening her with washing her mouth with soap when the men read and practiced rowena and rosalind would continue their travel by magic research asking for helga aid every now and then when they wanted to check whether she could do this spell or that gesture helga herself would study from the magic tomes she never told rosalind what exactly she was doing but rowena seemed to know so that was good enough for the older woman they ate a late midday meal afterwards they would lounge for a while read or play chess the men would disappear every now and then and do whatever it was they did she never bothered to pry it was during the evening that the worst godric versus rowena fights took place when they actually had to spend time with each other that did not consist of each of them doing their separate things i swear to you gryffindor if you dontstop i ll hex your face from here to rome i ll wrap your intestines around a stake and leave you alive for as long as i can that was the latest rowena threat it was given in retaliation to a really nasty joke godric played on her he turned her queen into a slug and when she attempted prodding her when the small chess piece refused to move the sluggish queen stuck to her hand and would not let go it was just a harmless joke why are you taking things so bloody heavily you are the worst prude i had ever met ignoring the shouting match as best he could salazar said no offense to your hospitality madam ravenclaw but i hoping that the snow will melt soon quite understandable my lord but you ll be happy to know that i think that by next thursday you will be able to leave the glen godric stopped in mid retaliation finally i cantwait to get out of this this thing vicinity salazar rolled his eyes knowing full well that this declaration was just asking for a sharp retort from rowena he hurriedly cut her off then it is time to discuss our mission again madam ravenclaw mission rosalind asked feeling a sinking emotion in the pit of her stomach she had been avoiding this specific discussion for the past two months we still need to bring you to face lord ambrosius and the council a n another chapter is done what did you think go on tell me what you think review to my reviewers calla now isntthat about time you d show up i glad you enjoy this and i stand by my word he is not cecilia orechio when exactly is thanksgiving it too long away anyway i suppose what happened on the previous chapter is that i went a bit back to the point where rowena and helga are sent to bed they had no idea what rosalind discussed with salazar and godric and this was where i explained a bit about rowena background and exactly what did godric do in the stable when he found rowena there i think you got confused with the sentence the girl no longer resembled a haystack for certain i was referring there to the way godric described rowena to gwyneth in the first chapter sorry if i got you confused freespirit65 thank you have you updated your story by the way eratosthenese thanks d bb yay everybody loves rowena godric interaction there a bit more in this chapter and quite a bit more in the next sara you mean i describe things in too much detail hmm should work on that i having the story beta d now so hopefully the next chapter i upload would be a beta d one thank you shadow n the dark thank you thank you bows extravagantly oh i like ryan very much myself fortunately as cruel as it may sound i wrote his death scene before i actually wrote his background and got attached to him disclaimer everything here besides the few things you dontknow belongs to jk rowling creator of the worlds of harry potter a n hello people once again i late in updating school tends to do that to people i afraid however this chapter is a bit longer than the ones preceding it so i hope it makes up for its lateness enjoy oh and if you enjoy reading marauders era fics i ve decided that i will try and recommend a few for you my own fic yeah yeah i know i am shameless the story of four friends a work in progress cecilia orechio the time guardian and the prophecies a work in progress white lily blossom seasons and changing ways one shot complete i like reading marauders era fics so if any of you writes any or knows of recommended ones i would like you to share thanks chapter 5 book and armour in modern times most of the wizarding world views salazar slytherin as the one who ruined the founders unity most people believe it was his dislike to those of muggle heritage that resulted in his leaving the school naturally we cannot cast all the blame on him for in truth it is equally shared by all four founders who in the late years of their lives started disagreeing with each other on minor issues concerning the way they should run the school however truth or falsity what is remembered by all is salazar departure why had he left what was the main reason behind his angry leave taking the obvious reply because he disliked muggle borns does not hold sway for it is known that helga hufflepuff herself was of muggle heritage if the reason for his departure was only hate to muggle blood why did he help founding hogwarts to begin with he knew for a fact that helga was one and still he aided the founding so yes one of his reasons for leaving was definitely his disagreement with the others concerning the admission of muggle borns to the school but was it all hogwarts a history author unknown what this helga thought turning sharply to look at the woman who had been like a surrogate mother to her for the past two years almost as if she heard helga words rowena demanded what this rowena rosalind voice was slightly too shrill to helga liking whatever the two men had to discuss with her was not going to be good rosalind voice continued climbing into panicky tones i want you and helga in bed now helga started getting up from her chair even though she wanted more than anything else to listen in on them no helga was shocked she stared at her best friend never in her life had rowena dared disobeying her mother she was always the obedient daughter rosalind never had to issue a command more than once but now now rowena was standing auburn hair loose from its knot skirts wrinkled eyes blazing she looked almost wild didntyou hear what i said rosalind demanded in a sharp tone blotches of red appearing on her face mute testimony to her anger oh i heard you well enough mother rowena seethed and i said no i am twenty year old you cantcuddle me for ever what are they talking about who is lord ambrosius what is this council why do you have to face them i will not leave till i have some sort of an answer you ve kept me in the dark long enough and i have had enough i know you and father have been keeping secrets from me i know that you think i canthandle things but you re wrong you always underestimated me i knew there was something weird going on for a long time long before father was murdered you should have hidden the book from me not charm it so i cannot see what written i have a brain and i can use it as you of all people must know helga watched rosalind with bated breath the woman anger seemed to rise as if to match her daughter s but when she spoke her voice was deathly calm you will go to your room now rowena and you will go there without protest you are still my daughter and therefore honour bound to do everything i tell you till you are married i dontwant to repeat this twice rowena lowered her head to anyone but helga it would have looked like the young woman deferred to her elder but she knew better she unlike rosalind and the two men had a clear view to her friend eyes the glint in them was the farthest away from defeat let us go helga she said in a deceptively sweet voice helga glanced at rosalind and then hurried after the already retreating rowena the moment the door to the main room closed behind them rowena put a finger to her lips telling helga to keep quiet she tiptoed to the door and put her ear to it what are you doing helga hissed listening in naturally rowena whispered with a mild grin mother will immediately know if i will use magic but she cantdetect good old muggle tricks can you go and fetch our water cups helga nodded and walked to their room making as little noise as she possibly could what muggle tricks did her friend think of using what had the glasses to do with it how on earth did rowena think of something when she the muggle born did not she picked up their glasses and went back to where rowena was pressing her ear to the door she handed her one and watched as she put the glass to the door it supposed to enhance the sound rowena explained in a soft voice put it to the door and listen she did as she was told glad that rowena deemed her worthy to eavesdrop together with her great merlin woman came godric voice i have no idea what he wants how many times do we have to explain this to you we are merely the delivery service we do what we are told and when exactly did the son of gawain gryffindor become a mere delivery boy your father would never have stooped so low said rosalind dontyou talk to me like this madam i have done you no wrong i am a man of honour and i have been commanded by the council to bring you to face it that is what i will do so much for the pride of the gryffindors rosalind said scornfully sticking to a corrupt system just because it is the system madam said salazar softly it is not willingly that we do as the council commands us we have been sworn servants of the council eleven years ago we cannot disobey them there was a shocked silence for a while before rosalind said weakly i didntrealize forgive me but why both your families were members of the first house since the day the council was founded you are part of the council and if you are servants then then we cannot rejoin the council godric said bitterly ever oh yes ambrosius knew exactly who he had to take out in order to have everything his way he found a way to make sure that the gryffindors and the slytherins will never plague the council again with their troublesome manner still rosalind said softly i will not come with you when he had exiled ryan ambrosius lost any kind of friendship that may have been between us he had doomed the two of us and our child to an outcast life and indirectly he had cause ryan untimely death for that he has my eternal hatred if i lay my eyes on him i might just as well kill him for what he had done there is no forgiveness i shall remain here till the day i die next to her helga felt rowena involuntarily flinch what was this about exile what was it that rosalind and ryan kept from their daughter but dontyou understand madam ambrosius will have you if that is what he wants said salazar he may have done a mistake by sending the two of us who are reluctant to do his will but if we come empty handed he will just send more willing servants and get you anyway i will not come madam i suppose that what he wants from me is my research on instant transportation i rather die before i see the research of my life in the hands of that murderer you will just have to go back empty handed my lords and what about your daughter godric asked what about her rosalind voice was sharp will you always keep her like this in the dark not knowing who her father was not knowing that most of the wizarding world regards him as something close to a hero the day she ll find the book i believe he had hidden for her will be the day she will learn never then because you will never tell her of the book exactly i love her too much to let her know i think we got the gist of the matter rowena muttered to helga let go to bed and she walked to the bedroom i dontget it helga said truthfully what happened there rowena slid out of her clothes and into her nightdress well from what i understood there this government sort of thing called the council it is headed by a man called ambrosius and from the tone of their words i think neither mother nor that pair like him much that an understatement helga said dryly i think the phrase your mother used was i might as well kill him rowena chuckled i never thought mother could say such a thing anyway so this ambrosius fellow exiled mother and father for some reason and somehow got lords gryffindor and slytherin out of the council and did something that prevents them from influencing the council now he wants something to do with mother research concerning travel by magic and he sent them to fetch mother but mother will not have it that is about it helga followed rowena lead and changed into her nightgown she expected rowena to get into bed but the other woman surprised her she closed and opened various drawers and boxes in the room frantically searching for something what are you looking for something i filched from father a long time ago rowena answered her head stuck deep inside their wardrobe what helga was surprised why would you filch something from your own father because i was curious about things she said as if it explained everything curious about what well i was just six at the time so i did not really understand and my reading was not very good what are you babbling about just get to the point please i getting there anyway father used to disappear a lot back then and when he came back his clothes were covered with dirt and grass stains so one day mother was too busy doing something and she asked me to wash his clothes for him when you wash clothes what is the first thing you do err helga looked at her friend uncertainly not sure if this was a rhetorical question or not come on helga it not a trick question what is the first thing you do sorry raven search the pockets of course so that nothing left there by mistake will get wet exactly so i search the pockets and what do i find a piece of parchment with a doodle on it it was not a very good one it had a few crooked lines and a big x on it a map you think of it now when you re eighteen but i was six and i thought it was simply a doodle father made to pass the time so i put it in my room and meant to return it to him only you never did that right now i want to find it why because of the book mother was talking about if i not very much mistaken it will lead me to the book i think that father meant for me to find the map otherwise how could he have expected me to find it he probably put the parchment there just so i would find it he knew i wouldntbe able to know what it is when i was six i think he guessed i ll remember it at some point and realize what it is that is a lot of assuming raven helga said carefully not wanting to spoil rowena excitement it might really be just a doodle i doubt it now where is it helga winced as something metallic crashed on the floor it was a tin box its lid fell on impact with the floor and everything in it scattered damn rowena swore and then froze the sound of running feet came from the corridor and the door burst open to reveal rosalind a very scared rosalind for that matter what are you doing she demanded upon seeing rowena trying to pick up a selection of stones pieces of parchment carved pieced of wood and the like she seemed to have regained her composure sorry mother rowena muttered not really sorry by the way her eyes rolled helga decided i was looking for my hairbrush not a very good lie considering the hairbrush was in plain sight on the bed but rosalind was preoccupied enough not to notice go to sleep she said shortly and walked out closing the door behind her that was close rowena said after a few moments here i knew i d find it sooner or later hold this please helga gingerly took from her the rather old grubby folded parchment rowena quickly put everything back into the tin box and put it back into the wardrobe where it lurked for over a decade she then retrieved the parchment from helga and unfolded it i was right she said triumphantly it is a map look helga peeked at the parchment and reluctantly nodded yes i suppose you are right what are you going to do then show it to your mother merlin no her friend said indignantly i am going to look for that book of course mother would have me completely ignorant to their past but i want to know now let go to sleep it is getting late helga shrugged and slipped into bed she was woken up early the next morning she doubted rowena meant for her to wake but the other woman dropped the hairbrush by mistake and the noise alerted helga that something was not as it should have been it was dark maybe two hours after midnight she estimated it was also very cold and she shivered beneath the warm blankets sometime during the night the fire had burnt out what are you doing she whispered startling rowena oh nothing get back to sleep helga i ll talk to you in the morning but helga mind brought to sharp awakening by rowena tone of speech refused to listen you are going to look for the book are you not the dark figure that was rowena sighed yes i am are you going to tell mother helga felt rather hurt that rowena did not trust her but said of course not i am coming with you however what you heard me i coming with you you are going to be needing help anyway he probably had it buried and you cantdig all night by yourself not waiting for rowena reply she slid out of bed and started pulling her clothes on dontforget your warm coat she said briskly nor your scarf and put an extra skirt on and your heavy stockings the snow has not entirely melted yet what are you my mother rowena grumbled no but in her absence someone has to make sure you are taking care of yourself how did you plan on leaving they might be still awake through the window oh good what through the window helga stared at the shadow that was rowena incredulously through what window our window of course come on we will have to break into the tool shed to get a shovel ready err yes i suppose i am she said though in her head her brain screamed what do you mean you suppose you are ready you are not ready climbing out of the window in the middle of the night you may get killed you may lose your way gets stuck in a bog and never be found again is she out of her mind are you out of your mind her brain continued shrieking insults at her but she calmly watched as rowena carefully unlatched their window and climbed out she heard a soft thump as her friend hit the ground five feet bellow the windowsill come on helga we donthave all day came the hissed whisper she followed her friend outside she just knew that her jump down was not as graceful as rowena s she landed straight on her behind and had to ask for rowena help to get up again rowena muffled her laughter and pulled her back up they walked a small distance in the dark when rowena deemed they were far enough to safely light her wand she muttered lumos and the small wand light flooded helga eyes rowena pulled out the map her father had drawn many years before and they started walking it was strange walking in the darkness the glen was very familiar to helga having spent there a large part of the past few years but she had never traveled it after dark especially not when winter still prevailed it was gloomy and they had trouble seeing outside the circle of wand light she had no idea for how long they walked more than two hours that was for certain but also less than four it was already starting to get light when rowena said we are here it this hollow here i sure and then they started to dig rowena went first clearing the snow from the small hollow and breaking the tough ground first using her magic to warm it by little she worked until her arms were threatening to fall or so she told helga and then they switched rowena rested until helga could not continue and they switched again it was a little after daybreak when rowena let out a cry of victory and fell to her knees her hands clearing the dark soil from a large wooden crate helga helped her until they managed to uncover the lid with combined efforts they pulled it off an armour rowena said weakly what has an armour to do with the book i dontknow raven but let at least see if there is anything else beneath it helga told her and started pulling the bits of armour out there was a preserving charm on the crate for the metal was not touched by rust nor were the leather straps rotten the metal parts were painted blue and on the breast of the suit of armour for it turned out to be a whole knight armour was a large bronze eagle beneath all the various parts of the armour was a blue velvet case with golden strings rowena picked it up reverently and untied the strings pulling out a simple leather bound notebook she opened it helga peeked from behind her shoulder the words on the first page were very simple the legacy of the phoenix a study of history by ryan raven lord of house ravenclaw is this the book she asked her friend quietly it has to be was all she said they packed the armour back into the crate then rowena levitated it and they started heading for home the way home turned out harder than she expected mostly because rowena was reading while she walked and had to be herded to the right direction by the time they reached the house two things happened one rowena finished reading the book and her face told helga that she had come to a decision and two three figures bore down on them and started talking all at the same time where have you been worried you mother to death could have been found by a wandering muggle and put to was about to go mad with worry never do that again what is it that you re levitating this final question came from godric who was more amused than worried but with that simple question he directed rosalind attention to what rowena was holding she opened and closed her mouth a few times before finally letting out in a weak voice you found the book yes i did rowena said proudly and i have read it all of it salazar asked in surprise it had taken him more than a week to finish reading it while we were walking helga said with a small grin and we found master ravenclaw armour i think she nodded at the crate that still hovered in midair no one was listening however because rowena and rosalind staring contest caught their attention so now you know rosalind said yes and what do you think i don t know what to think rowena admitted i was angry at first because you hid things from me then i was confused because i wasntsure of all that i read now i simply know what i am going to do and what is that rosalind voice was weak i am going to face the council in your stead what three voices demanded in alarm helga was simply surprised you are most certainly not rosalind said fiercely helga expected rowena to rise but it never happened her friend merely smiled a sad small smile you cannot stop me mother i want to face the man who had killed my father and tell him exactly what i think of him i want to see the faces of all the men who had helped him bring our world to such a state i want this and i will have it i know just as much as you do about our system of travel by magic and that will give me legitimate reason to come with lords gryffindor and slytherin into stonehenge if you refuse me i will find another way to go i just needed you to know the staring contest was long none of two wanted to be the first to give in but in the end rosalind lowered her eyes in defeat very well she said i can no longer keep you hear you may go and i am coming with her helga looked for the person who said that before realizing with a sinking feeling that it was her who had let these words out of her mouth helga rosalind said in shock you are not my daughter but i care for you as if you were i cannot let you go to stonehenge yes you can she said softly feeling bolder by the minute and you will i cannot stay here without rowena i always did things without her and i am not going to let her go by herself besides she said with a wry grin she is going to need a chaperone will she not what impression will she make if she comes alone with two men an unmarried girl absolutely out of the question this did not come from rosalind but from salazar why not because you are a woman that cannot be it and you know it rowena is a woman and you did not say a word against her coming that is different how rowena is from a long line of witched and wizards she knows far more than you about magic that is true but that does not make her any better than me it it does does not salazar godric finally snapped this is no time to start this argument helga may come if madam ravenclaw says she can four pairs of eyes focused on rosalind who finally said he voice quiet she may go a n and we reached the end of another chapter what did you think please review i know i going to need a lot of cheering up tomorrow i have a math quiz and to my reviewers hugs them freespirit65 i added you to my author alert you probably know this by now so i will no longer bug you about again glad you enjoyed the previous chapter and i love l j as well my other story is about them in a way miss anonymous hp laughs oh no worries there it ok that not everybody likes this relationship and i like constructive criticism when i can get it it always rewarding in way shows that someone interested enough in you story i had that conversation with my friends as well we werentsure whether ravenclaw and gryffindor had heirs at all but i decided to take this line of story anyway because it seemed interesting to me i promise you i didntdo it on purpose it was only after someone reviewed and pointed it out to me that i saw there were some similarities between my characters and the characters from the marauders era maybe it because i like those stories most take into count however that characters tend to develop as the story itself develops and in the end the characteristics for which the founders are best known will be the dominant ones thank you for your review bb thanks hope you enjoyed this chapter as well eratosthenese i continued though you had better be ready for long intervals between updates now that school is back cecilia orechio thank you very much yeah i knew a bit about thanksgiving but i wasnttoo sure i really hope this chapter was up to standard and that you enjoyed it by the way i cantwait for you to update your story sara well i figured that the way people are sorted into the different houses is by seeing what is the most dominant characteristic in them that fits into one of the houses which essentially means that it is the founder most dominant feature did that make sense at all thank you very much shadow n the dark heh d i just love love hate relationships that should give you a clue seeya all next time disclaimer everything here besides the few things you dontknow belongs to jk rowling creator of the worlds of harry potter a n this chapter is dedicated to chenelle who celebrates her birthday today or if you have a different time zone than i have then it might already be yesterday i hope you enjoy this p s dontbe confused this chapter does not start at the same point the previous one had left still do not worry you will know all that had happened in between before you finish reading this chapter enjoy chapter 8 unknown future the community was very important to the witches and wizards of the time the community protected its own even when the council failed to do so we are speaking of course of the small country communities and not of the magic community as a whole in this chapter when we will discuss that community we shall refer to it as the wizarding world the average community was small and very traditional men were considered more important than women and certainly more powerful powerful women were regarded with suspicion and were often estranged from the rest of the community for they posed a threat to the male leaders a community usually consisted of a few families living in close vicinity to each other the leader of each community came from either the oldest or strongest family the community supported its members and made sure they were all in good health that they were able to pay their taxes and did not do anything to anger neighbouring muggles to be an exile meant to be considered dead by all those who were once one family or friends it meant to be completely estranged from the community there was no one who would protect them they were always on their own for none would risk their own lives for that of an exile exiles often died in the hands of muggles hogwarts a history author unknown it rained it always rained rowena was tired of all the rain she had not been dry for three no four months it seemed that ever since that sorry episode in the council chamber they had been on the road never stopping in one place for longer than was necessary they were outcasts exiles ambrosius had decreed so rowena glared at her ale as though it held the likeness of the chief warlock in its dark brown depths in the space of two days their portraits or descriptions were to be found in each and every single wizarding home in the british isles the entire community was commanded not to harbour them on pain of death if anyone were discovered sheltering them the council would make sure that the head of the house would be killed and his wife and children made servants or exiles themselves they had been chased out of many a settlement often stoned or hexed helga arm had been broken by a large stone and only salazar meager knowledge of healing could save it salazar himself had limped for over a month after a particularly successful tripping hex had hit him godric still had a thin cute above his left eyebrow it tended to open up every few days and drip blood into his eye rowena still felt the occasional need to get rid of the contents of her stomach the kept to muggle settlements now muggles were superstitious and cruel but as long as they kept their true identities to themselves the companions could go among them safely enough salazar had bitterly told them that even the muggles worst verdict for a witch or a wizard was merciful in comparison to that of the council at least with muggles death comes relatively swiftly he had said right after they had been chased out of yet another wizarding hold this death comes out of frustration loneliness and the deprivation of magic altogether i d take the stake any day he had been shushed by godric who did not like that kind of talk and by helga who had been afraid of rowena reaction as for rowena she had merely stared moodily into the distance and after a while had softly said do you really salazar then it must be a sad thing to be you so dependant on other people and so unable to live without magic you should try it sometime maybe it will keep you in perspective salazar had gaped at her for a long while before godric had punched him in the arm and hissed something in his ear presumably reprimanding him godric behaviour had changed drastically since he was freed of the council before while naturally cheerful and optimistic he was still prone to periodic moodiness and at times when in a particularly bad mood snapped and resorted to unpleasant sarcasm he had also intently disliked rowena for some reason then again she had not liked him either so it evened out they just did not get along with each other to begin with for all those months of the past winter they had bickered to no end always at each other throat during the long ride to stonehenge their disagreements intensified rowena vowed to never tell even helga what had passed between them in those long forced hours spent together on horseback never in my life had i met someone who is so inconsiderable of other people ideals and feelings she snapped at him his close presence for all those hours for the past three days had gritted on her nerves the fact that his arms were in such close proximity to either side of her body and that his body was so tight to hers made her feel uncomfortable she had never been this close to a man who had not been her father and she disliked godric gryffindor greatly she wished salazar would never have noticed the minor problem concerning the sizes of the horses and constantly lamented for not sitting before salazar in helga stead the older man was quiet polite and always acted like a gentleman towards both women then clearly you have not met yourself he hissed for whatever i lack at these departments you lack tenfold you have no consideration whatsoever for your fellow men why is everything about you about me what of all this was about meyou were the ones to come into our peaceful life banging and shouting you were the ones to burst in on us and demand obedience from us you have no right to blame me you have no right you he started and then glancing at helga and salazar who were riding not too far away deep in conversation lowered his voice you are an obnoxious girl who had never learned how to control her impulses you have been indulged irresponsibly by a doting mother and a bitter father you my lady are a spoilt brat rowena grip on the saddle tightened her knuckles were white against the dark inlaid leather she had never felt so angry she wanted to hurt godric just as much as he had hurt her with his slander against her parents you are discourteous lord gryffindor she said coldly your manner us crude and you have no qualms insulting people you disagree with you mean yourself he cut her off scornfully i do not disagree with you i never have it is the simple matter of you keeping a grudge for five years no one can get along with you because of your habit of forming an opinion at first sight before you even get to know a person you have almost no friends in this world what do you know about people whom i dontget along with you donteven know me she snapped angrily trying to quench the tremour of sickness she felt at his accurate description of her habits i may not know you for long but i unlike you can read between the lines i ve heard the way people in culhwch speak of you they did not like you even before the knew you were a witch you were always arrogant and you looked down upon them like they were earth worms you are an unpleasant girl you have no limits in time when you will want to find a husband no one will have you your looks are nice enough but your character is ghastly i would not spend more time with you than absolutely necessary and required by the assignment you disgust me rowena could say nothing to that godric words were sharp and hurt her deeply she felt something well up in her she turned her face straight ahead and refused to speak to godric for the next few days rowena blinked back tears even remembering those harsh words hurt he had been so hateful and resentful after releasing himself from the grip of the council combined wills however godric whole demeanor had changed gone were the moody silences and snappish manner gone was the subdued expression this was godric gryffindor as he should have been a carefree cheerful man who looked the world straight in the eye and laughed at all its hardships another profound change was his sudden politeness towards her he was always friendly to helga it was impossible not to like the sunny girl it was almost a crime not to but something had changed in him in those long terrifying minutes when ambrosius backed with all the force of the council had commanded him to kill rowena when she had stood there heart thumping with fear she had looked straight into his eyes where the internal struggle was evident the most and had seen that he did not want to kill her she was his friend he never told them what it was that finally helped him throw off the will of twenty four people he seemed to want to forget covertly pretending to study a rough painting behind him she looked at godric he was steadily finishing his third tankard of ale she realized that this was one of those days godric had two modes in life she had learned stone sober or completely drunk there was no in between he seemed incapable of being tipsy salazar said it was because he was a rotten drinker getting drunk after three and a half tankards of ale or two goblets and three quarters of wine the days when he drank were those he was so frustrated with their current situation that he felt he had to be unconscious to them and to the world for a while rowena elbowed salazar take that tankard from him it his third one tonight we need to get him to bed before he starts snoring right here it took the three of us an eternity to get him upstairs last time salazar nodded and gently detached his friend from his ale that it for tonight godric let go up and put you in bed but i haventstarted on my fourth one godric protested precisely come on we will see you tomorrow morning ladies i told the innkeeper we will be leaving before noon he started looking edgy with us occupying his best rooms for a week good night they bid the men goodnight rowena drained her own tankard and helga put down her only half finished glass of cider she had taken a liking to the drink after leaving stonehenge it feels hopeless raven helga said softly so that the muggles surrounding them would not hear they were sitting on crude benches near a dying fire in a muggle inn dinning hall they had been staying there for the past week clueless as to where go next rowena had felt she had seen most of england and quite a bit of wales in the past months they could never stay in the same place for more than a few days because ambrosius had sent dozens of the chamber guard after them supposedly so he could execute them publicly it was a mind chilling thought they could do nothing we canteven go home helga said sadly not when the entire valley knows we are magic i still surprised no one had noticed us when we had left back in the spring have you even written to your mother lately rowena cringed at the accusing tone helga knew very well that she had not written in months she could not bring herself to tell her mother that she had been pronounced an outlaw in the wizarding world not really she finally admitted not meeting helga eyes i dontwant her to worry you dontwant her to worry if you didntwant that you would have written she probably worried sick because she didnthear from you in months i cantlie to her rowena snapped if i write to her i ll have to tell her everything and she will be afraid for us and may come out of the glen at the risk of her own life i dontwant this to happen so forget it she got up and ran away from helga up to their room from across the hall she could hear salazar voice giving instructions to a drunken godric she repressed a chuckle of dry amusement and entered her room closing the door as quietly as she could not wanting helga to start berating her as soon as she would reach the room rowena slipped out of her gown undid the clasp that held her hair in place and slid between the sheets closing her eyes soon enough she heard the door open and close and helga soft footsteps moving across the room as she lit a candle changed into her nightgown brushed her hair and folded all their clothes neatly the footsteps stopped and rowena strained to hear even a rustle of cloth i know you re awake raven helga soft whisper in her ear almost made her jump out of her skin you canthide things from me it not rosalind worry that frightens you it her disapproval you are acting like a little girl grow up she then went to her side of the bed snuffed out her candle and soon her even breathing indicated she was deeply asleep the moonlight shone through a crack in the shutters and reflected on a pair of unblinking eyes rowena remained awake for a long time servant gryffindor take her life ambrosius voice echoes in her head her mind tries to process the meaning of the words but nothing comes up can he truly mean why would godric obey to this deranged man she turns to face her companion her eyes widen as she realizes he is going to obey she can see a desperate gleam in his eyes as he heavily takes a step in her direction and slides his hand down to his sword he is going to kill her godric no you cantreally do that she is your friend helga cries from behind him when he does not comply still walking in that slow agonizing pace his eyes madly moving in his face the small girl takes hold of salazar arm and shrieks echoing rowena own thoughts salazar stop him he will kill her salazar starts moving in godric direction but ambrosius sees it and commands him to restrain helga she sees how he holds helga with an iron grip yes his eyes are desperately willing rowena to run save herself she would not run she would not give ambrosius the pleasure of seeing her pleading for mercy she stands her ground she looks straight into godric eyes trying to give him some of her own conviction and belief that he would not do the deed a movement catches her eye helga sinks her teeth into salazar arm and bites down hard there is blood on her face when salazar releases her with a cry of pain she then runs to godric before anyone can stop her and slams into him with all the power in her small body and then attempts to pull him away nothing helps godric continues his slow approach however rowena can see that his approach becomes slower still he is fighting even though all members of the council are commanding him to take her life he falls to his knees yet he continues approaching her his body shakes he is fighting a formless enemy something happens with a cry of rage godric gets up and stares vehemently at a shocked ambrosius you cannot make me he cries out i will never do as you say again the chamber is silent not even a whisper is heard she can see salazar wakes up from his sleep like trance he stares at godric in wonder and a slow smile tugs at this lips you are free he says kill him slytherin ambrosius suddenly shrieks his face panicked kill the traitor she sees how salazar returns to his trance starting to draw his wand his hand stops no he says softly you have no power over me anymore ambrosius i am my own man godric refusal has weakened you you can no longer force me either we stand together we will always will ambrosius gapes at salazar as the other man simply shrugs off the dregs of the council wills he walks over to where godric and helga stand and joins them rowena known it is time to leave remember us usurper and murderer she says coldly and loudly remember us who had rendered your pathetic council powerless we are going now but when we come back we will destroy you there will be nothing left of ambrosius of york but a bloated reputation that will burst like a rotten fruit farewell for the time being she then walks over to her companions nay friends and whispers we had better go before they realize that they have no trouble stopping us they leave right through the front doors of the council chamber no longer would lords slytherin and gryffindor have to enter stonehenge through the servants door they are free men and will forever remain so the moment they are out of stonehenge they hear the sounds of pursuit they knew it would not be as easy as that they run behind them hexes and curses are thrown arrows are shot she turns around trying to erect a shield around them an arrow comes straight at her there is no time to run rowena opened her eyes it was still dark and she was sweating profusely she could almost feel that arrow graze her side again she remembered clearly how godric had thrown himself over her sheltering her from other arrows and allowing her at the same time to shoot her own curses at their pursuers she remembered how they had barely reached their horses how they had escaped almost at the last moment four fugitives in the night she shuddered and attempted to go back to sleep after a while she gave up and got out of bed got dressed and brushed her night tangled hair it grew long again she noticed perhaps it was time to cut it again she spent the few hours till daybreak reading the legacy of the phoenix by candlelight we cantgo on like this godric said in the morning when they were already on their horses and on the road he was his energetic self again there was no trace of drunkenness in him what you mean traveling around doing nothing rowena asked with a roll of her eyes twisting in the saddle to face him we already know that my dear godric have you nothing new for us he rolled his own eyes in reply then maybe it time to stop speculating and actually do something about it we obviously cantgo to anywhere magic helga said in a subdued tone and if we go anywhere muggle we cantbe ourselves admit it godric we are stuck right in the middle exiles of both worlds rowena wanted to say something to make her feel better but the memory of the previous night was too fresh in her mind she did not want to speak to helga right now not if it was not absolutely necessary not precisely salazar said unexpectedly there is always dahlia why did we overlook her godric i am certain she will happily give us shelter why indeed godric said his deep voice causing a vibration to pass through rowena spine she jerked upright trying to have as little of her body touching godric s who is dahlia she asked to cover her jerking movement my sister salazar replied she lives with her husband in the loch i have not seen her in years but i sure she will have no problem having us for a little while where is this loch helga asked up in scotland it a large wizarding village a few dozens of families godric mother lives there as well a whole wizarding village rowena enquired in dread not liking the sound of it isntit much likelier for us to get caught if we go there godric shook his head not if we are careful not to show our faces in daytime we ll go into the village after nightfall and while we stay there we will keep to the inside rooms are you sure bran wouldntoppose to this salazar there is only one way we can find out the way up north to the loch was long and tedious the summer droned on yet the rain did not seem to want to stop it was rather bleak up in the southern end of scotland the companions were weary of all their travels and wished for nothing more than a warm meal and a dry bed mud was a constant companion to them godric and salazar fine garments were no longer so fine they were mud splattered and wet rowena and helga looked no better one evening when the rain had surprisingly ceased salazar let out a relieved sigh we are here he said contently rowena strained her eyes in the fading light and gazed at their destination the village was rather large a few dozen houses just like salazar had said and each house had a well kept garden surrounding it the roads were paved and the lights in the windows shone brightly like jewels in the growing dark out in the distance there she could glimpse the last twinkling rays of sun shining on a large body of water welcome to the loch godric said they waited till night had fallen helga had fallen asleep at some point and rowena was close to it herself when they had finally led their horses down to the village salazar led them around the perimeter of the village avoiding the lights from the houses as best he could after a while he stopped near a small clump of trees that is the house he indicated an already darkened house i see they have already gone to bed i hope we will not startle them too much they tethered griffith and cian just outside the village inside the cluster of trees then they walked in silence to the house salazar raised his hand and knocked firmly on the door there was a sharp crashing sound from within the house followed by hurried footsteps from inside someone unlatched the door carefully ah good salazar began with a smile before a wand was shoved right into his face take another step ruffian a deep voice boomed angrily and i will make sure there will be nothing left of you for the lawmen to hang a n well what did you think you know what i would like you to do tell me all you have to say and to those who reviewed shadow n the dark i hope this answered some of your questions oh ambrosius
