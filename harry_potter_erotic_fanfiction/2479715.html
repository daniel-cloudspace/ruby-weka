 last chapter fine whatever but i have a bad feeling about this knowing my luck it probably mutimer and his friend luggage or the stupid marauders or the bloody slytherins jade muttered under her breath jeez how many people are there that i dontwant to cross i wouldntknow waters but from what i know there probably a whole lot more sneered a voice coming from the frame of the door i believe this is our compartment standing in the doorway was bella black flanked by her friends rodolphus lestrange rabastan lestrange severus snape and her sister narcissa black not to mention the cold icy eyed older prefect lucius malfoy chapter 13 somewhere on the other side of the train the marauders were chatting up a storm not knowing what dangers some of their friends could have been in i cantbelieve lily has the hots for me james exclaimed getting excited his eyes were glowing in mischief already knowing how he could use this to his advantage i ve never heard such a stupid thing laughed scott trying to control his laughter but failing miserably it true james said sounding offended i heard the girls talking about it before we left for the end of school last year i quote lily evans quidditch sure does things to james potter body bullshit that just just just not right remus said spluttering out the words to try and communicate across his disbelief are you trying to say that i couldntget any girl i wanted james said his eyes widening and jaw clenching sirius sensed the danger of a tantrum coming on no no definitely not prongs better not be because i could get any girl i want james said sounding proud of himself james do you have any idea how immature you sound remus said cautiously also not wanting to start a temper tantrum meanwhile scott sniggered very obviously finding this whole conversation highly hilarious yeah well it better than sounding like a mature snobby rich prat james smirked leaning back and banging his head on the wall of the train ow hahahaha you re such a funny idiot to watch scott laughed tears seeping out of his eyes from the laughter that not very nice sulked james after a moment or two he was quickly over it hang on i was telling you how lily evans has the hots for me lily evans you know red hair bright green eyes smart a little moody but lily evans the one who told me she wait um what did she say remus sighed while sirius erupted in laughter like scott did james get a grip if you re going to go out with lily which i doubt you re going to have to listen to what she says remus added in as a little bit of advice while shaking his head at the immaturity of his friend what is with you guys doubting me how can you not believe that lily evans likes me james sighed in mock defeat she likes me ok you want to know why sirius asked and james nodded in return first of all lily is going out with amos diggory second of all she thinks you re immature even though you ve been friends for a little while and third of all she thinks you have horrific table manners remus explained biting the inside of his cheek so he wouldntsmirk amos diggory james narrowed his eyes at the name what so good about that stupid pretty boy he not you scott said directly and just a little bit bluntly oh i see james trailed off before the insult kicked in hey that not nice i not nice beamed scott with pride while remus coughed violently sirius clapped remus on the back a few times hard well prongzie mate the only thing i have to say is i ll believe it when i see it fine i ll be right back james eyes were glowing with success oh no what did you make him do now padfoot remus said slowly hoping that james wouldntdo anything too stupid oi scott when are we going to finish the animagi sirius asked after james left oh i not doing it he said brushing it off what exclaimed remus sitting up suddenly in shock i thought it would be better for me to be a decoy you know he explained while sirius nodded in agreement good idea you already know what you are dog smirked scott be careful you dontget too low ha ha very funny sirius said sarcastically rolling his eyes you are such a loser that because i hang out with you too much scott said solemnly nodding his head in mock sadness so butted in remus what do you think james is going to do let go watch sounds fun sirius said happily bounding up and sprinting down the corridor that james went down remus and scott trailed after him taken aback by their friend sudden energy meanwhile in the girls compartment things werentexactly happy and filled with laughter your compartment lily asked crossing her arms across her chest in defiance that right smirked bellatrix but before you make me lose more breath on your worthless face get out get out repeated lily slowly silently mocking the slytherin look mudblood we dontneed your presence here you re clogging the air sneered lucius i a prefect and i say get out of here you re only prefect because your precious father probably paid a lot of galleons snarled jade in anger shut up you worthless wench shouted rodolphus i dontwant to hear a word out of your filthy mouth my blood is as pure as yours yelled jade making sure he could hear her silencio screamed bellatrix pointing her wand at jades face while jade opened her mouth and closed it with no sound coming out of it how dare you curse my friend mel finally said getting sick of watching the slytherins look down their noses at her two friends how dare you speak to me you filthy little half blood screamed bellatrix expelliarmus mel flew to the ground and cried out in pain while kate took a steps forward to the angry slytherin look black no offence but your little comments about our blood is getting tired cantyou find something better to say i think you need help or at least get a life rodolphus came forward and slapped kate with all his strength dontever speak to my girlfriend like that kate clutched her cheek in agony a red mark already imprinted in her face she looked into rodolphus eyes in total disbelieve that this was the guy that she had grown up with all his happiness had faded away it was all black now black as ebony what wrong with you lestrange she whispered her eyes filling with tears well well looks like someone has a little wittle crushy wushy on rodolphus here mocked bellatrix jade spat at her as if kate would think twice about your disgusting boyfriend disgusting and perverted didntyour mother ever teach you to never hit girls james potter stood in the door way with his wand pointed at rodolphus lestrange dontever hit her again james squealed lily in happiness you ve come to save us evans shut up jade yelled while the slytherins watched in confusion and amusement james stopped in his tracks turning to look at lily the slytherins used this to their advantage and used their wands to wrap james with ropes they tied him and placed him next to the girls who had just been tied as well well i d never thought to see the day when james potter was in my mercy smirked severus snape his greasy hair slicked back with grime and his black eyes glowing with triumph i d never thought i d see the day when you washed your hair and i haven t sirius black stood behind snape with scott and remus behind him stupefy he said softly in one motion stunning the six slytherins at once how did you do that jade asked raising her eyebrow in disbelief easy but i wontspoil it you can figure it out yourself sirius smiled um guys hate to break it up but what are we going to do with these kate asked kicking the unconscious body of bellatrix black sirius looked down in distaste i dontcare leave them here james was still looking at lily in shock i your hero he smirked jade kicked lily in the shins no you re not we dontneed saving she snarled walking off with kate and mel pulling lily along with them what wrong with her scott asked does she have pms probably shrugged sirius but what with lily saying that james was here to save her i told you james said exasperatedly she loves me bullshit sirius said rolling his eyes look she probably under some sort of illusion what is with you not believing me james was getting agitated and angry you saw how she reacted let just sit down and not talk about lily remus said calming down james jade what wrong with you how can you talk to james like that lily asked sounding offended lily i ve had enough snap out of it it not real you dontlike him jade yelled almost breaking down in tears mel rubbed jades back soothingly dontworry she whispered into jades ear it ll wear off in time what not real lily asked in confusion my hair of course it real lily no one said your hair wasntreal kate sighed and blew out a deep breath this is so falling apart what is lily yelled i ve had enough there something you re hiding from me we re friends we re not supposed to hide secrets we re not hiding secrets jade whispered lily we love you we wouldnthide anything from you that right mel said nodding sorry i just got carried away but at least jade you can play quidditch this year and beat the slytherins first match of the season you donteven like quidditch jade sniffed lily defended herself that not true i come to all the games i just dontunderstand it jade laughed despite herself yeah that true i tired wake me up when we re half way there lily yawned stretching and lying down on the seat curling up to go to sleep james already knows she likes him kate whispered frantically what are we going to do it ok i ll tell him it not true he cantgo out with her then jade said confidently though not feeling at all confident inside i not sure about that james potter can be shallow when he wants to be mel said shaking her head kate mouth opened in shock and horror he not that low is he actually i remember when i was talking to matthew after the muggle ball that we were talking about how james was such an arrogant git and he said that his mother went to school with mr potter and that he matured later on you never know james might deflate his egotistical head earlier than we thought jade thoughtfully leaned back on her seat while kate and mel shared a glance you were talking to matthew mel asked her eyes sparkling mischievously ooooooo laughed kate shifting her eyebrows back and forth dontget me started jade threatened there nothing and i mean nothing between me and mutimer he off his nut nice catchphrase mel smirked while kate sniggered jade gave her the evil eye oh shut up mel contained her laughter and pulled herself together okay okay sorry what are we going to do about james and lily i dontknow jade said clenching her jaw there nothing we can do except tie james up to the womping willow until lily gets over this affect hey not a bad idea mel thoughtfully said i think we shouldntdo anything kate interrupted jumping in before mel and jade planned out a kidnapping nothing not do anything are you out of your mind he could molest evans jade exclaimed jumping to her feet dontover exaggerate think about it if we dontknow what to do then it not like we can do anything when the affect wears off lily will probably remember what happened with james kate level headedly said and dontmake too much noise you ll wake sleepy head over there yeah ok jade paused for a second hang on whoah what did you say what happened with james repeated jade slowly that is if anything happens with james kate finished hurriedly jade assume what will happen if something does happen it will only blow up in potter face sounds good mel said happily getting out a packet of magical gum want any yeah thanks jade said gratefully reaching in and getting one off mel oi who do you think will win the quidditch tournament the national one i mean i dontknow i dontreally follow it kate shrugged while mel and jade chatted on about the season i cantbelieve the hornets lost to the cannons the cannons suck jade said quickly to mel quickly showing her incredulity you cantbelieve the cannons are awesome mel argued back no their not the only good things about them are the beaters and the keeper but have you seen the way marsel passes he has no aim i surprised he actually got in the side jade disagreed are you kidding me he one of the best players on the team mel said defending her favourite player yeah because the other players cantplay smirked jade earning her a kick in the shin no need to get physical you re just picking on the cannons because the darlington dragons are having a crap season mel bit back no they re not it was just the small part when crashier was suspended for no reason she added angrily no reason you call knocking a guy out of thin air no reason the guy wasntpaying attention it not crashier fault that he had no balance on his broomstick it common sense to have one leg on each side of the broom it wasnthis fault he had an injury down there stupid ministry department of magical sports jade said bitterly favouritism i say favouritism kate listened to her two friends bicker about quidditch she really couldntgive a sphinx ass about it she thought back on the time in the compartment when rodolphus hit her how could her childhood best friend hit her what did bellatrix do to him so what if he had gotten sorted into slytherin and her into gryffindor they were still best friends until that very moment but werentthey supposed to be going out what the hell had gotten into her life wait what about remus what wrong donnell you look like your thinking too hard mel said interrupting her thoughts jade and her had finished their little bickering i not kate said hurriedly brushing the comment aside what with bellatrix saying you have a crush on rodolphus she not that dumb is she jade asked her eyes searching kate face kate gave a little laugh bellatrix is out of her mind if she thinks that i like rodolphus as if i d ever think about that disgusting worthless piece of dirt mel grinned giving kate a high five well said jade looked unconvinced but decided to drop the subject she would dig into it later in the blink of an eye they were into their fifth week of school and the first quidditch match of the season was only a day away lily was still under the influence of the affect and as every day passed james got more and more suspicious jade had decided with the other girls that it was time to tell james that it was only an affect not real emotions in the common room the marauders were sitting close to the fire suspiciously poking it jade walked over and tapped james on the shoulder potter come here i busy cantyou see he said annoyed at being interrupted i ll come with you sirius said winking at her jade looked at him in disgust what isntamelia giving you enough attention she sneered amelia no we re not going out anymore i got sick of her she going out with sain now so snap me up before i taken again he flirted much to scott and remus dismay the only thing i going to snap around here are the cards jade snapped at him potter come here alright alright i coming i coming james drawled getting up from the fire and making sure that whatever they were doing was covered what the hell are you doing jade asked raising an eyebrow hang on forget i asked i came here to tell you something yeah get on with it i haventgot all day he replied impatiently sneaking back looks at his friends you know how lily been acting a little strange she asked strange you know flirting with you and what not she said exasperatedly how is that strange what is with people thinking that if she flirts with me it strange or weird or or inhumane james was offended a lot offended shut up stop whining bloody hell i dontthink you re ever going to mature no matter what your father like she muttered under her breath james looked at her confused my father what the hell does my father have to do with this jade slapped him on the arm he got nothing to do with this shut up so i can finish we ve got to go to training in 15 minutes yeah and if we get in trouble by peters it not my fault james said rubbing his arm you harassed me stop complaining you baby she snapped fricken hell i never going to get across to your thick brain what i wanted to say okay then well in that case i gonna go he said edging away from her oh no you don t do you want the long version or the short version she asked rolling her eyes james quickly said the short version good okay well when lily was poisoned last year there were side affects to it she started yeah he said looking at her like she was a lunatic the side affect was that she d feel love for the last person she saw before it took place and that was you because apparently you were fighting or something james laughed bitterly yeah i told her not to open the envelope but did she listen to me nope she went along and opened it i not surprised she doesntlike being told what to do jade said shrugging wait did you say she fell in love me with he started smiling his eyes twinkling it not a real love it like a fake thing like a love potion jade said quickly growing increasingly nervous at the look in james eye how long could this last we dontknow a week day month or year great he said happily walking away jade grabbed his arm now that you know that lily is under influence i hope you dontuse this to your advantage because if you do when she gets over it it ll be the last thing you do she snarled calm down waters as if i d take advantage of her she d probably take advantage of me he smirked potter dontyou dare do anything to my friend she yelled at him waters dontyell at your team mate you might damage his ear for the game potter get down to the quidditch pitch come on only five minutes to go a harassed looking michael peters had just entered from his dormitory yeah whatever michael jade muttered i warning you potter she growled under her breath so that only he could hear out on the quidditch pitch at five in the evening the sun was beginning to set you could see the way the lake reflected the brilliant colours from the setting scene the oranges pinks yellows and reds coming from the sun showed all the variations in colours that it could bring around you could see flocks of birds flying out from the forbidden forest in order to get away from the creatures that came out at night jade stood there admiring the beautiful scenery but was soon rudely interrupted waters stop daydreaming and get your butt over here michael peters commanded motioning her to move aye aye captain she muttered under her breath moving towards the team peters looked around sizing up his team knowing that there was so much talent in the seven people surrounding him i d just like to say before i leave that it was a privilege to work with all of you even you fabian he smirked knowing that fabian and he had had a lot of disagreements as each of them having strong opinions the seven people he was talking about included his three chasers jade waters meagan kuper and patrick bennick the two magnificent beaters the fraternal twins fabian and gideon prewett james potter their seeker that had superb balance and himself the keeper of the team now i ve only won the cup once in my lifetime here but never as captain last year we lost to well you know who this year i want to make sure that my name gets on the cup as captain of the winning team the first game is tomorrow as you all know and this being the last training towards it unless you want to get up at five and start early training no we re fine peters fabian said quickly fabian was the most outspoken of the twins he had a close bond with his brother however they were so different yes they had their similarities the way they were both responsible and smart however that where it ended fabian was the blonde one gideon the sandy brown fabian was probably not as responsible as his quieter more level headed brother he was a party goer and loved to kick off his shoes and enjoy a good time gideon had a softer personality he tended to keep to himself and his close friends but never opening much to others that however did not stop his quidditch ability that was another similarity being twins they seemed to somehow be able to sense what the other was going to do it made them a pair of unbeatable beaters and helped them by quite a lot at saving their team mates by the ruthless bludgers yeah we re definitely fine i need sleep jade agreed you mean beauty sleep smirked patrick moving away quickly from jade wrath okay now you all know what we re going to do take your positions and practise michael finished off giving his team the final instructions gideon and fabian moved to each side of the pitch releasing the two bludgers and moving with quick speed on their brooms hitting them backwards and forwards around the whole pitch james freed the snitch and gave it a minute head start before starting his search the three chasers took their position in front of the hoops with peters defending them jade faked a left and threw the quaffel to her right but peters caught on straight away clutching the quaffel in his arms waters pay attention if your going to shoot properly make sure you dontseem to predictable whatever she scowled as he chucked the quaffel right back at her now go to the other side of the pitch and practise passing on your way down here he ordered his three chasers so kuper you were in a hurry in diagon alley jade said making light conversation as she ducked an askew bludger and passed the quaffel to patrick oi gideon take care of that bludger it a good thing i ve got good reflexes she yelled to the harassed looking twin coming behind her to whack the bludger yeah i guess so meagan quickly dodged james potter who wasntlooking where he was going careful potter it was clear at that point that she wasntkeen on making small talk good bennick kuper and waters now shoot for me peters requested positioning himself in front of the middle hoop an hour and a half later the whole quidditch team was trudging up to the gryffindor dormitories walking in and practically collapsing on the couches the team watched as their captain stood tall and still looked like he could take another day or so of training okay team good work i ll see you tomorrow at breakfast make sure you eat a lot and dontstay up all night tonight we need rest alright you re dismissed michael said going up the stairs the seventh year boy bedrooms patrick bennick chucked a piece of paper into the fire why do i feel like i just finished a day at army camp instead of a quidditch practise army camp questioned gideon muggle yeah it like this fitness thing hard to explain i off meagan said walking back when jade entered her room she saw the light shining through mel canopy curtains and kate bed unoccupied lily was sound asleep hopefully not dreaming about james but that thought went down the drain as lily whispered i love you jamie in her sleep she went straight to mel curtains and knocked on them it was just a little hard to do since the curtains were soft not solid but she still managed to do it going into mel bed she saw that mel had enchanted it to make it larger from the inside but from the outside you were unable to tell comfortably they could fit the three girls on it jade lay back onto a pillow i told potter about lily really cool that good it something out of the way mel bounced on her bed jade shook her head no it not cool he didntreally have much of a reaction i think he still going to do something he up to something the sneaky stupid son of a kate interrupted her before she went on a roll no he not sneaky he just a male specimen what are we supposed to do about that i dunno why dontwe just let things take its toll and then when lily does wake up we can take things on from there mel said maturely jade sighed look i dontthink that a good idea you cantdo anything about it unless like we said before tie james up to the womping willow dontbe stupid mel said kate rolling her eyes maybe this happened for a reason we ll just see how it works out ok yeah ok but if he does anything i will not take responsibility for my actions jade said narrowing her eyes and squeezing the quilt cover in her fist watch the quilt mel said angrily slapping jade fist away jade you should sleep you ve got a quidditch game on tomorrow good luck said kate rolling over jade rolled over too except into thin air and fell off the bed ow yeah thanks i better go aye that night jade tossed and turned she couldntgo to sleep there was something wrong but exactly what she wasntsure the relationship with matthew was down the drain or was it she didntknow about that she knew that james was definitely up to something hopefully he wasntgoing to do anything to lily and hurt her because if he did he d have an angry jade to answer to finally after a few long hours of thinking and no sleep jade managed to fall into a deep slumber dream jade was in the quidditch pitch she was flying through the air nothing could stop her nothing at all she was as free as a bird as she went towards the hoops when she was suddenly dragged back it was lucius malfoy you cantdo anything you re no good no one cares about you you filthy worthless girl he sneered his voice echoing across the stadium mocking her as he disappeared in the air soon matthew came in front of her blocking her from the hoops you re such a hard person to get close to people get disappointed in you you re evil mean and cruel hearted you dontdeserve anything leave us all alone he shouted his voice also echoing through the pitch before disappearing no i refuse to listen this isnttrue i not mean i not cruel hearted please dontleave me she cried sobbing into her arm in despair not believing this was happening before jade knew it there were thousands of people around her all were spirits talking to her criticizing her insulting her and chucking rocks at her they were all yelling booing hissing and chasing her around and around the pitch they wouldntlet her get to the other side there was a wall of them defending the hoops blocking her from her freedom you ve always let me down jade you re not good enough mum sobbed jade as the tears ran down her face dontsay that i dontlove you you re not my daughter you re a disgrace you are not worthy to be a witch her mum then also disappeared through the crowd jade then flew away she flew over the forbidden forest away from the crowds of spirits mocking her she needed to get away but they suddenly appeared in front of her mocking and snarling at her she then changed course and flew back onto the pitch but flew straight to the ground not trying to get to the hoops that it just give up like you always do you never try never at all sneered professor morter his face now close to hers you dontdeserve to be alive you should rot and decay in the tombs of your worst nightmare but then suddenly it changed the spirits were being driven away someone was coming to save her she saw his face he was so familiar his kind smile was bringing her back to life her energy was being restored from that faith she started moving towards the hoops getting closer and closer his smile in her mind but with only a metre to go she collapsed she didntremember who he was it was always like that she always failed at the last step i dontlove you echoed the words going through jade mind as she started to lose conscious end of dream screamed jade waking up suddenly in a deep sweat kate woke with a start her head banging onto her headboard what what wrong jade she asked rushing over to her sobbing friend she doesntlove me jade sobbed no one cares about me i a disgrace they all hate me she cried sobbing into kate comforting shoulder who doesntlove you kate asked confused but patting her friend back mel and lily came closer to the bed seeing jade breaking down realizing it didnthappen every day jade sniffed unable to make words her my my m shhh it ok babe we re here for you lily soothed kissing jade on the forehead and hugging her tightly it was only a dream only a dream that morning at breakfast it was so hectic michael peters was pumping up his team giving them more energy leading them in chants they were all having fun yelling and screaming even meagan kuper looked like she was having fun everyone except jade that is jade have a bite to eat smiled lily shoving some bacon into jade mouth come on it tastes good doesntit mmmhmmph mumbled jade trying to duck away from lily probing hand jade lighten up if anything should make you feel better it flogging those slytherins grinned mel some energy coming out of her that even jade couldntresist yeah i guess she said taking a deep breath it was only a dream what was a dream sirius asked butting in he was always in the wrong spot at the wrong time butting in on the wrong conversation none of your business snapped jade giving him a dark glare whoooooooah someone in a bad mood he said grinning there was something about that smile shut up snapped lily leave her alone hey lily flower winked james at her causing her to blush what are you doing this weekend noth we re going to hogsmeade us four to celebrate kate birthday butted in mel causing kate to give her a shocked glance and lily to glare at her yeah we sure are kate turning 14 beamed jade our little widdle katey watie is growing up so fast shut up cow said kate shushing jade immediately can we come to the party asked james hopefully ye started lily no jade said hurriedly it just family and us four then why is heather coming asked lily crossing her arms stubbornly because she family mel said giving lily a dontyou dare look kate clenched her jaw yeah family someone at that point came over to the gryffindor table sirius immediately clenched his fists and remus and scott held him back from standing up and doing something he d regret matthew stood uncomfortably behind the girls jade could i have a quick word whatever you have to say you can say it in front of us sirius snarled not liking this ravenclaw coming over to his territory a n seems like the exact thing a territorial dog would do no he can t said jade kicking sirius under the table sure just give me a second what does he want whispered kate exchanging glances with mel i dontknow i ll be back said jade moving away and lily gave her a quick good luck walking out of the great hall jade looked at matthew her arms in defensive mode yeah i just came to say i sorry for snapping at you he said uncomfortably jade looked at him in shock are you serious uh yeah he replied mirroring her shocked expression do you think i being fake or something no i ve just never heard a guy apologise before she said quickly before he thought she was insulting him oh well now you have he said causing jade to laugh uncomfortably um so is that it asked jade no i just want to say i was out of line and that i shouldnthave yelled at you but you have to understand i was confused and still am but if you ever need me the door always open he said shyly smiling a little jade smiled as well aw that sweet thanks for the offer mutimer anytime waters jade gave him a soft kiss on the cheek before coming back to the great hall leaving matthew more confused than ever his hand went up to caress the part of his cheek softly where jade had left a soft but lingering kiss on him it was time to get on with the game sirius black was the commentator for this match he had been the commentator since second year much to a random sixth year dismay mcgonagall had never liked him doing the commentating because he was just a little biased which was just the understatement of the century and the slytherin team comes out you d be surprised i would have thought they would have gone to sleep in their beds to hide from the shame of being beaten but wait i know a certain slytherin who would need to change his sheets because of the amount of oil on his pillow amidst a lot of laughter boos and catcalls there was a flock of green on the other side of the pitch led by professor morter who had taken the day out to get a walk and get some colour in his skin it perstoff black montague stanner lestrange lestrange aaaaaaaannnnnnnddddddddddd parkinson i dontknow why they bother still always good to see a team being flogged especially if it means that there a dare for the losing team black i warning you no comments without quidditch in this match do you hear me snapped professor mcgonagall at him professor comments not about quidditch me never sirius gave her an innocent smile whilst his teacher gave him her sternest gaze the gryffindor team was in the sheds waiting for the call michael peters led his team in a rant come on team we can do it show those slytherins what we re made of we re not cute little kittens we re lions at that point the team was giving him strange looks we re going to smash those snakes and they re going to wish they were never born let do it he yelled to them as the team hyped up giving each other high fives jade had even gotten her colour back and was looking ready to beat the slytherin team to pulp and here is the gryffindor team we all know they are going to beat the slytherins why bother watching i know because there nothing better than a defeated slytherin team yelled sirius into the megaphone shut up you blood traitor bella had just flown over to sirius and was glaring at him but didntgo further because mcgonagall was looking at her in a bad bad way it the growling grand gryffindor team superb i say okay michael peters leads them out did you know he going to play for the dragons next year i didn t well until that very moment everyone become a dragon supporter girls peters says he ll give free training sessions how do you like the sound of that black i warning you yes back onto the team it the two beautiful chasers the dashing jade waters and meagan kuper and two fine players they are i ve always wondered if kuper would go out with me on a date at that point jade turned and gave him a massive glare get on with the commentary she mouthed at him angrily better continue before waters has a nasty tantrum the third chaser patrick bennick lucky chap to play with them the prewett twins aaaaaaaaannnnnnnnndddddddddd potter clarissa and her friends were in the stands watching the game and listening to sirius black commentate they were in neutral colours not supporting either team except for amelia who had a miniature flag in her pocket you re not going out with sirius why clarissa was glaring at amelia because i didntreally want to go out with him in the first place i like tyson a lot more amelia said defending herself you re going to tell me that you like tyson sain more than sirius black clarissa exclaimed are you kidding me no i not grace decided to stick up for her friend clarissa why does it matter to you who milly going out with didntpotter break up with you anyway clarissa gave her a major glare no we decided to take a break dontworry i ll have him back in no time she sniffed her nose high in the air really i heard him talking to remus with something along the lines of i cantwait to go out with evans sarah said giving clarissa a suspicious look clarissa glared at her unconvincingly she d never go out with him anyway well i ve heard lily talking about how much she loves james in the corridors to her friends amelia said smirking why are you all ganging up on me clarissa said fake crying immediately the kind hearted grace fell for it whereas sarah and amelia gave her disgusted looks aww dontcry riss we re just kidding james and you will get back together in no time clarissa blinked fake tears seeping out of her eyes you really think so she snivelled yeah i do smiled grace there was a sudden buzz in the atmosphere in the quidditch stadium james potter and andrew parkinson had both seen the snitch they were suddenly swooping diving and shoving each other to get to the winged golden ball suddenly a beater came out of nowhere and smashed james in the back making him fall forward and spiral down down down slowly to the ground a n just quick to point out about the prewett twins i know their not twins in the book but i ve made them twins for this fan fiction they are in fifth year just one year older than the

to when she first found out who her mystery man was no the ending was not perfect she didntkiss him and they didntlive happily ever after but life wasntlike that jade kept saying to herself it not a date it not a date and her subconscious was saying you keep telling yourself that as jade swiftly walked around the corridors she looked left and right she was hopefully going the right way or she was going to have a long night thankfully when she lit up her wand with a simple lumos spell she saw matthew in the dark looking at her what are looking at she asked giving him a confused look matthew grinned but all the same lowered his eyes you scary freak she blushed poking her tongue out come on it pretty close i knew you d get lost so i stayed here waiting for you he said smirking because he knew he was right loser she said glaring at him you know my sense of direction is pretty good i sure it is he mocked taking her hand jade stopped suddenly you know the reason i dontknow where it is is because you re walking so fast and not showing me where we re going isntthat the whole point no yes it is my friends and i decided to make sure no one knew where this was unless we re showing it to someone new but the place must always remain secret but i your friend too jade whined giving him her best puppy dog eyes aww your so cute when you do that he laughed but no i canttell you we had an oath but but she stuttered but but what he smirked asshole she muttered slapping him on the arm you know i didntknow you were like this like what he asked giving her a bemused look jade gave him a thoughtful glance i not sure but i definitely thought of you as quiet and well not exactly unable to laugh but i ve never actually seen you muck around i think that might change he smirked tapping a wall we re here already yep but i dontthink timble here he said in mock sadness she stomped on his foot causing him to grimace in pain what exactly are you implying mr mutimer oh nothing higher one he grinned not for your ears anyway he muttered under his breath which jade heard not nice she exclaimed bring her knee near his sensitive area no not that he pleaded his eyes widening in forgiveness only because you re cute she smirked going inside no one called me cute before he said plopping in a chair turning to face her well i guess i no one then arenti she said sitting herself on the chair somewhat more elegantly than he did jade not to spoil the mood or anything what we re cool right i mean you ve forgiven me for blowing up haventyou he asked wincing oh no way you owe me big time a lot of begging is in order she said giving him a look which made him twitch oh merlin what now he asked not really wanting to know the answer oh dontyou worry your cute little head off i ll tell you when i want something dontworry she grinned teasing him now i in for it he groaned putting his head in his lap is it really that bad she asked frowning in annoyance am i really that obvious when someone owes me something he looked up and gave her a look what do you mean of course you re obvious and bad you always use something to twist things around she laughed tossing her head back in amusement oh hunny that called using your brain to make you get your own way no not hunny matthew m a t t h e w he said slowly and clearly treating jade like a three year old which she did not appreciate watch it baby remember your life is in my hands you owe me how can i forget when you re going to constantly remind me he said smiling poking fun at her jade mock whined you re picking on me 88888 in the time out room kate was standing stop still not believing her eyes this was the guy she had been best friends for her whole life with finally in front of her without his goons he was alone and vulnerable looking without his precious girlfriend he was here for her and only her snap out of it kate thought kate shaking herself this is the guy who rejected you in front of friends he walked away from the friendship that day he doesntcare about you he slapped you because you said something to his stupid girlfriend he doesntcare about you kate own thoughts fought between each other but that unfair he doesntwant to be an outcast in his own house it not his fault he got sorted into slytherin you can be good and be in slytherin it not unheard of maybe he still cares maybe he still wants to be friends maybe he ll apologise the words from jade mouth echoed once again in kate brain there wasnta witch or wizard who went wrong that wasntin slytherin they re bad luck kate never get involved with them just look at sirius family better yet just look at sirius aw he not that bad as regulus anyway and on it went but the main thing was kate didntknow if she could trust this guy ever again she knew that deep inside her with all her heart any sign that she could she d jump at the chance she couldnttrust herself she knew that even if he didntwant to be friends with her she d always have the same love she shared for him his voice suddenly brought her back to the present kate what are you doing here you told me about it when we were younger she muttered quietly averting her gaze oh he said quietly i should she started you know he also started you go first kate said blushing slightly he gave her a surprised look i really sorry about things that i ve done he said softly putting his hands in his pockets and looking awkward something he had been doing since he could walk really kate asked hopefully yeah he said not smiling but not not smiling kate smile instantly terminated too bad she snarled starting to brush past him his arm grabbed her and forced her to stop no katie dontwalk away i know you want us to be friends oh you do now aye she snarled narrowing his eyes i your best friend of course i do i can read you like a book i know your ins and outs just like you know mine well i guess i a complicated book because i cantread you at all your not who i thought you were no kate you dontunderstand i not like that i kate cut over the top of him her look alone made him stop mid sentence dontstart with this crap roe you re not who i thought you were you slapped me even if you were putting on an act you dontreally need to do that you hurt her he said getting angrier by the minute i trying to apologise here kate apologise huh she said softly giving him a disbelieving look yeah apologise he said smiling in the hope that she would not be mad apologise you want to apologise now after you never ever sent me an owl you never contacted me you never spoke to me and now you want to apologise she screamed letting out her anger dontyou dare think i will take these lies you re so lame i hate you i hate you she cried breaking down into tears kate dontbe like that he said coming forward to comfort her his arm stretching out to sling along her shoulders like he used to always do just like when she lost her first ever doll donttouch me she sniffed pulling away i ve got to go no you dontunderstand he said coming forward you ve lost all aspect of life i dontwant anything to do with you she said having the last word and marching towards the door no wait kate turned around quick as flash something jogging her memory did you say before that i hurt black yeah he said the wrinkles in his forehead creasing i dontsee how she got anything to do with this you slapped me because i hurt her what huh kate he stuttered unable to come up with full sentences you care about her dontyou she asked quietly lowering her gaze to the floor no i don t he said defensively she just a fling loser i dontbelieve anything you say there was a time i looked up to you i cantbelieve how stupid i was d dontsay things like that he pleaded getting worrier by the minute as kate looked like she was on the urge of a breakdown you promised me she whispered her eyes filling with tears before she ran away she was blinded by her tears all she had was her sense of direction she ran away from everyone bypassing lily mel and a startled remus kate are you ok he asked concernedly as she entered the gryffindor portrait leave me alone she sobbed running up the stairs behind she left a stunned rodolphus lestrange what wrong with her he muttered 88888 fortunately things were happening a lot smoother in the room with no identity jade and matthew were sitting on the couch talking about things the night was definitely getting on but that was of no concern to the two it seemed like they had never yelled at each other that summer did i mention how sorry i am for yelling at you matthew asked trying to apologise once again jade rolled her eyes only for the four hundred and fifty sixth time you know it only going to annoy me further by you constantly apologising so don t sorry he said cheekily jade whacked him on the head shut up you dolt dolt urgh you annoy me like a pesky mosquito jade growled but i dontgo bzzz smirked matthew you are so not what i thought you were jade stated crossing her arms over her chest as you ve already said matthew rolled his eyes jade stood up and started pacing no i think i liked you because you were so different from me and now your well not like me but not not like me this is so weird matthew gave her a stern look are you on something no dontyou get what i mean i think i getting across the message that now you know what i like when i comfortable you dontlike me matthew stated bluntly bringing his barrier down in case he got hurt again no that not what i said i mean well yeah that sort of what i said but it not what i mean jade exclaimed shaking her hands exasperatedly matthew shook his head now you re just confusing yourself you re supposed to be quiet and shy and well not talk to me i remember at nooks i d always watch you at lunch when you were with your friends and you d just watch them and never talk whenever i passed you in the corridors you even walked quietly i mean this is just so weird jade said unleashing all her hidden and confused thoughts jade matthew said sternly you re weird thanks snapped jade i know i weird so matt you are adventurous and open and loud when you want to be isnteveryone i know you are matthew said smirking slightly covering his body in defence when jade made a move to hit him i not that bad she whined mel a lot more whinier you re whining right now okay this is getting stupid let just talk matthew gave her a cocky grin something that you re good at jade gave him an evil look you shut your mouth matthew pretended to zip his lips and throw away the key now that you canttalk i just going to tell you something and you ve got to promise not to tell anyone ok jade asked giving him a firm glance and narrowing her eyes yeah ok i promise anything for you my darling he said sarcastically mock bowing to her good bow to me slave smirked jade anyway have you noticed how lily been acting all weird yeah i ve noticed amos has too in fact he cantstop staring at her when she all over potter matthew glared at the wall punching his hand it killing him never the whole time i ve known him seen him so so upset there actually no words to explain how bad he feeling it like he got sucked into a hole and cantget out spare me the details jade asked there more coming by the way do you mean he feeling as bad as you felt when i walked away which i didn t yeah except i think he feeling worse he likes lily more than i like you matthew gave her loving grin jade smile quickly turned into a frown good because i dontlike you at all aww that no way to treat a guy who spent ages thinking of what to buy you and plucked up the courage to actually send you a letter matthew said giving her his sad look which to jade was quite cute yeah i love the necklace the best it gorgeous i ll pay you back if you want me to jade said seriously getting out a piece of paper and quill to write down the price dontbe an idiot fine i wontpay you oh i will just in another way jade said suggestively smirking while matthew blushed back to what i was saying before jade said making sure she told him what she wanted to hang on what was i talking about um lily matthew asked not quite sure oh right lils jade immediately turned angry bloody freaking potter you know i thought he had sense but no he goes and takes advantage of my best friend and molests her on the couch in that bloody room black showed me so much for being gentleman like what potter took advantage of lily matthew asked his eyes widening i ve got to tell amos no i mean i dontmean take advantage advantage of her it just complicated you see lily under this sort of affect or spell or something i not really sure what it is but i definitely know it ll wear off sometime soon hopefully jade said trailing off it better be soon i getting sick of walking into my room and seeing her and james play tonsil hockey what going to wear off jade you re not making sense tell me please pleaded matthew getting more impatient by each second when she was poisoned wait we still haventfound out who poisoned us jade said distractedly i know it that cow clarissa but how do we prove it oh unless we get someone who helped her if anyone did to come forward wow she could get in so much trouble this is going to be so cool got to tell dumbledore maybe we can con clarissa into giving us the antidote oh that would be really good then we can say goodbye to potter jade shouted matthew snapping her out of her reverie huh said jade moving her head and seeing matthew eyes which were now a tawny brown colour hey you re eyes have gone brown matthew gave her a strange glance you get distracted so easily tell me about lily please jade yeah yeah hold your unicorns oh right well when she was poisoned she got this sort of side affect to it i think it made her fall in love or might i say obsession with whoever she saw last at least i thankful it wasnta girl now that would have been scary especially if it was that prue fletcher girl or whatever her name is or is it paige one of them it starts with p talk about nightmares it paige matthew confirmed thinking about the girl she was always so outcast ish never seemed to fit in anywhere jade you re distracting me okay so who did she fall in love with obsession corrected jade you know i surprised she didntfall in love with diggory it his bloody fault if he hadntmoved and talked to his friends then he would have been the one hmph it his fault he so upset now you re going off topic again matthew said warily tapping his fingers along the side of the couch they were sitting on it was james yeah potter and they re always together it so annoying i cantwait for this to blow over okay let me try and see what i ve picked up in your blabbering matthew said rolling his eyes thinking how much of a handful jade would be if they ever went out he had no idea why he liked her so much maybe he liked her because of her faults so what i know so far is that lily had a side affect that caused her to fall into obsession with potter right yeah jade said absent mindedly pulling out bits of fluff from the couch it going to wear off i ve got to tell amos then at least he d know that lily isntdoing whatever she doing or at least anything with potter that she wants to do jade quickly turned to him no you mustntdo that you promised you wouldnttell but he one of my best friends argued back matthew getting more and more torn between keeping his promise and releasing his friend from depression so far helping his friend looked much brighter you dontknow how bad he taking this then make him go out with some girl what about that sarah girl she seems really nice jade offered hopefully i dontknow i think this would be better if amos didntfind out if he continues to mope for lily then we ll know that he really does like her if in the end he gets over it then maybe he doesntlike her as much as we thought so we could maybe turn this into a thing dontlook at me like that i dontknow what else to call it she said defensively as matthew gave her a disbelieving look yeah we could maybe use it to see how strong amos feelings are you are wacko thank you beamed jade i ve always wanted someone to tell me that matthew looked at her as if she sprouted ten heads you are seriously strange okay stop complimenting me jade said pretending to blush okay so i wonttell amos but i pretty sure he does like lily and i pretty sure james is falling for her jade said sadly still picking at the fluff in the couch matthew grabbed her hand to stop reparo stop that you ll ruin the couch but what do you mean james is falling for her not that anyone wouldn t he finished hurriedly as jade gave him a glare yes she is gorgeous dontyou forget it but why does he have to like lily when there are so many other girls out there that would merlin knows why want him to like them just look at the desperate girl clarissa jade hmm she asked sidetracked from what she was thinking about it really late come on we should go he said ushering her out the door mmmhmm she muttered her thoughts playing over and over in her head why do girls like james and sirius why dontthey like you when you re better than them put together come on you seem a little disoriented he said thanking the darkness of the corridor engulfing his blushing face 88888 kate and mel were having a conversation in the gryffindor common room neither of them cared what was happening tomorrow or that they would be tired this was one of those times when really close friends bonded and spilled out their problems or in kate case little secrets i cantbelieve you and lestrange grew up together mel exclaimed her eyes widening i cantbelieve he used to be so nice yeah me too kate muttered you know i saw him today alone really mel asked what happened i told him i hated him she mumbled her eyes trying to blink away the tears threatening to spill mel gave her a concerned gaze do you no he was my best friend you canthate your best friends no matter what they ve done kate sniffed and mel gave her a hug you know there are rumours that his family are siding with what might be a powerful dark wizard mel whispered while soothing kate back yeah i know but i cantimagine him roe doing really terrible stuff it not who he is kate muttered you dontknow him like i do on the outside he like this hard black wall but inside he just soft caramel yum smirked mel causing kate to laugh a little kate sighed i just dontknow what i d do if we could never be friends again are you sure it not more than that do you think you might like him more than a friend like a little crush i dontknow murmured kate sighing taking in deep breaths i wish he never moved away or was sorted into slytherin yeah if only life wasntwhat it was if only we could control what happened around us mel said softly doing kate hair yeah kate said both her and mel sitting there in the gryffindor common room in silence each thinking about their own separate things what been happening with you are you and fabian an item no not officially mel said wrinkling her forehead he so different i mean he really close one moment and then it like he drifts away kate blew a wisp of hair out of her face i know what you mean stupid boys mel said angrily they always complicate things at least remus doesn t i think he likes you kate no i dontwant to do anything with any other boys until i sort this thing out with roe if we ever do kate said determinedly at that moment jade came into the gryffindor portrait but she didntsee the two girls and drifted up the stairs to the girls dormitory literally it was like she was in a trance or deep thought mel and kate exchanged glances is she ok asked mel i dontknow but she a pretty strong girl whatever wrong if there anything wrong she ll be fine yeah mel said gazing into the fire you know i dontknow what gotten into gideon he used to be so nice to me gideon what about fabian oh i like fabian it just that i really cherish gideon friendship and he sort of been icy yeah i ve noticed that too i dontthink it only towards you he been a little edgy even fabian doesnteven know what going on mel i dontthink you should worry too much if his own twin brother cantfigure out what wrong then you really donthave a chance at finding out yeah i see what you mean mel said sighing i just hope i not the reason he so angry kate turned around and her braid that mel just made flicked mel across the face why would you be the reason ow i dontknow mel said rubbing her face that hurt sorry mel i didntmean to come on we should go to bed 88888 the next day jade had decided to confront clarissa about her suspicions as she walked over to the table sarah and grace gave her warm smiles while amelia didntmake eye contact clarissa just gave her a chilly glance the four boys matthew in particular also gave her warm smiles what really concerned jade however was the way amos looked his face was a wreck he looked like he hadntbeen sleeping it was quite scary if this was all because of lily hey diggory jade said lightly you ok fine he muttered grabbing eggs and putting them on his plate at least he still eating thought jade well taylor i here to talk to you jade said her concerned manner for amos changing as quick as a flash to cold silent anger clarissa gave her a sickening smile yes waters i know what you did jade said narrowing her eyes you mean i painted my nails yes they are very nice arentthey james thinks so too clarissa flashed her newly manicured nails in jade face oh dontfeed me that crap i know for a fact james doesntcare at all for you he too busy with lily immediately jade regretted what she said as amos fork slid out of his hand and clattered loudly onto the floor blushing he immediately picked it up and started shovelling eyes at a speed into his face clarissa glared at jade in spite he ll come back to me you wish you little witch jade muttered under her breath but amelia heard and gave her a shocked glance but hid a smile anyway i came here to tell you that i know you tried to poison me and lily and you are going to pay clarissa face immediately turned a little white but quickly got over it i have no idea what you re talking about and obviously neither do you oh you d be surprised how much dirt i ve dug up on you and your precious mother jade said her eyes narrowing into tiny slits showing how angry she was if you think you can get away with trying to poison lily and i you ve got another thing coming and i d like to point out because of you re little stab at us you ve just pushed james further away he never going to come back and it your entire fault you have no idea what you ve done ciao she left clarissa there at the table sitting shock still not knowing what to do it ok clarissa she has no idea what she talking about it all a bunch of lies she trying to get you in trouble but as she looked up she locked eyes with jade and she wasnthappy with what she saw jade had this look about her confidence and she was very angry what was that about jade asked lily while james tried to feed her bacon she quickly shoved james arm away and looked at her best friend nothing lily dear just a little girl to girl talk with clarissa jade said offhandedly right lily said sarcastically not believing a word her friend had just told her james you idiot lily can feed herself leave her alone jade snapped throwing potter a filthy look 88888 finally it was the end of the school year this had also been a handful of a year lily and james were going out jade was of course angry but she knew there was nothing she could do about it and took kate advice to let life play itself out lily was still blissfully unaware of what she was doing with james but still achieving everything she d do normally such as finish top of the year in some subjects others which jade sirius and james took out kate was still thinking about rodulphus she still had hope that they would become friends but as she saw him every morning sitting at the slytherin table eating with bellatrix by his side her anger inside her would slowly each day increase bit by bit her anger built and built but it wasntyet at that point where she would fully lose it jade and matthew werentgoing out they were however very close friends kate and mel had each put a bet on how long it would take them to go out mel had decided the first day of the next year and kate had said at the end of next year during the year as mel had gotten closer to fabian and then confused as he would edge away she had gotten to know his brother gideon had always been nice to her so when he suddenly became icy cool and ignored her she d become very confused it was quite easy for mel to get confused but this was one of those times where boys were so strange and bounced from one emotion to another where no one could figure them out not even their own twin brothers kate thought it was because gideon liked mel but she kept that information to herself fabian thought it was because gideon was cracking under the stress lily and jade were too busy themselves to think about it and mel thought it was because she had done something nevertheless the year had been important issues had been dealt with others not quite best friends had been confronted hidden feelings reaching the open it was time to have another year at the wonderful school of hogwarts witchcraft and wizardry a n is this chapter shorter than the others i ve just realised i ve never included a christmas or easter break that will definitely have to be changed the 16th chapter should be updated in a few weeks if you dontlike the way i ve sort of abruptly ended all the years i really sorry ducks from thrown darts but if i didn t this fic would just be too long that why i do the little paragraphs at the end smiles thank you too all my reviews xdeliasanax i know how you feel i ve sort of been through the same thing i not sure if i going to make
