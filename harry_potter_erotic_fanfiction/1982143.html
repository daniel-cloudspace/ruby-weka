 a n hiya i the darkladyofravenclaw and this only my second fan fiction so please be nice if you rate or you hate please review anyway enjoy a n update i ve had a few flames saying that my main character is a complete and utter mary sue seeing as i wrote this when i wasntso well experienced in the art of keeping a good character in character it to be expected but it not a bad story so give it a go here the warning anyhow warning flamers dislike this story very much because it has an own character who has a few development flaws at the beginning and therefore brand it mary sue so if own character instantly means mary sue it not your cup of tea if you dontmind a possible hint of mary sue ness then proceed in reading i think it gets better disclaimer i do not own any characters settings or plots registered to joanne kathleen rowling author of the harry potter books since i have stated this you have no right to sue there are however a few characters that came from my imagination do not touch these escape a girl of around sixteen years of age sat in her room with a book open on her lap if you could call it a room the floor was made of rough stones and the bed was a thin mattress with only a thin sheet to use as a cover it was alright in the summer for then it wasnttoo bad but in the winter the girl fought to keep her health it was a miracle the girl had lived to be sixteen at all the way she was treated she should have died a long time ago but somehow she survived the girl turned the page of the book delicately with her thin pale fingers she enjoyed reading but was only allowed to as a treat so she savoured each sentence with pleasure her dark eyes scanned the page and she hid a small smile of pleasure behind curtains of raven black hair but that smile was about to be wiped off her face she had not heard her father walking down the stairs towards her room if it what you would call it and only looked up when the door slammed open she quickly shut the book put it underneath her pillow and stood up she looked down on the floor and wondered what she had done wrong she seldom saw her father unless he was to punish her one of the things he had taught her was that she must not look him directly in the eye she was scum she had to be treated like it her father was a thickly built man in his late thirties and you would not have known they were related since they looked nothing alike whereas the girl was pale thin had dark hair and eyes he was quite good looking with slightly tanned skin and baby blue eyes it was not his good looks that had attracted the girl mother to him but his kindness if she could be here now she would not have recognised the man he was no longer kind and loving but his heart was full of hatred and bitterness especially towards his daughter he paced around the room his midnight blue robes sweeping behind him at every turn he was playing with her mind making her wait before he blew the girl watched his feet and braced herself for whatever was coming she must have done something wrong considering her father resentment towards her simply being alive was doing something wrong maybe she had cried out in her sleep again it was frequent nowadays but it wasnther fault each night she dreamt her father wanted to kill her and he was just about to when she would wake up but she knew he would never do that he himself couldn t he had sworn to her mother on her deathbed that he wouldntkill her tell me kiara when was the last time you ate her father asked stopping in front of her kiara could feel the warmth of his breath on her scalp he was a giant compared to her kiara didntreply she wasntsure what to say perhaps her father had found out that a house elf had snuck her a piece of carrot well are you going to answer me or are you being disobedient today yesterday father kiara answered her head still down she was bracing herself for what was going to happen to her she was kept alive by nourishing potions once a week but apart from that she was not allowed to eat anything else unless she had done very well in her lessons and did i give you permission to eat yesterday or did you just think you could get my house elves to sneak you food are you trying to get my own house elves to obey you instead of me his face was getting closer to hers and he pulled her hair away from her face so violently her head went along with it answer me no father you did not give me permission to eat and i am not trying to turn your own house elves against you kiara explained her father slapped her face hard and she flinched slightly it was best not to show any sign of pain or emotion towards her father that way he would get bored if he saw no reaction there was no point in him continuing i was hungry aw my poor daughter was hungry i give you a safe place to sleep i pay someone to teach you i clothe you and i keep you alive and this is how you repay me by turning my house elves against me he pulled her hair back so she had to look at him his face was quite close to hers she could see the hatred towards her in his eyes and kiara could feel his musty breath on her face father i wasn t kiara was cut off as her father swung threw her aside her head contacted the wall and she slid down onto the floor she opened her eyes and saw him come closer to her he kicked her hard twice in the stomach and kiara knew it meant he wanted her to get up she struggled onto her feet only to be brought down with a kick to the shins you are an ungrateful piece of shit that what you are your mother gave her life for you and you are shame to her name you arenteven fit to have the surname brentwood why if i hadntpromised her that i would keep here little kiara alive you would have died a long time ago i am sorry father for being such a burden for having lived instead of my mother i do not deserve to live after many years of it being said to her this is what kiara also thought of herself no one had ever told her differently you damn well should be and now you will pay for your disobedience i have tried to help you become a good person fit to be seen in society but you are constantly trying to fight me this is for your own good crucio pain swept through kiara frail body as the effect of the curse filled her body she twitched in pain and hoped that it would end soon she tried as hard as she could from crying out in pain he would only increase the effect of the curse if she did every week more than once she was put under the cruciatus not only by her father but by her teacher he was a friend of her father and possibly worse if she misread a word she would be put under the cruciatus for five minutes and for any other mistakes she made she should have been used to it by now but she was too weak to withstand any pain it was a wonder she hadntbroken a bone when she had been swung against the wall unable to contain her pain she cried out it was what her father had wanted to see her in pain he laughed and increased the curse kiara writhed around and she continued to twitch that what he wanted to see and he always enjoyed seeing what had caused his wife to die he too felt pain every time he thought of kiara mother in his heart he had loved her and she was going leaving him not with a son but a worthless daughter that he had to keep alive mr brentwood a visitor is here to see you a voice said from the door it was kiara teacher vexus ripley kiara father lifted the curse and left her there in pain he could always deal with her later he says it is most important that he sees you right away thank you for informing me vexus just giving the little brat what she deserved i ll be there in a minute show them into the study he said putting his wand away and brushing dust off his robed five minutes in the cellar and you could pick up a lot of dust before he left he turned to kiara dontworry i haventfinished with you yet sweet dreams as the door shut kiara let out a groan he had been quite nice compared to what he usually did when she had disobeyed him she should have been grateful but she wasn t in the books she had read girls were not treated like this even when they were treated badly kiara dragged herself over to her bed and hoisted herself up it not like she could do anything about it she was stuck here until the day she died or was there kiara looked about the room there were no windows just a few lanterns along the side so that she could see cellars didntusually have windows and this cellar was no exception maybe she could find a way to run away to where she couldntcare less just as long as she was away from here away from her father and mr ripley the malicious teacher and away from the cellar she called her home she had hardly anywhere to go she had never been outside her room let alone brentwood manor but she could do it if she stayed in the shadows and there should be many in a house like this gathering up any strength that was left in her frail self she stood up and made her way to the door it wasntusually locked except at night to make sure she didntrun away but you could never know she turned the knob and thankfully it wasntlocked but how would she know her way around the manor it could be huge she needed to ask a house elf and she knew which one elvin elvin elvin i require your assistance be quick on your way kiara whispered into the empty space she knew he would hear her he had promised he would always come if she called out come to think of it elvin had been more of a father than her father would ever be an elf dressed in a midnight blue pillow case with the initial b m sewn on the side appeared he had eyes to match the pillow case an unusual colour for a house elf but then again he was a pretty unusual house elf did kiara call elvin i do not think it wise that kiara eats anymore master brentwood was angry very angry indeed elvin said jumping onto the bed he sat down and looked at kiara intensely with his big blue eyes but kiara is not wanting food she is wanting something else you could always read me like a book elvin you are right i do not require food i need you to tell me how i would get out of this place i need to escape elvin kiara told him going over to the bed and sitting down next to him she wrapped her bony arms around him and gave the small house elf a hug please elvin elvin not so sure it is wise master would be very angry if he found out you is gone master would have my head cut off and hung up on the wall and kiara cannot be thinking about running away from her own father please do this for me elvin i know you ve done loads for me over the years but please do one final thing for me i dontthink i ll live past my seventeenth birthday at this rate help me get out of this place kiara pleaded the little house elf and finally he nodded anything for my little kiara but we must be hasty elvin not sure how long visitor is staying follow me and keep very quiet oh master will not be happy his own blood running away from him he will be angry the house elf continued to mutter things under his breath but jumped off the bed and made his way to the door he beckoned to kiara with one of his long green fingers to follow him and with that they were gone it was the first time in sixteen years this room was empty empty of a girl crying out in hunger or pain it didntmatter whether or not kiara was caught if she was she would probably be tortured until she died and if she wasntthen she would never return to the room again wherever she was going she would be safer than here kiara had heard much of the city of london and perhaps there she could seek some help she would no longer be kiara brentwood a name that she was unfit to carry but simply kiara she would make up a surname along the way but right now her main concern was escaping thank you elvin and farewell if any harm is to come to you i humbly apologise you have been a great house elf for my father and i continue to look after him kiara said bending down and hugging the house elf tightly they were now behind a rose bush near the gate elvin was bound to the brentwood grounds and this is where they would say goodbye the journey out of the manor had been a successful one the corridor seemed to be clear as if everybody was occupied kiara felt as if there was a guardian angel watching over her there must have been for her to even have lived past her childhood goodbye my little kiara good luck to wherever you is going and i promise i will look after your father now go whilst it is clear for you elvin replied pushing kiara forward kiara ran towards the gate and out into the open she had to stop for a bit out here the sun was shining down so very brightly it blinded her she gave one final look behind her and began running down a path to where it led she did not know at that moment kiara father returned to her room to find it empty he ransacked the cellar upturning the bed throwing aside her desk and chair she wasntthere she had gone he roared in anger and left the room to alert his guards he needed her back she knew and had seen enough to have the ministry on his tails he had to get her back now vexus vexus where the hell are you he shouted as he walked through the many corridors the tall skinny man appeared from behind double doors he had small round dark green eyes with dirty blonde hair but with pale skin this gave him a sinister look but otherwise he would have been handsome you called william is there something wrong vexus asked he had a cold icy voice which also added to his sinister being vexus had always been alongside mr brentwood and he was his trusted adviser yes i bloody well did the little bitch has escaped and she knows too much she knows enough to bring us down the man was getting unnerved and it became visible why vexus ripley was his adviser he always kept calm in the trickiest situations unlike kiara father who looked as if he was soon going to start pulling his hair out but you cannot possibly think she will talk she will be too scared to say anything mr brentwood roared in anger and vexus quickly changed his tone or if it is absolutely necessary i ll get my men to see if they can find her and bring her back and i want her alive you hear me if she comes back dead i will skin you and your men alive is that understood vexus nodded and swept down the corridor his emerald green robes sweeping behind him i made a promise and i have to keep it no matter what kiara had stopped running and was now walking along a little stream fishes were jumping in and out of it and kiara smiled she had only ever read about them not actually seen one and she had never seen so many colours the green of the grass the blue of the sky the red of the roses the yellow of the daisies the sea green of the stream she wondered why she had never been allowed out even only out to the gardens a little rabbit ran in front of her and kiara called for it to come to her it jumped onto her lap and kiara cuddled it just then she heard bangs and shouts behind her she looked up and saw birds flying away in fear so they had realised that she was gone kiara put the rabbit down gently and began running as fast as her feet would carry her she didnthave any shoes and the rocks dug into her bare feet the shouts got closer and she ran faster pushing through branches that were in her way look there she is a voice said they must have been pretty close to see her kiara moved just in time or she would have been stunned as a spell flew towards to her she kept running not really knowing where she was going to but hoped she wouldntrun into a dead end kiara reached the edge it seemed she was on the top of hill and to get to the bottom was a pretty steep fall where was she going to go now she began running along the side of the dip if she could just get somewhere safe a spell hit her on the side blood began to seep through her thin clothes she was caught off balance and she toppled down the side of the hill she gone down come on another man shouted he reached the edge and looked down he saw kiara scramble up and run into the woods he stopped the other men and shook his head there no point in continuing no one survives the night in brentwood forest kiara ran through the woods as fast as she could they could still be after her but wouldntshe be hearing them she stopped in a small clearing and listened it was silent except for the occasional rustle of leaves she had tripped quite a few times on her way here her thin robes were torn she had quite a few scratches on her face arm and legs where the spell had hit her she now had a long deep gash and it hurt to breath kiara was aware that she was losing a lot of blood but she had to keep going and at least find a stream or get out of the forest her legs collapsed under her and she groaned as her head hit the floor kiara scrambled up to her feet and kept going she had to get out of there she had to get out of here mr brentwood we have news on your daughter vexus said as he entered the big study books upon books lined two walls full of shelves and this was only the study the library contained five times as many books mr brentwood had been standing looking out of the big window overlooking the gardens well have you found her mr brentwood said impatiently turning his gaze away from the gardens where he and his late wife had spent so many days together taking midnight walks by the moonlight or having picnics in the orchard not exactly she ran into brentwood forest and my men could not find her but i must say william she will not survive the night she took quite a fall and she will probably die of her injuries mr brentwood nodded and turned back to the window he had kept his promise he had not killed her he had kept her alive she was the one who had run away and he had even tried to bring her back if kiara died today it would not be his fault a tear fell down his face i miss you eleanor why did you have to die instead of her look what your death has done to me he whispered to the emptiness of his study nightfall was near and kiara was still in the forest at least now the trees were thinning it had got to a point where the trees where so thick that she had to squeeze herself through the gaps she kept going although she was weak and soon she was out of the forest how many hours it had taken her she did not know but she was now safely out of the forest what she needed now was a place to stay kiara spotted a path and decided to walk down it perhaps it would lead her to a place to stay surely they would give her some water to drink and heal some of her wounds and perhaps a thin sheet to cover herself with night was upon her and still she did not stop the path had died out and she was just following her instincts now she seemed to be in a dream the pain didntseem real it was just numb she knew her feet had blistered and been cut by jagged stones but the thought that if she kept going she might find a house kept her going once or twice she tripped creating more cuts and bruises and tearing her already torn robes even more in the distance kiara saw the outline of a house no it was too big to be a house it was another manor could she have gone backwards and returned to brentwood manor no she was sure this one was different all she had to do was hang in there and soon she would be safe hopefully a man sat in his study reading a book close to the fireplace it wasntthat cold but it was comforting and it created that air of elegance he turned the page of the book and frowned at it the book had been given to him years before by a very close friend and mentor of his fifty reasons to smile and why not to frown typical of him this had just been one of the many books that he received each year along with a box of lemon drops which he simply added to the ever growing pile maybe if he just tried one he d like it but the man was not fond of muggle sweets the man put the book down and walked over to his desk the book must have been written by a mindless idiot who was pent up on making you frown even more one of the reasons to smile was to celebrate the fact that you are alive there was nothing for him to celebrate he was a death eater the dark lord had risen from the near dead and he had to be a spy for the order which would obviously lead him to an early death perhaps writing a letter asking for the ban of muggle sweets then he would stop receiving lemon drops but did he have the time to do such petty things he ran his hands through his long dark hair his students were right he was a greasy old git but right now he felt like a greasy lonely git he had no one in this house apart from the house elves and most of them were scared of him there were portraits of his fore fathers but he did not have the patience to listen to them droning on about their slimy lives the man pale face twisted from a frown to a look of annoyance he should have been enjoying his free time but he loathed it it was so boring maybe he shouldnthave finished his lesson plans in the first week of the summer holidays master there is someone at the door wishing to speak to you they say it is important you talk to them a house elf squeaked pulling the man out of his thoughts who would want to see him at this time of night he wasntexpecting anybody and it wasnteveryday that somebody popped in to say hello more like never his neighbours lived five miles or more in both directions so it wasntlike they could come over and ask him for some sugar because they had ran out the man stood up from behind his desk and left the study his black robes sweeping behind him the man opened the door to find a girl of around sixteen standing there leaning against a pillar for support her robes were in tatters her face covered in many scratches and bruises he could see blood seeping through her robes through various places and her breathing was heavy she looked as if she had been dragged through the forest and true there was a forest nearby can i help you the man said looking at the girl curiously she looked strangely like himself but you couldnttell due to the blood and dirt on her face she was oddly skinny too skinny in fact please sir i am hurt and i am being chased by my f somebody and they want me dead please could you spare me some water so i could be on my way kiara told the man he didntthink he would care for a girl like herself after all she was scum all she needed was water to bathe her wounds in who are you who wants you dead the man asked he had to make sure she wasnta trick to get into his house you had to be safe nowadays you couldntreally trust people it does not matter who i am but please just spare me some water kiara groaned and her legs gave way she could no longer stand or breathe she gave one last groan before darkness passed over her the man bent down and examined her he was no healer and nor did he need to be to see that she was hurt he lowered his face to hers kiara was no longer breathing dum dum dum so how did you like the first chapter of my second fan fiction review please or no next chapter it ll only take a minute oh and thanks for reading this anyway disclaimer nobody in this world truly owns something soi dont own anything that you may recognise or basically anything at all a n i haventupdated in aeons but i lacked motivation now it back and running should have new chapter here sometime next week though i not promising anything coz i facing suspension oh dear anyway read on the vision the day hadntreally got off to a good start and it certainly wasntgetting any better at least kiara thought so she had spent most of the way back from london getting an earful from tonks about her running off like that the cab driver had given her a sympathetic look as he drove off even he felt sorry for her hermione had tried to intervene a couple of times but she got her head practically bitten off by tonks as they entered 12 grimmauld place tonks really let it rip kiara simply ignored her as much as possible and walked through into the living room where harry ron and remus were sitting harry and ron playing chess whilst remus had his head buried in a book hello guys hermione said cheerfully and deposited her bags near the door before sitting down on the sofa remus looked up from his newspaper at tonks who was currently hissing at kiara who looked bored he heard hermione sigh tough day remus asked a grin playing on his face he didntknow exactly what he found funny about the situation maybe it was because tonks was usually the one being shouted at and not the other way round hermione nodded and as if on cue tonks really started shouting remus went back to his book oh boy this should be interesting just leave me alone will you it my life and i put it in danger when i want to kiara said as calmly as she could with all the anger she was feeling tonks sighed deeply and for a minute it looked like kiara had shut her up fat chance you put your life in danger and ours as well if you want me to get off your back just tell me who the fucking guy was tonks said well mostly shouted she was giving back on speaking rationally what she at this moment wanted to do most was strangle kiara because tonks found her so frustrating your lives werentput in danger because he has no interest in you or hermione if he wanted to he would have gladly killed you then and there but he didn t so do us all a favour and do shut the hell up the last statement caused harry and ron to look up from their game and take interest in the argument remus was still engrossed in his book you make me feel so much better with that you really are selfish you know that and what is it to you whether i get myself killed or not it my life and i ll do what i want you are nothing but a spoilt brat your father probably spoils you rotten judging by your totally selfish dontyou dare bring him into this at least i not an bossy poorly mannered cow tonks looked taken aback by what kiara had just said and it took kiara to take in exactly what she had just said she was angry and upset and tonks was doing nothing to make it better oh no you just didntcall me a cow yes i did and i will do it again you know nothing about me and i ll let you on a little secret i am spoilt but i not a spoilt brat however you are a pathetic cow who has nothing better to do than stick her ever changing nose in where it doesntbelong that is it at least i know where you get your tongue from but that is no excuse i am going to give you a slap that you should have probably been given ages ago before tonks could carry out her threat remus had put the book down and jumped in between them relax ladies starting world war iii when everybody else will be arriving anytime soon is not a good idea in fact it a very bad idea remus said fully knowing he was the only thing standing between a catfight enjoying to watch but not a lot of fun to clean up after would one of you care to tell me what this is about it was a general question but it was more aimed at kiara nothing did you know that shouting is a very good way of strengthening the vocal cords kiara answered trying to change the subject this way she wouldnthave to lie and she wouldnthave to tell the truth not that it ever worked out that way so who this everybody else you re talking about dontchange the subject hermione ron harry would you mind going to do something that doesntinvolve eavesdropping of any form the three were reluctant to leave but seeing how sensitive this situation could get and remus serious face they thought it best to leave once they were out of the room remus relaxed a little kiara i know you are stressed about severus but there is no need to take it out on tonks i not stressed and if i am it because i not allowed to have any say in what i do it do this tell me that what happened in london was purely a warning to be on the lookout not an attempt to lure me out kidnap me then kill me she shot a glare at tonks as this had been one of her many theories on what could have happened overactive imagination dontyou start on me again i pleasant if you re pleasant to me but otherwise i can get very nasty this wouldnthave started if you would just tell me who that man was a name a link anything tonks said as she sunk down into an armchair what she really needed right now was a massage and of it before kiara kindly sits down as well to tells me everything i think apologies are due kiara apologise to tonks remus said taking control of the situation once more he wanted to fire a dozen of questions at kiara but he knew he had to restrain himself otherwise he d never be able to squeeze the truth out of her and please no argument over this a simple i sorry for calling you a cow will do i so very sorry for calling you a bossy poorly mannered pathetic cow although i think it not that far from the truth and for causing you stress by not telling you something which i quite frankly think that you dont need to know you just want to know tonks didntknow how to respond to that and she simply nodded in acknowledgement she had never been apologised to whilst being insulted in her life it was either one or the other good now sit and tell me exactly what happened and who is this man person that the identity is unknown kiara sat down clenching and unclenching her hands in frustration she took a few deep breaths but didntsay anything i am waiting this guy is used to know came and sat down at our table and just told me i should enjoy my life and freedom he left i followed him and then he apparated as soon as tonks showed up there nothing much to it well who was he somebody i used to know i going to say this once and only once you may exert a certain amount of control over me because you are looking after me but you are neither my father or a legal guardian and nothing you say or do is going to make me tell you who exactly that man was kiara answered but not exactly answering the question she waited for remus to say something but he simply looked at her with this look in his eyes it looked very my much like sympathy pity even for one minute stop thinking about yourself and think about others if you are in some sort of trouble now they know what company you are in it doesnttake an idiot to work out that if you re with us now you re going to be with us a hell of a lot more tonks hissed having partly recovered from the previous shouting all of a sudden she began to feel sorry for severus if kiara was like that with her what stopped her being like that with her father let it drop tonks remus said quietly but strongly this surprised both kiara and tonks tonks was going to say something but remus raised his hand to silence her i was going to tell you this a little later when you d settled in but it now or never remus ran a hand through his sandy brown hair and tried to think on how he would phrase the next few sentences why do i get the feeling what i going to hear isntwhat i want to hear kiara asked narrowing her eyes and trying to think of all the things that could come out of remus mouth most of them werentgood you are right i have no legal guardianship over you none of us in this house at the moment have when you re father is away on business due to the large possibility of him dieing and the fact that he is the only relative you ve got all guardianship goes to your assigned guardian he paused and wondered how exactly he was going to tell kiara whom her guardian was remus had a feeling she wouldntlike it if he had the choice he would have been her guardian but he couldn t harry was a touch more important than her harry needed remus more than kiara did the pause turned into a long uncomfortable silence as remus thought out his words carefully your guardian has been personally chosen by severus and what you must understand is that nobody in this house had a say in it so please refrain from ripping everybody head off severus thought wise that dumbledore be your guardian it took awhile for it to sink in kiara eyes widened and she shook her head in disbelief no no this cannot be happening to me what you are telling me is that that senile old coot can tell me what to do he has the right to do anything as long as he believes it in my best interests kiara looked like she was going to faint instead she got up picked up her several bags full of shopping mark my words if they dontkill severus if i still as angry as i am right now i will kill him myself with that she strode out of the room slamming the door firmly behind her she a passionate character aintshe tonks asked as remus sat back down to continue his book he knew the other three would look after her so there was no need in worrying he quite enjoyed muggle books his current one great expectations by a man called charles dickens quite yet i dontthink we ve seen the full nature of her personality just yet hermione helped kiara unpack as she was too frustrated to do anything that involved concentration her hands shook every time she simply thought of dumbledore being her guardian it would have been much better if severus had told her before then she would have been too angry to miss him hermione simply sat there and waited for kiara to calm herself down she didntreally see what was the big deal was if dumbledore was her guardian it not the end of the world dumbledore may be a little eccentric but at least you know you ve got somebody to fall on in case your father does die hermione said forgetting that severus snape was a touchy subject kiara glared at her and she quickly added but i sure he won t then you wonthave to worry about dumbledore it just the fact that i dontreally like dumbledore and wished dad had told me before instead of leaving it to remus kiara ranted finally relaxing enough to sit down and answer hermione questions without getting angry and it not very sensible dumbledore could decide he wants to push up daisies instead of be headmaster kiara hermione threw a pair of socks at kiara who dodged them narrowly i highly doubt that dumbledore is going to die anytime soon changing the subject how much have you revised it was kiara turn to throw the socks at hermione how could you possibly be thinking about revision dontworry i ll pass my tests with at least an acceptable changing the subject once more wouldntyou say ron is very attractive this caught hermione by surprise and made her go deep red this was not the kind of question she had expected kiara to come out with um he s ronald weasley is alright looking i suppose hermione answered trying to regain her composure kiara couldnthelp laughing it was so obvious she thought ronald weasley was more than just all right looking and what do you find so amusing the fact that you are very bad at lying about your crush on affection for whatever you want to call it on ron i not going to comment on what i think but you are so sweet together is it that hard to ask him if he feels the same way yes because if he says no it ll be humiliating plus it would ruin our friendship and leave harry out of the picture i dontwant to risk that alright but it your loss kiara looked around and taking in the size of the room and the bed considerably smaller to what she had been sleeping in the last couple of weeks bare wooden floor and boring cream paint nothing much interesting three beds crammed into such a small space each taking up one wall a small cabinets expertly positioned at the foot or top of each bed who is the third person sleeping here ginny weasley ron little sister and the youngest of the weasley s i think you ll get along fine with her just donttell her or anybody that i fancy ron this would have been a perfect opportunity for kiara to continue her teasing but she had something else on her mind something a tad more serious and important if i tell you something will you promise not to tell anybody without my say so hermione put away the last of kiara clothes and nodded interested at what kiara was going to tell her and honoured that kiara had chosen her as her confidant this involves the weasley and i not sure if they should know or not percy weasley is applying to become junior undersecretary to the prime minister and then move his way up to senior undersecretary and this is a bad thing because hermione didntdoubt her sources she just wondered what kiara thought was so bad about being undersecretary all hermione knew was that mrs weasley would be glad to hear news about a son she hadntheard from in almost a year you may not believe me but the ministry is chaotic at the minute fudge is hanging onto his title by a fingernail you know who is soon going to have control over the ministry and he going to do this through the undersecretaries and the new prime minister that means you re a smart witch hermione figure it out if percy is going for those jobs it must mean it must mean that percy is in league with you know who but surely not he wouldntturn sides just like that it unthinkable why are you telling me this anyway shouldntyou be telling a member of the order hermione asked still honoured that kiara had come to her but wished she didnthave that on her shoulder dontworry dumbledore will find out that you re hiding something just by looking at you for the meantime i want to change into something else hermione sighed but helped kiara choose what she wanted to wear kiara wanted to make a good first impression by the time kiara was satisfied with what she was wearing everybody had more or less arrived and after being warned by hermione to beware of mrs black they crept down to the kitchen quietly she had selected a pair of black hip hugging tracksuit bottoms if only she had hips a pale blue top with a sad smiley on the front and simple black trainers hermione had even put her hair up in a bun with a few strands of hair coming down the side of her face everybody was dieing to meet severus mysterious daughter and as she soon as she walked in there was a hush it was probably because nobody had expected her to have such a similarity to the greasy obdurate git you must be kiara i molly weasley it a pleasure to finally meet you mrs weasley said saving the poor girl from the embarrassment of having to introduce herself to a room full of people she gave kiara a bone crunching hug which she had used on harry moments earlier god you look like you need to eat quite a lot of my meals before i approve of your size you look so skinny why mum if she wanted a dietician she would have gone to one hi i bill weasley a man said pushing his mother out of the way and shaking kiara hand politely he had the trademark bright red hair except his was longer and in a ponytail something that kiara was quick to notice was the fang shaped earring donteat everything my mother gives you you ll end up the size of a balloon at the end of the week kiara didntknow whether to laugh or be wary in the next ten minutes which seemed more like hours to kiara she was introduced what hermione had earlier referred to as the close order those who spent more time at the base than on missions in those minutes she was introduced to arthur fred and george weasley who were a little reluctant but as kiara replied warmly they began to doubt whether she really was severus daughter along with that she met mundungus fletcher a crook who she knew had quite reputation and quite unluckily alastor mad eye moody she didnteven get an awkward hello from him i ll be watching you if you re a child of that scoundrel snape then i betting you ve been up to no good these past years he growled his vivid blue glass eye looking straight at kiara whatever he was attempting to find it was no use i will find out exactly why you ve suddenly come into his life and i wontbe none too happy if you ve been lying now now alastor do remember paranoia is not a good thing someone said behind moody for once kiara was actually glad dumbledore was there moody grumbled and walked away sorry that he couldntfinish threatening kiara he knew if severus found out he would be mad and moody had nothing better to do these days than aggravate severus now you ve gotten acquainted with everyone present maybe we could have that lovely dinner i ve been smelling as they all settled down to dinner with hermione ginny and kiara helping to bring it in and set the table there was a noticeable silence this was the first dinner they had all had together without sirius it was like a small tear in a painting it was barely evident but it was there conversation was kept going as much as possible everyone trying to find out more about kiara but not really prying in between answering questions kiara kept prompting hermione to think about what they had talked about earlier she was certain dumbledore would pick up on it any time soon as they tucked into a fabulous ice cream sundae dessert most people were comfortable with kiara and convinced that she was like severus but then again not like him she had the experience of an adult but the innocence of a child and was actually fascinated as fred told her about their shop or at least she acted as if she was as they were going to start going up to their bedrooms or to the living room to play a quick game of wizard chess exploding snap or gobstones or leaving harry grabbed his scar flinching the pain worsened and soon he couldntsee through the white hot pain that was searing through his head they also noticed that kiara was having difficulty breathing remus had not intention having a repeat of last week and focused his attention on kiara whilst dumbledore handled harry the rest stood back and wondered whether it was a joke or if something was really happening to them simultaneously kiara and harry fainted and no one was to know what they were thinking harry opened his eyes to find he was sitting on some kind of stone throne at the end of a large banqueting hall that looked as if it hadntbeen used in hundreds of years cobwebs hung everywhere but that was not the focus harry was focused on the man lying in front of him struggling to get up there were several other men standing in a semi circle all dressed in black robes with hoods and white masks death eaters get up severus at least have some dignity before you die harry found himself saying severus struggled to his feet but by some miracle managed to stand any last words it ll be so veryobvious why i suddenly appear dead my lord think this through carefully kill me and all those not loyal to you will pretend to be because they fear you will kill them severus said breathing very deeply whilst struggling not to fall you let me live and they will slip up then you will see who is truly faithful to you and your cause he has a point somebody said from the semi circle harry recognised the voice as that of lucius malfoy kiara opened her eyes to find that she was on her feet but swaying she stood in a fairly dark hall of some sort facing a stone throne she could barely make out who was sitting on the throne but she knew it was lord voldemort she must have spoken because voldemort stood up and walked towards him yes you do have a point you think quickly for that i will spare your life kiara felt herself breath a sigh of relief however my dear severus if you happen to be found guilty of being a traitor you will be dead before you can say crucio as kiara felt a pain sweep through her body she looked up to see the eyes of her tormenter instead of the red she was expecting she saw familiar emerald green eyes harry felt a sense of power spread through him and as he looked down at the twitching severus snape he met his gaze but he didntsee the expected cold black eyes that belonged to him instead he saw big warm slightly less dark eyes that he had been looking into only a minute ago as harry came out of the trance or vision or whatever it was he sat upright sweat trickling down his face the white hot pain in his scar subsiding kiara took slightly longer to wake up her hand twitching uncontrollably when she did harry wasntsure he wanted to face her they had just more or less seen the same thing kiara looked at harry with a mixture of emotions there was relief surprise anxiety and many more be thankful he not dead was all harry could whisper much to the confusion of everyone else in the room apart from dumbledore who seemed to understand perfectly kiara managed a smile i thought he was a goner kiara answered still aware that her hand was still twitching lucky bastard a n awww a bond between harry and kiara hermione has a crush on ron but does he feel the same way how will the weasley take thenews on percy new social status is snape really a bastard dind out in the next chapter of my saviour a n i updated this one a little later than expected but i just 5 cm away from suspension hopefully i ll be fine but that still wontstop me from updating will update early next month or late this month anywayz enough with the chatter remember to read and review to make my day on with the chapter disclaimer i own nothing sleep is more comfortable in two kiara sat on the living room floor using the couch to prop her up and stared into space it was really late and everybody had gone to bed she was dressed in green silk pyjamas and should have been fast asleep but she wasn t there was too much on her mind for her to sleep peacefully kiara didntwant anybody to know about her little nightmares so far no more than five people knew about it and she wanted to keep it that way sleep was something she was willing to sacrifice if it meant not having to go through terrifying nightmares that seemed so real and possible she twirled severus ring round and round her index finger it was a relief to know he wasntgoing to die at the hands of voldemort but he had been reasonably hurt only time would tell so deep in thought she didntnotice harry come and sit down next to her until he sneezed it made her jump but harry was in a train of thoughts himself his emerald green eyes were dark and it wasntjust the fact that the only light in the room was a candle but because his thoughts were dark being in grimmauld place hurt it hurt so much all he wanted to do was scream in agony all the time but he couldn t he wanted to cry a river but he couldn t he wanted to bring sirius back but he couldn t penny for your thoughts kiara said softly bringing him out of his trance she smiled at him but there was a hint of sadness in her smile she couldnthide the smile was returned and it had an equal sadness to it sighing harry run a hand through his hair and wondered which of his thoughts he could share he decided not to say anything now was not the time instead he changed the subject that had barely begun why arentyou asleep he asked in an equally soft voice although his had a rough edge around it his voice had decided to deepen dramatically in the past few days and it sounded like he had a sore throat of some kind i came down to get a glass of water and found the door slightly open i peer in and there you are i cantsleep i really can t maybe some warm milk will help this always made harry drowsier if he couldntget to sleep it wasntas good as a sleeping potion but it was the natural alternative and it worked at the best of times kiara shook her head and blinked hard to stop tears from escaping she d had been fighting a losing battle from the moment severus left but so far she had managed to keep the tears well and truly back yet harry was the only person she felt could understand what she was going through and had to struggle not to pour her heart out it not that i cantsleep if i tried i dontwant to sleep i have nightmares you see really vivid ones rather violent at times and i dontwant to wake anybody up with my screaming she remembered how it was with her nightmares severus seemed to sleep in her room because he was always there to stop it before it got too much then again she hadnthad nightmares in awhile but she knew that if she was stressed they were bound to make an appearance she continued to twirl the silver ring round her finger i really sorry you know for the person that used to live here to have died because of my father if you feel that strongly against my father then i sorry that he didntdie you donthave to apologise for that i dontlike him but i never actually wish he were dead at least not that much harry told her reassuringly in a way he was surprised because he didntknow many people who actually apologised for their parents not dieing quick enough about the guy that owned this house his name was sirius black i guess i dontreally need to say anything more a frown built up on kiara face as she tried hard to think sirius black heard of him but there was something else something recent sirius black last of the black family was in gryffindor house at hogwarts and was charged for killing 13 people in an open street kiara paused as she tried to remember more personal facts that she knew about sirius black when it came to arithmancy she was useless but when it came to knowing personal facts about people she was highly skilled sirius black was best man at your parent wedding was your godfather and was an animagus there something else something more important he um didntkill all those people but how do you know all that stuff about him being my godfather and him not killing all those people harry was amazed he didntshow it through his frown but he had respect for her all of a sudden he didntknow why but it may have been due to the relief that she didntthink sirius was a murderer is that all you know let me think he belonged to a group named the marauders whilst he was at school he was never one to like my father and he died this year at the ministry of magic in the department of mysteries i not sure how though something about a prophecy kiara finished mentioning all the facts she knew about sirius that she found worth mentioning a tear rolled down harry cheek and immediately she placed a hand on his arm and apologised i sorry i didntmean to make you cry it alright i fine i i wasntcrying i had an eyelash in my eye harry cleared his voice and sniffed softly kiara wasntso convinced but didntsay anything instead harry put his hand over her hand which was still on his arm and gave it a small squeeze you and me we ll live through this all these visions and all these problems we ll live through them i know kiara whispered before stifling a yawn she didntwant to sleep her eyes were beginning to drop but she bit her lip so that the pain kept her awake harry opened his mouth to speak but kiara guessing what he was going to say spoke first i know i look tired and sound tired but i cantsleep i just can t what i was going to say was if you sleep on the couch i d be here to wake you up if you start screaming or something kiara frowned but noticed the concerned look in harry eyes that was exactly the same look severus gave her when he thought she wasnteating enough i wonttell anybody okay but promise me that you ll wake me up before i wake everybody else up she was already on the couch her head resting on the arm her body curled up into a ball deciding to make her more comfortable harry lifted her head gently sat on the couch and put her head slowly and carefully on his knee she adjusted her position not saying anything before harry could answer she was out like a light i promise harry finally said before closing his eyes and falling asleep as mrs weasley woke up the following morning to start on the housework she never once entered the living room therefore it wasntuntil she and remus went to de bogart a drawer in there around noon that they found the two teens fast asleep looking as peaceful as you could get if you were harry potter or kiara snape harry had his hand protectively over her shoulder as kiara lay on his knee relaxed but still tense she jerked suddenly and then began to wake up looks like you had a nice night remus commented trying hard to control the laughter that was boiling his way up whether it was her hair standing on end or the bewildered look harry had as he slowly woke up remus couldntsay which realising what it must look like both of them jumped up faces bright red oh you didnthave to wake up on my account the couch is quite comfy to sleep on actually we i what happened was um harry began saying but had no luck finding the right words to come out kiara just looked everywhere but at remus and mrs weasley her cheeks were burning with embarrassment and harry wasntmuch different what i mean is we we we just go and get cleaned up for lunch consider yourself lucky that it was us who found you and not the others mrs weasley said relieving harry from having to explain why exactly he and kiara slept on the couch together they left as quickly as they could without seeming rude and they could be heard running up the stairs mrs weasley sighed and before beckoning to remus to start doing some work remus nodded the laughter still wanting to escape but not as uncontrollable lunch was as small as it got with mrs weasley cooking she shoved food under everyone nose especially harry and kiara but kiara the most she d lost count after the third helping kiara face had to turn pale green before mrs weasley realised she was going to be sick if she ate anymore as everyone began to finally digest dumbledore came in this was the second time in a week and last year it had been a miracle to get him here unless it was for a meeting sorry i late but my lunch with a friend was delayed i d just like a cup of nice strong coffee before i do anything if you dontmind molly he said his voice sounding like any other normal person and the twinkle in his eye dull he finally looked his age and kiara began to wonder whether she was right he should have croaked years ago finally he acknowledged that there were other people at the table not just mrs weasley to make him coffee how incredibly rude of me how is everybody there were mutter of i fine and could be better and dumbledore simply nodded his eyes on kiara and harry his coffee arrived and he drank whilst everybody sat silently waiting for him to mention the purpose of his visit kiara and harry seemed the most obvious reasons but dumbledore was unpredictable more than the weather at last he put his coffee down and he told them why he was here i ve decided to hold a meeting tonight i know this is not the day we usually have a meeting since things have been awfully quiet lately but i have reasons to believe it wontbe any longer he said answering the question that was on nearly everybody mind fred and george will be able to attend but they wontbe made full order members until their mother agrees or they turn twenty he paused to let fred and george cheer but was somewhat surprised they didn t instead they nodded seriously which was highly unusual he then turned his attention to kiara and so will kiara there was a silence as everybody turned to look at kiara she too was amazed after what hermione had told her about these meetings only the order members were allowed kiara didntsay anything but simply blushed and looked at dumbledore waiting for an explanation everybody followed suit and they too looked for an explanation when none came ron was the one to make the point clear if dumbledore had happened to miss it you yourself said that we were too young to attend the meetings why is it fair that kiara can attend them and we can t ron asked a hint of jealousy in his voice not that the jealousy didnthave a reason i will be back this evening until then good day before anybody could ask any more questions or make any complaints dumbledore was out of there before you could say his name kiara excused herself and went up to the girls room to study that where she stayed all day avoiding the curious looks she was sure to receive does anybody have any news dumbledore asked sitting at the head of the long table he sensed kiara didntwant to be here at all by the pout she wasnttrying very hard to hide and he knew perfectly well that what kiara knew was all the news he needed the ministry fired umbridge though it has yet to be announced her replacement is currently unknown to everybody apart from fudge himself and his advisors lucius malfoy is one of the advisors if i might add arthur weasley said running his hand through his increasingly thinning hair people are beginning to say fudge is next to be replaced and i doubt it will be somebody we can trust security increased by a lot but it still easy to walk in and out of the ministry without being noticed i think another attack is expected i think arthur here right old bill been saying something dodgier than me dealings is goin on mundungus fletcher said sleepily no one seemed to notice that kiara sat up at the mention of old bill he got eyes and ears about the place bill has if anyone gonna attack he ll be the first to know and he on our side mountain goblins are all for you know who after that business with ludo bagman death eaters are rich and that all they care about bill said remembering his recent meeting with the leader of the mountain goblins he hadntbeen able to talk for days the other goblins still have faith in dumbledore but unless something is done about it it only a matter of time we donthave less and less dementors are being seen around azkaban guards have to be used instead i think an escape is definitely underway tonks said her face at the moment pale and her hair shoulder length and mousy brown kiara instantly regretted having caused her so much grief yesterday the guards cantbe alert all the time it takes a lot out of them just to be around those things and i talking from experience nobody else spoke and there was a silence as the news just received was taken in dumbledore looked deep in thought and as he had done earlier this morning he looked his age kiara played with the silver ring she never seemed to leave alone and contemplated whether or not to say anything what they had said she knew most of it and a lot more yet she couldntbring herself to tell them because she felt that coming from her it would be regarded a lot of rubbish it has been confirmed that severus is now at home healing but is being supervised by lucius malfoy he wontbe back for at least another week and that means kiara will be here longer dumbledore said and some of the twinkle in his eye returned as everybody pretended to be pleased that severus was coming back because kiara happened to be sitting there remus gave her hand a reassuring squeeze but i have some bad news regarding percy he has joined or will be soon joining voldemort highest rank those not bound by the mark but by blood he plans to move up the ministry ladder and those high in the ministry are indeed working for voldemort apart from fudge who remains ignorant you must be mistaken dumbledore percy is power mad but he isntstupid i know him and he would never do that he just wouldn t mr weasley said sounding like he was convincing himself more than anybody else mrs weasley looked close to tears but kept a straight face i sorry arthur but i wouldnttell you if i didnthave inside information dumbledore persisted breaking mr weasley bubble of hope dumbledore shot a glance at kiara who would have gladly had the floor swallow her up as mr weasley nodded crest fallen his fists were clinched tightly but not as tightly as the three weasley brothers who knuckles had turned white before i assign jobs for everybody is everyone sure they have nothing more to report there was a silence people looking around to see who would speak kiara kiara turned red as all eyes fell upon her curious to know what she could possibly know she met dumbledore gaze and wished more than ever that he wasnther guardian she finally realized he knew that she knew exactly what was going to happen kiara swallowed hard her throat suddenly dry and her palms sweaty from the pressure i i know no more than i ve just been told she muttered quietly but loud enough for the whole table to hear dumbledore raised an eyebrow he wasntgoing to let her leave this meeting before she told them at least two or three pieces of useful information i have my suspicions on who will be the next senior undersecretary but it better i didntsay anything it would be interesting to hear what you think remus told her smiling encouragingly from the time spent with kiara he had an inkling that kiara knew a lot more than she let on it might help you never know william brentwood former minister of international secrecy who resigned due to personal reasons and the main candidate against cornelius fudge in the next elections the last time i heard percy weasley resigned as mr fudge assistant and has been working in international secrecy since he is applying to become junior undersecretary i never heard of this mr weasley challenged not entirely sure whether he wanted to believe what a sixteen year old girl was saying he was just starting to come round to the first shock when this was thrown at him i work in the ministry and i should have heard of this not necessarily i highly doubt higher ranking ministry officials would tell you the time if you asked deal with dumbledore pay the consequences you ll find out soon enough kiara didntmean to say that much but it came out she wanted to tell him straight that working in the department he was and with his status it might ve been too late when he found out and how do you know this i don t as i said i making assumptions and they are best waved aside it not like you can act on any of this you d be foolish to if he who must not be named gets wind that the order of the phoenix knows what he is planning something unexpected will happen pretty high assumptions to make if i didntknow any better i d say you were a spy moody grumbled looking straight at her there was a mutual dislike and it was increasing your father being the two faced scum he is i wouldntbe surprised either you seem to forget that i haventlived with my father for 16 years i lived with people who consider each person in this room their enemy i lived with people who taught me to hate harry potter to loathe dumbledore and all associated with him kiara paused to stop herself from growing angry she ignored the wary looks and continued i risk my life to be here and tell you what i know so that you stay one step ahead in this war i wish you luck without me because if this is the thanks i get i dontwant to be part of this kiara got up from the table and walked out of the room slamming the door firmly behind her all eyes turned to dumbledore for an explanation i would trust kiara with my life she may be young with a temper and tongue to match her father but she is the only hope we have to winning this war kiara deserves as much respect from you as you give me because she has been through more than some of you can even begin to imagine dontlet your doubt be the reason why the innocent die sure enough hermione ron harry and ginny wanted to know what had been said at the meeting but as kiara stormed into the girls room before the meeting had ended mumbling some mild and some rather vulgar profanities it would have been a good idea to wait until she calmed down they were smart enough to wait until the swearing stopped though did you get kicked out ron asked bluntly not even mincing his words kiara pulled open her trunk and searched for a jumper she finally pulled out a navy blue hoodie and slipped it over her head no i left she answered curtly not in the mood to converse she undid her hair and shook it letting it fall around her face for a moment before putting it in a ponytail thank goodness for the mirror in the room even if it was cracked and before you ask why let just say adults werentvery keen on me being there and what i had to say did you tell them hermione asked catching on to what may have caused kiara to have to leave ron harry and ginny looked confused wondering what they might be talking about partly dumbledore told most of it i just filled in the details kiara searched for her wand which was hidden under a pile of boxes on the bedside cabinet the others wondered what she was doing after locating a light drawstring sports bag putting in an extra t shirt and socks and a purse of coins she sat down on the bed opposite of where ron and ginny were sitting she sighed and wondered whether she was doing the right thing do you want to know any news about percy what happened to percy ginny asked her hazel eyes looking into kiara dark ones looking for an answer to her question kiara eyes were used to hiding emotions and were blank she took a deep breath choosing her wording more carefully than dumbledore had nothing life threatening at the moment ginny sighed with relief and ron relaxed a little after his body had gone tense at the mention of percy name percy has joined he who must not be named highest rank and is constantly progressing up the ministry ladder he on his way to becoming junior undersecretary how mum was all ron could asked like his brother s he clenched his hands in fists so tightly that his knuckles turned white he was trying to control his anger for ginny sake who was on the verge of tears kiara wanted to comfort her but didntexactly know how she keeping a straight face but you can see she wants to cry your brother look like they will punch the next person who talks to them and your father is in denial i am so sorry i really am ron nodded and put his arm around ginny kiara grabbed a hat put it on and stood up if i not too late i can help your brother at this moment i d do anything to make sure your mother isnthurt anymore than she needs to be where do you think you re going harry asked stepping in front of the door before kiara could open it kiara didntsay anything but simply looked straight at harry i ve done a lot of things thinking that i helping but in the end i make things worse dontmake the same mistake i going to get fresh air and sort some business out you d be welcome to come but i doubt you can go anywhere without bodyguards if i dontgo now any chance of percy weasley staying on dumbledore side is gone if i dontgo now i wontknow what happening dontbe stupid percy made his choice and it not your job to correct it ginny said laying a hand on kiara shoulder for a moment kiara wanted to shrug her away but didn t if you try and correct everything that happens all around you you wonthave time to sort out your own life but but nothing you leave order members will be around you before you reach the end of the road and they ll be watching you every single moment of the day kiara turned around and saw that everybody was so sure that her leaving would be a bad idea she sighed and took of the bag and hat taking her hair out of the ponytail she was unaware of how much harry looked at her ron had to elbow harry to stop him from staring too much kiara wasntgoing anywhere just yet but she still had business to sort out and she knew whom she needed to talk to i think the meeting over now i need to have a quick word with mr fletcher she walked out of the room before anybody could stop her or comment on how weird it was to hear mundungus called mr fletcher so you want me to go up to bill nought and tell him that little damned lady wants a word with him about security mundungus repeated again trying to see if he understood what kiara was telling him correctly under his ragged robes and musty breath he had a brain and when it came to dealing with dodgy business he was as sharp as anybody could be tell me again what yer gonna do after i ve delivered the message i going to have a word with him please mr fletcher i ll put in a good word for you with bill and mrs weasley if you want just as long as you deliver that message to him by tomorrow evening i ll do anything kiara pleaded frustrated at the fact that mundungus was so sensible wouldntit be nice for mrs weasley to stop giving you disapproving glances every two minutes and all you have to do is deliver that message alright since you asked so nicely but you best not be sending me into a trap i aintgonna be too happy then you have my word and i aintgoing to break it mundungus was taken aback as kiara hugged him he hadnthad one of those in awhile no need to thank me just yet getting to bill will be hard just say the little damned lady sent you and you ll be fine keep quiet about this and everything will be fine you will be staying for dinner right mundungus nodded he wouldntmiss a free home cooked meal if his life depended on it good be prepared to help me study for my potions exam i know under there you re not so dumb as kiara left the narrow hallway they had been talking in mundungus couldnthelp wonder how she could be involved in such business bill nought was the leading man in everything dodgy that happened in london he could do anything illegal better than any man could he d once been ruthless but after being captured by death eaters or so rumours said he d gone soft but was slicker than ever that night as kiara crept downstairs into the living room after making sure that hermione and ginny were fast asleep she sat on the couch hugging her knees and thinking about what had happened today she didntknow whether she was imagining it but at dinner everybody seemed to act a whole lot nicer towards her mrs weasley certainly warmed to mundungus as she saw him helping kiara with her revision what surprised kiara was the fact that moody showed her a picture of the old order of the phoenix and told her how much he missed them and how mr weasley bothered to go to a great deal of trouble to explain the weasley family tree when he explained about percy he couldnthelp but ask her if she knew where his son was kiara did but thought it best if she didntsay anything rotten eggs should be left alone to decompose kiara heard the door open and turned her head to see harry sit down next to her she could tell he wanted to ask so many questions but he held back harry had noticed a lot of things at dinner like the glances shot between all those who had been at the meeting and the forced smiles aimed at kiara what exactly had happened at the meeting anything you d like to tell me before we go to sleep harry asked kiara bit her lip as she thought about what she could and could not tell harry i need you to be ready to ask to take me to hogwarts i have some business to take care of and the only place i think there wontbe a there wontbe more than one order member present is hogwarts from there i can sneak away to hogsmeade kiara said just getting to the point no need to beat around the bush that is if you dontmind if you tell me what kind of business then i might consider it i need to talk to the leader of all organised crime in london about enhancing protection around diagon alley and king cross station from now until you are safely at hogwarts dontask me how i know bill nought just do me this one favour and what do you gain from this apart from an angry dumbledore an even angrier father and an equally agitated order kiara turned away from harry and it was obvious she wasntgoing to answer that she stared into space thinking how she could change the subject and coming up with nothing by the way you looked pretty today the way you had your hair down really suited you that comment came out of nowhere and kiara felt her cheeks burning nobody had ever said she looked pretty ugly and a piece of shit yes but never ever pretty she didntknow whether to repay the compliment or what but found it hard to speak anyway she was literally speechless faking a yawn she pretended she was tired thank you harry that one of the nicest things anybody has ever said to me now how about we get some sleep harry nodded and tonight they got into more comfortable positions than yesterday both harry and kiara lay sideways out on the couch rather close together harry arm holding kiara close so that she wouldntfall and so that she felt safe it was a normal sized couch with not much space to move around on but they both slept like logs little did they know that hermione saw them as she came down to get a glass of water the door had been left ajar and it took all her power not to wake ginny and tell her what she saw from her point of view it definitely did not look innocent a n not innocent eh and who is this bill nought and what is his connection with kiara why is kiara all of a sudden so sure of herself if not bossy is this author losing the plot tune in for the next instalment of my saviour disclaimer i own nothing in this story i simply have an imagination a crap one but it mine a n sorry for the major delay major tests major writer block moving on harry felt himself being shaken awake he didntreally want to wake it wasntthat he was tired but that was the best night he had had in a long time there was something reassuring in waking up in the middle of the night and watching kiara sleep in your arms and being the one to help her calm down after having a nightmare he opened one eye and caught a glimpse at the person who was trying to wake him up and prodding at him with his finger it was remus and he looked like he himself had just got out of bed remus sensed that harry was awake and began to tell him what brought him to the living room at 6 in the morning harry i know you re awake so listen closely i dontknow what going on between you and kiara harry opened his mouth to interrupt but was silenced by remus and nor do i particularly want to know at this moment what you need to do is get you and kiara back into bed before molly comes round to check remus whispered glancing at the door just waiting for mrs weasley to jump out and yell gotcha why is she checking harry asked gently getting up and making sure that kiara was comfortable enough he had some stiffness in his neck but it would pass soon his hair stood on ends and he had opened the buttons of his pyjama top due to the heat realising that remus had a questioning look on his face harry quickly buttoned up and blushed it not what you think i not here to judge but i sure molly will really approve of this not there wontbe any 5 course meals for any of you after this remus wasntsure that saying that mrs weasley wouldntstuff them with food anymore was a good idea because harry looked pleased and seemed to be considering the possibilities you either sleep in your own beds or you find a bed to sleep in and where exactly are we meant to get a bed harry answered frowning he wanted to be there for kiara and hopefully for her to be there with him he enjoyed the smell of her shampoo and the feel of her silk pyjamas he loved to hold her in his arms and protect her he would prove severus wrong and show him that kiara cared for harry as harry thought of this an idea came into his head sirius what about sirius his room there a king size bed in there all that need to be done is change the sheets dust a little and it will be habitable harry seemed to be fine at the idea but remus had his doubts was harry really ready to be back in sirius room be constantly reminded that sirius had once been here he watched as harry soothed kiara as she began to kick that must be the reason why they sleep together remus thought interesting are you sure about this i cantlive in the past professor and i not the only one here as far as i concerned sirius room will be put to better use rather than gather dust sirius death may have partly been my fault but i cantkeep feeling sorry for myself not when people are depending on me harry you know sirius death was not your fault if he could choose the way he died then he would have picked that way i know you said so many times if it possible i d like to start clearing things out today harry stood up and sweeping kiara into his arms carefully she looked so fragile and small under his toned muscular body that was still growing and toughened through quidditch for a second harry faltered and looked at kiara with a look remus couldntread before reaching for the door harry if you need anything or if you just need to talk i here for you harry nodded and careful not to bump kiara head into anything walked out of the living room he could be heard whispering to her as he climbed the stairs remus sighed and felt just under his eye where severus had landed a perfect punch on him just a few weeks before he was sure he would be receiving another one when he found out he supported the whole kiara harry thing remus prayed it would be easter when severus finally recovered that would give remus a good head start to run and hide are you sure you dontwant anymore eggs there plenty more where that came from mrs weasley asked looking rather dejected as kiara refused her fifth egg her plate was still full and she looked like she was going to puke breakfast lunch and dinner were always nauseating affairs for kiara there were points when she wished she wasntbeing fed at all but they quickly went away as an interesting conversation started up suit yourself then if you do need anything i ll be doing some laundry as soon as she was out of the room kiara sighed relieved that this was her last helping yet despite having eaten so much in the space of two days she hadntput any weight on she did look much healthier though harry was sitting in between her and remus and whilst remus talked to bill weasley about something he swapped the plates thanks kiara said and ate the toast remus had yet to eat how can i tell mrs weasley gently that i rather prefer eating normal portions of food at a time i cantkeep feeling sick after every meal harry couldnthelp but laugh as kiara clutched her stomach and looked like she was going to bring back up her entire breakfast there was a lot of it harry that not funny you werentlaughing last year when it was you in her position hermione snapped causing harry to laugh a lot harder before calming down i dontsee what so funny anyway her face it priceless i sorry kiara must be the immaturity gene kicking in july 31 coming up very soon in fact it in two days he looked around the table expecting everybody to start saying how he was growing up and was one step closer to being of age but nobody spoke they simply looked at him in confusion he realised with a pang they must have forgotten never mind did you sleep well tonight harry hermione asked her tone lighter and a rare smirk on her face it was harry turn to be confused but kiara face stopped looking green and she stopped feeling nauseous long enough to sit up and give hermione a knowing look it didnttake a genius to figure out that she knew um yeah i guess i must be getting used to ron snores harry glanced at kiara who looked better and was trying hard not to look concerned about what the conversation was going to lead to the only thing that gave her away was the hard grip on her chair and you kiara well i used to my own bed but it been alright kiara said aware that everyone was now focusing on the conversation remus was shovelling the greatly accepted food into his mouth ron looked as puzzled as usual ginny had received a hint from hermione that this conversation was going to happen and bill simply looked as if he was staring into space is that so i have reasons to believe that you mr potter and you miss snape were nowhere near your beds until 6 this morning hermione smiled as harry groaned and kiara sighed rather loudly would you mind telling the rest of the household where you were or do i have to hermione it none of their business what we get up to has nothing to do with anybody harry attempted to shut her up but weeks of not being a total know it all had taken its toll on hermione she knew something most people didntand it was her duty to share it it not like they ve been sleeping together ron pointed out only to receive pieces of toast thrown at him harry scratched his head and tried not to cringe as ron realised why hermione was looking at him with amazement he was a slow one but he finally got it eeeeew yuck ron you are so incredibly stupid slow and immature sometimes i dontknow how i put up with you every summer ginny moaned rolling her eyes even she had managed to get it after a lot of hinting from hermione you re lucky you re my brother i ve been trying to follow this conversation and i still dontget it bill spoke up so he hadntbeen staring into space after all ginny shook her head realising that her brothers were total nincompoops and she was probably the only sane one in the family kiara and harry have been sleeping on the couch together for the past two nights hermione said clearly kiara blushed a colour that had never been seen in her cheeks and harry banged his head on the table why did hermione have to have such a big mouth it was everybody else turn to laugh as harry lifted his head up revealing ketchup smeared on his forehead the things that happen in my absence the laughter stopped immediately as everyone recognised the voice there standing in the doorway dressed in black jeans and a black short sleeved shirt looking good although several cuts on his face and arms gave him away was severus snape he was leaning on the doorway and by the way he was standing he certainly looked like he needed to lean on something the initial shock of seeing severus wearing off kiara jumped out of her chair and hugged severus tightly he flinched and kiara let go of him sorry i didntmean to hurt you kiara said noticing the pain in his eyes as fast as it had come it went severus drew her into a hug and she could feel the bandages around his chest but didntreally care two days had seemed like years broken ribs whoever fixed these is good and broken nose which has had to be repositioned an immense number of cuts you ve been twitching since you got home and still are severus smiled as he learnt something new about kiara a talking medical encyclopaedia realising that everyone was wondering where the mean old professor had gone the smile disappeared and was replaced by a sneer it just had been so good to be able to know whether kiara truly missed him or whether she couldntcare less if i had the time and strength potter you would be dead and as for you lupin hope your eye healing i just came to say hello to kiara as far as lucius is concerned i having a bath it certainly explained the fluffy black slippers he was wearing dontworry it ll be a while before i back until then you can relax he glared at harry menacingly and shot remus a warning look before he walked out of the room kiara had the feeling he wanted her to follow are you alright kiara steadied severus as he nearly fell down he grimaced in pain but that wouldntstop him from being there sorry stupid question dad i sorry about what been happening between harry and me he just there in case i have a nightmare i know dontworry but if it goes any further i will kill him he smiled as kiara gently put her hand on his arm they seemed less bony than he knew them and warmer it felt good to be called dad by her i wanted to ask you about that night i went to the meeting where you there i wasntthere exactly i was here she motioned to the kitchen and i think here she put her hand where his heart was i dontknow how but one moment i was sitting in the kitchen and the next i was in your body your mind severus didntsay anything but simply nodded they stood in silence for a while until kiara took his hand and put the ring into the palm of his hand and closed it into fist she hugged him once more taking in the smell of his surprisingly soothing aftershave go back to your bath he might think you ve drowned severus still didntsay anything nor did he put the ring back on take care of yourself dad i ll try not to cause too much trouble his eyes glistened with tears and as kiara walked back to the kitchen severus cried a tear he had been holding back for god knows how long everyone needs to cry at least once every ten years anybody who had heard about the redecorating taking place was stationed around sirius room waiting for harry and kiara to appear they d been talking in the room upstairs since breakfast apparently grooming buckbeak remus was about to go up there and tell them that if it was to be done today they had to hurry up when harry arrived leading a slower kiara by the hand his face looked set and if he was feeling anything he didntshow it harry are you sure you want to do this remus asked resting his hand on harry shoulder he nodded and put his hand on the doorknob but didntturn it we ll all understand if you re not ready he right harry there no need to redecorate sirius room just yet i ll survive but what more important is that you do this when you re ready not when you feel you have to kiara said squeezing the hand harry still held onto gently he smiled and blew a strand of his over messy hair out of his eyes any longer and he would be growing a mullet no he wrong because for one it not sirius room anymore it ours and i am ready to move on he turned the doorknob and opened the door nobody apart from harry had been in there since his death a month or so ago one of the walls was covered with photos of harry the marauders and sirius himself with james and lily all framed a big king size bed stood in the middle of the room with small bedside cabinets on each side of the bed and a reasonably sized wardrobe in a corner the rooms were cream and the floors creaking wooden floorboards there was a silence as everyone acknowledge the fact that sirius used to be here and wasntnow they waited for harry to break the silence but he was looking at the bed that he was going to be sleeping in he felt it like it was some kind of betrayal but he would be betraying kiara if he didntget over it feeling her lean against him reassuringly gave him the encouragement he needed right then we needed to get his clothes and belongings into two separate boxes put the photos in another box but we ll put them back up harry said walking into the room everybody else following he took a good look around the floor needs polishing and the walls need to be painted i think i ll go for a light yellow with red swirls in each corner the jobs were divided amongst them and they got on with it in mostly silence a bit of polite chatter here and there but that was all mrs weasley and hermione worked on folding the clothes by type into a box and sorting his belongings by size and importance kiara ginny ron and remus worked on painting the walls and harry and bill who was lying low at the headquarters after some troubles with mountain goblins nailed down any loose floorboards harry came to his tenth loose floorboards and checked under it to find something he wasntexpecting remus come here harry said his voice quavering as he reached in and pulled out dusty gryffindor quidditch robes remus wiped paint off his hands on his trousers and examined the robes he pointed to a name sewn below the word captain james potter dad his old quidditch robes sirius never told me he had them harry dug in there and in the five minutes that followed he pulled out a pocket watch that had also belonged to james potter a spare copy of the marauders map harry baby blanket and last but not least sirius black will as harry began to cry the redecorating was abandoned to leave harry alone each person patting harry on the back and offering his or her condolences however when remus and kiara went to leave he asked them to stay harry i am so sorry i really am kiara said kneeling down where harry sat looking at the will but hardly reading it she patted him awkwardly not really sure what to do in this situation and was surprised that he lent on her and cried his eyes out all kiara did was hug him and let him cry on her shoulder i am really sorry he was a good man i didntknow him but he obviously loved you very much yeah i guess he did harry answered wiping his eyes with his t shirt i cantread it read it to me he handed it to remus who quickly looked over it before he started reading to my best friend the last of the marauders remus lupin i leave you my property in northampton it may need fixing up but it still stands strong it also worth quite a bit also i leave you my collection of fungi i know how it fascinated you to the greatest teacher and advisor i had albus dumbledore i leave my property in broughton considering it close to hogwarts and great for holidays thanks for being there when i thought i was alone to the weasley family i leave you a quarter of my inheritance money i insist you accept it renovate your home buy whatever the money can buy and have fun you re the only people who i know dontwant to ever take money but i insist to severus snape the person who i hated as much as he hated me i leave you kreacher the painting of my mother and my dust collection may it bring you joy and i hope we meet in hell or heaven so i can strangle you once and for all and finally to harry i leave the remaining three quarters of my inheritance money as well as 12 grimmauld place and my old motorbike until you become of age i leave the money to remus lupin for safekeeping who i hope you will come to consider as your godfather he will do a much better job than i could have ever done hopefully he still around he really is gone isnthe harry mumbled looking at remus for an answer remus nodded his head he himself trying hard to stay together for harry he wanted as much as harry did for sirius to come bounding into the room and laugh his near death off but they both knew he was gone is there anything we can do harry remus asked sitting down so he was level with the two teenagers he neatly folded the will and put it in its envelope dumbledore would have to see it harry took kiara hand in his and enjoyed the coolness of her hands on hisown that were hot and somewhat sweaty i want you to be my godfather as sirius wanted it and i want this room finished today if that alright with you remus nodded squeezing harry shoulder before exiting the room to get the others harry turned to kiara and hugged her thanks for what for being here for making me feel like i actually helping someone for apologising for you father fatal mistake i hope you dontforget i not severus snape at least not entirely harry smiled and got up pulling kiara along with him she was so light to pick up shall we get on our room could be finished today yeah harry and kiara room dinner was a rather sombre affair with dumbledore explaining the will nobody spoke hardly anybody ate and everybody looked like they d been hit round the face with a wet fish the only highlight for kiara that dinner was mundungus delivering a message back from bill nought he had to help kiara with muggle studies so that they could be alone mrs weasley was certainly starting to see him in a different light kiara hated being reminded that her owl were next week so what did he say kiara asked once she knew the coast was clear mundungus took out his pipe and kiara didntseem to mind the smell of over worn gym socks as long as he told her you gotta meet him somewhere out of london cause he not gonna be seen round here with ya and he says he glad to see you out of that horrible place he countin the day till he sees you he missed you like hell apparently mundungus said taking a pause between each sentence to take a puff of his pipe how come you seem to be so close to him ah now that would be telling would it not mr fletcher everyone has their business and people especially crooks like you and bill nought and it is better to keep shut than risk being caught kiara said smiling at the frown that appeared on mundungus face how is the smuggling business going last time i heard you d been stopped in dover after the french wine you were smuggling got on the wrong boat well bless my sickle how did you know that you ainta spy are ya why i ainttold that to no one but my uncle in france who supplying and old bill cause you ve gotta tell him everything or it your head and none of them would talk unless they knew i were dead i hear a lot of things it wasntfrom any of them because bill is so tight lipped he wouldnttell you the date if you asked and pepe fletcher is as slippery as an eel when you start asking questions mundungus eyed her suspiciously but shook her out held hand from now on nobody knows what we re doing i ll inform you when i want to go tomorrow for now goodnight mr fletcher she left mundungus puffing on his pipe thoughtfully she was one tough girl kiara seemed to have more connections in the dodgy business than he had she also seemed to know a lot more than everybody in the order minus dumbledore put together knew for a girl mundungus thought she the most dangerous you can get sweet but deadly i sure hope harry know what he doing the room looked wonderful the walls were a light yellow that went well with the red swirls that kiara had expertly painted on which matched well with the finally polished pine floorboards the bedside cabinets had been polished as well along with the wardrobe and mrs weasley had bought a red and gold rug to put at the foot of the bed the photos had been rearranged so they were spread across evenly harry adding a few of his own photos kiara stood in the doorway admiring it when harry came to join her he always found it harder to slip away after dinner because everybody insisted he talk to them or play chess with them it certainly looks different harry said remembering how it had looked a few hours ago are you going to go in or do you prefer just to look at it kiara blushed for the hundredth time that day and followed harry as he sat on the bed it felt weird now they were going to be sleeping on the same bed not just on the couch harry about going to hogwarts i was thinking the first of august because it gives us two days to get permission from dumbledore and remus kiara said carefully avoiding july 31 because she was fully aware it was his birthday and had been told to keep quiet about it she had no idea what was going to happen but she needed to sort out his present and soon and my exams start the day after so i ve got a clear mind when they come yeah sure i coming with you though i not going to let you go and see some ring leader by yourself harry answered trying to hide the disappointment that kiara had said nothing about his upcoming birthday i am telling you that somebody is going to blow a fuse when they find out not when i tell them it order business they won t they ll just have to pray that i not setting up a trap for them kiara smiled as harry gave her a wary look as soon as he realised she was joking he laughed and lay back on the bed it was a definite improvement from the couch i dontthink some of the order especially moody are prepared to trust snape daughter it not like i trust them either if i canttrust dad there no reason why i should trust anyone life treated me badly i cantafford to trust anybody not even me harry sat up and looked into kiara warm eyes she smiled and traced the outline of his scar with her thumb she wanted to say yes but could she really trust harry potter after what she had been taught kiara just wanted to tell him everything and get it over with i trust you a little i trust you to wake me up when i have a bad dream and i trust you not to tell anybody about the illegal trip to hogsmeade we ll be taking but i wouldnttrust you with my life harry took her hand away from his face and tried to think of a reply to that did he himself trust kiara if i hadntbeen raised the way i was things would be a lot different would you leave your life in snape hands no kiara answered realising just what severus had meant before he adopted her there was an issue of trust i think we should get some sleep we ve done a lot today and you ve been through a lot kiara got up from the bed and went to her recently bought trunk she pulled out some pink silk pyjamas with little hearts everywhere harry turned around as she pulled them on staring into the opposite direction and kiara did the same as harry pulled in his blue and white striped pyjamas as kiara climbed into bed her top lifted leaving her back bare harry saw selection of bruises some newer than others and he now knew what she meant when she had said life had treated her badly kiara caught him staring and quickly pulled down her top he got into bed and wanted to ask her so many questions but held back a few dozen would do does anybody know about those bruises harry asked softly he didntexpect an answer but was hoping for one the thing about bruises was that they could only heal naturally unlike broken bones so they would take a long time to heal by the looks of it severus remus some healers at st mungo and now you i careful not to let anybody see them they re a part of my past and donthurt anymore so they dontneed to be brought up again kiara answered secretely glad that she didnthave to hide it from him anymore do you want to talk about it no i just want to sleep and pretend it never happened i ve got to move on because living in the past is not going to help anybody harry grimaced as he realised he d said the same thing earlier that day kiara rolled over and went to one side of the bed and harry to the other turning off the light there was something not quite right about this it felt empty and they might as well have been sleeping in different beds with the space that was in between them harry rolled onto his back and sighed he wasntgoing to get to sleep this way kiara are you asleep he asked staring into the darkness of the room there something about sleeping like this i dontlike she answered moving over until she was close enough to harry to feel his body heat that was quite close maybe it the fact that when we slept on the couch we were close together and now we re miles apart kiara moved closer until harry could get his arms around her she could feel his breath on the back of her neck and he could once more smell her shampoo there was something about her shampoo he just loved it was almost like a tranquilliser the funny thing about it was that any other two teenagers in this position would have had several awkward thoughts running through their heads whilst kiara and harry were thinking almost innocent thoughts is that better harry asked as he felt sleep come over him kiara let out a yawn indicating that she too was tired much kiara answered before closing her eyes and falling asleep harry lay awake for another few minutes thinking about what secrets the girl he currently had in his arms held he couldnthelp wondering whether she was covering up for severus but the way they had hugged each other that morning it just didntseem possible harry held onto kiara a bit tighter and for once in the past five years he was grateful to be who he was because he couldntbegin to imagine what it was like for kiara i telling you mr brentwood that you re worrying for nothing anybody could have leaked it out to the press that you were up for her position you know how assistants like to gossip vexus ripley said calmly as william brentwood passed around his office trying to figure out who had told the daily prophet that he was most likely to become senior undersecretary to the minister of magic dolores umbridge had never been the same since she came back from hogwarts some might say she had lost her sanity do you never wake up at night and think that kiara is sitting in dumbledore office telling him all our plans or that she might be doing something to ruin everything we ve spent the past 6 years planning that she might not be dead after all william asked running a hand through his blonde hair he was sick of walking in the streets and seeing kiara face appear for a second ten disappear it was if she was haunting him i donthave a guilty conscience therefore i dontneed to be haunted by kiara vexus answered returning the glare that william now shot at him he sighed and shrugged continuing to explain his theory you see i spent the last 15 years educating kiara and despite following your orders to torture her for the slightest mistake i actually treated her like a human being i did the best i could for her and now she has escaped and died as naturally as possible i have a clear conscience you are meaning to tell me you would rather have her ruining us so that you can sleep easily at night william snorted and sat down on the edge of his desk kiara deserved to be treated that way she killed my wife eleanor gave up her life so that skinny little brat could live stop being so damn pathetic eleanor died because she was ill giving birth to kiara it the way any mother wants to die giving birth to a child if the poor girl had known what she was in for i doubt kiara would have lived either vexus was losing his calm and he didntcare all these years he had gritted his teeth and watched kiara suffer she reminded him so much of her mother but bore no resemblance to her father william there were times when vexus did wonder whether william really was the father all this time i thought you were on my side but that bitch has you wrapped round her little finger like she has every other prisoner we cooped her up with a frown spread over his smooth forehead causing several creases to appear tell me vexus and tell me the truth is my daughter still alive vexus contemplated whether to tell mr brentwood that his daughter was in the hands of the order but thought against it he had told kiara to enjoy being 16 and he would hold william back long enough for her to experience being at school with other people her age and at least her first christmas vexus would have to tell him she was still alive but not where exactly at least not until william had the position of minister of magic secure he was unofficially already senior undersecretary to the minister of magic and only a few steps away from reaching his goal yes i afraid she is i dontknow where she is but the last time i saw her was in manchester i doubt she dumb enough to be in london there was no reason for william to know the truth about his daughter location for the time being very well the minute i minister of magic my long lost daughter will make an appearance in my life she ll be good for publicity and perhaps i could use her to settle the rift between britain and bulgaria she might come in useful as william brentwood thought about how useful having kiara around could actually be to him if she was known to the public a smile crept up onto vexus ripley face at least he would feel less guilty about lying to his best friend and not feel responsible for kiara suffering vexus sat down and helped william come up with more ideas most of them to do with publicity with the job of senior undersecretary secure all that was needed was fudge to make a major slip up and cause an emergency election that was possible with a few owls here and there william brentwood would be minister of magic by january even if it meant people would die disclaimer i said it before i ll say it again me own nothing dontyou dare sue a n hey guys since i was feeling nice i gave you all a double update hopefully i ll update some time in the near future no problema se orita kiara turned over carefully to look at harry deep in a slumber that looked peaceful but judging by the way his jaw was clenched was everything but she d woken up with a start halfway through the night and hadntbeen able to fall asleep again instead she had spent a long time thinking about what this thing called trust was severus trusted her not to be a spy dumbledore trusted her to only tell the essential parts of the order meetings to harry and harry trusted her not to be like severus people had trust in her but she had no complete or even some trust in people she hoped mundungus not to tell anybody about what she was but it wasntreally trust because she expected him to finally tell at one point she did however have trust in severus the most she trusted him not to abandon her not to ever hurt her like her own father did and not doubt whether she was a spy or not around dawn kiara had come to realise she could finally tell severus she trusted him now she watched harry toned chest rise and fall evenly like the previous night it had been like a sauna in the room and he had removed his pyjama top kiara watched carefully until the image was etched in her mind she had only watched one other guy so carefully as he slept but there was one big difference her stomach hadntfelt funny at the time deciding she was hungry she took a quick shower also taking advantage of the fact the water was still hot got dressed and made her way down to the kitchen only to find it was empty apart from remus good morning remus kiara said as she sat down on the table opposite remus today there didntseem to be a huge amount of plates topped with food only what looked like stale bread several boxes of cereal fillings for a sandwich and a pot of tea mrs weasley was nowhere to be seen no mrs weasley then she decided to take today off and go help clean fred and george apartment before they move in according to the note she left it in a worst state than this place was she could have at least left us some food remus grumbled although he had a smile on his face he was eating some cereal but to kiara it looked like bits of paper put in milk anyway how was your first night sleeping in a proper bed with harry it was fine harry seemed to really doze off i wasntthat sleepy she avoided remus gaze as she helped herself to some cereal as well choc balls they were called kiara hoped they werentmeant to be chocolate because they certainly didnttaste it she ate it anyway used to being starved and not really caring whether the food tasted that bad i ve been wondering the last few days not that it any of my business if you and harry are an item remus expected an answer but instead he got a puzzled look and a frown like are you and harry together as a couple kiara still looked blank are you dating still confused let me make this easier have you and harry kissed what and have severus kill him kiara said suddenly finally clicking to what remus was asking she shook her head and blushed as she remember looking at harry bare chest and thinking how good it looked i mean it not something we have talked about or crossed our minds at least not mine what if i dealt with severus and have him take it out on me would the thought cross your mind then you re already sleeping together so remus ducked as a piece of the stale bread flew towards all i am saying kiara is that you two are pretty close already and so are you and tonks but i not saying anything remus blushed despite his attempts not to at kiara retort it isntlike i could disappoint severus because he hates harry and vice versa and i meant to be looking for guys somebody of equal status and wealth pureblood issues if you ask me anyways what are you getting harry for his birthday remus asked changing the subject to a slightly more comfortable level everyone was currently acting as if they had forgotten so that the surprise party would be more of a surprise i think i ll get him some aftershave but i dontthink you ll be allowed out to the shops for awhile after the last time you went shopping um i was thinking of getting a big sheet of white card or paper and drawing all the people i think he cares about for his parents and sirius i ll use photographs and for everybody else i ll have to get them to pose one by one that a good idea but remus stopped talking as harry came into the kitchen his hair was standing up and he looked like he was still half asleep he managed to get the just out of bed look perfectly harry muttered a good morning before settling down next to kiara he chose wisely unlike kiara and remus and went with the stale bread and a large amount of jam to take away the taste of the bread after taking his first bite he watched slightly amused as kiara and remus ate soggy cereals you look laid back today harry told kiara her long back hair was hung in a rather loose ponytail and she sported a pale blue velour tracksuit with matching slippers to him it made her look more relaxed and slightly more feminine thanks i think i didntthink i would be doing anything special today so i thought i might as well not take the trouble to dress up kiara answered blushing slightly as this was the second time harry had noticed how she looked she wanted to reply but couldntthink of a compliment he was wearing an over washed blue t shirt and jeans with more holes than swiss cheese he did however look more handsome for some reason but kiara didntthink there was any need to tell him that i think i ll go read the newspaper in the living room since you two arenthogging the couch anymore remus winked at kiara before leaving the kitchen kiara blushed again as she thought about what she and remus had been discussing about before she was going to have to stop blushing at every embarrassing thought that came into her head or she d be blushing forever there was an awkward silence as they looked for something to say so why are you up so early it a big bed it felt empty when i rolled over and couldntsmell your shampoo harry realised too late what he had just said and it was his turn to blush creating another awkward silence kiara decided to change the subject since she didntwish t discuss about harry need to smell her shampoo to sleep easy harry who are the people you care about in this world kiara asked deciding to gather information for his present it didnthurt to know what she was going to do exactly even if they are dead i care about my parent and sirius then there ron who like a brother to me and hermione is the over protective sister i never had and remus he basically the only one who has a real link to my parent left harry paused to think about whether those were the only people he cared about but realised he cared about most people he knew closely the whole weasley family in fact minus percy of course mood tonks and mundungus i suppose no dumbledore then kiara didntmean to sound sarcastic but it did everyone here seemed to worship the ground he walked on so it was surprising harry didntcare about him not even my father dontpush it you i guess i might care about dumbledore though i still pretty angry with him snape your father is somebody who there is a one in a trillion chance of me caring about no offence harry smiled to show he was only teasing but kiara was too deep in thought to return it she didntlook offended she didntlook as if she d heard any of it penny for you thoughts finally she turned and smiled but she looked like she was going to cry any minute you know the chances of me finding my father were one in a trillion but i found him just in time actually one more day in that place and i kiara broke off unable to finish the sentence harry wasntsure she didntwant to finish it or she simply couldn t he placed his hand over hers reassuringly i here if you ever need to get it off your chest it might help to talk about it rather than bottling up you might end up pushing away those who care about you harry spoke from experience he was being slightly hypocritical but not that much where i used to live i was hurt so badly you saw the bruises but worse things happened to me i swear to you one more day just one more day and i i i would have completely lost the will to live as soon as she d said it for some reason kiara regretted saying it she stood up hoping to get out of the kitchen as fast as possible but harry held her hand with a firm but gentle grip i sorry harry i need to be alone for a while i need to stop thinking about the past come here it alright to be upset harry stood up and pulled kiara into a hug silent tears streamed down her face and harry felt them soak through his t shirt if you try to never think about the past or try to forget it you ll never have the time to think about the present or the future it a part of who you are no matter what it ll always be there i felt like i would just give up fighting for a life that brought nothing but misery and pain give up resisting death that hovered over me ever since i can remember finally stop resisting the cruciatus and let it kill me to finally stop wishing i was dead and actually die kiara mumbled although harry could hear her perfectly crying harder her body shook and harry enveloped her delicate physique in a big warm hug it was the least he could do shh it over now your father would never hurt you you are probably the only person he genuinely nice to the most important thing is that you didntgive up and survived harry reassured her the tears declined and she looked up se had to because harry was at least a head taller than her the way i look at it you re the girl who lived and i the boy who lived we both survived death i ve just never though of it that way wiping her eyes with her sleeve kiara looked so vulnerable and frail harry just wanted to hold her in his arms forever so that nothing would ever hurt her he knew however that if he tried to protect her he d only end up suffocating her thank you for being there for me no problema se orita harry winked and laughed as he realised that he d been watching too many spanish soaps for some strange reason the dursley had decided to buy harry fiftieth hand television he was quite surprised until he realised that there were only spanish stations which was rather strange therefore he had spent the fist weeks of the summer holidays watching non stop spanish television harry was glad for it because it kept him occupied and the dursley were glad because harry was in his bedroom most of the time i think i ll go wash my face i look a right mess and then i ll be in the study all day revising for the test which is three days so it best if you didntdisturb me harry ruffled her hair playfully definitely not improving the messiness he had been stressed enough studying for his owl in around nine months so he couldntimagine what studying for it in a couple of weeks was like thanks again i ll probably see you at dinner harry sat back down and ate the rest of his breakfast the everyone else would be down in a minute at least he d have time to think about what he was going to do to help kiara trust him he wanted the trust ron and hermione had in him from kiara but if she didnttrust her own father there was no reason for her trust him the hatred for severus snape harry had increased as he wondered how a father could give his own daughter away to people who had done more damage than he knew the potions master was capable of doing to kiara it took a lot of pain and depression to nearly lose the will to live and it could have been avoided if it wasntfor severus snape just thinking of him made anger boil up inside of harry without warning he picked up his cup and threw it smashing as it made contact with the wall how harry wished it were severus face do you really think you re ready for the owl s i mean professor snape gave you as many as i took and that quite a lot hermione said trying hard not to move as kiara sketched her face kiara would put more detail into the picture when she transferred it onto the card you could always ask for an extension in your circumstances they have just got to allow it it must be because they seem to take years to send you your results i do think i would know if i wasntready i not but that my father for you could you stop frowning you re ruining the peaceful look you had going for a moment kiara answered making slight adjustments to her sketch are you and ron any closer than good friends you ve asked me this before kiara and no ron and i will not be anything more than friends unless i do something about it he might not even like me hermione sighed as she wondered what it would be like having ron as a boyfriend he would be the first proper one but it might be weird at first ron was also quite infuriating at times remembering she was meant to be looking calm and serene she pushed the thoughts away instead she thought of arithmancy that always made her peaceful perhaps you do not have the eye or your vision is clouded the tealeaves tell a different story though kiara smiled as hermione glared kiara always found divination interesting but severus had decided that it was a waste of time no daughter of his would be studying a load of hogwash hermione obviously thought so too who told you that you dontlike divination harry may have let it slip i should have known only a few days and already you re sleeping together and quite close either things are moving way too fast or you were meant to be together i done could you get the next person you see who is not harry to come up here fore a quick sketch kiara looked at her sketch of hermione and nodded in satisfaction it was all right by her standard she wasntgoing to say anything to hermione comment she didntlike harry in that way kiara was still wary of him even if they slept in the same bed forgetting things you had been reminded of every day was not an easy task alright we ll talk later hermione left the room leaving kiara to prepare for the next person she still had a long long day ahead of her to get through fifteen odd people with only twelve hours left would be hard work kiara wondered if harry was that special maybe kiara arm ached as she put the final touches to her masterpiece she smiled honestly proud of herself if it werentfor harry she wouldnthave realised how much she liked to draw somehow she d managed to convince mrs weasley to let her eat a sandwich for dinner kiara hadnteatenand whenever she looked up she could see the plate on the table so engrossed in getting everything perfect she didntnotice somebody slip into the room you might want to put a little more tone on hermione left cheek it makes it look better the person said leaning over kiara shoulder as they examined the masterpiece kiara jumped and sighed in relief as she saw it was only ron she followed his advise and saw that it did actually make it a difference i didntknow you were into this type of thing kiara said turning to look at ron she had seen him earlier in the day and as she had sketched him kiara had realised why hermione like him he had a dumb sense of humour and he wasntthat bad to look at his freckled face gave him a cute edge whilst his red hair made him different i didntknow you were either i used to love drawing when i was younger i guess i just donthave the time or the energy to spend my time drawing not when harry potter your best friend he smiled and pulled up a chair so he could sit down kiara wondered what he wanted but didntsay anything all she could was wait and see are you and him no we are not why does everybody insist on asking that question if i was interested i would have said so but i not kiara sighed shook her hair halfway through the day she had felt uncomfortable with her hair up and let it down sorry but it just so terrible when people assume you re together because you sleep together that okay i was just checking because mum was curious and was too humble to come and ask you herself do you know how to draw a hippogriff kiara shook her head and wondered why she would want to draw a hippogriff i ll teach you that is if you want me to with her agreement ron proceeded into giving her step by step instructions on how to draw a hippogriff for a first attempt she hadntdone too bad with drawing the main features now she was adding in detail and tone she struggled a bit but ron helped her he seemed to burst with energy as he helped her the same energy if you ever went to a chudley cannons game with him either he loved art or if you hold your pencil at a different angle to the one you usually do and shade there a slight difference even if you use the same technique ron dictated looking over kiara shoulder as she tried she couldntsee the difference or pretty much anything with her falling in the way before she could brush it aside ron tucked it behind her ear thought it might get in your way thanks kiara answered trying his way again she still couldntsee the difference with her hair out of the way nope cantsee the difference that because you re doing it all wrong your hand has to be at a slightly different angle as well sorry i sound like hermione putting his hand over hers he showed he which way to do it kiara noticed how warm they were slightly sweaty if she was being picky now she could see the difference see i knew i was right when it comes to art and chudley cannons and quidditch there no stopping me what about when it comes to hermione if she liked you would you take the chance and ask her to become your girlfriend kiara asked being as nosy as hell if she was to stay here for almost all of her summer holiday she could at least get hermione and ron to stop being stupid and admit their feelings no ron lied he knew perfectly well that what he what he wanted he d wanted that since first year when harry had been hurt and he and hermione had spent a few days alone the problem was he didnthave much experience in the dating area in fact he didnthave any experience in kissing ron couldntdate hermione if he hadnteven had his first proper kiss it just didntfeel right oh and why that kiara had thought that ron felt the same as hermione did for him she was either a very bad matchmaker or there was something wrong instead of answering he put a warm finger under her chin and made her face him this would solve his problem this ron whispered leaning inand kissing kiara taken by surprise and not having ever been in this situation before she didntpull away and instead enjoyed the softness of his lips on hers he pulled away but only for a second before kissing her again this time deeper ron was enjoying his first proper kiss and kiara was enjoying her first ever kiss a n writer runs away from a mob of very angry ron hermione shippers all carrying deadly weapons disclaimer you know the drill i own nada a n thanks for all your reviews i got two i will keep on writing though because although its still a bit lifeless i hoping to get some twist and turns in there in loving memory tears streamed down hermione granger face as she lent against the bedroom door she couldntbelieve it that morning kiara had acted like a friend a genuine one now hermione saw through her acts she was just another bitch the same like the ones at school who complemented her on her hair then turned around and laughed hermione sniffed and tried to stop the army of tears invading her cheeks which had been at peace for several weeks until now wiping her eyes hermione thought of how her dream had been shattered the dream of her being together with ron double dating with harry and kiara all of that seemed stupid now there was a knock on the door several actually hermione chose to ignore them having a faint idea who it was hermione look i sorry please let me in came kiara voice for a moment hermione thought she heard a hint of her being legitimately sorry as if i wouldntlet you in if you were the last person on earth kiara snape just leave me alone haventyou done enough damage hermione answered tears springing to her eyes perhaps she shouldntblame kiara she was a snape rather two faced never knowing what their real intentions were until it was too late roughly wiping her eyes with the back of her hand hermione swore to herself she wouldntcry over ron he was just ronald weasley after all yes and i sorry i dontlike ron not in that way i dontparticularly think he likes me either are you going to let ron go because i kissed him if i married him then yes but i haven t if you truly like him then you d fight are you seriously going to let me stand in your way kiara was rebuilding hermione broken self esteem although she was insulting herself probably encouraging hermione to fight her wasntsuch a good idea either i not going to lower myself to your level good things always come to those who wait are you a girl or a boffin are you going to bury your nose in a book hate me forever and resent the fact you let ron go for the rest of your life or are you going to bat those eyelashes someday forgive me and live with the fact you got your man for the rest of your life go away kiara i have nothing to say to you tough i going to sit here all night if i have to i not moving until you and ron are a couple i ll do whatever it takes tell you whatever you need to hear and say what you want me to say just as long as you and ron are happy kiara could be heard sliding down the door and settling into a comfortable position why are you doing this hermione asked adjusting her position on the floor she was beginning to get cramp up her right arm the tears had long gone and her eyes were now wide in curiosity kiara could have laughed in her face and showed off the fact harry and ron both seemed to like her but instead she chose to sit on the floor talking to her you are the first friend i ve had who has any real chance of staying in my life remember when we went shopping you helped me pick out half my wardrobe and i love it i not going to lose that friendship over a misunderstanding or i think it is kiara explained smiling as she remembered that day well the argument with tonks also stuck in her mind i would rip that sketch i ve spent the whole day doing just for you to see i would do anything for a friend especially one like you what if i dontbelieve you i sit here until you do should i ask ron to come and explain why he kissed me before hermione could answer kiara was already calling him ron ron get down here hermione heard somebody come down the stairs and somebody else sliding down the door she expected it was ron it was hermione kiara is telling the truth i wouldntlie to you i shouldnthave kissed her i a guy and i not going to deny i didntenjoy it but i would have enjoyed it better with you ron said hermione was sure he was going red and sure enough on the other side of the door kiara was trying not to laugh despite the situation she was in still doesntexplain why you did it hermione said moodily what if they were both lying but what if they were telling the truth she sighed and lent her head against the wooden door being sixteen was complicated enough with her newt next school year and not enough time to revise without having boy trouble and a snape as a friend it embarrassing i did it because i wanted to be hermione didnthear the rest and nor did kiara for that matter he trailed of and it sounded oddly like troll to kiara a lot of grumbling and mumbling nothing comprehensible what kiara and hermione asked in unison i did it because i hadnthad any experience kissing anyone before i just thought i d practise before i came to the real and proper thing meaning you mione hermione felt herself going red kiara also but not because she was embarrassed because it was funny thanks a lot ron i ve always wanted to be the practise see hermione i wasntlying and ron obviously doesntlike me if i was the practise if he did he would have used harry hermione had to laugh at that and soon all three of them were laughing i ll leave you two to sort it out but when i come back you ll be smiling and all happy and let keep this to ourselves harry doesntneed to know and what if he asks ron asked obviously not getting what kiara wanted tell him you finally opened your eyes to see what was right under your nose or just say ask kiara she ll tell you and say no more it may not come out that good if you say it kiara ruffled ron hair before skipping up the stairs hermione would forgive her tomorrow right now there was a sandwich waiting for her and this book on ancient spells she had seen even though she d already read it she needed to refresh her memory it could come in useful another sleepless night ensued for kiara whilst harry snored rhythmically it was slightly annoying but it wasntwhat was stopping her from sleeping thoughts and memories swam around her head mixing together until there were times she couldnttell what was what kiara wondered what life would be like if her mother was alive she didnteven know who her mother was right now kiara bet she d be on her own queen size bed in her own bedroom with a large bookshelf to keep her favourite books on knowing that when she woke up she d have two loving parents they d have mother daughter moments and she d always be able to convince her father she was right it would be like a dream but that all it was a dream that would never come true or even if her father treated her like a human then she would have never run away she wouldnthave had to kiara would have been at hogwarts or gone to some other school she wouldntbe betraying her father going against the family name she wouldntbe stuck in the middle wondering what she was doing helping the order or if she should go back she wouldnthave been adopted by severus and he wouldnthave the burden that was she kiara would be like every other person in the wizarding world normal wiping away a silent tear kiara slid away from harry hoping he wouldntwake up he simply turned over and continued snoring away she would do what she had wanted to do for a long time run and not look back if she were to die tomorrow then she would have helped the order as much as she had helped her real father a little yet not at all getting changed and stuffing change of clothes into a bag she crept downstairs cursing the squeaky floorboards there was a light in the living room and the door was slightly ajar stopping to catch a snippet of the conversation the topic didntsurprise her i aintgot nothing against her no siree me i just think harry oughta be careful she a clever minx next thing you know she cleverer than dumbledore she already knows more than this poor thief she heard mundungus gruff voice say so this is what he really thought of her i have to agree with mundungus remus it all seems a bit dodgy to me now i dontknow which side she on but i d put a sickle on the dark side we donteven know if snape is really on our side tonks said kiara wasntsurprised they werentyet on speaking terms sleeping together on the first week of knowing each other makes me think that she just here to get to harry i mean what if she meant to get pregnant so that their child is evil and has harry blood at the same time and when the child grows up they ll carry on you know who work or what if her job is to lure harry into a trap where they ll kill him bill weasley piped up there was laughter but before kiara could move she heard arthur weasley voice i dontlike her i dontlike her one bit i quite certain i like the father better at least we know who he was and what he is with her you canttell apart from the strong resemblance and somewhat similar personalities she could be adopted using the back of her hand as a tissue kiara slowly and carefully and opened the front door stepping out and with equal carefulness as she had opened the door with she closed it remus ears pricked as the door closed with a small and barely audible thud he had know somebody had come down the stairs and now they were gone excusing himself i really need some fresh air remus also left the house whoever had gone although he could guess who might need his help kiara sat on a swing staring into the distance and watching the odd car drive past everything was silent apart from the occasional car the creaking of the swing as she swung gently and the rustling of leaves as a small breeze blew them about she had found this park and thought it a great place to sit and think kiara enjoyed the peace and quiet but unlike at the snape mansion you couldntsee the stars hearing drunken laughter in the distance kiara tensed and decided she should move alcohol had many effects yet before kiara could put a safe distance between them she had been spotted oi you got any weed kiara heard one of them shut she carried on walking slightly faster glancing back she saw that it was a group of boys four of them slightly older than herself possibly 18 or 19 deaf bird i know you can hear me so stop turn around and answer me kiara pretended she hadntheard anything i need a shag kiara heard another say there was laughing and kiara sped up if she sped up even more she d be jogging the hairs on the back of her neck prickled she knew danger when she sensed danger maybe if she ignored them they d leave come on give us a shag you heard him darling he wants a shag and your going to give it to him at this point kiara ran only to hear the boys running behind her tripping on a chipped bit of the pavement by the time kiara had pulled herself up she was surrounded she could smell the alcohol from a distance so it was intense when the one who had spoke lent forward and talked barely five inches away from her face we ve got you now gaza she only young let her go i know a couple of birds who ll shag the lot of us for a fag one of the less drunk one said the one kiara supposed was gaza turned around and stared at him in disbelief and irritation he dontwant none of your slappers bonehead baz wants nice fresh meat gaza told him he shrugged and looked at kiara apologetically for a moment kiara thought she knew him from somewhere but she pushed the thought away she was surrounded and nobody knew she was gone panic was forced down and her brain began to work if she hurt gaza none of the others would do anything right gaza turned back to kiara see what going to happen is baz is gonna have you first since he asked first then me then gav and warren if he wants to i dontthink so kiara said stomping on gaza foot and then aiming where it hurts most whilst he was doubled over in pain kiara took advantage and barged past one of them or at least she would have liked to instead he caught her arm and spun her round so she was facing gaza who was standing up even if a little bent forward she said her prayers and hoped she d come out of this alive the little bitch can fight well fight this gaza punched kiara in the stomach and it hurt more because she couldntdouble over in pain not whilst being held up before she could recover she felt a series blows to the stomach and a backhand across her face she was in pain but she d felt worse cantcan you sorry baz but i think i ll go first since i the one who got hurt baz shrugged as gaza began to loosen his trousers even if kiara could scream she didntthink any sound would come out the panic came back and she closed her eyes waiting for it to happen it was her own fault and she would take it like a woman which was what the guy who had tried to help kiara said shut up and take it like a woman talk and he ll hurt you kiara felt a rough hand around the waistband of her trousers and tensed his hand began to go lower and reached its destination the other hand wrapped itself round her waist and she felt the alcohol in her mouth as he kissed her andforced his tongue through but before he could do anything more they heard a shout kiara didnthear what was said but all she knew was that the hands retreated and she was pushed forward she was free she watched the boys run off one of them cursing and the rest laughing standing she turned around to see who had scared off her tormenters and didntknow whether to be grateful or run as fast as she could in another direction remus reached her slightly out of breath looking concerned but a hint of anger in his eyes are you alright he asked panting he reached to touch kiara shoulder but she flinched in pain and because at this moment she didntwant anyone touching her even remus he finally caught his breath and looked at kiara eyes which even in the faint light he could see were filled with fear a pain kiara are you alright i fine just fine kiara answered before she began to walk towards the main road all she had to do was stick out her arm and the knight bus would be here then she d go to london spend a night in the leaky cauldron and then find bill nought he d know what to do and that was not asking obvious questions i know you dontwant to talk about it now but you could come back to grimmauld place and we d talk over a cup of hot chocolate and you have a nasty cut on your lip she subconsciously reached for her lip and felt the cut she knew there was a bruise on her cheek but remus didntsay anything what if i dontwant to come back i follow you and have severus bring you back instead and knowing how weak he still i it might tire him out remus had pulled the guilt card which had a 50 percent success rate and a 50 percent chance of not working luck was with remus as he watched kiara turn around and allowed him to take the lead for he knew where he was going kiara trudged behind remus trying to think of a way she could outsmart him and run twice she tried to make a run of it but he somehow caught up with her and managed to end up in front of her her brain had gone on strike and she half listened to him babbling on about his day and what he planned to do tomorrow it was obvious he was trying to get kiara to forget whatever had just happened but he was failing almost miserably kiara face was beginning to ache and sting especially her right cheek and her stomach ached but in general she hurt all over once inside remus checked that the living room was empty before ushering kiara in and motioning her to sit down he wouldntmake her talk right now but first he had to make sure she was alright physically first mentally would come later kneeling down so she had to make some kind of eye contact remus talked as gently as he could listen i need you to tell me where it hurts tell me or point to where it hurts i not a healer but i ve dealt with so many bumps and scrapes i should know what i doing unless you want me to ask molly for help remus said watching kiara lips quiver her eyes filling with gratefulness she opened her mouth to speak but instead shook her head removing her jumper so she sat in a t shirt she showed him the bruises on her arms from being held back tightly lifting her t shirt she showed him the red mess of bruises on her stomach her right cheek which was also red and her split lip which remus had actually spotted at least that where it hurt the most can i just have the hot chocolate and i ll sleep it off kiara mumbled she was in pain but she didntneed help she hadnthad it in years and she didntneed it now remus sighed and wondered how kiara could be adopted when she was so much like severus both incredibly stubborn and refusing help when they needed it most remus shook his head almost apologetically no just wait here and i ll be back with a cold compress for your stomach and some stuff for your other bruises and cuts and the hit chocolate i promised of course he smiled and left the room kiara relaxed and thought about whether to make a run for it or sit through some personal revelations for some reason telling remus seemed easier than telling harry perhaps it was the fact that she and remus werentthat close before kiara could make up her mind remus came back balancing a lot of things do you need any help he shook his head and put everything down on the coffee table two mugs of steaming hot chocolate a cold compress what looked like a tube of antiseptic cream a packet of cotton buds and a container of cookies probably mrs weasley s again he knelt down beside kiara so she was at a slightly higher level and talked as gently as possible now i need you to take this cold compress put it on your stomach and lie back so it just sits there kiara did as was told and only flinched a little bit as the coldness spread across her stomach stinging waving his wand bandages wrapped themselves round kiara so the compress was held in place now for your face and arms putting a dab of the cream onto a cotton bud remus put it on her right cheek and her arms throughout all of that he hadntactually touched her at all thank you kiara mumbled remus nodded and pulled up a chair so he was sitting opposite of her does severus need to know i know i was stupid to take of like that and if you hadntcome when you did things could have been worse if you dontwant me to i wonttell him but if he asks me then you know i cantlie although i will try and avoid the question at first kiara wished for a split second that remus was her guardian but then shook the thought away he was harry guardian and she was simply stuck with dumbledore harry told me not to spend so much time trying to forget my past to talk about it since you re the only one apart from dumbledore whom i ve developed a dislike for who knows that i adopted can i talk to you kiara asked surprising herself and remus he handed her mug of hot chocolate to her she loved the smell and the taste even better sure anything you want to get off your chest now a good time i dontknow where to start i just going to stay it as it is i was abused ever since i can remember tortured somewhat indoctrinated left holding onto my life with my nails and more my earliest memory was when they gave me a teddy bear for my birthday i think i used to love it so much then a week later they pulled the stuffing out of it ripped off the teddy bear head and threw it in front of me i cried and screamed and i think i bet somebody till they bled the thing that silenced me was a hard throw against the wall i grew up got used to it dontflinch they get bored dontcry they give up donttalk they go away do something wrong and you might as well be dead the first time they used the cruciatus on me i screamed till i couldntany more last time i yelled out in pain and shut my mouth kiara stopped to drink some of her hot chocolate it was still hot but it was drinkable they werentviolent they were just bitter towards me one of them taught me everything i know though day after day week after week he stayed with me he wasntthat much better though wrong answer and i got the cruciatus he did help me out of some sticky situations though i have a knack of getting into them there was a pause and both of them said nothing remus had always thought the students of hogwarts had it bad in one of severus detentions but the cruciatus for a wrong answer unheard of kiara contemplated whether to continue she stared into the fireplace and held her mug tight it was somehow soothing the silence stretched but kiara didntcontinue do you want to talk about what happened earlier remus asked kiara eyes flashed with the same fear and pain he had seen earlier she simply continued to drink avoiding his gaze that was something she wasntready to talk about just yet at least tell me why you ran i ran because i a traitor i a traitor to the dark side yes i was on the dark side but i was no death eater how do you think i know so much i cantlive here knowing if everything goes to plan that harry wontlive to see his 17th birthday and i cantlive knowing that i i i just cantlive i ran because i was scared because severus took me in not knowing what he was up against there more to me than my shy exterior i believe you that why you need to go to hogwarts you have survived sixteen years of god only knows shit and nearly died twice in a time span of only a couple of weeks trust me harry wouldntcare if you had killed a whole lot of people he likes you for who you are not what you were what a stupid teenage girl who likes to bend the rues to suit her needs i knew that i was supposed to stay here for a reason and i knew london was dangerous but i still ran ran straight into trouble how could i have been so stupid tears streamed down kiara cheeks and remus didntknow what to do we all do stupid things we ve just got to learn from it and move on right now i can only guess you re upset and even though i not entirely sure what happened feel a little wary of us men it ll take awhile to heal but with the friends you have here not too long i think i ll go to bed kiara mumbled wiping her eyes and draining her hot chocolate she briefly hugged remus and turned to walk out of the room she had reached the door when remus stopped her knock on my door in the morning before harry wakes up then in the afternoon you ll help us prepare for his party whilst he out at a chudley cannons game and please kiara dontrun remus said kiara nodded and walked out of the living room remus busied himself tidying up and a few moments later sat in the kitchen knocking back fire whiskey he too felt like running turning his back on everything and starting a new life a life where no one knew he was a werewolf and didntcare enough to notice he disappeared every month to be able to find someone who loved him even when they found out who he was if he couldntrun he d like to turn back time remus would make sure lily and james never died that sirius never died that everything bad was reversed that he never wandered into those woods thirty years ago he finished the bottle and dragged himself up the stairs whist he still had some sense of direction before he nodded off he thought about kiara why she looked familiar and why her behaviour was familiar it was as if he had known her before remus knew she bore an uncanny resemblance to severus but her smile just wasnthis he knew he had seen it somewhere but didntknow where the stubbornness tongue and knowledge were very much like severus but her kindness compassion and warmth was something else and kiara eyes they werentseverus they belonged to someone else think you stupid werewolf think he muttered to himself before he felt himself switch of his last thought was in loving memory of a n stupid stupid girl at least hermione and ron are how they should be kiara is well the angsty oc and remus is the lovable werewolf keep those reviews coming a n yes i know i haventupdated in years and for that i apologise suspension was lifted and therefore i can now put more effort into this this chapter is just a base for the next and the remainder of the story i intend to finish this before harry potter and the hbp which means i ll have to update more often and cut it slightly shorter kiara is a twisted mary sue and i wouldnthave her any other way just to let you know oh and i ve decided to reply to reviews and they re at the bottom of the page disclaimer i dontown nothing stronger than yesterday the next morning after her visit to remus to remove the cold compress on her stomach before harry woke up kiara came to a conclusion she needed to be a lot stronger along with learning to love she had let her guard down yesterday was the perfect example she had cried in front of remus and let herself get wound up in feelings she had long wanted to forget once harry had left the house preparations began but kiara withdrew to the library saying she had tons of revision to do downstairs she could hear mrs weasley shouting commands but quietly enough not to wake mrs black who kiara was unfortunate enough to meet in the morning when she tripped over the coat stand instead of staring at her books and not taking anything in kiara chose to look up the ancient spell she had seen in the book she had been reading yesterday ancient spells that have killed those who attempted them the book was called and yet it didntdeter kiara the spell she was currently looking up was scelaratus sus ligatio one that had worked on rare occasions and killed some who had tried the last person to successfully complete it was grindelia the great vii just under a century ago but had died two weeks later after losing her sanity what had attracted kiara to the spell was that it could be quite useful scelaratus sus ligatio was a way of bonding two people together through their magic what happened was one person would give their positive magic whilst the other gave their hidden dark magic a magic that was hidden so deep and brought misery a part of the person that was sometime forgotten the positive person would be the stronger of the two whilst the negative one bore the person pain and usually ended up insane if she were to perform that with harry he would become more powerful and spend less time dwelling on the negative side of life and be more positive it could be enough to help defeat voldemort the downside to it was that her body could reject such a large amount of negativity and die she could lose her sanity or she could become a squib since most magic was positive the upside was that she was helping harry who she owed a friendship reading the instructions she concentrated all she had to do was focus the magic she wanted and imagine it was a little ball and send it to her fingers she tried positive energy first closing her eyes she thought of all the happy times most of them recent others scattered across her childhood rolling those thoughts into a ball she felt it slowly but steadily make its way to her fingertips from her heart until it came to a spot opening her eyes she saw a silvery green ball of what looked like electricity hovering above the palm of her hand which was stretched out closing her hand the magic disappeared next she tried the negative magic this time she thought of everything negative which wasnthard and when she opened her eyes she saw a black ball of electricity with blood red and green sparks kiara was looking at it in wonder when she heard a knock on the door quickly she closed her hand and tried to look innocent i know you re revising kiara but could you come downstairs and give us a hand we could do some more help remus said as he poked his head round the door he noticed kiara innocent look which he could spot from miles away she was hiding something sure remus i ll be down in a moment kiara smiled closing her book a bit too fast remus caught a glimpse of the title killed those who attempted but didntsay anything kiara was smart enough not to try anything stupid especially not two days before her owl but she had survived so far maybe she could pull it off again ok dontbe too long though the match could finish anytime and we still haventmanaged to put all 45 of harry presents into the living room do you want yours in there kiara shook her head and remus simply shrugged before going back downstairs it was her choice ouch and that own goal puts the chudley cannons behind 60 110 that is the third own goal this match it been one hell of an hour and still no sign of that snitch not even a wronski feint has been attempted of yet better not the seekers dontseem up to it the commentators voice boomed through the stands the harrow sparrows fans cheered but they were outnumbered by the upset chudley cannons fans as the keeper was hit in the face by a bludger things were just getting worse for them there was a five minute time out as the chudley cannons keeper was carried of the pitch his face hardly visible behind the mass of blood mr weasley took this as an opportunity to go to the loo whilst bill talked to a pretty girl around his age about this being the worst game of the season harry took this as a chance to talk to ron about kiara he had noticed a change in her this morning she seemed less depressed somehow stronger but not yet happy the feeling he had got was hard to explain ron truthfully what do you think of kiara i know what i think i just want to know what other people think harry asked blushing as ron winked and nudged him playfully harry regretted having spoken to ron even remus would have been more mature about it i think that for a snape she a decent person there a lot she seems to be hiding but she good for you she handles your moods better that the rest of us ron answered shrugging although a grin was appearing on his face he was referring to this morning when harry had gone into a strop because he had misplaced his wand and he wasntgoing to do anything apart from shout until he got it kiara had calmed him down by simply placing her hands on his cheeks and looking him straight in the eyes his wand had been under his pillow but i suppose that because you both like each other what do you mean she likes me has she told you harry blushed as he realised he sounded desperate he had certain feelings for kiara but he wanted to make sure there was a possibility they might be returned harry remembered severus threat but waved it aside the more he was irritated the happier harry was harry be serious for a minute mate if she didntlike you more than a friend would she sleep with you at our age no teenagers of the opposite sex can sleep in the same bed without having some sort of contact if you know what i mean dontworry sooner or later you ll find out ron attention switched back to the quidditch pitch where the game had resumed harry wondered what ron meant he would find out but decided to leave it perhaps he would be rushing thing and there was nothing worse than rushing a relationship his feelings for kiara might be feelings of gratefulness for the friendship he and kiara shared or because she was the only who really understood what he was going through pushing kiara out of his mind he cheered as the chudley cannons scored a goal something that had been rare in this match surprise harry jumped as he entered the kitchen he smiled as he saw the decorated table filled with food to fit a king so they hadntforgotten his birthday at all they d simply been planning this party his spirits were lifted especially after that rather depressing chudley cannons defeat and he was grateful to have friends who cared for him so much it was his first birthday celebration and he was going to make the most of it for once mrs weasley hugs didntsuffocate him and he gladly received the birthday wishes and hugs kiara hug lingered a little and harry smiled sheepishly as he saw ron wink settling down to eat there was a lot of jovial chatter whilst everyone stuffed his or her faces with mrs weasley delicious cooking there were quite a number of people there around 15 the 8 weasley s hermione mundungus remus tonks moody dumbledore and one person this time last year harry wouldnthave thought about or even known existed kiara snape there was a smile on her face as she talked to the twin who wanted her to be a weasley wizard wheezes hogwarts correspondent apparently a snape using their product would be a huge sales booster but harry knew it wasntgenuine when she was genuinely smiling her eyes brightened up and small dimples appeared in each cheek and her current smile had none of that it was simply polite if you re going to stare harry at least dontdo it so obviously remus said quietly as he leant over to harry ron who had heard was about to say something but was promptly elbowed by hermione who had also managed to hear so it wasntthat quiet talk to her but just dontstare people might start getting ideas ha ha remus point taken i didntrealise i was staring harry said blushing slightly he had to stop blushing every time kiara was mentioned in the same subject as himself or he would be blushing forever hey remus do you think that things would have been different if sirius had lived for one there be a lot more alcohol and it d be a lot louder we d never get any rest because sirius hatred for severus would be projected onto kiara and i doubt she d stand for it you saw how she was with tonks i hate severus kiara supposedly hated me but we get along just fine we re becoming like this harry crossed his index and middle finger together it was true he and kiara were getting closer every day harry didntknow what it was but he felt like he d known her all his life not for a couple of days there was just something about her do you really need me to answer that question didntthink so now shut up and enjoy your birthday you are restricting my food intake harry smiled as remus returned to his food and shoved forkfuls into his mouth after mrs weasley was certain everyone was full and had successfully managed to stuff the last two slices of cake down harry throat they moved to the living room where kiara had helped to stack all of harry presents ranging from a watch to yet another organiser to spy ware harry face was like a little boy on his first birthday as he unwrapped each of his presents he did notice however that out of all his presents none were from kiara who sat on the floor hugging her knees comfortingly harry thanked everyone for his or her presents for being there as he said this all the background noise faded out and so did everything else he was standing in a white space everywhere he looked was white turning around he saw sirius yet he had returned to his former self there was he was smiling and had a peaceful look on his face that harry had never seen before it was just himself and sirius sirius harry said almost asking sirius nodded and a tear sprang to his eye you re not dead are you i can still come and get you canti just pull you out of the veil canti sirius sirius shook his head his eyes watering as he tried to stay together for his godson harry i just came to say goodbye i need to move on and so do you but before i left there are some things i have to tell you i need you to listen to me okay harry sirius asked stepping forward and placing a hand on harry shoulder comfortingly harry nodded and sirius smiled firstly you need to watch kiara not watch her as in she suspicious but watch her as in look after her dontask why just do it she an important part to the war and to your sanity without her i dontknow what to say look after her harry just dontdo something drastic for her alright you came here to tell me to look after kiara snape could have told me that i haventfinished dontbe stupid anymore harry stop playing a hero your time to will come and until then try not to jump head first into things more people could have been hurt i dontblame you for what happened in fact i think i ll like it where i going i ll be back with james and lily say hi to them for me i will one last thing about kiara tell her her mother says hello and that she wishes that she could be there for her if she d had the choice she would have never died tell kiara not to blame herself and not to do anything stupid if she anything like her mother she ll suffer in silence even if she about to die we were talking about parents me and kiara and she always wanted to know who her mother was you couldnttell me harry asked remembering kiara at a time when he d have thought all thoughts and concerns would be about him but he had seen kiara face when they d been groom buckbeak if harry didntknow who his parents were he d go mad looking for them that would be breaking the rules i can tell you she was a pureblood a rich one at that and when she left hogwarts and married she donated vast amounts of money to hogwarts to have the dungeons rebuilt after it experienced a rather unfortunate incident with cornish pixies and to update the dormitories common rooms and bathrooms she used to be good friends with remus if she looks hard enough she ll find her mother thanks sirius and goodbye i ll see you in a few decades you have fun i ll miss you harry was hurting badly but he knew this was right sirius had to move on and all of a sudden kiara became more important than mourning well according to sirius she was oh before i forget ask dumbledore about another prophecy that has been made it ll answer some of your questions sirius said beginning to fade away he hugged harry tightly before walking away and harry dontgive up you know you like her really harry watched sirius fade into the darkness and suddenly he was back at 12 grimmauld place a champagne bottle being cracked open time seemed to have stood still long enough for him to stalk to sirius excusing himself so that he could get to grips with what happened he went to the kitchen and got himself a glass of water he sat down and could hear laughter and music coming from the living room after awhile somebody came in he knew he should have been in the living room but it took a bit longer than 5 minutes to sink in that you had just said goodbye to your godfather what is the birthday boy doing sitting all alone when there are so many people in there who are here to celebrate his 16th birthday harry heard dumbledore ask before he took a seat opposite harry there was that twinkle in dumbledore eyes that harry hated and harry remembered what sirius had told him just wondering what prophecy i haventbeen told about i assume it involves me harry answered icily looking up at dumbledore with a loathing that could easily rival kiara and his loathing was justified it was partly dumbledore fault that he had just had to say goodbye to sirius i was hoping you d learnt your lesson i was going to tell you when i was sure about a few things the prophecy involves you and voldemort but it about kiara i simply had to make sure it was her you wouldntwant me to make another fatal mistake would you harry glared as dumbledore raised an eyebrow almost mocking harry go on then i dying to find out what this prophecy says before voldemort can kill me he has to kill kiara or maybe kiara is the chosen one and not me dumbledore chose to ignore harry remarks and tried to remember the prophecy i not entirely sure but i do believe it goes like this as light and dark begin a battle one must defeat the other for this a girl shall be born but from her mother she shall be torn dark and lonely will be her life till she decides to end her strife when this shall happen the power inside will her loyalty divide the choice is hers depending on whom she prefers she will help one side or both destroy in their stride yet with her success comes her downfall when many tears will fall sacrificing what she holds dear the pain her heart it ll tear you ve certainly been studying it harry said his voice laced with sarcasm and he knew it care to explain what it means if the girl is kiara then it basically says that during this war she will either help you or voldemort or destroy both of you however when she as succeeded in doing one of those she will sacrifice what she holds close i still not entirely sure what that might be dumbledore explained he had spent some time now pondering over the prophecy and what it meant there was a pause how did you come to find out about the prophecy harry pretended he hadntheard the question kiara needs to be told and i certainly not doing it it your mess dontkeep her from her or she might end up hating you more than she already does with that said harry turned and strode out of the room head swollen with pride dumbledore lent back in the chair he was sitting on and sighed kiara knowledge of the prophecy was necessary but he didntknow what it would cause her to do would she use it to her advantage or use it to make herself a better person her hatred for him increased everyday and it scared dumbledore to think what she would do knowing that she could destroy him all it would take was changing sides yet there was that small ray of hope the hope she had grown close enough to harry not to fight him for the meantime he would inform severus and make the needed arrangements to ensure she somehow stayed on his side after that he would have trouble harry and kiara were in bed harry sitting up and kiara with her head leaning against his chest he stroked her hair absentmindedly as he thought about the girl he was sleeping with and trusted so much for a near stranger he suddenly wished he didntknow the prophecy knowing she could help or destroy him frightened him he found himself placing a kiss on her forehead it was a reassuring kiss for him and kiara do you like me harry asked kiara took harry hands in hers and seemed to be studying them as she thought over her answer it depends in what way as friends yes as anything else i not sure for one i cantimagine what my father would do and i not the best person to date you donteven know me kiara answered letting go of harry hands she sighed and got out of bed i still need to give you your present cantwe try and make it work i mean as says we re already quite close and sleeping together stuff your father i hope you like it kiara said ignoring harry remark she reached under the bed and pulled out the drawing she had slaved over that now was in a thin black metal frame a smile spread across her face as harry stared at it in amazement it perfect i cantbelieve you drew this you had better believe it i worked hard all of yesterday on that i wanted to give you something special if you were on here it d have made it even more special but it still great i do care about you you know if you were to leave i dontthink i d have anything to live for kiara took the present back from harry and put it back under the bed until they hug it up tomorrow yes you would your life would be less chaotic but you d live are we still on for tomorrow kiara asked remembering what they had planned for tomorrow it was rather important to her if dumbledore will let you it no secret you two arentbest of friends harry answered remembering a rather heated discussion he and kiara had shared at the party it was over whether gold or silver was the better colour kiara wasntbelittled by dumbledore superiority and age she was able to look him in the eye and argue to her hearts content all i have to do is apologise as sincerely as i can and act friendly and he ll have to let me into hogwarts plus i need to brush up on my potions and charms he cantsay no you are one tricky girl you know that and here i was thinking that you were a sweet innocent girl who needs a strong man to protect her well mr potter you thought wrong kiara smiled to herself and snuggled in next to harry it was comforting knowing that she had harry to support her but she couldntlet her guard down again kiara was strong and she knew she was otherwise she would have never got this far now she had the chance she would show the world review replies flamedemon05 thank you for that encouraging speech and i mean it i was thinking of disappearing and never come back but then thought again grades have been raised and writer block is still

may i just ask why you are asking this if you dontlike then dontread kornishpixie sorry for the long wait on the update the next update should be soon and i was going to pull a twist but that would have dragged the summer on a bit and i was hoping to get kiara to school soon lula summers sorry for not updating soon and e richmond is dead in the story so that might give you a clue to who she is hopefully i ll update soon jackie g thank you for that i guess i didntthink about it that deeply maybe i should have done and given the story more substance but i will try to later on it was just

mind a n i have no excuse for not having update in aeons even though i wanted to finish it before hbp doesntseem like it now i am going to finish it and i ll be updating the next few chapters at least one a day until friday thanks for reading and please review oh and yes i am aware kiara is a bit mary sue ish just bear with me thank you creating a bond i missed you so much kiara said as she hugged bill nought tightly tears of happiness flowing down her cheeks bill held her as tightly having missed her too he had aged since the last time kiara saw him his dark brown hair was lined with silver the frown lines on his forehead deeper than ever and he wore the smile of one that had lived long enough to see too much however the love he held for kiara was visible in his brown eyes i missed you even more my little damned lady has grown so much bill laughed as he held kiara at arms length to get a good look at her her hair shone in the afternoon sun thanks to the shampoo kiara had borrowed off of ginny that morning her skin showed some colour in it and she looked happier than he had ever seen her she gave off such a warm glow look at you you look the same but so different i got myself a rich caring father kiara ignored bill confused looked and glanced at the two boys standing slightly behind bill one looked around her age and the other kiara heart did a somersault the wronski feint and a triple pirouette before returning to its original position he looked like one of the guys that had assaulted her that night pushing the thought aside or at least making an attempt to kiara put it down to a coincidence they might just look like each other bill noticed kiara looking at the boys and set about introducing them to her i haventintroduced my sons have i this is my youngest darren great personality bad attitude he your age bill explained pulling the younger boy forward he mumbled a greeting kiara didntquite make out and smiled awkwardly kiara smiled back and shook his hand and this is warren my eldest he as fast handsome and cunning as his old man have you met bill was referring to the knowing looks warren and kiara were giving each other did i not see you in diagon alley earlier this summer kiara said as she briefly shook his hand before wiping it on the back of her jeans as discreetly as she could yeah i think so we went for the same book at flourish and botts he answered avoiding kiara gaze the guilt he had felt yesterday had multiplied ever since he had seen kiara there was an uncomfortable silence may i ask why you brought harry potter as a bodyguard i would have considered that a death wish bill asked suddenly noticing harry who stood behind kiara looking up at the sky seemingly staring at a cloud oh he isnta bodyguard he just wouldntlet me come by myself hold on kiara answered before turning around harry come and meet bill the old man darren the young one and his older brother warren as harry got introduced to the nought brothers kiara and bill went out of earshot for awhile they sat there kiara resting her head on his shoulder as she had often done but not whilst sitting on a boulder on the outskirts of hogsmeade bill sighed deeply and kiara lifted her head the frown lines deepened and he stared out into the distance his mind on something tell me how you ve been i ve been worried about you ever since i left and now i find you looking so healthy and the biggest smile on your face not to mention with harry potter bill said looking at kiara his eyes eagerly awaiting an answer i ve been fine you ve been worrying for nothing really severus snape adopted me he isntthe evil snake everyone thinks he is i staying with the order whilst severus recovers from an accident which also explains harry potter right now though i need a big favour from you you went to snape and yet you completely missed me out i thought you would have come to me first he sounded genuinely hurt and kiara hugged him reassuringly i didntreally have that choice bill i nearly died and severus saved me i tried to come once but we had bonded too greatly by then he changed his appearance for me and got me this necklace he really does care for me besides he has no children you have two i have three and you know that perfectly well daren warren kiara stiffened at the mention of warren and you if you are ever in trouble or get fed up of him i here for you you are the daughter i never had thank you bill i ll keep that in mind but right at this moment i need a huge favour and i just about running out of time before they realise where i am fire away kiara there going to be an attack on diagon alley next week give or take a few days or so in you and your men to help reduce as many deaths as possible basically fight the death eaters whilst saving as many people as possible kiara said finally getting to the point of her excursion to hogsmeade which was going to get her into a lot of trouble for a moment bill didntseem to register what she was saying because he just looked at her strangely you want me to do what cantdumbledore or somebody else sort it out bill looked at her confused by her request do you know what you are asking the attack is a cover up the whole point of it is to kill and injure as many order members as possible so that when they attack the hogwarts express in september harry is an easy target kiara i not please bill you do this for me think of it as us being even we both know that if anything were to happen to harry the world as we know it is doomed alright but this is nothing compared to what you did for me i owe you my life as his eyes became darker kiara realised she had touched a sensitive spot and proceeded in hugging him once more you were willing to die for me and here i am scared to fight for a good cause i ll do it kiara and who knows this old man might have a few tricks up his sleeves thank you bill now i think you might need to leave before the order gets her and are tempted to call the ministry of magic they rejoined the three boys who were in a heated conversation about quidditch a typical topic for teenage wizards and kiara said her goodbyes as she said goodbye to warren out of courtesy she saw the guilt in his dark brown eyes quite similar to his fathers this time when kiara shook his hand she held it on for a second longer and smiled it him there was no point in holding a grudge she was going to forgive him finally convincing bill that they would get back to hogwarts safely the nought males diss apparated getting back to hogwarts wasntgoing to be a problem because seconds after remus dumbledore mundungus and tonks and to kiara dismay severus apparated severus looking quite livid kiara had known she would be in trouble but she hadntexpected severus to come as well she had never seen him so angry before kiara eloise snape you have no idea how much trouble you are in he shouted as he marched towards her his face etched with what had once been worry but now anger kiara grabbed harry hand tightly because firstly she was scared and secondly she was ready to do what had been going through her mind yesterday now was the time she could just sense it severus shouting doesntdo anything dumbledore said calmly although there was a hint of anger in his voice the rest hung back relieved to see harry and kiara safe although if severus anger sparked up any higher kiara might be in danger alright kiara i am extremely pissed with you at the moment you are coming home with me right now and you will explain to me what the fuck you have been thinking for the past week severus said more calmly but kiara didntbudge her hold on harry tightened to the point where harry thought his hand might drop off kiara flinched as severus tried to pull her away from harry he stepped back in disbelief there something i ve got to do first then you can scream at me all you want kiara answered coolly before turning to harry i need you to answer me truthfully do you want to become stronger and get rid of your negative thoughts your grief even you can do that kiara nodded alright just tell me what i need to do i going to say a lot of stuff and then you have to hold out your right hand i ll put my positive magic into your system then you have to focus all your grief your pain everything negative into a small ball and push it to your fingers then put that ball into my left hand got it harry nodded and kiara began chanting only severus and dumbledore could understand what was being said and by the time they had figured out what the whole point of the spell was it was too late to stop it finishing the chant kiara once more focused her positive magic into a silvery green ball of electricity harry held his right hand on the inside scared to death because he didntknow whether this would work but on the outside no emotion showing he was surprised as the ball sunk into his palm that it felt cool remembering what he had he gathered all his negative thoughts his time with the dursley s being beaten up dudley and his gang seeing sirius die everything that had ever caused him pain all rolled into one ball closing his eyes he opened them to find a blackball with red and gold sparks breathing in deeply kiara held out her left hand as harry let the ball move onto her palm kiara felt a burning sensation and as it finally sank into her palm she was propelled several feet backwards onto the floor as she lay on the floor everyone came forward to see if she was alright the spell had sounded complicated but harry was alright and that what really mattered to everyone apart from severus are you alright severus asked kneeling down next to kiara and brushing her hair out of her face she had a few grazes from the fall but she looked alright he tried to feel her pulse but immediately let go siobhan was burning hot virtually untouchable she moaned and looked at her left hand where she could feel her little finger pulsing there was a silver ring with an emerald stone set in it using all her efforts she tried to get up but found she couldn t if i still alive in a few hours then i should be fine if i die now then i guess i not kiara replied closing her eyes harry had reached kiara and wore a ring similar to hers but set with an onyx stone hey harry how are you better than you i would have never agreed if i d known this would happen to you are you okay harry asked looking so innocent and incredibly cute kiara wanted to hold him if only she could do so without burning him when i can get up i will be but if i do die then dontblame yourself harry i wanted this why dumbledore asked as he too kneeled down next kiara it was a wonder he could still do that at his age she groaned and wanted to tell dumbledore to go away but knew she had to offer some sort of explanation for her behaviour what other reason would i perform a spell that has an 80 percent chance of killing me to help harry he could use that magic better than i can i had nothing else to lose apart from my life anyway that is rich kiara it nice to know that i just another random person in your life of course harry was the one who stayed with you all the times you were ill harry s the one who rearranged his lifestyle to meet your quite frankly selfish needs and harry s the one who really cares about you severus snapped getting up and dusting his robes before he could stalk off kiara grabbed his robes and pushed herself up despite the pain at least he shows it better and trusting him is a lot easier and at least he trusts me as well it doesnttake a genius to see you donttrust me and i donttrust you either kiara snapped back before letting and watching severus stalk off followed by tonks who knew a thing or two about annoying daughters she was had been one herself kiara dropped backwards not really caring about the pain she felt as her back hit the floor hard she answered dumbledore questions half heartedly her mind buzzing she heard someone mention something about the hospital wing but she wasntgoing to move it wasntthe perfect spot to lie and brood but she was going to stay here until she snapped out of her mood kiara you are going to have to move she heard harry say opening her previously closed eyes she turned to look at him noticing that the crowd had gone and were standing to one side in a heavy discussion of some sort what the point kiara grumbled closing her eyes again she felt harry take her hand even though she was still burning hot she quickly opened her eyes what are you doing harry you ll burn yourself if you re going to stay here i staying here with you at least until you see sense you need to go to the hospital wing this temperature isntnatural he sat crossed legged by her side and looked determined it ll die down plus i dontthink i can stay awake any longer there this darkness that just trying to cover me i fighting it but i feel like giving up again she closed her eyes knowing that this was the quickest way to fall asleep but she felt harry shake her no fight it because you have no idea what that darkness it is it could just be sleepiness or it could be his voice trailed off but he continued to hold onto her hand despite the temperature in fact she was cooling down slowly but she was still hot there was a silence as kiara struggled to keep her eye open is there anything you want to talk about like anything do you want to tell me what you meant when you had a go at snape kiara cooling temperature seemed to flare up again but harry didntlet go his hold seemed to be the only thing keeping her awake no she snapped she didntmean to be like that but she was angry with herself and it was hard not to unload onto someone else she saw harry hurt face and sighed i mean it just something i dontsee the point in talking about i got angry as well and i said something i shouldnthave do you really trust me more than him no what i said was quite far from the truth i trust him a lot i know he cares for me it just i got used to him being extra nice and careful around me that when he started shouting it scared me and the look in his eyes i dontthink i ll ever forget them i dontknow what it was but something inside of me wanted to hurt him more than necessary harry chewed his lip and thought about that he had never seen kiara do anything that might suggest she wished to hurt anyone but that was what she said she had felt then she remembered the spell they had just performed if she had his negative magic that could mean she had some of his negative thoughts too and it wasnta secret he hated severus i really think you need to get back to hogwarts we can find out what this spell is doing to you and help you get better i sure madam pomfrey will be able to get this fever down no harry kiara what would it take to get you up there if you helped me up there i dontwant anybody else to help me dad can as well that if he wants to which i doubt after my behaviour it would take a lot of effort to get her up there maybe if they flew to hogwarts or something like that a portkey would work alright do you think you can walk harry asked letting go of her hand for a moment his hand was red and sore but he didntcare sirius had told him to look after kiara and that what he was doing if she died he would never forgive himself if he could save her he would do anything i ll have to lean on you though gritting her teeth because of the pain kiara pushed herself up onto her knees first and then onto her feet where her knees threatened to buckle under her but she stayed up with harry help it seemed pretty obvious that she wasntgoing to stay up long and harry thoughts were confirmed when she almost fell thankfully he caught her and picked her up into his arms carrying her towards the adults kiara snuggled against harry and let the darkness engulf her at least the last thing she would remember was the feel of harry toned torso and the smell of his aftershave as she drifted off severus kiara is sixteen and you haventbeen with her all those years as she grew up whilst fatherly instincts surprisingly come easily to you kiara may still be too proud that she loves and trusts you tonks explained as she watched severus stare into the distance his jaw clenched and his eyes filled with hurt it was the second time tonks had seen those eyes show any emotion so seeing him like this made tonks wary of whom severus really was behind his mask of indifference her pride will never let her accept defeat her pride will stop her from accepting the fact that there is someone who really cares for her someone she ll let in close for 16 years she has had to look out for herself dontexpect to slot in comfortably into her life how come she can slot so comfortably into my life might as well admit because there no point in hiding it but i had to swallow my pride to please her i cut my hair severus replied as if cutting his hair had been a life changing traumatic experience but it seemed to get on his nerves as he stood there clenching and unclenching his fists i never thought someone other than sirius black could nettle you so much dontgo to kiara make her come to you when she does be waiting with open arms to be the father she needs from what i can see you re not making it easy for her either she doesntknow when you re going to die maybe tomorrow maybe in an hour she has no idea and i bet that eating her up inside as well why are you being so nice to me severus asked suddenly turning to face tonks who today was sporting a more subtle dark violet hair do with matching eyes it had always unnerved severus how she could change her looks he wished he could do that tonks shrugged i guess i saw who you were really and you still haventput your mask back on i saw the hurt in your eyes and realised you werentthe cold hearted monster everyone said you were you have a soft spot and she reminded me of me when i was young caused my father a lot of grief but then again i knew he loved me you dontknow if kiara does she doesnttrust me at all so the hope that she loves me is being reduced to a mere atom severus sighed and tried to ease away the knife that dug into his heart he couldnttell what it was kiara words had hurt him more than he had anticipated you donttrust me and i donttrust you either was that really true dontact so surprised you hardly trust her with harry i know their both at a highly curious age but if you relaxed a little and werentso hard on the boy you might be surprised you might actually learn to like harry of course she cantbe trusted with potter they re sleeping in the same bed already lord knows what happens in that bed anger flashed in severus eyes and he struggled to maintain his cool and try to relax by clearing his mind there were too many emotions for him to handle i saw your face when kiara reached for harry i saw the anger in your eyes as she refused to move i heard the hurt in your voice when she implied that you werentimportant to her i have to admit it you scared me severus thought over what had happened and registered each emotion and saw tonks was right and that scared him as well he had sworn to himself that if he ever had children he would never hurt them he had sworn to himself he would never become like his father that why these emotions frightened him he had wanted to slap that stubborn look of kiara face as she stood by harry severus had felt a burning anger not towards harry but to kiara if he hadntgained control of his anger at that point there was no doubt he would have had to be held back severus would have done anything to scare kiara into listening to him that was what frightened him what made him shiver even in this afternoon sun do you think i could have hurt her severus asked his voice barely a whisper but tonks heard she swallowed and frowned part of her didntwant to tell him the truth the severus snape she knew had already broken she had no idea what this would do to him but it was unfair if she didn t the truth hurt but it was better he knew rather than found out if we hadntbeen there we both know you would have you would have hurt her until you were satisfied she got the message or maybe until you saw a familiar look in her eyes or her pleading finally broke through the shell of anger only then would you have stopped tonks left severus with that thought he waited until she was out of hearing range before letting out a sob he quickly held it in and walked towards his favourite place where he always sat when he needed to think settling on the edge of a cliff his felt dangling of the edge he looked out into the lake if he were to jump would kiara really miss him he didntknow how long he sat there but when he finally stopped thinking and got up night had fallen severus was afraid not of his father or his sudden sensitivity no matter how much it had shocked him but of himself abnormal pigeons well miss snape under the circumstances you have done extremely well you will receive your test results as soon as possible the examiner told kiara as he led her out of the classroom which had been used to sit her owl for the past four days he smiled and held open the door for her you can rest easy i wouldntworry too much about your exam results one could say you did as well as your father thank you kiara replied and walked out of the classroom as the door shut behind her she did a little victory dance and skipped all the way to the hospital wing where she was now staying madam pomfrey insisted that kiara must be at hogwarts until her temperature stayed constant and she kept food down severus had also stayed but on the grounds that he had work to prepare not that he wanted to stay with kiara he had distanced himself from her kiara was happy to see that harry hermione ron and ginny had come to see her nothing could spoil her good mood today madam pomfrey found it hard to get the girl to sit still whilst she talked non stop about the exams and how well she thought she had done even when madam pomfrey put a thermometer in her mouth she carried on talking if you dontstop talking i will seal your mouth shut and dontthink i wontdo it madam pomfrey snapped causing kiara to blush and the rest to laugh kiara hadntreally meant to talk away like she had done she was just so happy to have finished her owl s she couldntwait to get her results i wonder where our results are i casually sent an owl to lavender brown and she said that she d got her results weeks ago hermione complained looking slightly put off that she still had to wait for her results when others had got theirs weeks ago she wanted to prepare for whatever she subject she would get accepted in but up until she got her results she was studying every option she had i dontmind it ll give mum less time to either act disappointed or to coddle me because i got better scores than the twins ron shrugged ginny agreed saying how she wished she hadntbeen told she was going to be prefect fifth prefect in the family sixth if she counted her father well i just want to know the suspense is killing harry said dramatically although he didntreally care he just hoped he had failed potions another two years of severus would do him more harm than good their conversation soon turned to quidditch and several times madam pomfrey threatened to kick them out even though they were the only ones there it was funny how most topics seemed to revert back to quidditch hermione and kiara not really seeing the point of it all preferring books than to go out and get pointlessly muddy and ginny ron and harry argued their point oh how quidditch gave you an extra buzz and was more interesting than any book kiara was laughing as harry told her about his second year when gilderoy lockhart had made the bones in his arm disappear when severus arrived coughing loudly to make his presence known i have a package for you kiara from a certain bill nought i ve checked that everything is in order there are matters we have to discuss but i ll leave you with your friends at the moment severus said coldly before quickly handing the package to kiara and stalking out of the hospital wing kiara made to stood up an argument in mind but decided against it if there were matters they were to discuss later then now was not the time for an argument what is it ginny asked poking the package it felt like material of course kiara knew what it was she had asked bill to send her anything he did through her severus so that he could check it for tampering bill hadntbeen happy at first but he had relented present for each of you kiara replied opening the package carefully she slid out five slimmer parcels each with a name on handing each one to the correct recipient and keeping her own with her she watched them open it each of them had a cloak their name written on the inside and customised to what kiara had thought they might need each had a place for their wand either up to sleeve or down the side hidden pockets which only they knew were there and the ability to change colour at the owner wish thank you i really needed a new cloak ron said smiling although he really couldntsee why kiara had brought them cloaks nor could anyone else for that matter it not just any cloak i went to a lot of trouble having these made for you kiara answered taking out her own which had her name stitched on in green silk on the inside every one of these cloaks was made to suit the individual they are lined with protective spells so that most spells are deflected although the unforgivables aren t they change to what colour you choose them to be all you have to do is put it on and will it to be can you will it to be invisible hermione asked curious at what this simple cloak really was she willed it to turn pink and slowly changing from its original black it became pink kiara shook her head at that question though it not an invisibility cloak unfortunately only few were made originally and are scattered over the tomake an invisibility cloak is of course possible but risky business i might try it one of these days only joking kiara added seeing the looks on their faces it was almost impossible for her to make an invisibility cloak some of the ingredients for the potion a cloak was dipped in could only be found at the top of the highest mountains and she certainly wasnttaking up hiking they talked some more about the cloaks each turning it a different colour and testing it out by punching each other as hard as possible to see if they felt anything once they had seen some of the things the cloak offered they were thankful harry knew it would come in useful he just had that feeling after awhile the conversation turned to talk of the order and what they suspected voldemort was up to kiara said nothing the attack was scheduled for this week something had to happen soon people took her silence as a wish not to talk about it because it hit quite close to home for her but she was watching the door waiting for someone to come in and they did just before madam pomfrey was due to bring them tea you are unbelievable you know that severus shouted as he stormed into the hospital wing kiara stood up and scowled aware that everyone was looking from her to severus waiting to see who would burst first what are you talking about kiara said innocently although she had an idea what he was talking about and severus knew that he took a newspaper from his hand and opened it to the front page this attack on diagon alley pressure on fudge you knew this was going to happen kiara and you said nothing i should have known you were meeting bill nought for a reason sure he saved a few lives but we could have saved many more if we had known that is if i had told you the amount of order members that would have been lost would have been significant and they are needed do you really think that this is the only attack i know a lot more than you do dad since you didnteven know this attack was happening at least i would have acted on it you sat here knowing it was going to happen and said nothing that what i dontget did you want these people to die is that why you sent a thief and his measly men to see if they could stop them the last thing i wanted was for people to die but it cantbe helped a war is a war dad people die i d rather they died than harry died the whole point of me sending the order on a wild goose chase around scotland was for none of them to get injured they need to protect harry and the hogwarts students when they attack the hogwarts express in september and you only say this now harry asked obviously offended that kiara had only chosen to share this information right now only two weeks left until school started and if it wasntfor severus harry doubted she would have said anything for once potter actually raises a valuable point what more are you hiding from your friends what are you hiding from me kiara was taken back by severus show of emotion and she saw the public mask slip once more and his eyes were questioning her scrutinizing her actions she opened her mouth to answer but found she couldntanswer well i sure i not the only one who waiting for an answer why are you putting me in this position there a lot about me that i hide and i have good reason to i refuse to be judged for what i did judge me for my actions now but you will thank me one day with that kiara stormed past severus but he wasntdone with her he followed her thinking how to snap her shell if she could do it to him he could do it to her how do you expect me to trust you this way kiara stopped and turned to glare at him what was it with them they had never had these disagreements before they had only started five days ago she sighed and turned to carry on walking she had no idea where she was going but she was letting her feet carry her you just have to trust my decisions if you donti understand i wouldnttrust myself either i dontknow why you re following me either because i dontknow where i going severus seemed to stop for a minute to take in their direction but continued to follow her he had a feeling where she was going i trust you nice try but that doesntexcuse the fact that you put me in an awkward position how am i meant to explain to harry why i didnttell him i did what i thought was best but i guess it wasntreally my decision to make i guess dumbledore isntextremely happy about having been in scotland whilst the real drama happened here in london you know you broke his trust in you what he has in me is not trust he knows i could solve most of this war and he waiting for me to but i won t it not my war it not his it harry s i wouldntsay its potter war entirely it yours now too have you quite forgotten you have part of his magic and he has part of yours you made it your war as well you became a traitor to the dark side to help who you thought was right despite knowing the consequences you should be proud what kiara stopped and found she was in the dungeons despite the fact that it was dark and gloomy it welcomed her she had grown up in a dark cellar severus noticed how she suddenly relaxed reaching out to touch one of the walls the stone soothed her constantly sore skin and even though it reminded her of her past it comforted her kiara why did you walk to the dungeons severus asked looking curiously at this girl who had become his daughter she sighed and lent against it resting her forehead on the stone wall he saw her relax even more and when she finally lifted her head she smiled it was a tired smile but she was smiling at least to tell you the truth i have no idea i followed my legs and whilst we were arguing i guess i came to the only place at hogwarts which made me feel at home she took his hand expecting him to flinch from the heat but instead he smiled am i not burning you madam pomfrey said my temperature was still not normal it normal right now do carry on walking and talking we seem to tell each other what we think better kiara smiled and instead on thinking where she was going thought what to say should she tell him her feelings on being a traitor or was this the time to tell her what she thought how did you live knowing you were betraying everything you had grown up knowing i did it through my own actions i didnthave to join the dark lord ranks i chose to i didnthave to join dumbledore i chose to you ve had no choice have you i guess not i just wish i didntfeel like i ought to be going back it was the worst life ever but perhaps if i went back things would be different do you regret letting me adopt you do you regret adopting me when you distance yourself from me i hate it or when you are angry at me but i know it only temporary you can never be worse than my past company you re too good for that they came to a painting of salazar slytherin a smaller one than one that hung in the great corridor which held paintings of all that had helped make the school what it is today the man sat there twirling his wand in hand and looking bored kiara eyed it curiously and salazar eyes kiara as curiously severus did nothing but watch kiara to see what she would do next good afternoon salazar kiara said politely the man in the portrait stood up from his plush chair and scrutinized kiara not knowing whether to respond or if this was one of severus annoying tricks having been the potions master at hogwarts for almost two decades now they had gotten acquainted humph another snape i thought i saw the end with this insufferable know it all who they made professor here what is it you want the man said arrogantly and grumpily before settling back in his chair kiara smiled at hearing severus referred to as he referred to hermione granger you are the great salazar slytherin you must know what i want indeed i do see severus it never hurts to pay compliments the portrait swung forward leading way to a passage which kiara curiously entered severus was impressed kiara had managed to get into his quarters without even requiring the password she stood in is living room and looked around her in awe she didntknow how a place could be so cold yet so inviting how did you do that severus asked very curious now she shrugged and sunk into the sofa she was tired he could see it in her face going over and placing a hand on her forehead he found she was beginning to burn up again when would this temperature ever stay regular i dontfeel too well severus i think i should go to the hospital wing go to sleep you re in no state to walk up there i ll have you transported there severus soothed stroking kiara hair until she closed a small smile still on her face and her breathing even but shallow severus couldntbelieve how much he had missed her it was funny how he had gone expecting to have a fight that would finish any relationship they had managed to build but had only managed to strengthen it i dontknow what i would do without you kiara i trust you with my heart dontforget that i wontbecause i trusted you with mine severus hid his hurt the next morning when she said she could only remember up to the point she had entered into his quarters he would tell her again but not now september 1st came fast enough harry forgot all about kiara not having told him about the attack and spent the rest of summer brushing up on his spells they had gotten their owl results and they had all passed even if it meant they might all be in severus newt classes if he lowered his acceptance grade to an e harry prayed he wouldn t even if harry couldntpractise the spells he discovered at least he knew what each one did in this excessive studying he was joined by hermione ron and ginny who all wanted to be ready for anything if it happened kiara joined them on occasions but she spent so much time in order meetings and came back looking so tired they didntwant to disturb her her temperature had not been regular since she had performed the spell but she was getting used to going from piercing hot to icy cold to normal mrs weasley fussed over her skin giving her all different types of skin cream to use to keep the occasional flaking to a minimum perhaps it was because she burning on the inside but mrs weasley had hoped kiara would tan but she remained pale and even her attempts to fatten kiara up were failing kiara could only keep down half a plate down at a time however severus had taken to spending more time at the order headquarters and this helped kiara keep happy a lot of the time at first everyone had protested against it but after being scolded by mrs weasley and threatened that they would be cooking their own meals everyone had agreed they were surprised when severus had actually been civil to everyone although it was unnecessary to say that he favoured kiara over all of them and he didnteven say anything when he found kiara asleep her head resting on harry lap harry reading a book in fact he had just settled into an armchair and read the newspaper without a word people were suspicious of this new found kindness and were always brought back to earth when they could hear a bitter argument between himself and his daughter it was always sorted by the time they both resurfaced though harry escort was unbelievable everyone had made sure they were packed and ready the night before and getting everyone out of bed was simple a quick breakfast and they went out if they didntwant to attract attention they were going the wrong way about it there to mainly protect harry but also including ron hermione ginny and kiara in the package there stood around ten people around them and kiara could sense other people around them the presence of so many didntsooth kiara for some reason and found it put her in a bad mood being left alone wasnthard since mrs weasley had fussed greatly about her high temperature that morning and everybody knew a high temperature often put kiara in a bad mood a frown appeared on her face as she sat by the ministry car window watching the london streets through the rain that had began to fall you all right harry asked her taking one of her hands in his she shook her head but didntoffer an explanation or turn from the window harry realised that he had been so caught up in learning spells that he had not noticed how ill kiara actually looked her hair was tied up in a bun something she had told harry she hated because it made her face look much slimmer than it was and harry had to agree she looked gaunt and her pale skin did nothing for her really it had lost its radiant shine he wished she would smile that infectious smile she had had only a few weeks previously but order meetings the bonding of their magic and being a teenager with severus as her father had taken its toll on her they drew up to king cross station and most things seemed ordinary there was the usual late morning bustle as the last of the muggles went of to work and the array of hogwarts students and their relatives pushing luggage and pets whilst trying to blend in as they made their way to platform 9 where the scarlet hogwarts express stood waiting for them to board for a fleeting moment kiara thought she saw bill nought in the crowd but waved it aside why would he put himself in danger right now that wasntlike bill so kiara waved it aside and focused on getting through the barrier which she had been nervous about getting everyone through the barrier was no problem but everyone seemed to tense there was no sign of trouble yet but there was bound to be kiara knew she wasntwrong and even if she was at least they had prepared even for the worst a frown appeared on her face once more as she tried to figure out how death eaters could hide on a platform without getting noticed especially with the place laced with aurors called in to tighten security measures more than enough members from the order and bill nought men who managed to look like anxious relatives given away only by their sideward glances a feather fluttered down onto kiara face as she stood waiting with the others for their various pieces of luggage to be put on board the train looking up in the rafters above the platform she saw pigeons yet there was something about the pigeons she couldntquite place how they looked so dark and clean when she had grown to know pigeons as dirty scavenging birds or how they stood together so tightly was not heard of at all and she was pretty sure normal penguins would have taken the time to excrete or at least aim to excrete on several people heads then it hit her what if they werentpigeons but death eaters she quickly spun around and saw that there were pigeons sitting on the train as well i think we d better get on the train now kiara said quietly trying to look as calm as possible remus turned concerned his look was quizzical up until now she hadntminded the slow process of getting to and on the train the pigeons arentnormal we ve got to get on the train before kiara was cut off as pigeons swooped down at once many transforming into their human forms as they fluttered down the big clock on the platform said 10 50 there was ten minutes to get onto the hogwarts express panic ensued as relatives tried to get the remaining children on the train screams filled the platform and soon spells began to be exchanged and they sure as hell werentfriendly we ve got to get these kids on the train moody could be heard grumbling as he deflected two spells at once the order surrounded them creating a shield around them that seemed to be stopping most spells nevertheless they put the hoods on the cloaks up and stood with their wands ready just in case they watched as the shield began to flicker probably as someone from the order was drawn away so they no longer formed a protection around harry and his friends harry got a foreboding feeling that there were just too many death eaters he dreaded to think what would have happened f it was not for kiara warning it would only be a matter of time before those protecting them were reduced to a measly few we arentgoing to hold on forever not the way they re attacking us when the chance comes up all run to the train get on it and stay on it tonks said whilst trying to fight off a particularly persistent opponent she was pretty sure she had hit him with several stunning spells but he seemed to come back it wasntlikely an opportunity would occur they were surrounded and quite far away from the train the answer came in the form of bill nought and several men apparating in the right spots so that they created a passage for them to pass through kiara had been right bill was risking his life to be here they ran in a line towards an open door whilst they warded off death eater alongside the order hermione went first followed by ginny and ron and they all got through no problem any stray spells bouncing nicely off their cloaks yet harry was attacked with more strength and as he tried to defend himself wand arm out from the protection of the cloak he was hit on the arm several times he didntfeel a thing and carried on running instead it was kiara who had to grit her teeth in pain as she felt as if several knives had cut into her arm deeply she could feel her jumper soaking up the blood she felt dizzy and before she could reach the door only about halfway there she fell to the floor the cloud clearing from her eyes she found a death eater stood over her and fear spread through her her wand was in her cloak and it was no use anyway since her she was her wand arm happened to be her right arm as well i thought we made it perfectly clear what happened to those who talked kiara if you had just kept your mouth shut then he might have left you alone he just might i was working towards your freedom but you had to save your new friends didntyou the all so familiar voice snarled placing a booted foot on kiara chest and pressing hard so that her breathing was restricted kiara wondered why no one was helping her could they not see what was happening are you going to kill me she asked hoarsely because he was making it hard to breath therefore hard to talk and her temperature often required her to drink plenty of water for fear of her dehydrating he laughed and put more pressure on her chest i could you know but i won t that wouldntbe fair even you deserve a chance at a real life for a moment he seemed to lift his foot a little and kiara was able to breath but she soon found pain shooting through her and intensifying as the cruciatus took place she had almost forgotten how much it hurt you will come back to us sooner or later the child is never coming back to you kiara heard a gruff voice shout but she was just happy to be out of that torture as brief as it was the boot lifted and she was able to crawl towards the door glancing back she saw bill duelling it out with her tormentor using all her energy she somehow got to her feet and pushed herself inside the carriage where harry was anxiously waiting she waved his concerned looks aside and looked out of the carriage door window and watched to see who out of the two men would win kiara focused solely on that fight she didntconcern herself with anything else even her bleeding arm but watched fearfully as spells were exchanged what happened next happened quickly but as kiara watched the events they seem to unroll in slow motion bill was disarmed and he dodged the spells as best as he could but as the whistle went signalling one minute to eleven there was a flash of green light and just before the train began to move kiara watched with despair as bill nought fell to the floor a n strange chappie i was never good at keeping people in for the strange title but i was lacking inspiration thanks for the reviews maybe i deserve it but where did all the reviewers go well thanks for reading anyway next chapter kiara makes friends my bed or yours i owe you my life these words echoed through kiara mind as she allowed madam pomfrey to patch her up complaining that it was only two weeks ago she had been in the hospital wing and here she was getting herself in this state these words didntmatter though inside her head she kept remembering the green flash of light and as he fell through the air probably dead before he hit the ground it all my fault kiara said although she had only wished to think it madam pomfrey looked at her sympathetically and for the first time kiara didntwant any sympathy she didntwant anyone feeling sorry for her madam pomfrey shook her head and finished wrapping the third layer of bandage around her cuts and handed her what she had said was a potion containing mild sedatives that would help lift the shock and the pain she must be going through it wasntyour fault dear it wasntyour fault she said before moving on to the next patient the train was full of them it was just that harry had come to fetch her saying that kiara had been hurt and garbled things that madam pomfrey had hardly caught except for lots of blood and burning hot knowing kiara special condition she had come immediately but was more worried about kiara state of mind than anything else really her arm would be in a sling for a few weeks because the cuts had got deep enough to cut through muscle and kiara couldntmove it but it wasntknown when kiara would get over whatever she blamed herself for there was a way madam pomfrey could heal the muscle but it would cause more pain than necessary hermione ron and ginny were making prefect rounds handing out potions for shock to the first years especially who hadntbeen expecting this on their first day of school and comforting those who were in hysterics about their relatives harry went into the compartment after madam pomfrey had let him in and he felt sort of guilty if only he had made kiara go first so that when he was hit she had been in the safety of the train if only he hadntbeen so stupid and kept the cloak wrapped firmly around him if only we could make if only come true kiara muttered clocking onto what harry might be thinking she smiled reassuringly and told him her arm would be back to normal in a few weeks maximum i sorry for your loss kiara you and bill seemed close harry said after a silence where they sat staring out of the window tears welled up in kiara eyes but no tears seemed to fall that wasntlike her either in the first few weeks harry had known kiara she had been very emotional and cried at a lot of things now she seemed withdrawn not bright and bubbly any longer we were was all she said on the matter harry brooded on how he should have done more research on the spell and it was in a way logical pain was negative but harry hadntthought she would also be receiving his pain along with his negative magic it would certainly explain why she looked like the it was pouring down with rain every day whilst he felt optimistic about a lot of things even thinking of sirius didnthurt him as much he guessed he had let go but the pain that was transferred was only magical he had certainly felt it when someone had shut his fingers in a compartment door i sure everything will settle once we get to school you ll be sorted into your house and then there ll be a feast and then we have to go to mcgonagall office i sure it ll be fine harry said trying to start up the conversation once more she looked up this time and again smiled it didntreassure harry for this smile was tired and drained but her previous smiles had been bright and carefree have you thought about what will happen to our friendship if i sorted into slytherin she asked quietly watching him closely as his eyes darkened and he thought about it she wasntsure which house she would be sorted into for she had never heard of her actual father talk about hogwarts but she was certain vexus had been in slytherin cantsay i have i suppose i just assumed you d be put in gryffindor with you being so nice and everything but with the bonding thing and everything i guess there a higher chance you ll be in slytherin he looked miserable as he thought about it more and more he had heard talks of them having their own quarters with the possibility to share a bed like at grimmauld place but not of them being in the same house especially since you re father snape head of slytherin slytherin through and through do you think we ll just pull apart why are you worrying about it all of a sudden you never asked me about it all summer i ve just realised how much i d miss you to being able to talk to you without disapproving looks harry thought about this the potions master daughter and the boy who lived suddenly becoming friends instantly would raise a few eyebrows and as much as he hated severus harry had no wish for him to die any time soon maybe we could set an example what kind of example if we got on even had a little bit of romance in the mix people would see that opposite houses arentthat bad you just have to act like a mini version of your father until classes start and we get the chance to be friends kiara considered this and thought that if that the way it had to be for them to carry on being friends properly then that the way it was going to be she had spent long enough with severus to know what he acted like most of the time withdrawn and quiet but when spoken to spoke with arrogance and sarcasm that wouldntbe difficult she had this strange feeling she belonged in slytherin very well potter if i must the deal is done they shook hands left hands because of kiara handicap and harry made himself scarce it would not do to be seen together just yet and he wanted to see if there was anyway he could help kiara continued to dwell on what her life was now going to be like at hogwarts by the time the train arrived in hogsmeade kiara had managed to get herself known so that there were already talks off severus daughter coming to school it hadntbeen her fault really one person had come to ask her whether she was new and who she was and soon crowds were coming to ask her whether she really was severus daughter at this point she snapped at the them threatening a miserable life in potions if they didntshut their mouths and go gawp at someone else she thanked whoever was watching over her life that she got a few moments peace and managed to make acquaintance with a rather podgy looking slytherin girl with black hair cut into an unsightly bob greedy looking eyes and a smile that kiara could only endure for so long at least this millicent bulstrode would secure her a place somewhere in the slytherin social crowd this year first years didnttravel across the lake in a rowing boat for some of them looked very faint and perhaps that excursion would have tired them out even more a message had been passed down the train that this years sorting ceremony would not take place today but in two days time allowing the students to heal and get over the shock kiara didntknow whether she was grateful or not as she sat in a carriage led by these strange looking horses if that is what you could call them trying to listen to this girl talk about her summer which had been spent in france when asked where she had spent her summer she had offhandedly replied at her father mansion and at a friend of her father from the golf club millicent had then launched into this whole description of her father golf club and how she would invite them over that summer that was if kiara didntkill the girl first the great hall was not laid out into it usual four houses but there were dozens of smaller but large enough tables so that family members could stick together regardless of their houses it also gave a chance for first years to be comforted by older siblings some who they had not seen since they were on platform 9 earlier that day hair neatly pulled into a bun her posture giving off an air of arrogance kiara ignored the stares and muttering coming from tables as she walked to a table half filled with slytherins millicent babbled excitedly how the table would like her and kiara was quick to notice the platinum blonde hair that could only belong to a malfoy i was wondering whether the rumours were true our dear snape has a daughter draco malfoy smiled as he kiara approached the table she smiled back and hoped that it was like her father enough it did not have to be identical but there had to be something in there do sit miss snape i personally welcome you to slytherin even if you have yet to be sorted it not very likely you re sorted into gryffindor is it no mr malfoy it isn t call me kiara though i dontneed a reminder that my father is severus snape kiara answered charmingly enough there was a small laugh and any tension that had might have occurred with the arrival of a stranger seemed to dissipate call me draco and these are what you could call my inner circle he introduced to crabbe and goyle two beefy looking boys who were his companions but acted most of the time as bodyguards pansy a blonde girl who would have been sitting on draco lap if she edged any closer blaise zabini an olive skinned boy with a mess of dark curls and a constant frown millicent bulstrode who kiara was already quite acquainted with and another boy who name kiara didntquite catch she nodded a greeting but didntshake any hands she wasntsure of her temperature and now was not the moment for them to find out it funny how snape never let on about having a daughter it must be a pain living with him he bad enough as a teacher let alone a father pansy said raising a valid point what story was she going to spin them and would it match the story severus would later spin them she smiled and glanced up at the teacher table where severus sat looking like he could probably kill the next person who talked to him you get used to it and i quite sure my life at hogwarts wontbe that bad not with me in slytherin and my father head of it she smiled at her new friends if that was what you could call them and remembered that if she was going to be a slytherin she had to be cunning and manipulative i pity those who get on the wrong side of me i can get pretty angry when i want to angry enough to land people unnecessarily in detention and cause them to fail at least one subject i d like to see you try blaise zabini said and kiara turned on him her eyes glaring for moments she held his gaze black eyes against black until he turned away come again kiara dared him to repeat what he had just said but he waved it aside returning to brooding silently if he wanted a challenge kiara would gladly accept it and it wasntlike he was draco malfoy kiara would never dream of starting anything against draco he worked too well as an ally now now kiara you must forgive blaise here he doesntdo well when he sees girls doing better than him it makes him feel small and i think we can all imagine what could happen if a petty fight broke out into a house war that bleeding sorting hat would never stop singing about the houses being divided kiara took note that draco seemed to finalise most things she would have to go to him if she were to befriend harry without the house turning their back on her with that cleared up they talked generally about holidays france seemed a popular destination as kiara was the only one who had not spent at least a week there golf clubs were also popular amongst them and they talked social gatherings for awhile thankfully before the conversation could turn into anything about that morning dumbledore stood up a hush spreading over the great hall welcome back to another school year unfortunately it did not start as well as hoped with an attack launched on hogwarts students and their relatives to give a chance for those injured to seek further medical help and allow contact to be made with loved ones the sorting ceremony will not take place until tuesday lessons beginning wednesday dumbledore said looking around the tables kiara felt a loathing for the man wondering how he could keep smiling at a time like this but for now let try not to think about it and fill our empty stomachs food filled the dishes and kiara watched the people on her table help themselves to large quantities of food whilst she felt queasy picking at the mashed potatoes on her plate and arranging it so that it looked like she had eaten something kiara listened to accounts of hysterical students who had watched their parents hit she was remembering bill death when somebody asked her a question she hadnteven realised they were talking to her how did you get that bad arm i would have thought your father would have arranged it so that you were safe draco asked interested kiara wondered how she would get herself out of this one and shrugged wishing that was an adequate answer draco eyes unnerved her they were so grey almost colourless father wanted me to come to hogwarts yesterday of course but i couldntbe asked i thought i would be alright i would have been if some idiot hadntshut the door in my face so that i was trapped outside of course it only torn muscles and a few cuts kiara said in her new found offhand manner and he bound to fuss over me a lot more if i look like i ve been wounded seriously you are a strange child i think we could get along draco laughed and returned to his food kiara felt herself breath a sigh of relief and found she was indeed hungry but was still cautious at the amount she ate puking right now would be embarrassing and hard to explain once the last of the puddings was cleared from the plates dumbledore stood up again i sure that has filled you up nicely but before i send you off to sleep i have a few announcements firstly the forbidden forest is forbidden to all students hence the name and as argus filch our caretaker wishes me to remind you magic between corridors is also forbidden along with all items from weasley wizard wheezes and the other 999 items on his list located outside his office dumbledore announced with what seemed like a wink at some gryffindors who began to shift around in their seats i d also like to welcome a new member of the staff he will be taking the defence against the dark arts post after last years loss of another talented teacher let hope that professor damien rominisci stays with us there was deafening round of applause as a man perhaps in his mid twenties stood up and smiled the applause came mostly from the girls for this teacher was handsome he had neatly spiked dark brown hair with matching eyes that smiled at you but not as widely as his opal white grin set of by a tan he must have got on holiday to some exotic location unlike the other teachers he wasntdressed in robes but muggle attire of shirt and jeans kiara wasnteasily impressed and she scoffed nothing but a pretty boy she muttered not aware that draco was listening to her he would definitely like her she wasnteasily swayed and her status made her valuable to him he did believe she could make his life at hogwarts living hell but not that much severus was his godfather after all there was a limit to how much more severus would favour his daughter over his prized godson or so he thought second year and upwards will go to your normal dormitories prefects will accompany you for password purposes first years will sleep in temporary accommodation until they are sorted appropriately if any illness is experienced during the night the hospital wing is open and someone will be there dumbledore concluded there was the scrape of benches being pushed back and the sleepy chatter of students it had been a long day for them however kiara stayed seated remembering that she had to go see mcgonagall right now and was waiting for the great hall to empty so she and harry could go together arentyou coming i suppose you re in my dormitory pansy said as she got up to leave with the rest kiara shook her head i have to talk to professor mcgonagall about making arrangements for my condition i need my own room kiara explained but didntoffer any explanation on what condition she had that required to sleep by herself pansy shrugged and went after draco who was more important to her when the great hall was completely rid of students harry came over to kiara miss snape he acknowledged although there was a grin on his face mr potter she nodded amused by this formality that they hadnteven had when they had first met they had gotten along so well like tea and sugar how do you like the slytherin crowd he asked as they walked towards the mcgonagall office she shrugged because she wasntsure she actually liked them they would certainly come in useful i fit in i wouldntsay i like them but i fit in kiara answered all she needed really was a holiday to france and she would be one of them they seemed to accept her even if for now she was only professor snape daughter harry knocked on the door and mcgonagall called them in the office was typically gryffindor it didnttake a genius to figure that out she sat in the gold yellow and red office a contrast to her black robes she smiled as she saw them her usually pursed lips relaxing some of the harshness leaving her face kiara thought the bun mcgonagall had was perhaps a bit too tight but didntsay anything i not sure whether this was mentioned to you but it has been arranged for you to have your own rooms there will be a small common room for private use also this arrangement will stay the same even if miss snape is sorted into a different house she said looking from harry to kiara they both nodded kiara thankful she would not have to share a room especially not with pansy and millicent i understand why kiara has to have her own room but i just wondering why i do harry said and mcgonagall nodded as if she had been expecting this question it was a fairly obvious question to ask after all professor dumbledore thought that you might prefer to be by yourself sometimes in light of situations that may arise and of course miss snape there is direct access to the hospital wing from your quarters so that if you may need madam pomfrey you are close to her thank you kiara said managing a small smile if that is all follow me and i will show you to your quarters the beds are up to standard and miss snape room is at a slightly cooler temperature for comfort it would be best not to reveal your password to anyone although you may explain the conditions in which you have your own rooms their luggage had already arrived and kiara spent a good time staring at the room she was to sleep in it was considerably cooler than harry room but it felt good against her skin as she stood in the doorway he came and wrapped his arms around her thin frame my bed or yours he asked wondering who bed they would be sleeping in it had been easy to decide before because there was only one bed or they had to sleep on the sofa i think tonight harry if you dontmind i d like to sleep on my own a n another chappie just for you i felt lazy but then i realised i owe readers several chapters in wait time thank god i not jk rowling or it would take years for my books to come out well thanks to my reviewers and thanks for reading if you are like me and sometimes are just too lazy to hit that purple button and review next chapter i ll be rustling up a bit of friendship and frustration i think so anyway three letters harry hadntslept well that night he had woken up several times and gone to check in on kiara a little vial sat by on her bedside table and he assumed it had been filled with a sleeping potion which explained kiara calm state he wondered why today had been different why she had wanted to spend the night alone instead of how they had been sleeping together for at least a month her temperature had been normal as he had come to check which was rare these days and for awhile he wondered whether it was him who made her temperature rise yet he and severus were the only ones who could touch her when she heated up it made no sense at breakfast he knew he must look a state whilst kiara was fresh eyed and laughing with her friends he sat picking absentmindedly at his food not aware of hermione concerned looks ron was more concerned in the bacon and eggs he was currently attacking however when he did look up and see harry looking so glum he said exactly what he was thinking harry you look like shit thanks ron as if i didntnotice when i looked in a mirror this morning harry replied slightly amused by his friend lack of sensitivity glancing over at kiara who was whispering something to pansy whilst looking at him he could have sworn she winked at that sight harry felt he could no longer eat and pushed his still full plate away from him even if it was his idea he didntthink he could be as good an actor as kiara then again it must have been in the snape genes you and kiara had an argument hermione asked really worried usually he would have shovelled down food as quickly as ron unless it was the morning before a big quidditch match only then did you have to pry his mouth open to get a bit of toast down his throat could say that he yawned and rubbed his eyes hoping that doing so might wake him up he gratefully received the cup of coffee hermione handed to him even if it tasted nasty as long as it kept him awake or you could say she realised that i was gryffindor scum and she was slytherin royalty kiara would never think like that we all know she not like that think about it hermione ron said suddenly serious and philosophical all summer she was hanging around with us she didnthave to worry about houses now we re at hogwarts she realises that she snape daughter and she and harry cantreally be seen together i still dontthink look guys just forget it and hermione you wouldntreally understand the reason why i down is more a guy thing than a general thing hermione rolled her eyes and ron winked at least that had shut them up when an argument started between them two it was hours before they shut up and agreed to disagree he refilled his coffee and realised that he was down for nothing wasnthe miffed because kiara hadntlet him be the big strong guy and hold her whilst she grieved instead she had pushed the grief away by acting like everything was alright and depending on a sleeping potion to get her through the night well he could act too and he could and would show kiara he was better than some sleeping potion he laughed to himself for that thought was funny realising just how hungry he was he pulled his plate back towards him and ate it gladly boys hermione thought to herself and girls are meant to be the ones with the supposed mood swings but as she glanced over at kiara table she couldnthelp thinking ron was right about something for once post came halfway through breakfast and the older students couldntsay they had ever seen so many owls before everyone got something whether it was a letter from home a newspaper or magazine subscription or the last thing you wanted to get there was something harry groaned as several owls flew in carrying between them a large brown bag marked fan mail he should have realised he was bound to get some after yesterday attack he should have also realised that there was going to be hate mail as well for moments later another bag was dropped before him there were tears some quite hysterical although they didntgo without justification some people had lost their parents or close relatives yesterday whilst they got the students on the train before apparating away if possible some cried out of relief when they got letters from home saying they were perfectly alright or from st mungo saying they would pull through hermione who had been quite worried about her parents was glad to find out her parents were alright except that they would be closing the dental practise for a week to get over the shock hermione was so glad she hugged and kissed a bemused ron kiara was the recipient of three letters whilst others opened parcels with expensive hot chocolate and tea in case the hogwarts supply wasntup to their standards kiara wasntsure whether to open the letters then and there excusing herself she went to hers and harry quarters and sat in a comfy armchair by the fire taking a deep breath she opened the first letter only to sigh a breath of a relief as it was from severus kiara you seemed to be settling in fine yesterday but i free today after dinner if there is anything you wish to talk to me about anything at all even if you just want to talk about how much you hate the school food if there isn t i sure you wouldntmind some hot chocolate dad she smiled seeing that he had signed it off as dad and not as severus it made her feel warmer inside it was nice that he had attempted at something that seemed like it was supposed to be a joke but also a plea for her to talk to him shaking her head at his bribe of hot chocolate she put it aside and opened the next envelope which contained two letters picking up one she started reading hoping that it wouldntbe too bad dear kiara i hope this letter reaches you since we re having a bit of trouble with our own personal owl service i dontknow if you know this but dad bill nought died yesterday one of our men there said that he was killed after saving you or something of the sorts try not to blame yourself i think that the way he would have wanted to go fighting with the guys whilst protecting the innocent as he always put it the funeral wontbe held until next month for certain circumstances but you are welcome to come and i ll keep you informed with the date i think he would have wanted you there and i would appreciate it if you came even if only to say goodbye to him we went through the will yesterday and it seems you have inherited a large amount of dad wealth of course i wanted to tell you before our lawyer contacted your father about looking after the money until you come of age it seems i going to take over where he left off it a huge responsibility but i realised i ve got to be responsible for my actions i know this letter probably doesntmake any sense but i hope you can decipher it in some way write back warren ps i sorry kiara bit her lip in order to stop the tears welling up in her eyes and breaking free this made it all so final bill was really dead and it was her fault no matter what he said the next letter that had been in that envelope agreed with kiara thoughts to the bitch that got my dad killed i hate you i hate your fucking guts you had to go and get my dad killed didntyou after all these years and he had never got more than a few broken bruises and bones you had to ask him that favour all he ever talked about when he was freed was how this little girl had saved his life we all thought he was delusional you know after awhile he seemed to think he d dreamt it as well i got sent off to this special school and didntsee him for two years right so you have to get that it was a huge shock hearing how we were going to finally meet this kiara i thought it was a joke and you are a joke where were you to save his life yesterday dontbother to answer because we all know he died saving you warren seems to think we shouldntblame you but why not if dad had never got wind of this he would have never died and it bad enough you got him killed but you re on the will as well muscling in on everything you show up to the funeral i dontknow what i ll do kill you or kill myself i hope you get the message go to hell darren the son of a man who died without reason ps did i tell you how much i hate you so one brother forgave her and the other one hated her kiara struggled even more to stop the tears so she opened the next envelope thinking it would be better than the last letter anything had to be nothing could be worse than being told you were the reason someone father had died right i know where you are now kiara you will never be safe one day when you least expected he coming to get you think snape can protect you nothing can protect a traitor enjoy being sixteen for it sure isntgoing to last he gets more impatient everyday i want to be anyone but you when he finally gets his hands on you you ruined our plan yesterday potter got away but not a lot of parents did did they certainly not bill nought the order must be kicking themselves how i laugh at their attempt to protect themselves and the innocent bill nought did better before his unfortunate demise remember kiara i know where you are who you re with and i can easily find out what you re doing it wasnteven a proper letter but when kiara put it down she found she was shaking it had shocked any tears away all these what if and if only filled her mind and she felt cold despite the blazing fire putting the letters away she hugged her knees and weighed out her options she could pretend she didntget the last two letters and drown her sorrows by listening to millicent drone on about her boring but long life she could share her anxieties with harry and let him pull her into a hug and tell her that everything going to be alright or she could hold on until this evening and talk to severus about it he was bound to be more understanding and less sympathetic than harry she didntwant o need anyone sympathy kiara thought over that last thought again when had she began to feel like this kiara what wrong kiara hadntheard harry come into the common room and he instantly dumped two large brown bags and came over to her she attempted to smile and shake her head but it was a useless attempt to assure harry instead he seemed more worried have you been crying no she replied nasally contradicting her previous statement she looked like she d been crying her eyes were red and her voice nasal but she might have just been catching a cold i just got some upsetting letters that all i fine now do you want to talk about it kiara shook her head and got up are you sure talking can help you feel better no harry talking never makes me feel better talking never makes things better at least not in my case she attempted to push past him but he got a hold of her arm she was cold right now her skin seemed to have a bluish tint even if she had been sitting by the fire if it about bill i know how you re feeling i lost sirius last year remember someone died because of me the year before that knowing that there was something you could have done to prevent it but didn t eats away inside you until you cantdeal with it no more dontbottle it up i can deal with it it just another thing to my long list of things eating me up inside i cantsimply grieve about one thing i couldnthave stopped i not regretting what i did but ever since we bonded our magic i ve had to deal with not only my negative thoughts but yours as well dad gave me a dream restricting potion of some sort and that how i ve managed the past few weeks imagine having your nightmares and my nightmares combined i wouldntsurvive you should have told me that i know i know i should have told you about the side effects of this but you would have never done it if you had known would you whilst you get stronger i struggle to survive not very appealing you would have never even given it a second thought she laughed dryly blinking to clear her vision from the renewed threat of tears what wrong kiara there been something different about you i sorry harry but my problems even your hugs cantsolve not now she tried to pull out of harry hold but he held firmly on his fingers digging into her left arm kiara didntthink he was aware of his own strength he narrowed his eyes and stared at kiara trying to figure out what was different who hugs are going to solve it your father s maybe malfoy anybody in slytherin he asked searching for a lapse in kiara act that would let him see what was wrong for a moment she stopped struggling and wondered what was wrong with harry malfoy she had only met draco yesterday i d like to know what wrong with you as well giving one final pull she wrenched out of his hold and disappeared down the flights of stairs that led to a statue of a cherub that had the foulest mouth harry had ever seen in the statues around hogwarts in fact it was the only one that actually talked to passer by s you look like you ve just seen a ghost you didntrun into the bloody baron did you draco joked as he ran into kiara on his way out from breakfast to the library he had some books he wanted to take out before hermione got her hands on them she always did but it was worth a try kiara was strangely pale and shivering either from the cold or something else her face had an unusual blue ish tint to it as if she was freezing and when he held out a hand to steady her she was indeed freezing cold geez kiara never heard of a fireplace your father will blow the roof if he finds out his house haventbeen taking care of his beloved princess i fine draco kiara said waving aside his concerned look he was probably more concerned about severus reaction if she said she wasntbeing looked after than how she was feeling she had to admit though that she was unusually cold even for her yes and i go by the name of harry potter let get you in front of a fireplace and see if that doesntwarm you up it was no use trying to protest as he grabbed hold of her hand pulled her down to the dungeons they came to a plain wall and there he tapped a few stones in a certain order before whispering the password pureblood royalty before walking into the wall and pulling kiara through with him despite it being in the dungeons the slytherin common was warmer than kiara had expected he dragged kiara past groups of curious students and set her in an armchair in front of the fire it felt warm on her skin but she doubted that it had any effect whatsoever on her temperature she looked around and decided she wouldntmind being in slytherin at all considering she would be spending most of her time in the common room of the house she got into she jumped as draco put a hand on her shoulder it had been an involuntary reaction and kiara asked herself why one earth she had jumped are you quite alright you ve been sitting in front of the fire and most people by now are burning and yet draco felt her hands you are still ice cold perhaps it would be wise to alert madam pomfrey i getting worried and i never worry there nothing madam pomfrey can do kiara said hugging her legs it was a comforting action that also warmed her up slightly even though it was one armed she missed having two arms functioning draco drew up a chair and sat next to her waiting for an explanation he was curious so this has happened before no i ve never been this cold i dontwant a lot of people to know but since i am going to be in your house and you are a prefect i might as well tell you draco nodded and said he wouldnttell anyone else unless absolutely necessary kiara didntbelieve him for a minute but right now she needed him to take that false look of concern off his face it didntbelong on the face of a death eater son i have a condition which makes it so that my temperature is never regular this is one of my bad cases but it unusual for my temperature to be normal it usually a lot higher than normal sometimes it too high and sometimes it too low like now you re saying that your temperature is nothing to worry about i wouldntsay nothing to worry but it not a reason to go trouble madam pomfrey about especially not right now when there are so many people in the hospital wing she ll probably tell me to wrap up warm and send me on my way strange even so you are not walking out of here until you look normal people will think you re about to croak and they wontbe as lenient as me i bet a gryffindor would have forced you down to the hospital wing lucky saint potter didntsee you what makes you say he didn t a catch of having my own room is that i have to share the common room with potter who also been assigned his own room this year he isnttoo bad just overly concerned like a certain blonde haired slytherin i not concerned i just dontwant people thinking that slytherin dontcare about each other sure we re more likely to have civil wars but we still look out for each other he smiled and took his cloak that had been hanging on the back of the chair and wrapped it around kiara speeding up the process here at the rate your thawing it ll take all day i didntask for this remember i was going to go ask millicent or someone where the owlery is so i could dictate a letter and have it sent of by today you are the one insisting that i thaw in front of the fire no use arguing miss snape a prefect always knows best he said tapping the silver badge pinned to his robes i ll keep you company unless you insist on talking about a holiday to france and what dress you wore to a golf club event i still dontunderstand why our parents are hooked onto a muggle sport and insist we come along i more interested in how potter isnttoo bad all i meant is that he isntas perfect as people make him out to be and he doesntact a hero all the time if he did i hardly think he would have survived yesterday i see your point wait you re not softening to him are you kiara blushed hoping it had the desired effect draco laughed loudly and stared at kiara in wonder snape daughter is softening to potter you have to be kidding me he was civil enough on the train i suppose it was because i was bleeding but he did talk to me for awhile that was before he found out who i was she shrugged and pulled the cloak tighter around her she could feel herself warming up at least for a second i wished i wasntprofessor snape daughter but then i realised i was hardly going to be in gryffindor and told him so it would be nice to be known as kiara though and it would be nice to be known as draco and not a death eater son but that the world for you cantchange it cantbeat it although many do try and fail miserably the afternoon was passed with general chatter kiara being occasionally introduced to other people she should know and talk to including the head boy lunch arrived and he insisted someone bring up sandwiches when draco was satisfied with kiara temperature although still low she had at least regained normal colouring in her skin they went to the library where draco looked for his books and kiara just browsed what they had to offer the restricted section was not yet open to 6th years and wouldntbe until halfway through term and kiara saw that she had covered a large number of books that werentin the restricted section draco was annoyed that hermione had gotten the books before him but shrugged it off as much as possible and showed kiara the owlery dinner came quickly enough and she ate as fast as she could despite only having the use of her left hand severus didntseem to have bothered showing up to dinner so that must mean that he had given her control of how much time they spent together saying she had letters to write she quickly left the great hall and made her way down to the dungeons hoping she would remember where his quarters were that was the only place she really knew in the dungeons and sure enough she came to a portrait of salazar slytherin good evening salazar kiara said politely causing the man to stir from his chair where he had been sleeping peacefully he grumbled and fixed kiara with a hateful glare that didntreally stir kiara there wasntmuch a painting could do a coat of armour would be one thing you wouldntwant to annoy but not a painting you re back i thought you might have perhaps come to your senses two snape at hogwarts just my luck i guess he better than some of the potions professors that have been hired thought i d never see the day when that old coot went only to have him replaced by the young selfish coot that is your father salazar lectured her grumpily kiara listened patiently knowing that she didntknow the password and would have to be nice to be let in now what do you want the great salazar slytherin knows what a humble potions master daughter needs i would not dare to question your knowledge by telling you because i know that you know you humour me child he swung open and kiara walked through the passage way that connected to the living room two mugs of hot chocolate were sitting steaming on the coffee table with severus hidden behind a newspaper on the sofa he had got a haircut after letting it grow long for the couple of weeks and wore dark jeans a black shirt and a black sweater topped off with his fluffy black slippers he put the newspaper down and smiled evening kiara make yourself comfortable severus said patting the seat next to his she settled down and leaning on his shoulder evening dad tell me was it really necessary for you to send me an owl kiara asked just out of curiosity it hadntreally bothered her at least it had been the only positive mail she had got that morning the last letter was folded up neatly into the pocket of her robe where nobody could accidentally stumble upon it no i dontthink you noticed i wasntthere for either breakfast lunch or dinner i was having a day to myself and therefore couldntbe asked to leave the comfort of my quarters do you mind no not at all i was curious she wondered whether to tell him about the letter she didnthave to say anything all she had to was reach in her pocket and give it to him he would know what to do wouldnthe do you think i going to be in slytherin need you really ask me that question kiara stared at severus waiting for an answer clearly she did need to ask the question well you ve already made friends there and there no way salazar would let in a gryffindor to my quarters without a password of some kind so yes i do think so i was just wondering just to make sure i wasntmaking friends with the wrong people there was a pregnant pause where severus wondered what to say and kiara thought over what she should say should she say anything about the letter should she drop really heavy hints or should she just leave it she frowned and sighed in frustration could this be any harder is there anything on your mind yes there is actually i ve got a question for you if there was something troubling you something that made you ill to think about more than anything else would you tell someone you can trust say like dumbledore i donttrust dumbledore kiara punched him playfully willing him to answer quickly she really wanted to tell him but she was wary he laughed and put a serious thinking face on if it made me ill then yes i would tell someone even if it was only for the sake of telling someone i would want to sleep easily at night without the help of potions what if whatever you told them could affect the way they looked at you their opinion of you kiara if there is something you need to tell me you can trust me that what i here for otherwise there wouldntbe any point of me being your father there was the invitation all kiara had to do was accept it it not that i donttrust you it just kiara what is it taking a deep breath she handed the letter to severus she watched his eyes darken as he read and re read the letter he tapped it with his wand several times and every time it quivered and then went back to normal he read it several more times and kiara was sure he had memorised the letter she bit her lip waiting for severus response but it was awhile before one came who it from he asked his dark eyes sharp as they fixed themselves on kiara needing an answer i i dontknow she stammered unnerved by his cold voice that sent shivers down her spine who is it from i dontknow kiara you have to tell me who it from i telling you i dontknow he stood up and kiara watched him pace back and forth opening his mouth to say something but deciding against it severus ran a hand through his hair and sighed i canthelp you if i dontknow who it from or who he is then donthelp me i just thought you might like to know that someone is after me and knows where i am for christ sake kiara we both know that you know who sent that letter you just dontwant to tell me what is it fear are you scared that if you tell me we re all going to die that is what might happen if you donttell me who the fuck sent this letter he slammed the letter than on the coffee table causing the mugs to hold on for dear life kiara flinched she hated seeing him this way she could stand cold and withdrawn severus but angry severus just scared her that why she tried to avoid getting him angry unless it was impossible to do so she stared at him but didntanswer severus was getting angry and usually when people were angry at her she ended up hurt one way or another her silence angered him more say something kiara give me a clue anything what do they mean they know where you are now didntthey know before did severus stopped mid sentence and looked at kiara maybe the person that had sent that letter had no that couldntbe kiara would have said something but she wasntsaying much she looked up and severus saw fear in her eyes more than anything taking a moment to calm he sat down next to her she waited for him to continue shouting but when it didntcome she relaxed did they do that to your arm i dontknow these are harry injuries severus frowned in confusion no dark spells can injure harry whilst i alive or both of us are wearing the rings all his injuries go from him and are transferred to me in a way harry got two lives even if he was killed once he wouldntdie i would it was an attempt to change the subject but severus decided they would talk about this another time now was the time to talk about that letter was whoever sent this letter there he killed bill nought he was going to kill me and then bill saved me kiara felt the guilt increase bill had saved her and died it was her fault did he hurt you not really kiara what will it take for you to tell me who it is nothing because i can t i ve said enough and enough is enough that was the most severus was going to get out of kiara for the moment a n not one of my best chapters oh well all that matters is that it here not sure whether i ll get one up tomorrow but i shall try and for those wh are reading and hopefully reviewing thanks a few more reviews would be deeply appreciated but not necessary well next chapter it s err the sorting and err first lessons i believe again thanks for reading being slytherin patting invisible stray hair down kiara stood nervously behind the great hall doors waiting for them to open so that she could be finally sorted luckily she wasntthe only older student being sorted the boy they had seen in ollivander that summer was going to be in sixth year as well he too seemed nervous for he kept shuffling his feet and running a hand through his straw blonde hair which was in need of a haircut finally the door opened the boy followed by kiara walked up to mcgonagall and the sorting hat sixth year jameson howard mcgonagall called out the boy dragged his feet to the three legged stool and sat down mcgonagall lowering the hat onto his head there was a pause and kiara could have sworn she heard voices gryffindor the hat cried and gryffindor burst into applause and cheers the boy was welcomed with large pats on the back and squashed onto the already packed table it seemed gryffindor had received the most students that year sixth year snape kiara kiara walked up to the three legged stool as confidently as she could she saw severus nod in encouragement and that was probably the only way she managed to not faint from the nervousness she was feeling sitting down she felt the large ragged hat lowered onto her head a snape indeed yes a snape best place to put you would be slytherin i suppose although the sorting hat said or more thought because kiara didntthink everyone else could hear the sorting hat please no although i just want to get this sorting over and done with just put me in slytherin kiara thought back clutching the stool tightly she hoped no one noticed this she was scared the sorting might not go her way your mother was a gryffindor you know i could put you there no you couldn t i never knew my mother there wouldntbe a point in me being in gryffindor slytherin is the place for me dontyou want to even know who your mother was kiara took a sharp breath and thoughts raced around her mind did she really want to know all these years she had been blamed for the death of this woman did she really want to know who she was she was a gryffindor who didntcare about the name of the house she made friends with others even those in slytherin i can do the same if that is the only reason you wish to place me in gryffindor i can make friends with gryffindors just put me in slytherin well if you re sure i am then it ll have to be slytherin there was polite applause mingled with whispers from the other houses whilst slytherin cheered and applauded almost as loudly as gryffindor had done kiara walked towards the slytherin table with a smirk on her face she had been worrying for nothing severus wasnteven bothering to cover up a thesmallbut visiblesmile on his face he had already scared several students by replacing his billowing black robes with more practical and less intimidating navy blue robes and with his haircut but the whole smiling thing was scarier with the sorting out of the way another feast is in order to have you filled up for tomorrow when minds will be educated with the odd detention here and there dumbledore smiled the sparkle clearly visible in his blue eyes with a wave of his hand food appeared on the gold plates enjoy what other house did the sorting hat want to put you in blaise asked as he handed kiara the potatoes she had just asked for kiara looked at him confused unless the sorting hat immediately says your house there always another possibility what was yours mine was ravenclaw oh that happened to me as well i almost screamed when that hat wanted to put me in hufflepuff can you believe it pansy cried somebody murmured that they could see her in hufflepuff which caused the table to erupt in laughter she blushed a nasty shade of pink and concentrated on her food gryffindor kiara replied as if it was nothing blaise looked happy at that for some reason but he nodded sympathetically as if it meant she wasnta pure slytherin because the hat had suggested she go in gryffindor it was a bit obvious i belonged in slytherin though that hat must enjoy messing with people minds depends on your parents really the day a mudblood finds their way into slytherin is the day i ask granger on a date blaise added casting a glare in the direction of the gryffindor table which will also be the day the world comes to an end you are negative blaise both my parents were of course slytherins that why it didnteven take seconds for the hat to decide my house draco said slightly on the boastful side i heard the other possibility usually means the other parent your mother wasnta gryffindor was she i never knew my mother and father doesnttalk about her at all there was an uncomfortable silence she wasntabout to reveal that she was part gryffindor that was the last thing she needed what do you suppose defence against the dark arts will be like better than last year i suppose umbridge was good when it came to power but was a rubbish teacher it a wonder i got an o really mother was pleased of course the teacher seems like a gryffindor though draco grimaced at the thought of being taught by yet another gryffindor i dontsee why the old fool wontlet snape teach it though must be scared he ll teach us something dark the conversation went to dark arts and soon there was a debate whether dark arts should be taught in slytherin clearly everyone had forgotten about the sorting and she was glad she kept out of the debate only given an opinion when asked frankly she didntreally care as long as there wasntan exam on it she looked over at the gryffindor table and her gaze met harry s for a minute they seemed to come to a silent understanding about something before they were both pulled back to whatever conversation that was occurring on their table do not lose these timetables if you do i will not be making new ones and you ll just have to try and figure out what classes you re going to severus said as he handed each individual on the slytherin table that morning a lesson timetable that means crabbe goyle that following mr malfoy around will not work as you have different lessons the two boys looked stumped and accepted their timetables oddly aware of the fact that their free periods seemed to outweigh their actual lessons those who had passed the subjects they had chosen were just given a timetable whilst others simply had to alter their choices a little kiara glanced at the timetable she had been given and groaned at the number of subjects she had been given there was no way she was going to cope with history of magic astronomy and arithmancy at a newt level on top of charms defence against the dark arts transfiguration herbology and potions and in any case she didnthave books for those with her anything wrong with your timetable severus asked peering over her shoulder to have a look he had done it personally choosing subjects he thought would get kiara far she obviously didntseem to think so not by the frown on her face professor would it be possible to lower the number of subjects perhaps dropping history of magic astronomy and arithmancy kiara asked aware that some people had looked up from their timetables to see what severus reaction would be he almost never changed them unless they had failed or really couldn t and that was rare you may drop history of magic and astronomy for you only scraped an e for those kiara nodded gratefully and accepted her altered timetable more happily more free periods seemed to have appeared so she thanked him for his consideration dontthank me now thank me when you get your newt s he walked away to go and talk to another student about their failed owl and the rearrangement of their timetable did you pass all your owl s draco asked as he compared his timetable with hers the only lessons that were different were her arithmancy and his astronomy which surprised kiara he didntseem to be one for astronomy kiara nodded noting that their first lesson was double defence against the dark arts imagine if you had failed potions what would he have been like he would have probably demanded a retake or disowned me if that failed kiara joked she didnteven want to think of his reaction when if she had decided she didntwant to take potions she would have never heard the end of it all heads of houses were obliged to do this and professor mcgonagall at least had fewer timetable changes that professor snape s it was no secret that slytherin only had the brain power to be ingeniously cunning but when it came to anything academic they were at the bottom hermione was pleased with her subjects and ron and harry were only complaining about one thing why did he lower his acceptance level kiara got an o so it has nothing to do with her taking potions ron complained waving his timetable about as if that would make the boxes marked with potions snape disappear i bet it was to get more of his house in there wouldntsurprise me harry scoffed looking at his timetable it wasnttoo bad the free periods certainly cheered him up actually mr weasley professor snape lowered his acceptance level so that more people would have a chance of taking his class mcgonagall cut in unknowingly saving hermione from having to hear different theories all day on what was going through severus mind i would like to say he did it voluntarily but it was a unanimous decision which he tried to argue of course if i didntneed it to become an auror i wouldnttake it not if it means that i have to spend two more years with that git harry grumbled it might be better this year you never know and arentyou forgetting kiara will probably be in our classes he bound to soften up hermione said confidently she had watched the way severus acted around kiara and she had found he acted like a human at those times she was absolutely sure he was going to soften severus had already began to soften to harry being friends with kiara during the holidays and it wouldntbe different here at school she just hoped he would look past the house differences let hope so he drained his coffee he had stayed up for a long time watching kiara sleep so easily and he was tired if only she would let them go back to how it was before defence against the dark arts first let hope rominisci is all that he looks if he teaches as good as he looks there wontbe a problem hermione said having her rare girly moments ron muttered something under his breath remembering lockhart in second year yet this time the entire female student body had been taken in by the young handsome man who dressed in muggle clothes and talked happily to hagrid who didntlook too bright today right for those who dontremember my name i professor damien rominisci i ve applied for you to call me damien but it seems professor mcgonagall is taking her time with that request so for now just call me professor rominisci said as he walked over to his desk unsurprisingly most of the girls with the exception of an unimpressed kiara had taken front seats and were hanging of his every word whilst the boys scoffed they didntlike older and smarter competition who can name the last five teachers you have had and in chronological order saying how well they taught the girls hands shot up whilst very few guys even bothered in a way it was funny but also very sad rominisci bit his lip and walked around seeing who he could chose or who name he actually remembered there were only two he was certain of their name but only one had been at hogwarts for five years perhaps you mr potter could tell me i have received very high praise for you along with others first there was professor quirell who seemed mostly scared of anything to do with the dark arts then there was professor lockhart who taught us from his books that didntseem really reliable third year we had professor lupin who taught us really well and so did professor moody the following year umbridge was the worst though harry said grimacing slightly as he remembered last year and how they had been made to read from their textbooks for hours on end she was useless making us read from textbooks and not letting us do anything practical so it hasntbeen smooth sailing i hope i can beat the curse and last to see you through to your newt exams but we ll have to see i ll just take the register to make sure i have everyone and try to remember names then i ll do a little shifting there were murmurs as he sat down behind his desks what kind of shifting was he talking about the people you see in this classroom are going to be your classmates for two years i hate all this house rubbish so i going to mix you all up rominisci didntallow for the murmurs to begin again as he immediately began taking the register pausing here and there to make small comments harry half expected him to make a fuss over his name but he didn t perhaps this teacher was alright when he was done he began walking around the room checking robes and moving them around accordingly snape up here in between potter and macmillan and dontscowl like that he said standing by the empty seat and watching as kiara picked up her bag and moved the scowl on her face seemingly genuine after all only harry knew this was pretend as she sat down she heard him mutter the wind might change and you ll end up looking like your father but before she could say anything he had moved on he managed to mix them up so that by the time he had finished some people wanted umbridge back anything was better than being where they were hermione had managed to be seated next to draco who didntlook to happy about being wedged between hermione and a ravenclaw who was known for making snide comments at errors and people handwriting with that done we can get down to some work perhaps some jinxes that produce amusing results and a shield charms yes that ll do does anyone have a suggestion for a jinx jelly legs jinx it funny to see people try and walk seamus finnegan said casting a glance at dean who he enjoyed practising the jinx on rominisci wrote this down and continued to take suggestions then went about pairing the class and gave them until five minutes before the end of the lesson where there would be feedback what are we going to do with you cantwrite cantperform a spell rominisci said to kiara who suddenly wished her arm wasntin a sling she said nothing but glared at him instead she had a feeling about him it was as if she knew him but didn t i dontsee the point of you being here nor do i but since i have to be here and you have to teach me figure something out kiara replied sharply she had done nothing to the man except happen to have an injury maybe i could read up on the shield charm and some of the jinxes that wonttake a double lesson even if you read at snail pace the homework was to find spells other than the unforgivables that will penetrate a shield charm no matter how strong it is but i pretty sure you re capable of doing that of the top of you re head and what that supposed to mean it means miss snape that the dark arts are probably nothing new to you i bet you would rather be studying the dark arts than defence against them but what else could be expected with a father like yours please refrain from insulting my father professor or what are you going to run to daddy and tell her that professor rominisci is being mean in this classroom your name is just a name i dontcare that your father is the evil potions master i wouldntlike to meet him on a dark night though he scary looking enough during the day he laughed dryly but kiara didntfind it very amusing that wasntfunny obviously your looks obstruct vital necessities like a sense of humour for once and perhaps a brain ouch the similarity is the same right up to the sharp tongue i suppose you have a dark mark on your arm as well then perhaps as a family outing you go and pay homage to you know who or go kill a few people wouldntsurprise me if you did insult him and the snape name one more time and i will not be responsible for my actions therefore set me the work and go away empty threats does that run in the family too your father did that the students looked up from what they were doing as they heard something crash into the wall kiara was on her feet wand pointed and a slightgroan could be heard from the floor where the crash had occurred it took a few moments for people to realise that kiara had just sent professor rominisci flying he stood up grimacing slightly and wiped dust off his clothes not as empty as you thought are they kiara sneered although inside her heart was trying to beat its way out of her chest had she really just done that there was definetely something wrong with her reactions before she would have never ever dared attack a teacher now detention snape at 6 pack up your stuff and go to your head of house you can go explain to professor snape why you attacked a teacher rominisci said casually as if this what he was expecting anyway kiara put away her wand and stuffed her books into her bag as he wrote out a note before she could get it from him he added perhaps you should learn some self control as well only when you learn to control your mouth kiara snapped back snatching it off of him she could feel eyes follow her as she walked out of the classroom as arrogantly as she could slamming the door she hoped severus would believe her side of the story walking down to the dungeons kiara hoped that severus wasntteaching so it would be less embarrassing she cursed under her breath as she peered in the classroom through the half open door and saw severus mid flow of some sort of lecture to what seemed like first or second years putting on a what she hoped was a wrongly accused face kiara knocked on the door severus appeared not every happy to be disturbed half way through a intimidating lecture why arentyou in lessons severus asked he was sure he had read that she had defence against the dark arts first lesson she didntsay anything but handed him the note she had tried to open but instead got a shock up her arm he read it and frowned you attacked him miss snape attacked me she had the nerve to do so after arguing with me and insulting my teaching methods because i simply suggested she worked from the textbook that a lie i did not argue with him kiara said she hadntmeant to send him flying but how did he expect her to react after he had just been insulting severus but you attacked him yes but sit at the back of the classroom and do whatever work he was trying to get you to do i ll deal with you later but do you want dumbledore to deal with this kiara scowled didntthink so kiara grumbled something and stomped into the classroom slamming her textbook down as hard as she could manage severus shut the door and continued his speech though it seemed he had lost the feeling he tapped the blackboard with his wand and ingredients showed up there was the usual scraping of chairs and chopping of ingredients soon the classroom was filled with smoke and kiara watched with interest the boy closest to her as he went through the steps of making the potion she had nothing better to do psst hello kiara said to the boy as the content of his cauldron began to bubble dangerously he turned and looked at her his eyes open with fear kiara made sure severus was distracted with the telling off of a hufflepuff girl at the front turn the heat down stir ant clockwise five times and then add your next ingredient um thanks he followed her instructions though he wasntsure they would work as the potion calmed he relaxed and smiled at kiara before continuing kiara smiled with satisfaction helping others made her feel better it sure beat reading over notes she had read millions of times before the end of the lesson came and a total of five potions had blown up but all thankfully nowhere near kiara she had helped those around her as much as she could hoping severus wouldntcatch on for a moment he had lingered a fraction too long in front of the potion of the boy sitting in front of kiara but he had moved without a word slinging her bag over her left shoulder she walked to the front of the class where severus was sitting behind his desk rereading the note you have a detention at 6 o clock tonight and he wonthesitate sending you out of class and giving detentions unless you re attitude improves your first lesson and you attack a teacher enlighten me what were you thinking when attacked him severus asked looking up from the note he wasntangry but disappointed kiara felt a pang of guilt before remembering why she had done it he was insulting you kiara said simply he carried on even when i asked him to stop he just carried on and then i lost my temper why would he insult me kiara shrugged because she had no idea herself what did he say it not what he said it just the way he was referring to you being a death eater and saying that it would probably run in the family it just got to me severus sighed and rubbed his eyes he hadntslept all that well last night you ve got to understand kiara that i not a lot of people favourite person people are going to say stuff about me and you cantgo around attacking everyone who does so why they shouldntsay it in the first place i ll have a word with professor rominisci and try to get the truth out of him go to whatever lesson you have now and try to stay out of trouble kiara went to say something but he held up her hand to silence him please fine and in future let my students learn by themselves there wontalways be snape daughter there to help them kiara smiled to herself as she made her way to the slytherin common room she had a free period before break and she could read up on what she had supposed to read up on how was the lesson kiara asked draco blaise and pansy who were sat around a desk getting on with what looked like an essay of some sort joining them blaise merely shook his head and smiled amused by his own thoughts better than expected after you went potter spent the whole lesson asking what had caused you to attack rominisci in the end the guy got so fed up he put potter in detention draco explained pleased by the fact that harry was also in detention what did snape say kiara shrugged he wasntpleased why did you do it anyway one minute you re talking to him then next bang he made a motion with his wand he on the floor no one insults the snape name and gets away with it and dontcall me sensitive if it had been you you d have probably punched him it in your blood to defend your family all slytherins will do so i d be worried if you didn t blaise said not even bothering to look up from his copy of advanced ancient runes better watch it though carry on like that and he ll be dead by christmas draco added cautiously is that a bad thing a lot of you wish that you werenthere i personally dontwant to be here but we have to be if any of you are having any doubts i would leave right now severus said walking around he opened the door and looked around the classroom no well then welcome to newt level potions i here to try and get you up to a standard where the exams at the end of your seventh year will be a walk in the park since the class is considerably smaller than usual my hatred for you all will be considerably less than usual these next two years are very important and my wish is to get you through them and out of my life he gave them a moment for his little speech to digest he was being very kind and he wasntsure whether it was the fact that kiara was sitting at the back of his class in between draco and blaise or whether he genuinely cared that they passed their newt s two hufflepuff had made it susan bones and ernie macmillan several ravenclaw a few gryffindors and only three slytherins he didntknow whether he was disappointed or what but he had not wished to have more gryffindors than slytherins opening your copy of advanced potions i am giving you the choice to make any of the potions in this book since it is the first lesson the potion will not be marked on its difficulty he stopped to cast a glance at hermione but on how well it has been made you may decide to make a simple sleeping potion but if that potion does nothing but make the drinker yawn you will fail this assignment any questions before we start is this part of our coursework hermione asked severus rolled his eyes she would be the one to ask that even if it was a fairly reasonable question luckily it isn t this will be used to predict your ability if you fail i will reconsider you having you in my class or i will arrange for some tutoring if you pass with flying colours i will make sure that you keep working at that standard there nothing i hate worse than one hit wonders who think that one success in their life is enough for them to ride on his gaze lingered over harry before going to his desk and settling himself comfortably behind it you have one hour and a half you may begin there was an immediate scrape of chairs and cauldrons and a scramble to get ingredients there was little and almost no chatter for everyone was concentrating hard on their potion they didntwant to fail but nor did they want to be one hit wonders harry looked for a potion that required the least attention ron chose one he had mastered a bit last year whilst hermione randomly opened a page and began working she had read through the book several times by now and knew over half the potions by heart fifteen times anti clockwise five times clockwise two times anti clockwise four times clockwise and let it simmer until it turns clear kiara muttered to herself as she remembered the instructions for her potion it was a potion that caused the drinker to hallucinate and although the ingredients required no cutting the process was long and intricate watch this draco whispered nudging kiara he rolled up one of his ingredients into a little ball and aimed it at harry who was sat in front of them next to hermione and ron kiara buried her head in her book as harry jumped slightly wiping whatever it was off his neck he looked around for a moment before going back to work you try i a rubbish thrower ask blaise kiara replied knowing that if she tried she could probably hit harry but just didntwant to severus was busy scribbling something onto a bit parchment and hadntlooked up in ages but she didntwant to get on his bad side as well he cantthrow to save his life i pretty sure you can do it no thanks i d rather not you re the one missing out on all the fun he flicked something else at harry and this time he immediately turned around and glared at their table got a problem potter harry shrugged and went back to his potion draco continued with great satisfaction watching harry shudder as he managed to get an ingredient down his neck kiara tried to ignore it and continued to follow the intricate instructions ten half stirs clockwise five full anti clockwise two drops of water seven stirs anti clockwise and let to simmer that all she was thinking looking up she saw harry turn around again looking as if he had had enough enough to punch draco dontyou think that enough draco kiara whispered noting that severus was still engrossed in whatever he was doing and blaise didntseem to particularly care kiara doubted he cared about anything but himself are you sticking up for him draco asked looking from her to harry he saw her determined face and scowled but didntthrow any more excess ingredients kiara didntanswer but went back to reading the instructions they seemed endless moments later draco asked again you were werentyou let it drop draco her potion was almost finished but she made it out like she was concentrating draco was no fool no matter what people thought you have that same look pansy gets you did stick up for potter he laughed in disbelief but quietly so he wouldntbe heard kiara still didntsay anything but muttered instructions to herself if she carried on this way she would know it off by heart dontignore me kiara what is it you want me to say i just dontget all this house prejudice stuff i get enough of it at home thank you very much if you spoke to potter once in a while you might realise he no different to us i d rather eat dragon droppings he cantbe that bad you are treading where you shouldntkiara unless you will one day be able to convince me that the boy who got my father put in azkaban is worthy of a slytherin attention you will have difficulty getting approval from anyone in slytherin kiara said no more on the matter she would have to step carefully around draco in only three days he had picked up on her hints that no one else except perhaps blaise but he kept to himself had picked up there was going to be a long time before she and harry could openly be friends if this was draco attitude a long time indeed according to her watch it was now ten past six and she was still standing outside rominisci classroom waiting for him to arrive she would give it until half past and then she would leave she had three pieces of homework to complete and she couldntmake sense of an of her arithmancy questions as she looked at her watch again she heard someone running along the corridor and turning her head she saw it was harry dressed in a navy blue hooded top with matching tracksuit bottoms and scuffed trainers there was no need to run harry he not even here yet kiara said as harry lent on a wall trying to catch his breath kiara wondered where rominisci could be to forget a detention probably exfoliating his face he an idiot harry said after he had regained his breath and was no longer panting kiara smiled to see someone agreed with her but he was a boy and most of the boys in the school hated rominisci but kiara seemed to be the only girl who did tell me about it kiara took another more careful look at harry and wondered why harry was dressed like that where were you training i was made quidditch captain and i really out of shape and they wontlet me train any later than six i just want to be in good shape for the try outs to set an example why exactly did you get detention draco mentioned something about you bugging rominisci malfoy would say that wouldnthe i just asked a few times why he thought you d done what you did and he got angry at me and gave me a detention that i wasntbothered about really harry shrugged his shoulders to emphasise the fact that he wasntbothered about being here but then he kept me behind and said that if i really wanted to find out i should come to detention even though it was obvious with you being a slytherin and everything but if i apologised for being nosy i d get let off instead i walked off professor rominisci has issues that is all i saying arentyou even going to tell me why you did it then what would be the purpose of you serving this detention kiara answered cheekily harry attempted a few more times to tease it out of kiara and it wasntuntil half past six rominisci came and opened the classroom door kiara and harry had missed dinner unnecessarily and when harry grumbled this under his breath rominisci simply said that if they were going to waste his time he would waste theirs miss snape mr potter and i are waiting and the clock is ticking rominisci said to kiara after she and harry had been sitting in the quiet classroom listening to the ticking of a grandfather clock in the corner of the classroom they hadntnoticed earlier waiting for what kiara asked although she had an inkling both of us are waiting for an explanation for your actions this morning and i am waiting for a full apology i have nothing to explain and nothing to apologise about kiara glared at rominisci and waited for his response she expected it to be an insult but remembered that harry was with her if he did insult her there would be an eyewitness then you and potter if he does not apologise will be coming every day for detention until you do explain and apologise your choice miss snape kiara considered her options put harry through all that and probably get an earful from severus or just explain and force an apology tick tock tick tock we are waiting miss snape the reason why i sent you flying professor was because you were insulting my family i asked you to stop and you didn t so it was you that provoked me into lashing out and i had done nothing previously to provoke you to start the attack on my family nobody likes a liar snape why dontyou try again but with the truth this time that was the truth rominisci narrowed his eyes and kiara knew that he would in no way shape or for agree to kiara version of the story feeling harry hand over hers under the table she remembered that it was either lying or spending the rest of the year coming back she felt sure that for her it wasntthe last detention but it had to be for harry you dontbelieve that do you potter harry shook his head compliantly so why did you really attack me miss snape i was angry because i could do not join in with the others and when you tried to set me some work from the textbook i argued with you i got so angry i just lashed out i was entirely in the wrong kiara said through clenched teeth that was as far from the truth as one could get it was an unprovoked and unjust attack i am sorry and i wontlet it happen again you d better not and mr potter next time please ask the person in question and dontwaste my time in lesson asking me for an explanation because i dontknow how people minds work he pointed to the door there the door use it they left gladly beginning to talk about how much they hated the man already right up until they reached the entrance hall it was nice to talk to harry after two days of talking about how much slytherin was better than the rest of the school and the like with a pang kiara realised she missed him but until her arm was somewhat healed it wasntlikely she would let him sleep with her i m err going to the gryffindor common room harry said slightly obviously this is where they went their separate ways harry to gryffindor kiara to slytherin separate houses and yet they were good friends perhaps something more you do that see you later then kiara replied aware that this was an awkward moment and we should probably not be seen together draco doesntlike you very much and i need his approval before anything can happen i can wait there no rush is there especially since we re not sleeping together anymore harry i ve got to go a n thought it was about time i gave y all another chapter it was nine pages on word i am really irregular when it comes to updating reviews do prompt me though thanks to all those who reviewed and those who are reading the story i quite random with this story i keep changing my mind about a lot of things it will come to a conclusion at some point i swear expect more twistedfluff i changing from angst romance to drama romance it not very angsty well until next time girl trouble that week didntimprove much for kiara for starters all of her subjects required the use of both of her hands and this meant she was often stuck reading or making sloppy notes with her left hand professor sprout put her in charge of making sure all her equipment came back most of the teachers were considerate but by the end of the week everyone knew that there was some kind of a feud going on between kiara and professor rominisci at least once a lesson she found herself on the wrong side of the classroom door cursing under her breath severus was not very happy about this he had tried to guilt her into not answering back to one of rominisci taunts by giving her a long speech of how she had been such a sweet girl when he had taken her in but it had done nothing to help kiara harry wasntspeaking to her much either they exchanged formalities in the common room but nothing more he seemed to be waiting for an invitation before he came close again kiara was relieved she didnthave to keep saying no but the taste of the sleeping potion was beginning to get to her she saw harry everywhere and every time she knew draco was watching her closely blaise had taken to watching her closely all the time and it unnerved kiara because she had no idea why draco hadntdistanced himself from her as she had feared he would but instead spent most of his time talking to her kiara enjoyed his company but couldnthelp feeling it was only because she was severus daughter so by the time she was sitting in the hospital wing on sunday waiting to get her bandages changed she was despondent she didnthave to come to madam pomfrey because severus could have done it but after their argument on friday about being sent to him again she had been coming to madam pomfrey the hospital wing wasntpacked as it had been on tuesday but madam pomfrey had so much paperwork to do now madam pomfrey kiara asked as the woman was checking her temperature just for safety measures yes dear is there any way that i could be able to use my arm again madam pomfrey frowned she had known that she might ask her that but she wouldnthave expected differently yes but it means the scars it will leave on your arm will never heal and it will be painful too how long will it take a few hours if you took the potion now you ll be out of the infirmary by dinner kiara smiled suddenly feeling like she could hug this woman who was constantly prodding a thermometer in her mouth but you have to be sure the scars will never heal please madam pomfrey i cantbear to sit through another lesson of doing nothing and i cantbear to be apart from harry any more she thought although obviously didntsay it well alright then and dontsay didntwarn you about the pain being able to use a knife and fork again was great and kiara ate happily not concerned about puking up or anything even if her arm still ached from the potion she listened to pansy happily not really caring that there was no way to get a word in edgeways she didntcare about the fact pink satin dress robes made pansy look fat or that her cousin who lived in ireland owned several horses and made money by ripping of hapless muggles all she cared about was getting through dinner and the few hours she spent in the slytherin common room doing homework once or twice during pansy monologue kiara kept glancing over to the gryffindor table and watching harry gulf down food like that would be his last meal even as she tested draco on his star mapping her mind wondered to harry and tried to remember times before the magic bonding his touch his warmth of his body the feel his bare chest as she woke up early in the morning to find herself nuzzled next to him and his arm wrapped around her protectively pulling her close her arm had been the only excuse to not let harry close and now it was gone he was all she could think about you are meant to be helping me not day dreaming draco snapped bringing kiara back to earth she blushed and mumbled an apology if you were daydreaming about what i think you were daydreaming save me from the nightmares it cantbe helped not when we share a bathroom as well seeing him in nothing but a towel doesnthelp kiara answered only to have to dodge a cushion being thrown at her draco looked genuinely horrified at the thought i said save me from the nightmares not induce several nightmares kiara giggled as draco shuddered it was a private joke they had established but he was still not approving of the idea tell me again what the hell you see in potter i dontunderstand it he physically attractive and he a good person when we ve been forced to have a conversation he been very nice and hasntacted anything like the jerk you make him out to be draco snorted in disbelief i bet he slipped you a love potion that why you like him i ll bet you anything that it a bet whoever can seduce snape daughter gets 50 galleons i wouldntput it past him as if you wouldntdo that kiara said huffily you re like him in a way good looking could have any girl you wanted and people willing to see me humiliated how do i know you haventgot a bet going on you don t besides if emphasis on the if i did approve of it how do you know potter likes you back i just do draco please say yes it going to cause a lot of upset slytherins and the last thing i need is my house to hate me if you approve most people will too only if you say draco is a gorgeous sex god and the only reason why i not totally besotted with him is because potter slipped me a love potion otherwise i would realise potter is hopelessly pathetic and doesnteven deserve my affection to everyone in defence against the dark arts tomorrow kiara almost choked no chance rominisci would never let me live it down well then you ll just have to find another way of persuading me i ll tell pansy you love her kiara teased looking over at pansy who was sitting with several other girls congregating over several magazines from young witch weekly to dress robes delight to hair happiness today and i ll tell blaise you think he hot draco answered back glancing at his friend who was sitting in a corner trying to figure out what the runes he had spread out in front of him meant he and kiara had yet to click there were times it seemed like they were close to a normal conversation and he would clam up again there no winning is there a malfoy never gives up without a fight harry kiara said timidly as she pushed open the door of his room he was sitting on his bed in nothing but his boxers flipping through what looked like a photo album a smile on his face his room was definitely different to hers his was gryffindor colours with pale yellow walls and red curtains and carpet but to kiara delight her drawing had been put up on one of the walls to add a personal touch harry put the album away and watched as kiara crossed the room to his bed her pyjamas hanging of her small frame she had a smile on her face and harry hoped she stayed that way there a scary spider in my room she said although she was smiling and didntlook she d just been scared away by a spider and i was just wondering if i could sleep with you tonight i dontknow it doesntseem like you re scared of the spider harry said trying to be serious but a smile was beginning to creep onto his face i could scare it away and you could go back to your room safely i didntfool you for one second did i if you d said your room cold and you wanted to snuggle up to me i might have believed it but i know for a fact you are not scared of spiders what would it take to worm into your bed mr potter the truth it been a week since we ve slept in the same bed because you didntwant to and now you want to why i miss you harry a lot actually just because a potion stops the nightmares doesntmean i dontmiss waking up next to you but why did you not want me to sleep with you in the first place it would have been difficult with my arm and i was upset and scared the first night i thought that with bill death and stuff even you wouldntbe able to stop me from having violent dreams but now i dontcare just as long as i have you to wake me up it doesntmatter alright only on one condition what i get a goodnight kiss each night before i go to sleep you might decide to go out with malfoy and i still want a goodnight kiss deal deal they shook hands and kiara placed a small kiss on his cheek before they got into bed it was no different than before with harry holding her protectively whilst kiara made herself comfortable but for some reason it was kiara was oddly aware of harry toned chest on her back and his breath tickling her neck whilst harry was aware that his hand lay millimetres away from her breasts and of the position of her bottom these thoughts had not crossed their minds before and only after one week of separation they were flying around their minds goodnight harry kiara said quietly as she felt her eyelids begin to close it was funny how harry steady breathing seemed to have the same effect as a sleeping potion sleep tight goodnight kiara harry answered although he wasntsleepy he had won beaten whatever potion kiara had been drinking kiara had come to him like he had wanted but now she was here he didntreally know what to do they had a strong emotional connection and some physical but harry didntlook at her and think phwoar just yet although he loved the way their bodies moulded together despite the fact that seconds before he hadntbeen sleepy at all his eyelids were getting heavier and soon he was asleep harry found himself in the same white space that he had been in when sirius had spoken to him the last time he walked around with his hands out hoping to touch a wall but it seemed the whiteness as endless he was grateful that it was endless darkness hello harry a voice said behind him harry spun around reaching for his wand that he usually kept in his back pocket only to remember he was in his boxers he took a step back as he recognised the man standing in front of him it was from this man he had inherited his untameable jet black hair and pretty much everything else except for his eyes dad harry asked slightly uncertain come here son james potter held his arms open and hugged his son lovingly and rather tightly as if he was afraid to let him go i ve been waiting sixteen years to do that and to hear you say dad i dreaming arenti in a way this is like when you saw sirius except i waited for a more convenient moment harry nodding partly understanding he still believed what had happened with sirius was sort of a dream i here because you re having a bit of girl trouble girl trouble harry couldntbelieve it his dad was coming from god knows where to give him help on girl trouble all the times he could have helped harry but he only comes when harry having girl trouble yes with this girl kiara so what wrong excuse me for being so blunt but you re sleeping in the same bed and yet you haventactually slept with her why dad harry felt himself blush at the thought i haventeven kissed her yet well hurry up and do so she not going to wait forever and i pretty sure someone mentioned something about a guy could brace houdini or something like that blaise zabini yeah that the one someone betting that they get together so why dontyou ask her how she feels before it too late and kiss her i can guarantee you she wontsay no it not that simple how so she snape daughter he already given us enough grief over the sleeping arrangements and she a slytherin until she can get approval from malfoy we cantreally do anything yes you can just sneak around and hope you wontget caught as for snape i ll try and see if i can have a word with him you can do that yes but it only recently we ve been able to talk to the living some unspeakable opened a rift between our worlds your mother gave her sister a right haunting about the way she been treating you it was funny james grinned as he remembered that night is she alright she fine she might pay you a visit but only after you and kiara get it together in fact if you get it together the whole family will come and see you really i promise harry woke up to find it was still night kiara was sleeping quite peacefully and her temperature was as normal as it would get for her occasionally she stirred and her breathing quickened but as harry held her closer and whispered soothing words to her she would calm again harry thought about his dream did he really have a chance with kiara well at least he could say his chances of getting together with kiara were higher than his chances of getting back together with cho what so interesting over at the slytherin table seamus finnegan asked at breakfast following harry gaze he saw kiara in a conversation with blaise zabini harry didntseem to hear his question and continued to stare whilst absentmindedly sipping his coffee harry donttell me you re interested in snape daughter what harry asked snapping out of his thoughts had seamus just asked him that you were looking at kiara snape and you had a sort of dreamy look on your face no i didn t hate to tell you mate but you did it was a sort of i smitten and have been thinking about her the whole night look ron added doing nothing to help erase seamus shocked but amused expression thanks ron you re a great friend so you like her seamus persisted harry had an idea if kiara was slowly getting slytherin used to the idea of her liking a gryffindor what if he did the same wondering why he hadntthought of it before he allowed himself to blush are you serious i surprised you hadntnoticed he been staring at her since last week hermione said from behind her copy of advanced arithmancy they were having a small assessment to see what they had learned last week and she was determined to get higher than this girl in ravenclaw who always managed to beat her by one mark but that impossible you hate snape how can you fall for his daughter if you accidentally walked in on her whilst she was in her underwear i think you d say the same harry said remembering this morning with a smile he hadntseen kiara like that before and his gaze wondered up and down her body before he had excused himself blushing we share a bathroom and it doesntlock harry some of us are trying to eat he shuddered and made a face let say i understand why you like her what makes you think she likes you she walked on me in my towel and hardly looked away in horror i know she liked what she saw he heard a snort coming from behind advanced arithmancy and i harry potter i irresistible to who dean thomas asked joining into the conversation as ginny left to go pick up a forgotten homework in their common room harry here has got a crush on kiara snape and he thinks that she likes him as well seamus explained dean burst out laughing but stopped when he saw their serious faces no he really does like her you share quarters dontyou yes harry answered happy at the domino effect this was having dean would tell ginny and they would be overheard by someone who would tell somebody else and the cycle would go on if you like her then we can hardly stop you i wish you luck getting past snape and malfoy though i heard he likes her i heard blaise zabini likes her seamus argued i overheard malfoy teasing her in potions about liking harry so there you have it kiara likes harry and harry likes her now will you move on to something more interesting hermione snapped finally looking up from her book the boys looked at her confused ron was the one to air their thoughts i thought you were reading where are we going kiara whispered as harry led the way under his invisibility cloak so far they had sidestepped the head boy and girl and were now in a part of the castle kiara hadntyet managed to come across he put a finger to his lips to silence her and continued walking she decided to just follow him and hope wherever they were going didntget them into trouble it was now saturday and the whole week rumours had been flying one rumour said that snape had given her to harry to stop a family feud that had been going on for decades whilst another said someone had slipped them both love potions the rumours had caused outrage from some members of the concerned houses whilst others didntreally care kiara made sure she didntgo to the girls toilets by herself for fear of getting attacked and harry stayed away from the dungeons as much as possible especially after a death threat from severus harry led her up a narrow and steep circular stairway and once or twice kiara lost her footing reaching a door the cold outside air hit them strong and sharp emerging from the cloak kiara was taken away by the sight from where they were standing you could look out over the hogwarts grounds the forbidden forest thick with trees and on the horizon you could just make out the centre of hogsmeade all highlighted through the light of the full moon obscured once or twice by a passing cloud it beautiful kiara said edging closer to the low wall that stopped her from plummeting to a very ugly death she felt harry by her side and wrap his arm around her waist the funny feeling she felt in her stomach when she was around harry intensified and she wondered what he was doing she was neither cold neither needed help standing up i come here to think about my parents about sirius harry explained looking out into the distance and about you about me yes you remember this summer when i asked you if we could be something more something more than friends kiara nodded but didntsay anything there was nothing to say to that really and you said that i didntknow you well enough well you didn t i ve been thinking and wondering whether i could wait any longer i like you kiara i like you a lot you re a great friend and this after seeing you in your underwear last week i haventbeen have been able to keep my eyes of your body harry kiara blushed at the memory but instead of making her look unsightly which happened to a lot of people it added colour in her cheeks making them all rosy i know it ll take a lot of sneaking around but it would make me really happy if you let me be your boyfriend even if it will be a secret for a while my father will kill you kiara said finally seeing as this was her only argument she wanted harry and had fought a losing battle to keep les than clean thoughts entering her minds as he lay next to her in bed at least i ll die a happy man harry replied turning kiara round so that she was looking up to him kiara had to admit she had never seen him look so handsome than he did tonight perhaps it was the moonlight that seemed to highlight harry face in a way that no other light did are you sure i wouldntask if i wasn t kiara stood on her tiptoes supported by harry arms which he had wrapped around her waist and wrapped her arms around his neck there was a pause kiara slightly unsure harry experience wasnta lot more than kiara but he knew what he wanted bridging the small gap that was left between their lips harry kissed kiara gently just to see her reaction she seemed to stiffen slightly before he felt her relax against his body parting for a moment their lips met again but this time the kiss deeper a meow from the doorway caused them to part and glare at who had dared intrude mrs norris sat there her eyes glowing eerily in the moonlight her usual arrogance present many people liked to give her a good kick every now and then the problem was that wherever mrs norris went the caretaker argus filch was sure to follow almost always ready to drag you to your head of house harry placed a finger on kiara lips to signal to her she shouldntspeak and motioned her to a gap in the wall where two people could fit snugly into and covered themselves with the invisibility cloak this put them in very close proximity of each other acutely aware of their bodies against each other but also aware of the fact filch was to appear any minute now and he didntdisappoint them coming through the door wheezing from the hard climb he was getting older so where are they didntjump off did they filch said looking around and peering over the edge to make sure for a moment mrs norris came close enough to be able to scratch at the cloak but instead she meowed before turning and making her way down the stairs tail in the air where are you going now third time this week this has happened you aintbeen the same since you were petrified i ll tell you that they waited another five minutes before even daring to breath normally and making an attempt to get out of the gap as they did so harry managed to steal a kiss knowing that it was probably time they made their way back to their quarters light headed by the night events harry took several wrong turns and almost bumped into the head boy twice the cherub that guarded their quarters had to bribed with promise of more people using that passage to stop it from making more noise than really necessary by the time they finally climbed into bed they were exhausted but giggling as she fell asleep kiara thought how she had to be the luckiest girl in the world she had a father to be proud of friends she would never forget a boyfriend who also happened to be the boy who lived and had managed to get this far in life a n puts on puppy dog eyes why am i not get any reviews pretty plwease can i have some i thought i d give you a double chapter to have something to mull over since you all will know my updating is very random although a few reviews might help anyway i hope you enjoyed reading the story adn thank you very much for getting this far withoutturning back bear with me folks it will get better i have up to chapter 25 written up kiara eloise brentwood what going on harry asked as he pushed to the front of his team where ron stood arguing with draco over something it was probably just the usual booking clash nice of you to get here third time so far ron snapped as he let harry take over harry ignored his best friend comment sneaking around was harder than harry had thought true to his word james had brought harry family so harry wasntcomplaining it was nice to know he had once had a big family he was late to quidditch practises especially since his practises always clashed with kiara detentions it was as if rominisci somehow knew malfoy i have the pitch now harry said stepping up to the slytherin quidditch captain harry noted that draco had sprouted slightly faster than him over the summer and was a few inches taller correction i have the pitch now draco replied narrowing his eyes he didntreally have time for this he needed the pitch and he needed it now he only wished it was hufflepuffs he was shooing off they found him more intimidating i checked the rota and it clearly says gryffindor it not my fault you cantread but stop wasting my time potter just move my team are seriously in need of practise crap if i being blunt and i cantspare this session draco pulled the pity plea hoping it might work once again draco wished they were hufflepuffs they were much kinder what are you expecting pity sympathy again i not going anywhere so you are wasting time yours and mine i dontwant sympathy from the likes of you i was hoping you might understand but obviously not draco snapped looking miffed he d tried to be civil but it wasntgoing to work move or i ll move you look malfoy i dontwant trouble okay harry said stepping back to show that he really meant it he didntwant a fight especially with draco kiara would not be very happy i got the pitch and i intend to use it let settle this like gryffindors and slytherins do draco said handing his broom to crabbe if arguing fails fling spells at each other until one surrenders draco shrugged or gets hurt beyond repair i can t those were the hardest words harry had had to say in a long time he was trying hard to just resist the temptation of turning him into a ferret once more his transfiguration wasntthat good but it could work what the great harry potter walking away from a chance to beat me and shut me up once and for all i must be dreaming at least he mature enough to walk away ginny snapped draco snorted and looked at her with a mix of disgust and amusement little ginger weasel kindly go shag someone if you can find anyone in gryffindor you haventshagged already i see not being able to shut up ugliness and a love for potter is genetic ron made to go forward but harry held him back no fighting he was going to be civil but what else is to be expected of the scum potter chose as his friends why are you so eager for a fight malfoy harry asked calmly hoping to get a reaction that would tell him something nothing the same smirk and the same look in his eyes not even a flicker more importantly potter why are you not harry opened his mouth to speak but said nothing this is what kiara had been trying to tell him for the past week there were issues needing to be resolved within the houses this is what the sorting hat was trying to tell them how come if there was a practise clash with another house they played against each other for fun or split time but with slytherins there was a constant battle he wasntgoing to fan the flames any more now would be a good time to do what he had set out to do two weeks was enough time come on we ll reschedule good luck with you re team malfoy harry said turning to head back for the changing room everyone stared at him in disbelief but didntsay anything harry had been acting weird lately anyway this was the first time he had ever walked away from an argument with draco we can get changed and discuss tactics not so fast potter draco said causing harry to stop and turn around why i ve outgrown this grudge i not going to live forever we both know that so why should i spend my time arguing with you harry answered draco mouth dropped and he stared at harry in wonder and this whole house rivalry thing has gone too far we re meant to learn from the past but we re just repeating it i gave you a choice potter you chose weasley that would have made no difference i would have been sorted into slytherin and the rivalry would have still been there all i saying is i dontwant to spend the next two years constantly hating and badmouthing slytherins it produces some good people once in awhile oh i see what this is about draco said eyeing harry suspiciously he looked at the gryffindor team and the mistake he was just about to make he was going to be friends with that lot he burst out laughing that funny because i thought you really meant it for a moment there i did yeah right and muggles ride dragons i know what going on and it going to take a lot more than that to convince me whatever malfoy harry snapped back before storming off much to his team disbelief had harry actually wanted to be friends with draco malfoy kiara and blaise sat on the floor by the fire with their potions assignment spread out in front of them they had been there since the end of kiara detention almost three hours ago and it was still nowhere near finished even though they had started it five days ago and they only had until monday to do it three days away this project had done them some good kiara and blaise spending a lot of time together had brought them closer and now blaise opened up to kiara far more than he did anyone apart from draco do you think we re going to need an extension blaise asked as he copied down some information from a big book he had managed to get before hermione got her hands on it kiara looked up from her drawing of the effects of an incorrectly made lengthening potion and looked at what they had done so far i dontthink we ll be the only ones if we do no one can write a textbook in only a week i ll have the pictures finished by sunday morning so we can stick everything together i dontthink so really kiara answered smiling at blaise before returning to her drawing it was almost done all she had to do were the extra long fingers and she d be finished granger probably could doubt it she working with harry and ron those two are both on the quidditch team and lazy with stuff like this she probably wontsleep at all blaise wondered about the first name mentions but said nothing he didntwant to make a big deal out of nothing especially with he and kiara getting on better than he had expected should we take a break i d love to sitting cross legged hurts after awhile kiara answered stretching her legs and noticing that a week of sitting by the fire had put some colour in her skin a slight tan even this coursework deadline is a bit too sudden dontyou think blaise shrugged getting up and helping kiara up as well they sat down in the armchairs for a moment just relaxing the common room was empty especially after blaise had hexed a few first years who where making too much noise there were some things he did not tolerate unnecessary noise was one of them kiara studied him for a moment and watch his eyes at the stared into the fire and further his jaw clenched and unclenched something kiara knew severus did when he was really frustrated about something her eyes were drawn to his neck where just below the neck of his school shirt there was a scar a fresh scar by the looks of it blaise tell me about your family kiara said smiling as blaise turned to her with a confused look it was a random question but kiara just hoped she could break through his shell he was a friend and kiara held friendships close to her heart the only people she truly considered friends at hogwarts were ginny ron hermione harry draco and blaise she would do a lot for them there not much to tell blaise replied feeling slightly panicked kiara was the first person to ask about his family seeming genuinely interested and this unnerved him he had everything figured out if one doesnttalk about it they can push it away build walls around that not true my family is really just severus and i still find lots to tell he got the complications of a whole family blaise still looked uncertain and kiara placed a hand on his arm please why are you asking kiara what is it you want to know about my family do they treat you right what blaise stared at her in disbelief but she wasntjoking her face was serious and her hand was still on his arm urging him to talk to her he felt the walls beginning to sink but they wouldntwithout good reason he had worked too long for them to be dissolved by her do they treat you right i the only person they have left of course my parents treat me as well as can be expected they push me to meet their expectations but so do most parents my sister left home when i started school it was a real blow to my parents who had hoped she would marry but she didntbelieve in the dark lord and his cause and wouldntmarry what she called pureblood scum last letter she sent me i was an uncle congratulations kiara smiled it must be hard on you knowing she living her own life away from you not as hard as it is on my parents father forced her to come home once but she left after only a week said she had a life asked me to come with her to save myself when i still had the chance he paused his eyes still fixed on the fireplace as he tried to word his story carefully i couldntleave i couldntdo that to mother i not saying i didnttry but when mother asked me to stay i stayed i stayed for her what about your father mutual dislike he doesntsee me as a son but more as an offering to the dark lord never fails to remind me what a failure i am i always too dumb too smart too rude too shy too everything you cantwin with him does he treat you right blaise narrowed his eyes and shook kiara hand off this was forbidden territory he tried not to think about it let alone talk about it what worried him was that kiara had guessed pretty much by herself she had just gone round instead of asking him straight out he didntanswer but continued to stare at the fire blaise some scars people can see i just want you to know you re not alone i have scars too his eyes widened as she lifted the back of her school shirt to reveal a back adorned with scars even some slow fading bruises her back was like his each scar representing a bad memory and each bad memory bringing him crashing down to reality the reality that he was destined to be a death eater whether he wanted it or not the reality he might one day have to watch his sister die the reality that someone cared snape no kiara shifted uncomfortable before smiling maybe we should get back to work we ve only got three days after all yes you re right we can celebrate on sunday when we put the book together and then we can talk terrorise first years or just relax all we want sounds good to me as kiara began to draw she settled on the plush carpet once more this time he felt drawn to kiara not in a romantic way there was no way he had a crush on snape daughter especially since he was certain she was sneaking around with harry but in another way kiara wanted to know him as a friend and they were similar blaise studied her face for a long time noting the large warm eyes she had those that seemed all so familiar but strange at the same time his sister had the same warmth but he had seen these eyes somewhere somewhere in hogwarts kiara certainly didntget her eyes from severus she got them from her mother and her mother was somewhere in hogwarts dear kiara the funeral is scheduled to take place on the last day of the month i am aware that darren told you he doesntwish to see you there but he has changed his mind he was grief stricken when he wrote that letter and didntmean it you donthave to say anything or even be at the service i just think dad would like to have you say goodbye to him on the day he laid to rest if you do wish to come owl back and i ll arrange something with your father and professor dumbledore or you may do so yourself and owl back the details or whichever way you want i am looking forward to seeing you again even in this circumstance we have so much to talk about yours sincerely warren i would like for you to go but whilst i am your guardian this is only in circumstances when severus is not able to take care of you and make decisions on your behalf severus has told me he doesntwish for you to go and therefore there is not much i can do dumbledore said looking genuinely sorry i will however tell the noughts of your circumstances and offer for you to go another time when severus is a little more lenient thank you i understand kiara replied slightly disappointed but understood the reasons for this she made to get up but dumbledore motioned for her to keep sitting she obliged even if she wanted to grab her letter and bolt as he began to look through his drawer she felt like she shouldnthave come and she knew she was right because he produced a letter the letter that she had gotten at the start of term kiara i know you are scared but this letter is serious we can protect you but not if you donttell us what really going on kiara stared at dumbledore twinkling deep blue eyes and wondered whether they could be trusted yes he was powerful but what he was fighting was way over his head kiara feared voldemort would win i i can t why i donttrust you with that information what about severus i can tell him why dontyou because professor there are some things i need to figure out kiara sighed and slowly traced the two long scars that intersected on her right arm scars that would never fade away a small price to pay for the use of her right arm like who my mother is we can help you if we knew who your father was it would be very easy her eyes flashed with anger and annoyance my father beat the shit out of me for 16 years dumbledore are a few months just being kiara snape too much to ask i ll catch you guys later i going to the library harry said as he finished swallowing the last of his dinner down ron almost choked on his food and he stared at harry as he was ill he might has well have been harry never stepped foot in the library unless absolutely necessary hermione on the other hand beamed she had been trying 6 years to get harry to go to the library because he wanted to and not for an assignment have fun harry take your time hermione said proudly ron just continued to stare harry smiled picked up his bag and left he had nothing better to do so this was the perfect time as he entered the library he felt wary of talking to madam pince he was hardly a regular and she wasntthe friendliest of people what can i do for you she asked as he approached her desk she knew who he was of course but she only ever saw him around exam time like she saw every other student this was rare um i need information on people that donated to the school in the past 50 years harry answered aware of madam pince curious looks but she nodded and indicated for her to follow him he followed her to the end of the library which looked rather old in this section you ll find all of hogwarts information from former students to donations made to the school it might take a bit of searching but it there somewhere harry thanked madam pince and began searching the books finally he found a book with records of the students that graduated the same year as the marauders sirius had said she had been good friends with remus assuming she had been in gryffindor he noted all the girls that had graduated from gryffindor except for his mum he was certain she was not kiara mother otherwise that would mean he had been making out with his own sister brushing away the thought he looked for accidents that had happened to hogwarts these were easier to find as there werenttoo many scanning through the records he quickly found what he was looking for 1978 extensive damage sustained in the dungeons due to explosion donations received from eleanor richmond william brentwood ministry of magic the governors help received ministry of magic and governors provided temporary classrooms on the school grounds william brentwood supplied the builders and decorators eleanor richmond helped teach potions until the dungeons were re built harry took down the only female name there and saw that she had graduated alongside his parents and remus it was possible they had been friends seeing as she was his only choice harry looked for a book that might give him more information than he already had checking the student records next to her name was the date on which she died she had died a year after this sure enough he found her but something wasntquite right the picture next to the description looked like kiara enough the eyes and the smile certainly he had little doubt this was kiara mother but what didntmake sense was the fact that she was married whilst at hogwarts eleanor was a shy girl but proceeded in making friends with everyone regardless of house she won hogwarts the international wizarding gobstones cup for seven years running and graduated with seven newt s instead of pursuing a career eleanor married william brentwood her childhood friend in 1975 both were students at hogwarts eleanor a prefect and william having been head boy in the year in above in 1978 they helped rebuild the dungeons after a bad explosion whilst her husband saw to the rebuilding she teamed up with severus snape to teach potions in the temporary classrooms eleanor brentwood nee richmond sadly died two years later giving birth to her daughter kiara eloise who after complications did not survive and the fact that according to this kiara eloise snape was in fact kiara eloise brentwood and she was supposed to have died many years ago a n oo cliffhanger but dontexpect me to do anything dramatic with it so dontworry point of info i am fully aware that in canon blaise mother has had seven husbands who all died mysteriously i wrote this chapter before i researched it i am not exactly the best person at keeping in canon but at least blaise isntextremely fanon just slight remember guys reviews do help thanks for reading though even if you dontreview until next time i decide to update the dark lady of r warnings and the truth kiara stormed into her common room anger boiling up inside of her from her previous conversation with dumbledore and the fact that the cherub guarding her and harry quarters was starting to get rather irksome dumbledore office was a long way away from her quarters and she was certain she had earned herself a reputation as a rude bitch because she had lost count of the number of people she had barged past and had snapped at anyone who dared breathe a word she was also quite sure she was in a lot of trouble having collided with professor mcgonagall and professor rominisci and been quite rude about it both who werenthuge fans of hers hey kiara what wrong harry asked putting down the book he had been leafing through and standing up kiara stopped in her tracks tempted to barge past him and into her room but not able his eyes were fixing her to the spot they were full of concern so much that there was nothing kiara could do as she felt tears streaming down her cheeks dumbledore is an kiara said through the tears as harry held her close having covered the small distance between them she buried her head in his chest and the last word was lost within the folds of his dark robes he stroked her hair comfortingly and cursed dumbledore for choosing possibly the worst moment to make her upset dontworry we all find that out sooner or later he pulled away from her and taken her by the hand steered her over to the sofa where they could sit and talk want to tell me how he managed to upset kiara snape so much it alright now you know anything sets me off kiara replied calmly although she was still sniffling wiping her eyes with the sleeve of her robes it contradicted her words she did not look alright the crying her made her cheeks red and blotchy and it was a look that didntsuit her and with bill funeral coming up it just got a lot for me kiara remember that little thing we do when you talk i comfort and then we spend the rest of the week snuggled up closely in bed together can we do it now harry winced as kiara elbowed him sharply in the ribs seriously kiara bottling things up never works i know from experience and remember that thing that called having secrets what about that thing where in a relationship you trust one and other what if your relationship is based with the boy who lived who according to sources never managed to complete his occlumensy course and therefore would be dangerous to share secrets with have you forgotten about that little magic bond thing we did we can go on like this for hours and i still mightnttell you kiara said coolly knowing fully well that the conversation wasntgoing to go anywhere if they carried on like that it was often the reason they overslept on mondays and had to rush everything they were tired after spendingsunday evening just arguing pointlessly besides it doesntmatter whether you know or not the matter is dealt with how so next time dumbledore decides he wants to upset me i will hex him i starting to think you need to have a good long chat with me harry said slowly as kiara lent on him giggling slightly at her own remark but having forgotten about crying he stroked her arm tracing a lightning bolt on her arm about what you what about me the fact that snape isntreally your father severus opened the door to mcgonagall office not bothering to knock he hadnthad time to digest his food and therefore he was cranky straight after dinner was always a bad time to talk to him his eyes narrowed as he saw that mcgonagall had company in the form of the defence against the dark arts teacher severus couldnthelp wondering why this man if you could call him that insisted on wearing muggle clothing at the moment rominisci was wearing faded blue jeans with rips at the knees and a dark blue long sleeved shirt severus may have graduated from wearing black robes to the dark green he was now clad in but muggle clothing was another thing am i interrupting severus asked raising an eyebrow to the two that had been in deep discussion before he walked in he grimaced inwardly at the thought of anything happening between the head of gryffindor and rominisci but kept his face straight no not at all take a seat severus there are matters damien and i need to discuss with you mcgonagall said attempting to smile but ending up looking like she was in pain severus stayed where he was and the only suggestion that he would sit down was the raise of an eyebrow about kiara i think you will find there is a line take a ticket and wait until your number is called severus sneered wondering why they had felt now was the time to talk to him along with several others the head girl had come up to him and given a full account on how kiara had threatened to curse her to a life of acne if she ever tried to take points of slytherin severus had smirked at that moment and simply shrugged stating that he had no power over kiara he had spoilt her too much the look on the head girl face was unforgettable i remember getting a ticket on the third day of term so you ll find it happens to be my turn rominisci said playing along with the sarcastic comment severus had just made severus still didntmove to sit but instead made to turn around and leave snape this meeting was not called as a teacher to teacher but more as an unofficial parent to teacher well as a parent you ll find i just dontcare what you have to say severus we both feel that kiara isntadjusting well to the school life very well and wanted to take it up with you before we went to dumbledore mcgonagall snapped making severus stop hand on the door handle so if you please sit down and listen for once in your life very well if you insist on being so rude rude compared to your precious little princess that was polite rominisci said adding a little chuckle to add to the absurdity of mcgonagall being rude i have never in my life as a student and a professor seen someone hurl so much abuse at another person must take after me this is no laughing matter severus this evening she will receive her first official warning two more and we will be forced to suspend her even consider expelling her and this warning has been brought up by what exactly severus asked his attention now taken she hadnteven been here a month and here she was already being issued a warning he had been trying the past five years to get one given to harry with no avail kiara had changed so much since he had first adopted her he guessed he shouldntbe surprised especially since the whole magic bonding thing she had been ruder as stubborn as ever and very argumentative he would personally applause the person that managed to shut her up without any force damien has been petitioning for this warning as vigorously as you petitioned for potter on the foundation that she is a distraction in the lessons and he spends half his time sending her out of the classroom than he does teaching and every time he is answered back with abuse mcgonagall explained her face turning sour with obvious distaste of the thoughts passing through her head i chose not to take him seriously until this evening when not only did kiara push me aside as she rushed to god knows where and when i tried to ask her calmly where the fire was she turned around and said the rudest things a student has ever said to me in years let me guess kiara said you looked like you d been sucking on too many lemon drops severus replied already bored he knew the outcome of this rominisci and mcgonagall would take it to dumbledore who would make kiara apologise and that would be end of story it was the most logical and expected thing you wish she told professor mcgonagall to go fuck dumbledore and stuff her bitchy looking face with his fucking lemon drops because she needed fattening up when professor mcgonagall took 50 points from slytherin for language she turned around and looked exactly like you before asking what a mere gryffindor like herself was going to do rominisci explained trying to look angry although he was trying very hard not to laugh have you never heard of a detention that all that was going to happen i heard kiara shouting from my office and came to see what was going on and when kiara began turning away quite rudely whilst she was still being spoken to i told her so true snape style she decides that pissing off one teacher isntenough and launches into a verbal attack on me as well here i can guess what she said no problem something along the lines of you are a pompous bigheaded faggot who should step away long enough from the mirror to see that the world doesntrevolve around you if it werentfor your over rated looks you d be nothing but a sewer rat drowning in the sewer how did you know i think exactly the same thing severus smirked rominisci attempt at a scary glare failing miserably kiara will apologise once she realises what she has done we all know dumbledore will not suspend kiara so please save your breath next time are you aware she failing every other lesson of hers the only ones she isntare potions charms and arithmancy because these are the only lessons where she doesntjust sit and stare into space mcgonagall said as severus began to get up severus sighed and sank back down again her essays are appalling read this one she wrote on shield charms severus accepted the essay that had a bright red t on the top of the short piece of parchment clearing his voice severus read it out loud when using a shield charm the shield is conjured up through the charm created by ones wand it was discovered years ago and is still used today there are many spells which the shield cannot shield the wizard or witch from especially those that were intended to break through the shield the unforgivables are an example for more information read chapter three of advanced defence against the dark arts five feet would have been acceptable but not five sentences if it was potter that gave that in what would you do severus considered his response very carefully if he said he would let it pass it would be so obvious he was trying to save kiara from getting the warning but if he said he would punish harry and make him do it again he would be agreeing to them personally if any student gave that in he would make them redo it and write out the whole of chapter three first by quill then with a pencil and then with a muggle biro all in their spare time and an hour of shouting would ensue severus sighed wanting to get back to digesting before he took action he was going to have to cave in rominisci did you tell her off for it you could say that rominisci shrugged i just asked her what she thought she was doing and in her usual fashion started an argument i never got to properly shout at her besides that isntthe only essay of its kind every other essay i ve set has been like that very well issue your stupid warning severus stood up to leave by the time i finished giving her a piece of my mind she ll be a lot nicer and concentrate more in class certainly with you minerva but i not promising professor rominisci anything he left the office before any of the remaining professors could say anything i know i should have come clean from the beginning harry but i was so scared kiara said as she had finished filling in the blanks for harry how it was that she was alive how snape had come to adopt her and why she was wanted by her father he had listened quietly every now and then squeezing her hand in encouragement to keep going harry now sat there silently absentmindedly stroking kiara arm you dontneed to apologise you did what was best all that left to do is tell snape and get on with your life harry said eventually kiara sighed snuggling further into his hold and wished that her life was easier so much easier perhaps harry was right she had to tell severus he would be hurt she hadnttold him before harry but he would get over it you wonttell anyone else though will you your secret is safe with me thanks harry i dontknow what i d do without you kiara turned herself so she was able to give harry a gentle kiss on the lips that seemed to snap him out of his thinking daze because he looked down at kiara and smiled to think only moments before she had stormed in here on the verge of tears and here she was looking a lot happier already and teasing him what they say is true talking does help i dontknow but it definitely wouldntbe this harry matched kiara gentle kiss and she smiled he had a point there soon the seriousness of kiara situation was momentarily forgotten as they kissed each kiss deepening every now and then tongues searching never mind the fact they were on the sofa and anyone who had access to their quarters could walk in on them whilst harry mouth kept busy so did his hands running up and down the contour of her slim but shaping body whilst her hands ran through his jet black hair air didntseem important and they would have carried on going for quite awhile if it wasntfor the interruption kiara eloise snape you had better be studying because if you arentyou will be in a lot more trouble than you already are severus had shouted as he made his way through the doorway he hadntyet spotted the young secret couple but when he did he sure wasnthappy potter look dad we can explain kiara said pushing harry aside so she could sit up his hair was a lot more ruffled than usual and kiara was aware that she must looked flushed or something along those lines because she certainly felt like it explain then well you see harry was comforting me and then well we sort of professor snape sir i think you deserve the truth harry said bravely standing up so that he matched severus in height harry was being extremely brave since severus was still a few centimetres taller and also a very angry father i have been seeing your daughter in secret for the past two weeks or so it was at my suggestion that kiara agreed to it and entirely my fault i should have done the honourable thing and come and asked you for permission or at least told you because i know how much you hate me and want the best for kiara potter yes sir shut up if you expected me to believe that nonsense you just spewed then you have just insulted me now if you would leave i would like to have a private conversation with my daughter harry hesitated do you have a death wish harry chose to stay alive and winked at kiara before running to his room as fast as his feet could carry him leaving her alone with very pale looking snape she stayed seated on the sofa whilst he paced up and down looked at her sighed and then carried on pacing this carried on until kiara could stand it no longer alright stop pacing kiara you are in no situation to be ordering me about you are heading towards expulsion and i have just caught you with potter when you know how much i hate him severus snapped but kiara stayed determined she didntcare about expulsion and getting caught kiara felt that now might be the time to tell him dad what who eleanor richmond severus stopped pacing and slowly turned to stare at kiara he hadntheard her name mentioned for over fifteen years now he wondered how kiara knew there was some kind of connection between him and eleanor richmond and why she was asking at this moment in time we went to school together and she was a colleague for awhile eleanor died around fifteen years ago severus explained and watched in awe as tears filled kiara eyes she looked neither happy nor sad why eleanor richmond was my mother a n short in betweeny chapter it what you get for not reviewing a total and utter fluffball i would like to say specialthanks to freakstar who will finally get to this chapter since she has been reviewing in every single chapter starting from numero uno even though she only started reading recently a bit of feedback would be nice guys and gals thanks for reading though i haventforgotten those that just like to read and cantbe asked to review thanxies i ll see you soon enough not you as well fudge resigns wizarding community rejoices written by rita skeeter journalist of the year yesterday evening it was announced by the ministry of magic that cornelius fudge minister of magic for fifteen years had finally resigned instead of being sad and confused by this sudden event the wizarding community actually sighed a breath of relief some wondering what had taken so long the past years of fudge career are widely known to have hardly been smooth sailing three years ago he made a blunder of catching the then believed to be convict sirius black who died under mysterious circumstances in the ministry of magic earlier this year two years ago he made the mistake of not believing harry potter when he told him that he who must not be named had returned to life and putting the world at risk from another uprising of the dark lord it was only when the ministry was infiltrated and attacked by he who must not be named in question along with his followers did fudge admit to having made a mistake now he has stepped down the wizarding community can look forward to a brighter future with a new leader in place perhaps a full blown war between light and dark may be avoided preparations for an election in january have already taken place and we already have the names of three most likely candidates william brentwood hopefully as good at being minister of magic as he is being handsome has been part of the ministry for quite some years now and has experience according to our sources he will be one to watch percival weasley a new talent that graced the ministry with his presence only two years ago but has worked his way up from errand boy to junior undersecretary to the minister in just under two years great things are predicted for this weasley margaret sinclair only female candidate but is well liked amongst her colleagues and is well known and loved as the head of the wizarding community welfare department or better known as the cww rumour has it that ms sinclair had a hand in fudge resignation whether or not she had she is still well respected kiara threw the newspaper aside in disgust how could people not see what was underneath their nose lack of knowledge made you ignorant and that what everybody was ignorant fudge had been quite awful as a minister but at least he wasntout to help a psycho take over the world and beyond these days he had been influenced by dumbledore so that had played to their advantage now william brentwood was going to be minister of magic they stood little chance unless he decided to kill himself which was very unlikely he already started messing with the newspapers i see severus said as he walked down from his room in dressing gown it was sunday morning and kiara had spent the night in severus quarters at his request most probably to keep on eye on her how did you know kiara asked curiously as she watched severus pour himself some coffee he had had a long night and he certainly deserved it he raised an eyebrow as if it was an obvious question because all of the candidates are little shits and here they re made out to sound as heroic as potter severus settled down onto the sofa next to kiara kiara had to giggle at severus he could be so blunt at times who can i just say i am not happy about wait my father is going to be made minister of magic and has threatened to come and get me and all you can think about is harry kiara asked quite surprised actually severus snape had struck her as the kind of man that took life very seriously his eyes darkened and he stared into his coffee bitterly maybe i still trying to digest the fact that you are not dead and i might have to give you back to your father so i would appreciate it if you worked with me and didntmention it any more severus answered but didntlook kiara in the eye perhaps he didnttrust himself severus had been up most the night thinking he was going to do with kiara he had decided that he was going to have to take it each day as it came worrying about a future with kiara that might never exist was useless he had to worry about the present and make the most of what he had with kiara now of course when the time came severus would fight for kiara with all he had but if he lost that was it he would never see his dark little one again it would take while for him to come to terms that he was looking at eleanor daughter and had been looking after her he was sure if she was looking down on him right now she would be laughing at his sensitivity i sorry maybe i was being insensitive or maybe i was just trying to worry about my future kiara snapped before hugging her knees to her chest it was her way of warning severus she might just start crying any minute now if he carried on the way you re behaving you haventgot a future he scoffed kiara looked up her brow furrowed in confusion dontact like you dontknow not concentrating in class lack of effort in homework ring any bells kiara you are failing every other class not on purpose i just have a lot on my mind at times it not like i failing potions or anything kiara replied quite frankly not bothered about her grades when the newt came she d revise like mad and scrape it that if she even got that far in life that not the point you re here to learn kiara it time you did just that you try learning when you know any time now the life you re just getting used to is about to be taken away you try and learn when you have to worry whether you re acting convincingly slytherin enough and you try and learn when the teacher hates your fucking guts it not as easy as you make it to be severus eye twitched donttalk to me like that kiara i am still your father i never said you weren t i just dontsee what the big deal is what the big deal is what the big deal is severus felt like he could tear his hair out and maybe even strangle her until i ve had you for six months i am under review any moment now a social worker could come and check how you re getting on the way you re behaving i d probably lose you is that what you want you never told me that kiara said huffily resting her head on her knees it did ring a bell though and it certainly made sense at certain moments it felt like she was really his daughter it was a kind of bond they shared adoption issues had been the last of her worries i did i told you when we were at grimmauld place severus reminded her she turned to look at him blankly no she could not remember that before we had that rather big and unnecessary row about me being rude to potter it was the first and only time you swore directly at me ah so you did it slipped my mind maybe i should just have you home schooled it would save me a good deal of grief and that way i d be sure that you weren t severus stopped mid sentence what he had been about to say would have probably provoked an argument it would just be a lot easier but i like being here it not my fault mcgonagall and rominisci hate me kiara defended stretching herself out a little not knowing she d got herself into a corner that would be hard to wriggle out of how did you know it had anything to do with professors mcgonagall and rominisci i never mentioned them perhaps you d like to explain yourself severus drank the rest of his coffee glad they were actually moving somewhere towards his intended destination hopefully the next week would start with an apology to said professors and an improvement in her work well it just i well kiara stuttered unable to find the right words she wasntsure whether severus knew about yesterday incidents or not so she couldntchance lying it wasntfair lying to severus i was out of line with them yesterday i used abusive language towards them and it was mostly unprovoked i just guessed i might have tipped them too far you did they both expect full apologies i not apologising to that idiot kiara severus said his voice warning her that he too wasntto be tipped too far she scowled but fell silent so that he could continue what he was saying and i expect to see a large improvement in your work all your essays will come through me first so i can check you haventwritten absolute nonsense my essays arentthat bad kiara huffed in her defence better than crabbe and goyle s well crabbe and goyle are exceptions they re quite frankly idiots that what you say about harry and he a lot smarter than them two but they re not secretly dating my daughter he is i haventforgotten about you and him together severus shivered at the memory he hated walking in on students when they were all over each other especially not when it was his kiara all over harry potter when were you going to tell me after we got married severus head snapped to face her his face livid kiara put her hands up in a surrendering way laughing slightly joking we were going to tell you after we got blessing from draco so he knows oh no he d kill harry he wouldntthink about the consequences he cantsee what i see in harry nor can i but he willing to warm to the idea over time it only been a few weeks you are telling me that you value malfoy blessing over mine he asked crossing his arms kiara groaned inwardly big mouth she had a big mouth especially when she didntthink what she was saying severus was upset enough without this as well well kiara began dragging out the word to give her time to think actually you know what kiara just go she turned to him thoroughly confused one minute he wanted an answer the next he wanted her to go it was on his request she was down here anyway kiara searched his eyes for a moment or two and found no emotion he was hiding them she hated when he did that because it usually followed some kind of outburst she reached out and touched him slightly on his arm he flinched be like that then kiara snapped getting up from the sofa once you ve calmed down come and find me i ll be with blaise all day severus didntrespond turning on her heels trying not to show she was about to cry kiara stormed out of the room not caring she was in her pyjamas and definitely not caring to apologise to the painting of salazar slytherin she had just pushed forward with unnecessary force once she was gone severus walked to his desk searching for some writing paper when he found it he took out a quill and began to write dear vexus something up kiara blaise said as he watched kiara sigh for the tenth time in the half hour they had just spent finishing up their textbook project for potions she stopped shuffling through the papers and looked up at him her eyes questioning you ve been really unlike yourself all morning no i ve been like myself kiara replied curtly before turning back to the work it was blaise time to sigh it didnttake a genius to figure out something was up even if being quiet rude and withdrawn was kiara actual personality he turned back to his book leaning on the armchair since he and kiara were sitting on the floor kiara had offered to put the book together since she had left him to do all the written work last night when she had to do something or other with this on his mind blaise found it hard to concentrate on his book it wasntthat interesting anyway instead she watched kiara as she worked her face partly hidden by her hair and her hands moving with an awkward elegance he only knew in kiara i not that interesting you know kiara said after awhile yet still not looking up from the work blaise let a small smile appear on his face he was finally getting a response you are when you re trying to hide something kiara snorted but the wheels in blaise head continued working what could have happened yesterday that made her so upset she had seemed perfectly alright on friday especially something like potter that definitely got the girls attention kiara put down what she was doing and turned to blaise her face a mixture of emotions only two that blaise could easily recognise relief and confusion i have no idea what you mean come off it i do have eyes and unlike most people i do know how to use them i still have no idea what you mean i may be developing a liking to him but nothing is happening until draco agrees oh really blaise rolled his eyes denial could be quite tiresome and holding hands under the table is just you know a friendly way of saying fuck off and sneaking a quiet kiss between lessons isntwhat you do you re not going to tell are you only if you tell me what wrong kiara weighed out her choices she could either have draco kill harry or she could trust blaise sighing kiara nodded this was certainly going to be a long day especially since it had only just gone midday kiara settled on a window seat that overlooked the hogwarts ground shortly followed by blaise at been his idea to come to the trophy room since he was quite sure people hardly came in here and filch cleaned to trophies and awards on wednesday evenings so they were quite alone there was a moment or two of silence as blaise waited for kiara to speak up and kiara thought of what she could say that didntreveal too much about her my father caught harry and i together last night kiara said quietly her voice barely a whisper but since he was sitting in close proximity blaise heard her clearly enough i guessing he not happy blaise said although he wasntguessing he knew his head of house well enough to know he would not be happy and even consider approving of such a relationship kiara shook her head staring out of the window her eyes focused somewhere in the distance i dontblame him not you as well blaise blaise held up a hand to silence her hear me out the thing you ve got to understand kiara is that you are trying to cross boundaries that have crushed all those who tried to get past them all gryffindor slytherin relationships in the past and present have either been kept secret or have failed bringing them crashing back to earth same applies for pureblood half blood or muggle born relationship they never last and you know why why because that the way life is especially if you are a slytherin or come from a slytherin family you should have chosen gryffindor if you seriously wanted to be with potter you know i couldnthave blaise i had my father to think about and the snape name think of what this will do to the snape name once it gets out professor snape was a well known death eater and some say he still is his daughter dating the boy that brought the destruction of the dark lord will not fare well on the rest of the pureblood community what do you have against me dating harry nothing i just trying to look out for you kiara looked at him questioningly as if to ask how telling her all this was possibly a way of looking out for her i dontwant to see you get hurt why would you not want that only a few weeks ago you seemed to hate my guts only two days ago you showed you cared about me there was a silence as the two just looked at one another wondering if they really cared what the other thought or if they did genuinely care for each other kiara scolded herself of course she cared about blaise he was a friend and he was probably just looking out for her and blaise well there werentmany people he talked to or even offered advice kiara ran a hand through her hair which she had worn down for the first time she had been at hogwarts perhaps blaise was right i not going to get hurt blaise what harry and i want is to stop all this house prejudice rubbish to set an example to do something i ll be remembered for kiara finally said although she knew it would take much more than that to convince blaise or any slytherin for that matter dontyou sometimes wish you could get to know people outside your house what you are attempting has a high failure rate just promise me one thing what that dontfall in love with him a n another short chappie i give up on reviews i know you re reading and i guess i ll have to live with that unless somehow my reviews arentgetting through oh well i gonna concentrate on finishing this thing my estimate is another 20 chapters max yeah well until next time i update but before i go do you think kiara should help voldie harry or destroy them both i needto knowto continue after chapter even if you dontreply or review thanks for reading because my stats tell me you are bye quidditch match to remember the month of october passed quickly for kiara having started it with at least one apology her class work and homework did improve mostly due to the fact severus was checking each piece of homework and coursework before she submitted it by the time halloween had come and past she was acing most of her classes with the exception of defence against the dark arts it was like rominisci had launched a personal vendetta against the snape family and more than once kiara still found herself sitting at the back of the potions classroom catching up with work even severus had given up on getting kiara to ignore the idiot her relationship with harry continued in secret but kiara couldnthelp but to sit up late at night and watch him carefully blaise words echoing through her mind she still didntget by what he had meant that day by asking her to promise she wouldntfall in love with him by now she knew blaise well enough he hadntsaid it out of jealousy which would have been the easy and straightforward solution draco had yet to relent and when it came with anything to do with harry kiara and severus couldntagree about anything severus had become rather withdrawn but so had kiara pansy and millicent thought she wasntas interesting as she had been to start with draco blamed blaise bad influence whilst kiara just shrugged it all off even when she wasntacting the perfect slytherin kiara had noticed that she was still very slytherin sometimes her gryffindor side did show up but very rarely she wasntexactly about to act like the mother she had never known now it was an early saturday morning and kiara was sitting with the quidditch team along with blaise offering moral support draco looked extremely tired and he would be he had spent every last minute trying to whip his team into shape he intended to win the quidditch up this year even if slytherin probably wouldntwin the house cup until harry finally left the school kiara was currently trying to coax some food into him draco please eat something what good are you going to be when you faint and fall off your broom kiara said wafting a piece of toast in front of his face he just scowled but didnttake it i wontbe there to catch you when have you ever been there to catch me draco retorted snatching he piece of toast out of kiara hand and shoving it into his mouth with his mouth still full he turned to kiara and sprayed her with food whilst saying happy now you can be so revolting sometimes thank you kiara shot a glare at blaise who had a small smile on his face warning him not to ever bring it up again she may have now been covered in a few breadcrumbs that had been in draco mouth but at least he had eaten and was now reaching for another piece of toast draco was through his third piece when a fourth year slytherin came into the great hall that was empty apart from the two teams playing today gryffindor and slytherin and a few supporters able to get out of bed earlier than needed the boy approached kiara who happened to be the most approachable person at the table right now the team looked like they would clobber anyone and anything with their wands if they were at hand and blaise was known to be a generally unapproachable person kiara was the only one who looked harmless and considering she was shorter than him a safer bet madam hooch sent me to inform the slytherin team that she has come down with something and professor rominisci will be refereeing the match today he told kiara before hightailing it out of the great hall he had a feeling that the slytherins would be less than happy um guys kiara said getting the attention of everyone on the table she hadntrealised until then she was the only girl on the table they all looked up from their food or their conversations and waited i have some possibly bad news madam hooch has come down with something and rominisci will be refereeing not that fucker draco groaned it was now common knowledge that rominisci hated everything and anything associated with snape which meant that he took a dislike to the slytherin house whose head was severus snape rominisci and severus were in a battle to see who could award and take points away in one lesson you never know things might go our way dreg simmons a stocky seventh year muttered he had replaced crabbe as beater and he certainly performed better it also helped that he was able to give and take instructions without a five minute hesitation how can it rominisci hates slytherin dreg shrugged at his anxious captain kiara had no time to consider what he had just said as she was busy trying to get draco to stop pulling his hair out it was nice hair and it would be such a waste if it was ruined ladies and gentleman i am back couldntget rid of me for long could you lee jordan commented as the stands began to fill up the boy with the dreadlocks had certainly grown in the short space that was summer and he certainly looked every bit the eighteen years old he was now mcgonagall sat next to him as she had always done making sure he watched his mouth first match of the season gryffindor vs slytherin who going to win kiara sat in the stands between a very grumpy severus who looked very much as if he d rather not be there and an expressionless blaise not the very best of company but it sure beat sitting with a group of giggling and screaming girls she was wrapped up warm with a silver and green scarf wrapped round her neck and a matching headband to show her support she felt nervous as this was draco big chance and felt nervous for him but also because harry was also playing and she was going to have very hard not to cheer if he so happened to catch the snitch instead of draco excited severus asked as it was almost time for the match to start more like nervous for both the team captains kiara replied keeping her eyes on the field where rominisci was doing a quick check over of everything by flying round the field and the posts i cantbelieve madam hooch chose this match to be ill i heard she got food poisoning before kiara could enquire the whistle sounded and lee jordan commentary echoed round the stands time for the game to start introducing the gryffindor team whom i have fifty galleons riding on potter weasley weasley thomas finnegan bell and brown there was an eruption of cheers from the gryffindor side all dressed in the house colours of red and gold and the slytherin team malfoy pucey simmons goyle nott and two others i ve forgotten the same amount of cheering came from slytherin clad in the house colours of silver and green the two teams had shot up into the air when they had been introduced circled the pitch once and landed in their positions both captains stood facing each other rominisci in the middle both teams were glaring daggers at each other hoping on in the opposition might suddenly have a heart attack or faint but certainly not happy about the choice of referee madam hooch was a favourite but for the gryffindors it sure beat having severus as referee i want a clean game from all of you no cheating rominisci said and draco and harry shook hands although it seemed they were both out to break each other hand they let go and mounted their brooms may the best team win and they re off gryffindor is in possession of the quaffle new girls brown and weasley sure play well together with bell bell getting closer to the goal and oh no pucey has taken the quaffle weasley had better watch himself slytherin has scored ten nil cheers broke out from the slytherins only two minutes in and they had already scored for the first time in a long time slytherin stood an equal chance at beating gryffindor even with harry playing who by chance even half an hour into the game had yet to find the snitch lee jordan had tamed his tongue but he still found comments to makes that no good spawn of the devil would have knocked her clear off her broom if he came any closer or goyle is playing quite well despite his brain capacity must be because he got a smarter partner now harry was circling the field keeping above the game and keeping a lookout draco was doing the same but considerably lower than harry since he was occasionally screaming instructions at his team he was glad that it was warm and only slightly windy but the sun wasntthe greatest condition for playing and winning a game although it often made the snitch more visible as slytherin scored yet again to make it 90 80 to them harry decided to go down and see exactly what was going wrong slytherin should have been easy to beat his team was playing well it just that they kept getting veered off course by a bludger most of the time sent by dreg simmons and potter has stopped circling to come down and watch a bit of the action personally i d hate to be a seeker sitting there until you see the snitch and then plummeting how many feet bell is in possession of the quaffle and she going for it and there was the audible crunching of bones and everything went quiet dreg had aimed a bludger directly at an unsuspecting harry who was now falling through the air he landed on the grass with a thud and it took a few moments before anyone responded potter is down he been knocked off his broom by the dirty rotten idiot that is dreg simmons always hated him when i was here arrogant fatso rominisci blew his whistle and signalled for a pause in the game everyone waited for a foul to be called but none was instead he walked towards harry and crouched down to his level to those in the stands it was impossible to see what was going on hermione had already run onto the pitch to see what had happened and kiara felt a strong urge to do so would you believe it folks it seems the gryffindor seeker has been knocked out cold and why isntthe referee issuing a foul i not one to criticise teachers but there a fine line between overlooking and being blind anyone can clearly see that was a foul on potter by simmons that bludger was no accident a lot of people shared this thought and it wasntonly the gryffindors ravenclaw and hufflepuff students who had come along just in the name of school spirit were also outraged kiara was amongst the scattered few slytherins who thought the same minutes passed and rominisci still hadntstopped looking harry over shouldnthe be sent to the hospital wing or something kiara asked nervously waiting for harry to get up and shake the fall off severus frowned he hated the boy and wanted his team to win but he couldntshake the feeling that harry actually needed help professor rominisci doesntfeel so severus replied but keeping his eyes fixed firmly on the pitch both teams had come down and stood around talking to not only their fellow team members but members of the other it seemed that draco and ron were having what appeared to be a civil conversation well fuck him i have a bad feeling about this i going to see what up kiara don t blaise said also grabbing her arm at the same time as severus keeping her firmly in her seat she struggled for a bit but finding that she couldntresorted to glaring as evilly as she could without looking like she was squinting as some people ended up doing think about this very carefully i have now let me get to harry zabini you know as well severus asked his voice not revealing the twang of hurt he was feeling inside yes sir i will gladly discuss this with you afterwards however now is the time to make sure kiara doesntmake a mistake by running onto the pitch imagine how bad slytherin will look kiara snorted how bad slytherin wontlook bad for helping out a fellow student i sick of this prejudice and rivalry i d quite frankly rather shave my hair off than not do anything what is rominisci playing at lee jordan voice boomed through the stadium potter has been down for at least five minutes but he is showing no intentions of sending him to the hospital wing or giving that foul if i knew better i would never say that i think that rominisci may just want potter dead there were loud gasps and kiara took this as a chance to wrench herself out of their holds stepping on blaise foot to get him to let go of her completely as fast as her feet would carry her she was on that pitch her heart pounding in her chest and pushing rominisci out of the way blood was oozing coming from a cut on harry head and she could see he had broken several bones and rominisci had nothing about what exactly are you doing kiara shouted at rominisci who was watching her with quite an amused look on his face he could die you dumb prick and there you are just standing there as if it ll stop the bleeding and fix his bones ignoring the fact that she had just lost slytherin fifty points kiara tried to remember what madam pomfrey had taught her in the few weeks she had been in the hospital that summer and whenever she went for a check up as madam pomfrey had insisted on keeping a regular check on kiara temperature first she had to stop the bleeding a simple spell could do that waving her wand that she had retrieved from her inside pocket kiara groaned with frustration when it didntwork in fact all the spells she tried didntwork what the ever so perfect kiara snape cantfix his little cuts rominisci said sarcastically kiara glared at him quite annoyed actually he knew it wouldntwork but he had let her try anyway therefore wasting time you should have asked i would have told you what is going on potter is still down and i am informed that kiara snape is down there but i can hardly believe it to help there probably an ulterior motive if she anything like her father dearest i am definitely praying hard for potter i mean it is a good thing to see someone from slytherin helping a gryffindor happy professor searching her mind for something that would help harry kiara also transfigured her scarf into a gauze and from the first aid kit needed at every quidditch match took out a cleansing balm kiara almost cried when it did nothing but clean up the surrounding area on harry head wound but not stop the bleeding all together and there was still the issue of the broken bones it would be unsafe to even transfer him onto a stretcher hermione kiara called out hermione immediately crouched down to kiara level waiting to hear kiara request i need you to tell me what my body temperature is not exactly but something like hot cool normal whatever hermione touched kiara arm and by instinct immediately withdrew her hand you re burning hot hermione said kiara thanked her and began wondering if what she was about to do was either smart safe or worth her energy deciding that it was kiara concentrated and placed a hand on harry forehead the effect was instant the moment her skin met his she felt as if all her energy was being zapped out of her but right before her eyes the skin began to heal up until there was nothing more than a very faint scar going from his hairline to his brow and she could have sworn his bones seemed to straighten out when it was done kiara fell backwards onto the grass feeling very tired and parched she had just partially saved her own life and what is this potter is getting up everyone potter is up did kiara snape have anything to do with it sources tell me she did well what do you know the world is coming to an end now professor rominisci about that foul thanks harry smiled as he pulled kiara onto her feet she could at least stand which wasnta bad thing kiara smiled back and for once didntcare what draco thought who was looking at them with a very deep scowl on his face especially as she leant on harry for a little support how do you know i did anything kiara asked innocently because after i was knocked out i kept hearing this voice going if you dontwake up harry when i die i am going to haunt you forever and there is only one person who would be thinking like that well perhaps i was a touch dramatic harry snorted kiara was one of the most dramatic people he had met she punched him playfully but he didntget a chance to retort before draco came marching up to them kiara tensed a great deal i dontwant to hear it kiara we ll discuss this after the match draco said as kiara was about to say something he turned to harry and for a fleeting moment kiara got the feeling he was going to punch him but instead draco held out a hand maybe it time for that truce you were talking about gladly the world has come to an end first potter and snape daughter and if rumour is true they are now a couple and now potter and malfoy are shaking hands the good old slytherin and gryffindor feud has come to an end seems ravenclaw and hufflepuff are joining in too am i the only one who hasntforgotten this is meant to be a quidditch match professor rominisci both teams agree that simmons did send that bludger on purpose therefore i replacing him with crabbe and the gryffindor team get a free pass draco said to rominisci who seemed to consider this for a moment before mounting his broom and shaking his head carry on rominisci shouted blowing his whistle there was immediate outrage in the stands someone started stomping whilst shouting foul foul and soon everyone present was doing the same i still cantsee what this man is doing he is insisting that they carry on professor do something what do you mean you can t it up to the referee you have lost your bloody mind there is going to be a riot if you dontdo something look even professor snape is going down there at his team request dontjust sit there rominisci touched down as he watched both the professors approaching he touched down with a small smile on his face looking extremely arrogant despite the situation before speaking both mcgonagall and severus nodded and shook hands even if rather hastily to show that they too were calling a truce minerva severus what can i do for you on this glorious morning he said cheerfully enough to make severus wish he could strangle his younger see i afraid i a bit busy i have no idea what going on but if i were you damien i would just issue that foul and get on with the game mcgonagall said sharply racked up that it was her star player and captain that the team had almost lost but keeping her temper in quite close check sorry no can do what do you mean no can do can you not see that they arentgoing to calm down until you do something about it severus added personally not bothered that harry had been knocked off his broom what did bother him though was that now everyone knew about kiara and harry and that it was their fault he now had to be civil towards mcgonagall i am doing something i giving both the teams a choice either decide to call it a draw or play on never thought i d say this but i think i might hate rominisci more than snape and i am being quite serious rominisci has decided that it either a draw or they carry on playing even with the truce called how on earth are they going to decide i say we carry on playing but let gryffindor take a few easy shots before we carry on pucey suggested flicking his dark blonde hair out of his eyes as both the teams huddled hermione and kiara were the only others on the pitch standing by their house hermione standing by harry and kiara by draco yeah right we could take those easy shots without you letting us i say we draw that way it fair ron suggested quite a surprise for most people ron would have usually been the one doing anything to stop them from drawing harry had a feeling hermione presence had something to do with it i say we take advice from those who would rather be reading than playing quidditch their advice wontbe biased harry suggested it took kiara awhile to realise he was talking about her and hermione she didntknow anything about quidditch but kiara also thought it only fair if they drew draw kiara and hermione both said simultaneously kiara smiled and allowed hermione to continue with her theory to why it should be a draw rather than carrying on look at it this way we ve gained a lot more from this match we all actually managed a civil conversation with no wands pointed or anything like that we united against rominisci just like the sorting hat wanted us to do against our deadliest foes continuing the game might ruin that granger has a point and actually one that i can understand draco said after awhile of thinking harry nodded in agreement all in favour of this say i the majority said i an almost equal number on both sides all against say nay there were considerably less and their nay faded away as their team members turned to scowl at them it all over people the match is over a draw has been called putting slytherin and gryffindor both in the first place let just hope the next match the one between hufflepuff and ravenclaw isntthe same or i definitely will not be quitting my day job for this and where professor flitwick i want my money back later harry kiara said as the teams began making their way back to the changing rooms harry stopped and turned to her his arms wide open and a cheeky grin on his face this would be their first public embrace later kiara he said as he drew her into a hug god he loved her shampoo pulling apart kiara waved him off a happy feeling in her stomach she felt like she could shout it from the rooftops harry potter was hers all hers and hers alone well for the moment anyway i hope you know what you just did blaise nagged as she walked over to him where he was waiting in the stands they had become sort of best friends as kiara was probably the only person blaise talked to about almost everything he talked to draco when it cam to male issues and blaise was the only person in slytherin who seemed to look past her surname yet still take account of it apart from end a really old and pointless feud yes apart from that kiara frowned what did i do you just made yourself a potential target for the dark lord he might use you to get to potter you know what i think about your brilliant thinking kiara asked as leaning on blaise for support as they made their way back to the castle what kiara i hate it to bits a n yay truce and thanks for the reviews guys made my day and encouraged me to update d the question still stands should kiara help harry help old voldie or destroy them both and my chapter will also become considerably shorter so i can update them in a much faster way than i did previously well thanks for reading and until next time the dark lady of r just kiara to make the end of the feud official hermione came up with a brilliant idea the week after that memorable match every person in every year and in every house signed a book and made a comment so that november 1996 would be remembered as the year that really made a difference in hogwarts history with this out of the way changes took place hogwarts was generally a happier place to be now it was surprising to see some people even talking to each other it was still too early for slytherins to be interacting with hufflepuffs since a majority were muggle born but their interaction with gryffindor was getting better especially one of their own dating the most gryffindor person on earth harry potter the one person that hadntnoticed that people were getting over grudges was professor damien rominisci kiara was constantly badgering severus to let her drop the subject but he would never let her finish grovelling when she started going but dad in a rather whiny voice he and rominisci never saw eye to eye on a lot of things and sometimes arguments in the staffroom got ugly but nothing physical ever happened it was halfway during the month when the cold weather was making everyone snappier than they usually were that snape finally snapped and let himself get angry as kiara and everyone else for that matter stepped into the potions classroom they stopped in their tracks to stare someone had put up an artificial window so that light poured in air freshener had certainly been used and someone else was sitting behind severus desk scribbling something down long dirty blonde fringe covering his face when he looked up though kiara almost fainted i professor vexus ripley and i will be your potions teacher for the next month looking through your record mr snape it is a wonder we even allowed you to take kiara into your care gail hemlock a rather short and skinny ministry social worker informed severus looking at him over her square glasses which were neatly balance her nose severus said nothing keeping his face blank first he had to deal with the governors for the school and now this woman former death eater records of several bouts of anger a recent ban fromst mungo shospital after kiara was admitted and now you are involved in a petty brawl with a fellow colleague you forget ms hemlock that despite that i am classed as a good father i have a steady income to support all her needs i am there to give her the emotional support she may need and we have got on well from the beginning severus replied forcing him to smile slightly he needed to if he was to keep kiara it says here that the first time she was admitted into a hospital it was at st mungo and her body was covered in several bruises you failed to mention them when you were adopting her i was never asked about that therefore i didntfeel the need to mention it when i took her into my care she only really knew her name her date of birth and that she didntwant to go back to where she had come from i ask no questions ms hemlock unless necessary are you willing to take veritaserum to support your case i afraid i allergic and before you ask so is kiara the woman tutted and scribbled down something i still dontunderstand why you chose to adopt her instead of taking her to an orphanage you seem like an intolerant man mr snape did you not even think of doing a blood test to see if her parents could be found that way severus hesitated at the time it hadntcrossed his mind but ever since he had found out whom her parents were that was all he could think about sometimes he took pictures of himself and kiara taken outside in the snape mansion gardens and charmed them to fit william brentwood face in his space and he just couldntsee the similarity to himself he saw in kiara william brentwood looked nothing like kiara no i adopted her because i wanted to there were no ulterior motives as you so seem to believe severus said finally letting his features soften as much as they could there was a time to be snape and then there was a time to be severus however his severus side made no difference to hemlock prejudice if i let every man who said that me get away with adopting a girl with no proper research especially older ones then i wouldnthave my job she replied quite spitefully she scribbled down some notes and then opened a drawer behind her desk severus felt the wild urge to fidget because he was feeling very nervous for various reasons but kept still i would like kiara to keep a diary i will want to see parts of it in a few months but i have an exact duplicate which allows you to know what she thinking and what going in her life that way it benefits all of us does she have a choice unless she wishes to be put in an orphanage then no she does not severus took the small leather bound books the woman handed him and pocketed them having access to kiara thoughts would be useful but the fact that hemlock would see them didntmake it better he was developing a dislike for the woman i would advise her not to tell her you can see it it might not bode well ms hemlock i not sure whether you are doing it tenaciously but you have been insulting me all afternoon do i really look that stupid to you kiara blaise whispered halfway through vexus introduction speech hmm kiara answered not paying much attention to her slytherin friend her stomach was tightening with every word the man that stood in front of her was saying her thoughts going way beyond the speed limit and her throat thoroughly parched you re burning me sorry kiara immediately let go of blaise she hadntrealised she had been holding on to his hand nor had she noticed her temperature had gone up actually she wasntsurprised it had she was incredibly stressed at the moment and she had good reason to be vexus was now leaning on the table appearing like the nice normal substitute teacher kiara knew perfectly well he wasn t i went to school with professor snape i not going to sugar coat things but he was hardly an agreeable person to be with and he hasntchanged much he a perfectionist and can be down right horrible vexus explained he had already won over gryffindors hatred for the potions master usually meant something however he is so for a reason he wants you to learn and take in the fact that potions is not an art that comes naturally except to very few and he wants you to thrive to get better than he predicts you will he wants to be proved wrong imagine how it is for a man of his excellence to be teaching a bunch of twits not that any of you are of course kiara just couldntbelieve severus could have done this to her vexus ripley at hogwarts what next her father vexus didntreact to her name in any special way as he called out the register not did he look at her for longer than he did anyone else this meant that he knew exactly who she was with and where she was even before getting together with harry she had been a walking target and not noticed it since i going to be here until christmas i might as well learn your names we re going to go round the classroom and you re going to say one truth and one lie about yourselves that way i ll associate all that with your faces and so on and it a good way to pass time i actually have no intention of teaching today my name is susan bones i a brunette and i an excellent chess player she was in fact a blonde and despite the stereotypes of hufflepuff she had even beat ron at a game of wizard chess every single person in the class took part and gladly so it beat brewing some potion the truths were light things like owning an owl being able to speak languages and so on whilst the lies got more and more eccentric as they went round seamus said he was in fact half human and at half moon he transformed into a girl kiara laughed along but when blaise had just finished introducing himself he was a slytherin and he enjoyed socialising and it was draco turn kiara couldntthink of anything to say the name draco malfoy i extremely vain but i would gladly be caught wearing second hand robes it was now kiara turn taking a deep breath she spoke you all know i kiara snape i love lemon drops and i keeper for the england team snape what relation are you to professor snape vexus asked curiously kiara was the last person to introduce herself and she wished she wasn t everyone turned to look at her for some witty comment or other it was obvious to them the relation even if they hadntknown kiara i have been cursed with having professor snape as a father dontask how i deal with it i just extremely tolerable kiara smiled slipping into her perfect slytherin act which she now didntreally need to wear blaise recognised it from miles kiara just knew blaise did daughter i never saw professor snape as a family man he certainly isn t i should know there was an awkward silence as dark green and black eyes met kiara wanted to know what was going through his mind breaking away he suddenly smiled and looked around the class i want you all to make name tags in this class all different colours i will supply cards but i trusting you all know how to make ink if you finish that before the end of the lesson then proceed in colouring your textbooks or parchment just have fun with that vexus sat down behind severus desk and began scribbling away again kiara didntknow what was unnerving her more the fact that vexus was there or the fact that he was there and putting on an excellent act nice easy going person indeed he was either competing with rominisci for teacher of the year award or doing so to annoy kiara what going on blaise inquired once the classroom had filled with enough sound to cover a whispered conversation kiara shrugged she could hardly tell blaise if she had yet to tell harry actually she doubted she would be telling him any time soon unless she wanted him to go charging and knocking the daylight out of professor ripley you donttell and i will find something to blackmail you with and i d rather not i dontknow what you mean i think you do the whole snape daughter thing and how you gasped when you saw his face it like you know him i do if he knows my father how can i not know him then how did he not know who you were complicated story which cannot and will not be told in the middle of a potions class with both hermione granger and draco malfoy ear wigging you always suck the fun out life kiara draco said settling back in the chair as he had been leaning over to hear what was going on in the conversation kiara smiled it genetic i canthelp it kiara what are you doing camped out in front of my quarters severus asked as he came back after his fifth and final meeting with someone he would rather bury six feet under kiara looked up from her transfiguration homework due tomorrow morning and with a click of her fingers the books flew into her bag it was a neat spell pansy had taught her a month ago and it had taken her that long for her to be able to do it just like that with her wand and without saying it wandless magic waiting for you and the restricted area has been open since halloween i d be a fool not to explore my magic a bit further kiara replied getting off the hard marble floor it certainly wasntthe most comfortable place to sit she should have transfigured one of her quills into a cushion why didntyou just wait inside because salazar wontlet me in he still upset about something i did weeks ago and is refusing to let me in without the password why did you need to talk to me severus asked helping with her bag it was the least he could do she said nothing as she followed him into his quarters but just as his backside hit the sofa she began her explanation to exactly why she had been sitting outside his quarters the past four hours she had even missed dinner pardon my language but i have no other way to voice this what the fuck are you playing at vexus ripley vexus fucking ripley the same vexus whose been threatening me the same vexus ripley who killed bill how could you do this to me donttalk to me like that kiara why shouldnti give me one good reason why i shouldn t you failed to inform me he would be replacing you whilst you got yourself into a fight with rominisci and you knew that we had a history i said donttalk to me like that kiara i have had a very bad day mostly because of you dontmake it worse it not like you ll do anything you wontspeak to me for a month and then i ll worm my way back into your good books i know you severus sighed kiara was right she had him wrapped around her little finger and figured out to her advantage after almost six months of knowing each other it was to be expected and there was something about kiara perhaps it was her ability to seem innocent despite that she had probably lost most of her innocence that she had left when she had done the magic bond with harry she certainly hadntbeen the same since then first of all her mouth had become a nuisance with her constant swearing her temper was unpredictable and she was extremely melodramatic so i have i ve been given the chance to send you to an orphanage and since i obviously cantcope with you are you serious do i look anything less than serious kiara you need to learn not to abuse any power you might have had a meeting with one gail hemlock your social worker one owl and you could be out of my care and into vexus if i so bad i hate you sometimes tell that to the diary severus said throwing the diary at her and she caught it examining it with a confused look on her face hemlock seems to think you need to keep a diary for some reason so for the last month of the six months she wants you to write in it daily why because she still wontbelieve you re a happy teenager who loves her father dearly and that i can look after you properly she says it ll help you keep emotions in check kiara raised an eyebrow dumbledore mentioned something i didn t she muttered something which severus chose to ignore but was glad as she sat down calming something always managed to bring her crashing back to her humble beginnings severus didntknow if that was a bad or a good thing kiara had a lot of weaknesses harry severus harry her friends harry and her past she hugged her knees and severus was instantly reminded of the scared teenage girl he had adopted not so long ago all quiet and her large black eyes ever staring waiting for something are we calm now severus asked although it was pretty obvious she nodded anyway and didntsay anything just in case she got carried away sometimes freedom of speech wasntalways a good thing good now vexus is on your side he been leading brentwood to believe that you re currently in manchester god knows how he managed to do that but he has but why honestly kiara i may be a legilimens but i dontknow the ins and outs of this man brain ask him yourself kiara knocked nervously on the office door she had never been nervous when entering that office before because it was severus until his suspension was lifted vexus would be using it kiara wasntwhat you call delighted about that for one it meant that vexus would be there for quite awhile and second of all it also meant that on wednesdays kiara couldntoversleep and use the office as a shortcut to potions come in pushing the door open nervously kiara grimaced at the changes that had taken place sunlight streamed in from yet another artificial window and the office had lost severus dark touch vexus sat behind the desk scribbling away at something this man was always scribbling his dirty blonde hair falling into his face contrasting terribly with his pale skin he looked up as kiara closed the door behind her and smiled miss snape i thought i might be seeing you he said cheerfully kiara simply stared at him wondering if that really was the vexus ripley that had nearly killed her in september there was no point beating around the bush and kiara got straight to the point why why what why are you here i thought it would have been obvious i here to teach i covering for professor snape whilst he suspended load of bullshit there some other motive and i want to know what it is ten points from slytherin please refrain from using such language in my presence fuck shit bullshit fuck shit fucking shitty bullshit shitty bull kiara said ticking off her fingers every time she used a profanity vexus crossed his arms frowning slightly if you re taking ten points for each swearword then that a ninety points off slytherin right professor ripley are you aware that you ve just lost slytherin a hundred points in the space of two minutes yes i am not as stupid as i lead people to believe i am you could have fooled me kiara clenched her fist and stared at the man looking back at her calmly no trace of anger anywhere just perhaps annoyance he gestured for her to take a seat and she did so taking slow deep breaths to keep her mouth shut he was obviously not one to be provoked into talking kiara should have known that then again when she had been under his care she had been too scared to try and provoke him kiara jumped slightly as the door locked with a loud click and vexus waved his wand several times probably placing charms around the room now you are calm perhaps you want to ask again kiara why are you here sir kiara repeated politely a contrast to her previous demand he smirked and kiara finally recognised the vexus she knew a knowing almost arrogant look in his eyes he got up from behind his seat and leaned on the table standing in directly in front of kiara i am here because severus thought it wise i taught here and here i can keep an eye on you make sure your mouth doesntrun any more than it already has i knew you werenton my side liar on the contrary kiara i am on your side kiara snorted i may not show it but if i wasnti would have dragged you back home at the first opportunity i got i am here to stop you from doing anything that will anger your father any more than he already is he has plans for you and they will stay good only if you are good i not coming home kiara stated crossing her arms defiantly you are a rude little madam these days severus been too soft on you severus has been acting like a father should do i ll take that as a yes his misplaced mollycoddling has destroyed you kiara vexus said getting up and passing around the room you are pathetic weak and extremely rude when your father gets his hands on you you wontbe ready says who says the person who watched you cry out only a few months ago at a little cruciatus not even a quarter of a minute long this is coming from the person who watched you ask whether i was going to kill you like a weak little nobody why are you even bothering because i promised your mother i d do everything to look out for you if your father didn t and if reminding you of where your place is is what it takes i will definitely do so if removing you from severus care is all takes then i will do so kiara remember who you are i am kiara snape no you are kiara brentwood and will always be you re wrong kiara replied but she was saying it to stop the feeling of fear she had shed over the past month creep slowly back into her heart hogwarts and severus had given her a false sense of security now the real world was coming back she felt lost and hopeless with no one to turn to no one that she thought would understand i have no intention of writing my most inner thoughts in this diary i have no intention of retelling all that happens during the day however i have every intentions of recording my feelings about a lot of things today i felt angry at whom i felt angry at severus for not telling me he was being suspended but not rominisci who started the whole fight something about him knowing better than to indulge in physical violence rominisci is an idiot i dontknow why he hates me i dontknow why he hates the snape name in general he says it with so much hatred part of me thinks he jealous but the rational non slytherin part tells me we might have done something unaware to make him feel this way i dontremember maybe that first school day in september i really had been irrational i dontknow any more i dontknow anything any more all i know is that i ve got to give up and stop pretending give up being a snape and go back to being kiara just kiara a n my best work but it had to come out and all the diary entries kiarawrites will be written in italics and they should appear in the next few chapters thanks for reading and thanks to all that reviewed my last chapter i doing my best to use that reply feature so if you have a question feel free to ask the majority feel that kiara should help harry do you agree run in with a father miss snape please stay behind rominisci said over the clatter of books and the scraping of chairs as his sixth year newt class packed away talking about the announcement of mock examinations at the end of term the only that wasntworried or showed any emotion towards the news was kiara who had shown no enthusiasm or sarcasm in over two weeks now and he was starting to get worried he watched as harry gave her a quick kiss reminding her that he had quidditch practice followed by a detention with mcgonagall and not to wait up for him only then did she smile but she was still a shadow of her former self rominisci also noticed that blaise zabini pulled harry aside as they walked out of the classroom together kiara came to the front of the class and stood in front of his desk yes professor kiara asked rather bored she had after all been doing this since september kiara waited for a snotty remark or a series of detentions for some crime she had apparently committed none came he just looked at her taking in her once again thin frame and how she used her long black hair to hide behind although she could hardly hide the fact that her face was looking gaunt miss snape is something the matter he asked genuinely concerned his brow creasing an unusual feature for the young man he was usually all smiles and grins it was like nothing stopped him from just bouncing back she snorted why did you for one minute believe that i would tell you if something was wrong you do amuse me one minute you spend the whole time insulting my family name get my father suspended and the next you re concerned really professor i expected more from you and so did i whatever problem you re having you re not hiding them very well are you one minute you re miss popular slytherin with the boy who lived on her arm and the next you re miss almost dead pardon me if i even a little worried you donthave to be i ve just been ill the last two weeks my condition and everything it was part of the truth ever since the day that vexus had reminded her that there were some things severus couldntprotect her from she d stop fighting fighting the darkness that threatened her every night as it had seemed manageable before now harry nightmares fears and hurt seemed too much as well as hers severus and harry had both noticed of course but kiara couldnthelp thinking that it was because she was back to the kiara that they had known before vulnerable dependent someone who didntargue back constantly does madam pomfrey know she busy dealing with pre winter colds besides it not the physical side of my condition it the mental mostly how so i told you i wasntgoing to tell you what wrong so can i please get out of here rominisci let kiara go but as he ran a hand through his hair he couldnthelp smiling if only slightly kiara had dropped the pretence and so he could he when he found the chance the only thing that worried him was how she seemed both mentally and physically whatever she said today rominisci asked me if anything was the matter and i felt confused i told him there wasntof course because there isn t i going through a rough patch that all besides i have severus and harry by me whether i need a shoulder to cry on someone to hold me tight and tell me everything going to be alright they re there severus i love him dearly like a daughter would love a father i really do i miss making him tear his hair out though at times it was funny harry i dontknow if i love him i wontlet myself blaise asked me to promise to not fall in love with him i never agreed but i never declined either i not going to let myself fall in love just yet at least not until i absolutely sure of my feelings love is a strong word sometimes i wonder if my mother was still alive if she would have loved me would she take care of me and hold me tight whenever i had nightmares or would she push me away think of me as scum sometimes i just wish i knew rain pound on the windowsill droplets falling down the window mingling with others to make a stream that slowly made its way to the bottom kiara watched the grey sky her eyes seeming grey from the reflection of the outside hugging her knees and waiting for the day to end she had been sitting there since morning and she was pretty sure it was some time around two in the afternoon kiara had heard the usual bustle of student as they made their way to lunch and it was now a few hours after that she currently occupied to the window seat blaise had introduced to her a few months back september felt such a long way ago now they had entered the month of december surprisingly she and blaise had made a close friendship it was close to what she had with harry but different if harry was her boyfriend blaise was her best friend it was a saturday and whilst she would usually be with harry she had chosen to hide out here all day with blaise being the only one who knew where she might be this was because today was the day the candidates for the minister of magic position would be making a stop at hogwarts to boost their campaign it had been whittled down from three to just the two men percy weasley and william brentwood severus had refused to let her hide away in his quarters just in case william wanted to discuss something with him her room was an obvious place and vexus was still unrelenting in saying that she was weak she should be able to stand up to him by now a whole month of his pestering had really done nothing kiara just clammed up if it isntlittle kiara kiara froze at the voice she could recognise it anywhere it was in her dreams it preyed on her mind it never left her memories she started breathing again and counted ten bristling as she sensed him edge forwards before turning around to face him kiara had never wished for funeral more than at that moment william brentwood stood towering over her even when she stood politely and he seemed to have acquired a much deeper tan than that kiara had known growing up apart from that he hadntreally changed he was still handsome and looked nothing like her kiara wondered how he had found her the trophy room was closed off for cleaning kiara had got in by luck and no candidates were meant to wander off as far as she knew even if they were how had he known she would be here not even a hello or a hug it been so long it only been six months father kiara replied for the first time being able to speak whilst looking directly into his eyes six months away from him had done her some good at least even if this was all it was i didntthink you d miss me what father doesntmiss their daughter when she runs away the kind that has come close to killing them many times before said kiara bitterly what are you doing in here i thought you would be out there persuading students to persuade their parents to vote for you i was doing that until it came to my knowledge that a certain kiara snape was currently studying at hogwarts i thought i would check it out and imagine how surprised i was to see you sitting here you ve grown you know that maybe it because they feed me brentwood chuckled my you are so bitter these days and here i was hoping we could put the past behind us and start all over again be like a family i have a family you re not part of it the smile that had been on brentwood face fell and was replaced by a look kiara only knew too well anger an intimidating anger but she was not going to let him win not now before she had quaked at any mention of him but now he stood there and she realised she wasntutterly petrified of him perhaps a little scared and it gave her the lift she had needed gentle but effective i think you ll find you have no choice in the matter especially once i become minister of magic severus wontmatter because i ll have him put in azkaban and you i think you ll sell for a pretty high price as a play toy over my dead body kiara spat and almost regretted it when the sharp backhanded blow jerked her head to the side it stung considerably since it was the first time in quite awhile she had been physically assaulted over my dead bruised broken body if i outsmarted you once what makes you think i wontdo it again kiara was sent to her knees by a blow to the stomach followed by a sharp kick to her shins she didnthave time to breathe before she was knocked properly to the floor rolling onto her back in pain she tried and failed to dodge the kicks reigning down on her kiara was pretty sure several ribs had broken but was grateful he wasntusing the cruciatus probably to remain undetected dumbledore wasntas omniscient as he made himself out to be there was a moment that was long enough to allow her to take a shallow breath before she was dragged onto her feet her father was still able to throw her around effortlessly the wall became her enemy as brentwood slammed her into the wall his hand firmly around her throat and pushing her into the said enemy cocky little bitches such as you always get their comeuppance he whispered as he was so close to her face kiara but she refused to open her eyes she wouldntbe shocked if she couldn t she felt like she was dying every part of her body ached i guess we do kiara replied only to get any wind remaining knocked out of her by a knee to the stomach she grimaced in pain but right now her mouth was ruling over any brain that hadntbeen turned to mush there is only one way to get me to leave you well and truly alone kiara join the dark lord ranks and it will prove to me that you re not a weakling all you have to do is become a death eater once and for all how do i know i can trust you you have my word and unless in extreme cases i take my word seriously i d rather be a play toy than join them you have until january to either become a death eater or prepare to come home have a nice day kiara letting go kiara slid to the floor and opening her eyes watched him walk away not once did he turn back he wasntgoing to get help she knew that doing the best she could kiara dragged herself to the window seat and lay down blaise would come when he noticed she didntturn up to dinner when she had said she would right now she was so tired all she wanted to do was sleep closing her eyes kiara let the darkness wash over her a small smile of triumph on her face she had faced up to her father he could never scare her as he had once done ever again that didntstop the dreams though a n shortest chapter to date i do believe i had to give you something though thank you all for reading and thanks to those that reviewed the last chapter review this one as well d written the next few chapters so i will have them up asap and about the whole which side should kiara choose ting it seems a lot of people are in favour of harry i dontknow i think i might make kiara side with voldemort just to see how it turns out well thanks again for reading and leave a review if you can the dark lady of r a pawn in this game decided to wake up kiara slowly opened her eyes blinking a few times to adjust to the bright clinical light the smell of antiseptic filled her nose and she knew she was in the hospital wing having spent part of her summer there she felt groggy as if waking up from an extremely long sleep and although she knew where she was she felt extremely disorientated true to fashion severus was dressed in all black something he always was when she woke up after some ordeal or another she noted he had evidently not shaved in days and had not had his hair cut recently it was long enough for him to have a fringe that almost fell into his eyes he looked ill dark bags under his eyes as if he had not slept properly in days knowing severus he probably hadn t i don t feel too well kiara managed to croak surprised at how her own throat refused to cooperate with her it felt dry and scratchy as if somebody was rubbing sandpaper on her throat with every word she said i wouldntexpect you to especially not in the state you were in severus replied his eyes darkening kiara frowned she couldntreally remember much of what had happened before she woke sure she remembered dreams those were hard to forget but events that took place when she was conscious that would be tricky what happened you dontremember kiara shook her head but instantly wished she hadn t it felt like her brain had disconnected itself and hit the side of her skull whenever she moved it hurt that much i was hoping you could tell me what happened severus snape what the hell do you think you are playing at kiara winced madam pomfrey voice at the moment was extremely painful severus rolled his eyes having known the bothersome matron for almost all of his life this is the reason why i never allow visitors you are all intent on abusing my kind nature the next time you ask me if you can stay in here by her side i will point blank refuse i was just leaving severus replied seeing that madam pomfrey looked extremely wound up perhaps it was the fact that at the moment kiara was her most critical patient colds were hardly life threatening he kissed kiara on the forehead i ll be back later alright kiara watched his retreating back wishing he would stay with her even if only to hold her hand or just be there his presence was comforting her attention snapped back to madam pomfrey as she drew the curtains around the bed sharply and began to slowly roll off the blanket covering kiara body she shivered slightly as cold hit her bare arms and legs but wasntsurprised to see the fading marks where bruises had once been child why do you do this to yourself if you had only told me you werentfeeling well then maybe you wouldnthave fallen down the stairs and done this to yourself she ranted whilst applying a stinging lotion to both kiara arms and legs just look at you all skin and bones you werenteating i suppose felt too hot so you werentkeeping yourself wrapped up either you could have died i sorry kiara said seeing that madam pomfrey did care about her well being and wasntsimply doing her job however kiara was sure she would have remembered falling down stairs or it would ring a bell in her memory somewhere she did know what the older woman was going on about with the not eating and the not wrapping up how could she eat when she threw up afterwards or how could she wrap up when that only made her temperature soar just dontdo that to your father ever again i dontknow if you notice but every time you get hurt he hurts as well he obviously loves you very much especially since he spent the past week sleeping on that very chair next to your bed bless his soul refused to leave your side in case you woke up and he wasntthere apparently he always there when you wake up yes always well you should count yourself lucky not many people are loved by their father as much as yours loves you i d have done anything for my father to have lived to give me as much affection as severus does kiara felt a new level of respect for madam pomfrey she wasntjust the very annoying and suffocating head healer she genuinely cared about her patients and more often than not if they came in here more than once she got to know them slowly but surely madam pomfrey obviously cared about severus if she was telling kiara all of this i certainly hope you arenttaking it for granted he might not always be there when you wake up madam pomfrey applied the last of the lotion and put the covers back over kiara all done sleep now and when you wake up we ll see about getting some food in you drinking down the potion tipped into her mouth with any protest kiara felt consciousness leave her and give way to the darkness that unless she had just been given a dreamless sleeping potion would soon twist into her latest nightmare dad dad where are you kiara called out as she searched the highs and lows of snape manor for severus but could not find him he wasntin his study he wasntin his room he wasntin the library he wasntin the gardens he was nowhere to be found and she felt as if she had been looking for hours check your room a portrait behind her called out causing kiara to jump whirling around kiara saw it was a portrait of her mother kiara tried to edge nearer but she shook her head go to your room check your room doing as instructed kiara walked briskly along the corridors trying to find the painting of the garden that hung immediately outside her door her brisk walk turned into a run running up stairs and along corridors hoping to find her room finally she came to her room panting a stitch in her side as soon as the knob was turned she heard screams from within her room walking in she had to adjust to the dim lighting of the room the only thing giving off light were the candles on the walls and those threw eerie shadows around more than they gave off light again she jumped as the door slammed shut behind her and the lock clicked in the centre of her room was a circle of people all in long robes and white masks laughing as somebody in the middle screamed braving it kiara edged forward surprised she hadntbeen detected yet she was almost close enough to see who was in the middle when a death eater that what she supposed they all were grabbed her and threw her into the middle no stop it kiara shouted as she saw just who they were torturing severus screamed once more his back arching as pain seemingly passed through him she knew what the cruciatus at maximum notch felt like kiara got down on her knees before the one who had pushed her in the middle i beg of you please stop pathetic how you have grown weak kiara you should be laughing laughing at this pathetic excuse for a wizard calls himself a man laughable the man laughed before lowering his hood and removing his mask vexus ripley join us kiara laugh and be one of us again you will never be like him you will never have double loyalties your heart wontlet you it never will never show me your are no weakling and laugh the man did as vexus had done and revealed himself william brentwood all the while severus screams intertwined with the laughter of the two men laugh laugh so that you never fall in love with me laugh so that you can never lose me show me you can never be a gryffindor like me laugh and show me i deserve better the hood fell and another mask was taken off harry potter tears were now streaming down kiara face she was helpless there was nothing she could do to stop the torture there was only one person left masked and hooded there was only one chance left on her knees begged once more just to put severus out of his pain i will do anything just please stop it there was a high pitched laughter that echoed through the room everything was silent as that could be heard was the laughter the last person revealed their face kiara gasped as the blood red eyes bore into her own join me never then he dies the monster raised his wand and with a flash of green light severus no longer stopped twitching or crying out in pain he couldntanyway he was dead shooting upright and panting for air kiara shook beads of sweat trickling down her forehead and into her eyes not used to such an action her arms gave way and she collapsed onto the pillows grateful that they werenttoo low it was the first time in weeks she had dreamt about losing severus seeing the dark lord in her dreams was nothing new but this was it was just a dream nothing but a stupid dream kiara mumbled to herself still trying to regulate her breathing looking around kiara noticed that the lights had been substantially dimmed and if it wasntfor the lamp on her bedside she wouldnthave been able to see past the foot of her bed looking to her right she saw the man in question sleeping in what looked like an extremely uncomfortable chair he would damage his back taking a deep breath kiara hoped to clear her mind enough to try and figure out what the dream might mean one thing was obvious her priorities needed a bit of ironing out she still shook as she thought how she had chosen her freedom over severus life how could she possibly have done that even in a dream she was certain severus would do anything for her if he ever happened to be in the position she had been in kiara considered telling him she loved him at least that way if she were to lose him tomorrow he would know that she loved him yes that was exactly what she would do about the people that had been in the circle she didntknow what to do harry was a constant worry so it was only natural for him to be there vexus was forever nagging her about her weakness and her father it was weird his words rang a bell as if she had heard them only recently and the dark lord she had never been offered to join him in her dreams why did it occur now awake severus voice startled kiara out of her thoughts she turned to him and smiled weakly he looked tired as she nodded severus stretched himself out of the chair probably to prevent a stiff neck in the morning it was a wonder to kiara how he managed to sleep in a hardback chair without being in pain i had a nightmare kiara stated as severus sat next to her on the bed so that she could lean against him madam pomfrey healing skills were almost miraculous kiara felt way better than she had felt that morning or as it afternoon she had no idea what time or day it was about what happened kiara frowned didnti fall down the stairs that what we told madam pomfrey severus explained zabini found you in the trophy room battered but living you ve been out all week i was hoping you could shed some light on who gave you a few broken bones and obviously used you as a punch bag wait did blaise tell you why i was in the trophy room in the first place hiding apparently kiara thought hard an image of sitting in the trophy room was coming to mind she remembered it being in the weekend or she wouldnthave dared skip classes it had been raining because she had watched the small streams of rain form on the window it had been comforting knowing she was by herself and had time to think kiara remembered thinking about hiding from someone someone she didntwant to face somebody she really wanted to avoid father kiara whispered her eyes widening at the revelation it was becoming clear now there was only one person after all who knew how to beat her enough so that she felt the pain but survived and he was a candidate for minister of magic it made sense that he would have been visiting hogwarts so you remember not really i remember pain that quite obvious and he said something or other i cantremember right now did he make a proposition to you severus enquired even more he had an inkling to what had happened to her and knew what brentwood visit had really been about but kiara remembering it for herself would come a little less as a shock if she panicked madam pomfrey would have his head i think so he wanted me to come home or something i really dontremember severus sighed and kissed the top of her head i afraid that wasntthe only thing he wants you to join the dark lord or go back home and i said no the dream made more sense to kiara now kiara didntreally have a choice it was either join or lose severus and she would rather join the dark lord and become a death eater rather than have to leave severus taking a deep breath kiara turned to severus i not leaving you now is not the time to decide and be stubborn about it sleep on it no kiara shook her head much to severus displeasure i not leaving you and that final for once in you life kiara stop being so obstinate and listen to me severus said his dark eyes boring into kiara similar ones if you do what i believe you are thinking of doing you will be condemning yourself to a life without freedom you will be forever tied to that man and have no way of escaping it from experience it will be nothing but hell and what difference will it make if i go home i still wonthave any freedom dad please i dontwant to lose you i i i love you too much tears finally won and kiara choked tears falling down her sunken cheeks severus held her in a tight embrace rocking her backwards and forwards to calm her down madam pomfrey was going to kill him when she found out but right now he was struggling with what to do send her back against her wishes or once again spoil her and go with her choices at this precise moment though he placed a kiss on the top of her head i love you too my little dark one i love you too nice to have you back nice to be awake actually i still in the hospital wing but only because dad and madam pomfrey say that i need to fatten up before i go anywhere i dontdisagree with them but i just wish i didnthave so much time to think sure most of the time i talking with either severus blaise or harry or revising for my mocks but there still too much time left for thinking i thought i had control over my life that not possible though it never will be not for me i ran hoping to escape him i wasntsuccessful and now i have to make the biggest decision of my life and either way he will win i follow his rules for now after that i will follow somebody else s until the day i day somebody or something ill probably tell me how to live my life until i die i will probably be a pawn in this game that is life and it sucks a n yay another chapter up and posted i d liek to thank y all for reading please bear with me things will pick up in the next few chapters i still haventdecided where this is goign but who knows i like to twist things review if you wish but the important thing is that you re reading i realised it would be a bit hypocritical if i begged you to review since i rarely do it myself i just patiently watch the story develop so thanks for reading and until next time the dark lady of r summons miss snape nice to see you are well hope you ve been revising rominisci said as he walked to the front of his classroom noting how kiara had previously been conversing with not only harry but with ernie a fellow sixth year but a hufflepuff he knew his seating plans would work out she smirked and he noticed she looked healthier than he had ever seen her i wouldntwant to fail my least favourite subject professor it might give me the incentive to hate it even more kiara replied looking innocent as if that was a normal thing to say so yes i have been revising excellent i wouldntwant my favourite student to fall behind so you will be able to tell us all where peruvian premars are usually found and why of course professor in chapter 8 of the textbook because that is where the author chose to put it very funny miss snape he said over the laughter he knew that she knew kiara had handed in an excellent essay about dark creatures around the world that had been o standard work of course she didntknow that he had graded it an acceptable even though in his mark book it clearly said outstanding that was the grade he had been putting down since october with the exception of harry potter she was his best student so what does it say in the textbook that despite originating from peru they are usually found in colder climaxes such as iceland or reside in mountains such as the alps however i have no idea why perhaps they just dontlike the cold perhaps you need to do a bit more revising the exam is in two days that is why this lesson will be concentrating on individual revision pretend i not here just dontmake too much noise the class kept its promise and rominisci congratulated himself for being such a good teacher he had a knack for doing this despite his age and lack of experience more than once he found his gaze travelling towards kiara and being amazed by how much she changed kiara had come to hogwarts acting very much like a spoilt slytherin brat something he had suspected was just an act and then with the suspension of her father and the arrival of vexus she had become quiet and withdrawn now there seemed to be a balance the sound of the bell startled him out of his thoughts that all folks last lesson tomorrow before the big mock exam we ll be doing practical revision so come prepared he said over the noise of scraping chairs ruffle of paper closing of books and the mild chatter he added as an after thought and miss snape please stay behind at this kiara sighed could the man not go for one lesson without keeping her behind she told blaise to save her a seat and made her way to the front where rominisci sat with his legs on the table twirling a quill between his fingers kiara had to admit if she didnthave a great mutual dislike for the man she would be like all the girls in the school he was good looking and the muggle clothes he dressed him did him as much as justice as when severus dressed in muggle clothes as well right now his black trousers and khaki roll neck jumper served him well my father always taught me that putting your feet up on the table was rude kiara remarked as she reached his desk rominisci nodded and placed his feet on the floor where they should be besides nobody wants to see the underside of one shoe for once your father was right he answered leaning forward so that his elbows rested on the table what can i do for you now professor what detention will i be serving or are you once again going to ask how i am despite it being none of your business though kiara words were sharp and could have been arrogant her soft tone of voice and the small smile upon her face made them none of those except perhaps sarcastic i wanted to make sure you were ready for the exam as it will decide whether staying on this course will be a good idea if you arentthen i sure it can be arranged for you to do it during the holidays i assume you will be staying here for christmas i assume as much it wontbe necessary though i as ready as i ever will be i am touched that you care though shegave him a small smile was that all professor yes yes that all kiara turned to leave and miss snape you really are my favourite student that is why i care and this really is my least favourite subject that is why i care again rominisci was left pondering over his actions since september perhaps choosing to intentionally be horrible to kiara and severus had been a bad idea but he had been angry at both of them at the time he got out of his chair and got ready for his next class he would think of a way of spending more time with kiara so that she would figure out his identity maybe extra lessons or maybe even having her hermione and harry the best sixth years he taught hold some kind of club for the younger years he d figure it out welcome ladies and gentlemen to my humble abode it is good of you to join me for lunch on such short notice william brentwood said as he showed guests into the dining room where they took their seats around the table that was covered in a small banquet if this was lunch they could hardly imagine dinner please take a seat i find that business seems always lighter when discussed over a meal the guests took their seats many nervous wondering why a man that was supposed to be busy trying to secure himself the post of minister of magic would take the time to invite them all to lunch especially when you looked at who his guests were they all had two main things in common they supported the dark side many death eaters and they all had a child in their sixth or seventh year at hogwarts it was a surprise to some to see lucius malfoy vincent crabbe sr and gregory goyle sr sitting there with their wives as they were supposedly in azkaban others included the zabinis the notts the parkinsons and a few others last but not least perhaps the only one without a partner was severus snape you may perhaps be wondering why i have invited you all to lunch today no doubt you have worked out the common link between all of you brentwood said as everyone had finished serving themselves and were beginning to eat we all have at least one child attending hogwarts severus spoke up as he knew perfectly well what the intention of the meeting was after all his letter explaining kiara intentions to be initiated soon must have triggered it indeed and what more they are at an age where they can be extremely of use especially to the dark lord there was a small murmur not many people had expected him to be on the dark side why else would i invite you all here i am on the same side you all vie for but my reason for inviting you here is not to make my loyalty known but to make it known to you that the dark lord has decided that now is the time for what crabbe asked looking up from his food for your sons and daughters to their place in the dark lord ranks he is rising in power and to successfully take over his needs his future death eater trained and ready to do his bidding but my son is only sixteen narcissa malfoy said looking as if the brentwood had just told her the worst thing in her whole life he is still but a boy there was a murmur of agreement as half of those present were parents of sixth year slytherins regulus black was only fifteen when he joined the dark lord ranks and he was not ready and look what happened to him i do not think it a good idea to recruit wizards and witches so young and without a complete education lucius added in support of his wife there was more agreement if i had a son or a daughter brentwood said slowly and carefully his eyes meeting with severus as he said this i too would be worried but this was not my decision shortly after christmas there will be a meeting in which you must bring your son or daughter and the dark lord will decide whether they are ready or not and if we do not somebody asked then you will be punished the dark lord is not one to be disobeyed but how exactly will it be possible for them to come to meetings after they are initiated it would be suspicious and foolish i am sure the headmaster would figure it out somebody else said it was as if brentwood was prepared for each and every one of these questions for he answered without hesitation the dark lord will no doubt have his favourites at this he looked at lucius snape zabini and simmons they will probably be the ones that meet with him regularly and will only be a small number they will only all meet when it safest mostly during the holidays and severus being a professor there will undoubtedly think of something yes i will severus replied nodding yet i would have still preferred it if they were older i have heard you re rather protective over kiara i am surprised you are not looking for a way out of it brentwood said taking a sip of his water severus narrowed his eyes he knew what the other man was trying to do and it would not work it is much easier to go with the dark lord decisions rather than against them it would happen sooner or later though later would have been preferable besides i am sure they will grow accustomed to it they are strong minded then it is agreed they will be initiated conversation was small people concentrating on food rather than on conversing they were all trying to figure out a way to break the news to their children or why they had ever got involved in such a thing in the first place severus was carefully picking at his food silent but catching snatches of other people conversations when lucius said the thing he had hoped he wouldn t i wasntaware you had a daughter severus he said causing everyone to look up and follow the conversation in fact nobody had been aware of severus having a daughter until now you have kept her well hidden i had my reasons severus replied blaise mentioned her in a letter mrs zabini spoke up her slanted brown eyes looking at severus as if wondering how he could possibly have a daughter that had befriended her son apparently she is his closest female acquaintance they are indeed good friends nothing more no nothing more at this moment in time anyway severus i heard through the grapevine that she is currently courting a certain harry potter severus hated for william brentwood tripled and he cursed him for being who he was severus really wished the man could disappear of the face of the earth you heard correct the great hall was decorated for christmas and the first time kiara had walked in she had marvelled at how spectacular it looked garlands of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls and no fewer than twelve christmas trees stood around the room some sparkling with tiny icicles some glittering with hundreds of small candles and others shining with gold bubbles which she had been informed was the handiwork of professor flitwick now as kiara walked in for dinner later that day and sat down at the table she got the sense that there was a tense atmosphere as she began to put as much food on her plate that draco would deem satisfactory he had been told by madam pomfrey and severus to keep an eye on what she ate the silence was a little too much nobody spoke but between the sixth and seventh years glances were exchanged finally kiara just had to ask what is it kiara snapped putting down her fork just as she was going to put a forkful of mashed potatoes in her mouth but had noticed blaise frowning at her he rarely did it nowadays so it had worried her nobody answered what i didntdo anything wrong did i no but i wish you had pansy snapped before promptly removing herself from the table and storming out of the hall kiara looked at blaise and draco for an explanation of pansy outburst but draco played with his potatoes avoiding her gaze and blaise just didntsay anything can somebody just explain to me what is going on not here in the common room just hurry up and eat draco finally said although he was talking more to the potatoes than he was to her she sighed and ate as fast as she could despite being extremely uncomfortable tension always killed her appetite but she knew very well draco was strict when it came to her well being and it was no use arguing what is it kiara asked again thsi time as she twirled the thick envelope that was made of yellowish parchment around in her hand dreg simmons scoffed as if it was obvious almost to say that if she was snape daughter how did she not know the seal was plain dark green with a black rim no emblem to signify were it was from summons they arrived shortly after lunch that all all that tension because we have been summoned kiara i dontthink you realise what this means draco said leaning on the arm of the armchair kiara occupied some of us are still sixteen and we ll be serving the dark lord for the rest of our lives some of us had dreams we wanted to follow and now we can t did you not think it was going to happen anyway yes but not now never now kiara looked around the room there were no younger students probably all told to scram all aged between sixteen and eighteen they looked anxious and somewhat jumpy as if they expected the dark lord to jump out of nowhere she seemed to be the only one not worried what getting summons meant then again she had had a week warning or so so what are you going to do kiara asked the whole room leaving the question open to be answered by anybody and yet nobody spoke probably still trying to figure out whether they could ignore the letter and run as far as they could or to just accept their fate us simmons asked kiara got the feeling this boy did not exactly like her you ve been summoned as well if you hadntnoticed what are you going to do i going to the library to revise as you should all be doing and pretending like nothing has happened going around looking like we are about to snap at any moment isntthe best way not to arouse suspicion dumbledore is most likely now aware that something is going on people cast shifty looks at their neighbour as they realised she was probably right i going to the library any of youare welcome to join me how can you be so calm about this somebody asked as she made to leave the common room followed by draco crabbe goyle and blaise as she was bound to be they seemed to always be together whenever she wasntwith harry she shrugged i may only be sixteen but i ve learnt that it better just to accept things and go with the flow than to fight them when you know deep down you d be fighting a losing battle and that is exactly what this is what a losing battle there is a war going on outside of hogwarts you may think that i a blood traitor and all the sort but i assure you when it comes down to it i will be choosing the right side you all make sure that you do and what if this isntit i admit i was wrong and hope i dontdie simple as that kiara could hear the whispers as she left the common room she knew it wasntgoing to be simple but putting on a brave face calmed her it made her more confident now she had to make sure she wasntoverconfident because being overconfident was worse than being cowardly and she wanted to stay alive as they walked towards the library kiara absentmindedly touched her left arm she was going to be a death eater but stay with severus she had been summoned but not as kiara brentwood as kiara snape relief fear anxiousness three words to describe what i feel right now but it will be worth it at least i hope so now i must revise a n another chapter up yay for me thanks for the reviews and thanks for reading as well it niec to know people are actually following this it makes my day well until next time the dark lady of r friends kiara woke up to find she had fallen asleep on the sofa yet again after spending all night revising today would be the last test and it was in a subject she should be extremely good at but had taken the precaution of going over her father would kill her if her potions practical and theory grades combined together was lower than exceeding excellent but then again he would be probably disappointed if she didntget an outstanding standing up kiara smiled as a blanket fell off her and onto the floor harry was sweet like this as kiara hugged the blanket she remembered all the little but memorable things he did this was one example covering her up whenever she chose to study into the early hours leaving a note with a drawing of a snitch on his pillow when he had early quidditch practises kissing her forehead and walking away whenever she was in slytherin company to respect the fact that that was her house and the list went on another was the way he liked to sneak up on her and wrap his arms around her waist protectively as he was doing now another night on the sofa if i didntknow better i d say you were trying to avoid me kiara snape harry said placing a kiss on the top of her head getting the chance to inhale the shampoo he loved so much even now it kept slipping his mind to ask her what she used you could always join me kiara replied running a finger along one of his arm if she knew harry at all it would be awhile before he let her go she felt him shake his head no you ve gotten a bit podgy these few weeks if you ask me you might push me off this was of course an exaggeration kiara may have gained weight thanks to madam pomfrey strict diet of eating anything and everything available and offered to her but she was yet to reach the stage where she could be classed as podgy if it was anyone else but harry that said it to her she would have hexed them but because it was harry she gave him a playful slap i not that big i the same size as i was during the holidays in the first few days i was at the headquarters besides you should never tell a girl she put on weight remember that we wear high heels so you do but personally i like you like this gives me something to hold on to harry said tightening his hold around her waist just to prove how much he liked her new shape and now you re getting more pronounced curves i not complaining i am i cantfit into some of my clothes i have to use an enlarging charm and that sometimes doesntturn out the way i want it to they laughed not because it was funny really but because they always seemed to end up talking about the most random things when they woke up and just before they went to sleep kiara sighed and turned in harry hold so she was facing him his height sometimes overwhelmed her despite the fact she hung around with the slytherin boys who were more or less of equal height she only came to just below his shoulders she kissed harry on the cheek and hoped he would let go of her so that she could get ready for class kiara didnt doubt that she looked a mess where do you think you re going i didntget a goodnight kiss so i expect a make up one harry said smirking as kiara saw that she wasntgoing anywhere because when he was in a playful mood he was going to play harry i have morning breath you dont want to kiss me with morning breath kiara tried she really wasntin the mood right now she was more in the mood for perhaps a shower and putting on fresh clothing she could hardly wear what she had slept in people could spot it a mile away trust me says who i have a free period all morning and i can wait you have a free period that means that shit kiara wrenched herself out of harry hold which had loosened due to his surprise and she bolted up the stairs to her room shouting all the way up i have arithmancy when you have a free period in the morning you could have reminded me harry sighed and sat down picking up the book kiara had left there as he read he couldnthelp thinking that kiara was avoiding him or that she had something a lot more important than him on her mind that she felt she couldntshare it was now thursday and ever since her return to school from the hospital wing on monday she had been acting a bit distant he figured she was going through a mood she d snap out of it she somehow always did your time is up put your quills down and stop writing vexus voice was heard in the silence of the classroom there was a small groan of frustration from every other student in the room and with a wave of his wand all the test papers were on his desk difficult judging by the class looks it had been well you have five minutes until the bell goes unwind and discuss all you will i knew i should have taken divination it would be a lot easier to predict my death than to remember the properties and uses of austrian sunweeds ron muttered causing a smile to creep onto harry face he had found it difficult as well as had the majority of the class apart from a select few hermione obviously included how did you find it kiara hermione asked turning around in her stool so she faced kiara kiara turned from what from a distance seemed like a heated discussion in whispers with blaise and smiled at hermione leaving blaise to converse with draco peace of cake i worried for nothing kiara answered yawning she really hadnthad much sleep this whole week it had been spent either revising or holding a debate with some slytherin idiot who still wanted to find away to avoid the summons you same you d think it was meant to be extremely hard or something granger that was hard only those who spend all their time studying or have the potion gene manage to find something like that easy blaise said rolling his eyes even he had found it somewhat difficult and he had always thought himself an o standard pupil when it came to potions no doubt the two of you will be getting o s i could say the same thing about ancient runes for you zabini it was as if it was your first language hermione retorted kiara raised an eyebrow and settled to hear the two argue on what subjects the other was going to fail with shame or pass with flying colours draco seemed to be in his own world despite the frequent warnings of staying normal that kiara kept telling everyone at the moment only blaise was listening to her before the bell goes i d just like to say something vexus said again causing a hush to fall over the classroom in the month or so he had been here they had come to respect him and they were quiet because of that and not because he was in any way intimidating he did however have a liking for removing points as you may or may not be aware this has been my last lesson with you in january professor snape will take back his rightful place as potions master and professor at hogwarts do you have to leave sir somebody asked and he laughed unfortunately but i can assure you it has been fantastic working with all of you it has been a wonderful experience and i quite sad it has to end i certainly hope professor snape will be pleased by the progress you have made and the exam results class dismissed as the class filed out of the room glad to be over with the exams and that there was only one week of the christmas term left kiara packed away slowly telling the others that she would catch up they were accustomed to her now staying after class to talk to the teachers about something or other she approached his desk where he was locking away the test papers in what appeared to be the top drawer but once he closed it it seemed to disappear how may i help you miss snape vexus asked settling down in his chair and looking up at kiara a small smile of amusement on his face it always seemed to be there when he addressed her as miss snape as if it amused him incredibly i just wanted to say thank you kiara said smiling slightly a look of confusion appeared on his face and kiara added for everything you taught me a lot a lot more than you can possibly imagine i was just doing my duty he sighed and leaned back in his chair i leave on saturday you could always come with me save you a lot of trouble it too late now i chose severus and it up to me to deal with the consequences you taught me as much so i did there was a silence between them where they thought about what had really changed between the two they were still teacher and pupil as they had been for years yet they had grown to understand and respect each other a lot more kiara was grateful for the times she had slipped down to the dungeons to talk to vexus he was the only clear connection with her past and between the pestering and scolding he did he would relay stories about her parents when they were younger sometimes kiara had wondered if she gave him the chance perhaps her father was up to change but the recent event had made her mind up vexus had also managed to curb kiara attitude as much as possible unlike severus he refused to tiptoe around her emotions and gladly ripped them apart until she acted the way he wished her to act at times perhaps he thought he overdid it but the result was as expected and even kiara was grateful with a little explaining she had come to realise it was necessary her attitude was destroying her friends kiara enquired extending out her hand a look of confusion appeared on his features i might need your help again and i d rather call on you as a friend than just a mentor vexus scrutinized her hand for a moment but shook it nonetheless friends kiara smiled her face lightening up in honest happiness it caused a smile to appear on vexus face as well as he did not know many people who could look so happy at simply having made a friend especially with someone like himself great now i guess i ll be going have a nice trip professor i will do just as kiara was about to leave the classroom she heard vexus mutter as he scribbled down something still cantbelieve she hasntfigured out or come to ask me about rominisci must talk to him before i leave might need his help did you say something dont mind me just speaking to myself keep safe kiara as kiara made her way to the dinner a thought passed her mind vexus had never spoken to himself and even if it was what he did normally he had never spoken to himself in her presence it was as if he had said it so that she was to hear him perhaps vexus had expected her to come see him about rominisci increasingly strange behaviour the way he was starting to take a positive interest in kiara however as she sat down in her usual seat next to blaise she found she had other more pressing matter on mind should i be worried about my exams about spots about getting fat about life in general thing is i am but at the same time i not guess i ve just learnt to accept things now there is just so much i have had to come to accept like the fact that my biological father will never make as good a father as severus or that despite the truce there will always be tension between slytherin and the other houses due to our prejudice some people still frown on my relationship with harry just because he a half blood as long as i dontfall in love with him i dontcare got your letter you wanted to talk to me kiara asked as she entered severus living quarters to find him sitting on his sofa reading the daily prophet he looked and returned the smile kiara offered him they had after all not seen each other for almost a week severus had said he had business to take care of back at the manor and kiara had told him that she could take care of herself and sent him on his way despite the cold riding out on the vast snape land had given him time to think whilst enjoying himself there was nothing he enjoyed more than snuggling up with a good book after a day of riding and experimenting with a few potions now he was back at hogwarts he sort of missed the place but was glad to be with kiara yes he said folding his newspaper and allowing her to sit down and lean on him as she always did it was a habit she had at least her habit of fidgeting had stopped well almost stopped as she only fidgeted when she was extremely nervous about about where you re staying during the holidays kiara frowned arenti staying here i would have liked you to but with everything that gone on i think it might be better if you spent the christmas holidays with the malfoys or at least a large chunk of it malfoy as in draco malfoy blond haired draco malfoy how many draco malfoy do you know of severus asked rolling his eyes kiara sudden bouts of stupidity never ceased to amaze him what other malfoy could she have possibly thought he was thinking of i will join on christmas eve and stay until you are initiated then you ll come back with draco but dad severus put a hand up to silence her you will not be worming your way out of this one kiara cant i at least try severus had to smile at that but still shook his head it was almost funny how she insisted on arguing with every other decision he made despite knowing that she would only win one or two he was pleased that the amount of swearing she used had gone down a considerable amount but wasntcertain just yet kiara seemed prone to mood swings these days i thought you and draco were friends we are kiara said trailing of as if she was going add something else but decided against it but sometimes i just feel he only friends with me because he obligated to and then sometimes i feel like he acts like my bloody older brother or something he just so suffocating at times he not like blaise or harry maybe that because he my godson what dontact so surprised i did have a something like a heart before you came along lucius and i go back a long time further than vexus and i you could say lucius and i are almost like brothers that why he was more than happy to have us for christmas kiara nodded in understanding it was the best she could right now she didnttrust herself to disagree with him because she was bound to get worked up it explains it then so how am i meant to act around them your normal self just dontswear or anger lucius his bout in azkaban has made him just the tad on the touchy side but he has sworn to me he will treat you like his own then i hope he treats draco well i will be spending christmas with the malfoys i am overjoyed as much as i would be if i failed potions there nothing wrong with them i just hoped i d spend christmas with dad after all it will be my first proper christmas a n i so sorry people my computer broke down and i haventbeen able to post anything hope you had a good christmas and have a happy new year catch you all later and thanks for reading as always the dark lady of r a n i have not updated in like a year or something and i apologise profusely i have no excuse to present well i do but that could take ages i ve just had a lot of things to sort through now i sort of back on two feet and can update at least twice a month hope you like the chapter a secret revealed the morning before she was due to leave kiara rolled over and watched harry as he slept it was a miracle they were in the same bed actually thursday night she had told him that she would be spending christmas at the malfoys instead of at hogwarts as planned friday morning he ignored her friday afternoon he ignored her friday evening they had an argument which would have ended with her sleeping in her room if she hadntat the last moment decided to apologise to him for what she didntknow or care blaise words never left her mind dontfall in love with him she hadntpromised but it was something that she couldnthelp wondering why not what was so dangerous about falling in love with harry potter sure he came with a few issues like having a madman after him but he was a great person to be with quite recently kiara had even began to wonder if they both survived the war if marriage was on the line yet there was always that voice at the back of her head telling her not to be stupid she was a slytherin perhaps not born one but she was one now and with the initiation date drawing nearer there was just so much to remind her that the path she was choosing was leading her further and further away from harry if it wasntfor the magical bond they shared there probably wouldntbe anything keeping kiara with him or vice versa it was just knowing that they shared something special that nobody else had that probably kept them together harry deserved someone better there was no way she was going to be able to tell him when she came back in the new year that she was a death eater kiara had a feeling he wouldnthandle it well he would find out the truth in the end though like he had about her identity but this time he would probably be more hurt than understanding kiara groaned inwardly as she thought of something else the dark mark was hardly conspicuous they couldntsleep in the same bed any more not without him seeing the unsightly mark rolling out of bed and walking into the bathroom to have a shower she saw no reason beside personal to stay with harry they would still share the bond and they would still be friends but there was no need for them to be romantically involved in fact it was dangerous for them to be romantically involved voldemort might use her to get to him as blaise had predicted and that couldnthappen if they werentdating there were a good many excuses she could use if they split up getting out of the shower kiara quickly dried herself and wandered into her room and to the wardrobe it was cold outside but she would be meeting the malfoys so she needed to make a good impression after awhile of browsing and pondering she went for black denim trousers a white roll neck top a black cardigan and black boots to keep her feet warm although they werentvery formal packing didnttake too long as she wasnttaking her trunk but a suitcase severus had given her for the stay and there werentmany clothes that fit her comfortably anyway kiara was going to have to go shopping during the holidays closing the suitcase she left it by the door before wandering into harry room he was still fast asleep the sheets tangled around him looking at her watch kiara saw that she was due to meet draco and the rest of them in the common room soon there they would finalise a few things with the rest of the slytherins and then set off kiara didntwant to wake him but then again she couldntgo without saying goodbye harry she said softly nudging his shoulder he grumbled but didntopen his eyes harry what he mumbled turning his face away from her as if it would block her out i going now going where slytherin common room why i leaving today remember his eyes flew open and he stared at her in confusion for a moment his emerald eyes searched her dark ones and then it dawned on him and he adapted the same hurt expression he had worn on thursday night i thought you were staying he said simply pushing himself out of bed the sleepiness gone from his voice his words cutting clear through her conscious kiara didntsay anything and simply stood by the bed her previous thoughts mulling in her mind i thought you were staying i told you on thursday that i thought when you apologised you were going to go tell your father that you wanted to stay it not a question of me wanting to go or not kiara snapped how did apologising instantly mean that she was staying she didntget it it a question of me having to go i not going to argue with him why not harry mumbled pulling on his trousers roughly you always argued with him before yes well that was before this is now i ve learnt to have better respect for him if he says i going to the malfoy for christmas it where i going why why do you all of a sudden have to go over there i was invited harry it would be rude not to go they re like family kiara defended having a feeling it might be useless and draco and his mother are spending christmas alone severus and i have to go bet they ll probably become actual family soon what that supposed to mean oh come off it i know exactly what going on here really do enlighten me i was your bit on the side you knew you were doomed to end up with some slytherin pureblood so you though you d have fun while it lasted harry said viciously pulling a jumper over his head so who the lucky guy huh malfoy zabini or maybe that nott guy why are you doing this kiara asked following him down the stairs into their common room he turned round on his heels looking at her with a look of utter dislike you re hiding something have been since the start of the week and now it all makes sense but it a lie there is no one but you at the moment draco is like a brother to me and will never be anything more blaise is my best friend i went to a lot of trouble dating you harry so dontyou dare throw it back in my face since the beginning it has been you that wanted me to go out with you i was perfectly okay with getting butterflies when i was around you so everything my fault is it yes it is he turned and stormed out of there headed for the exit kiara followed knowing that if she didntfinish this now she would never finish it harry legs were longer than hers but she kept up by jogging a little stop acting like a coward and face me harry say what you re thinking and get it over with again harry stopped this time so suddenly that kiara was lucky she didntrun into him i am no coward he hissed glaring at her it good to know sneered returning the glare arentyou meant to be leaving arentyour precious boyfriends probably worried about you not until this is sorted out i want to enjoy my holiday not spend it worrying about how to make up with you dontworry you wontbecause it over you re splitting up with me kiara asked her mouth dropping she had thought that she would be the one to split up with him or that she would chicken out although she was relieved it was now and not later but it was still a shock you re splitting up with me dontact so surprised you may not be a true snape but you certainly ended up like one cold manipulating and surly you arentthe kiara i fell for not the kiara who i raced down through the cherry orchard at snape manor you re someone completely different so it over it over as a couple as friends we ll see but as being magically bonded he held up his hand to show the silver ring on his little finger it your choice i dontcare with that he stormed off leaving kiara staring where he had just stood cheer up will you draco said as he pansy kiara and blaise settled into a compartment crabbe and goyle were with simmons and his lot they werentmuch company anyway kiara rolled her eyes and settled down in the window seat you ve been like this all morning you d think i was taking you to your death my parents arentthat bad it not your parents kiara said staring out onto the hogsmeade station other students were dragging their trunks off the platform and onto the train many chatting happily despite the cold i actually looking forward to having a holiday away from hogwarts then what is it harry broke up with me this morning there was a stunned silence earlier that week harry and kiara had seemed like a pretty close couple none of them would have guessed that by the end of it hogwarts most known couple would have split up draco still wasnta fan of harry but he knew kiara liked him after all she had gone through to be able to go out with him she must have done that was all that prevented him from cheering and getting out the champagne instead he was angry who does potter think he is dumping you like you re yesterday trash he demanded if he was on this train boy would i give him a piece of my mind nobody dumps a slytherin especially not a gryffindor i shouldnthave gone out with a gryffindor in the first place kiara mumbled kiara was surprised by how hurt she felt she had been contemplating of ending it with harry anyway but now it was done she felt empty as if her other half had been taken away ever since the summer harry had always been there and now he wasn t she didntreally know any more it would take some getting used to i should have listened to you darling dontbeat yourself up about this pansy said reaching across to take kiara hands in hers you thought potter was the one didntyou you couldnthave cared less that nothing would come of it and now he goes and does this to you he not worth it if he cantsee how pretty you are that the thing he thinks i ve been cheating on him with who blaise and draco what both of them kiara nodded and pansy let out a laugh doesnthe know that if you went anywhere near draco i would be the first one to kill you and blaise is gay anyway i am not blaise said coldly if i were gay i would have killed myself a long time ago imagine my parents reaction if i came out of the closet no i pretty sure i straight oh said pansy looking confused she had been sure blaise was gay as far as she could remember he had never had a girlfriend kiara had to giggle a little pansy looked so perplexed i stand corrected either way potter should have known you wouldntdo that to him if he didntthen he certainly didntdeserve you maybe you re right there no maybe about it you re better off without him you can have any guy in slytherin apart from draco at the snap of your fingers dontworry about stupid gryffindors alright kiara nodded and smiled grateful to have pansy as a friend although she certainly had her ditsy moments and her let s all hate kiara days she could be nice could be that my girl mother will be overjoyed blaise said frowning the fact that his mother was going to be happy didntseem to bide well with him she been bombarding me with letters asking as to why i had let you slip through my grasp what do you mean kiara asked it means my mother has decided that there is nothing more she would like to see before she died than us married now with potter out of the way she ll expect me to slowly worm my way into your heart or at least hope that the offer my father makes beats all the other offers what other offers dontyou know draco asked surprised you re one of the wealthiest girls in britain once you re seventeen snape will hold a ball and he ll have to choose a suitor for you however if you choose before that you get the choice of who you marry no nasty surprises unless you were betrothed from the beginning are you saying i was a nasty surprise then pansy pouted no pansy he sighed kiara hadntrealised that there was more than a stupid one sided relationship going on between them draco had no choice but to be with her it explained so much i just saying that if kiara doesntchoose now her father choice might be ugly i heard flint still hasntfound a wife and warrington is looking both are extremely ugly so you reckon i should choose now kiara asked what better time there probably going to be at least one christmas event over the holidays you and blaise can announce your engagement then hold on a minute blaise snapped sitting up who said anything about an engagement i d rather not be smothered to death by my mother and i never said i wanted snape as a father in law what wrong with my father kiara huffed crossing her arms blaise thought of kiara usual reactions when people made a negative remark against the snape name before answering nothing he mumbled knowing full well that unless kiara disagreed this christmas would be his worst ever and on top of the summons as well well then it sorted draco said lazily stretching out on the seat and resting his head on pansy lap blaise get the ring off your mother kiara write to your father as soon as your settled in and once the zabini engagement ring is on your finger it official it ll be good for the both of you how so kiara asked again intrigued by how some families wanted their children to marry it ll be good for you because it ll be a good bounce back after your chilling break up with potter and for blaise people will stop thinking he gay and his status will be raised draco shrugged at least that what it should do and if it doesntdo that you ll be labelled a lying cheating slut and blaise someone who trying to cover up his homosexuality but it shouldntgo that way he blew a strand of hair out his face and pansy carefully swept it back engrossed in his features now can we talk about something else everyone happily obliged and soon they were far away from the topic of marriage once or twice kiara found herself wondering what severus was going to be like when she told him probably mixed feelings blaise wasntthat bad when she thought about it but he wouldnthave been her first choice he was alright and everything and she didntmind spending the rest of her life with him but she just wished she had gotten to choose someone she was in love with like her mother was supposed to have done kiara couldnthelp comparing him to harry they were equal on looks harry was more pretty boy if anything perhaps he didntintend to but just like draco he could well be on the front covers of magazines and be swooned over from his sheepish grins to his sparkling emerald eyes there was something about them blaise was the dark italian you secretly wished for instead of making you drool his looks made you wonder blaise was taller than harry by a few inches at least which would have been suffocating for kiara if she hadntgotten used to it in the past four months however because of quidditch harry packed a lot more muscles and was leaner and stronger but blaise made up for muscles in brains there was no denying that he was smarter than harry in kindness kiara couldntmake her mind up both cared for her she assumed harry still did he hadntrejected friendship and had shown that they cared in different way both were good company and she wouldnthave minded marrying either she wondered how blaise would have handled the situation and found that he too would have probably dumped her and she was sure he would have done it so that she felt the impact blaise had a way of doing that when they were close to london pansy and draco left to do a bit of patrolling and look for crabbe and goyle draco was curious as to what they were up to this left kiara and blaise in the carriage alone able to talk more openly about the arrangement which draco not them had made no offence but you werentwho i d thought i d marry blaise said staring in front of him as he spoke the whole journey he had been zoning in and out of the conversation something completely out of character for him he always followed the conversation even when reading or doing homework dontworry you arenteither kiara replied though a tad hurt she hadntexpected him to voice his thoughts who did you plan on marrying sally anne perks what muggleborn sally anne perks hufflepuff sally anne perks that sally anne perks yes kiara blaise snapped irritably no need to be so fucking dramatic about it you are joking right you didnt seriously think you were going to marry her why not my sister married a muggle so why canti marry sal kiara gaped at him in disbelief you were the one lecturing me about the failure of these kind of relationships you made me promise not to fall in love with harry which i didn t now as a friend i am telling you to forget about perks it ll only lead to trouble i cantforget her kiara blaise insisted turning suddenly to face kiara his eyes pleading with her i think i might even love her how long has this been going on for since the end of our fourth year wow blaise kiara said deeply impressed you re an excellent actor i would have never guessed the constant hours in the library the ancient runes study group and the week you spent helping professor vector they were all sally anne werentthey yes it will never work out it didntfor me and harry that because he a self centred pig very much like draco what are you going to do when this gets out huh what is your father going to say i dontcare what my father says not anymore after the quidditch match i realised that if i wanted to marry sal i could you went out with potter in the end and all because you wanted to what going to stop me the fact that you re due to become a servant of the dark lord this seemed to wipe away the small smirk that had formed whilst he reasoned as to why he could get together with sally anne kiara guessed that blaise was attracted to her mind as well as body her wand abilities were almost to that of a squib but give her an arithmancy problem she could solve it in two ticks and according to hermione she could read ancient runes better than the professor and even better than blaise himself her latino roots had given her curves to die for kiara couldnthelp but be envious i wontthen blaise said after awhile she had to ask him to repeat himself in case she had heard incorrectly i said i wontjoin the dark lord are you after a death wish you cantsay no to summons we both know that your family will pay the price then let them pay i have a right to a life you know kiara sighed as she fixed the broken glass of the compartment door that was the first time he had snapped at her and she could see when blaise was upset he was upset all this time she had the feeling that blaise was disapproving of everything she did with harry when in the end he might have been jealous she and harry had been able to date publicly with little scrutiny they had after all somewhat ended a long lasting feud between two houses or maybe he really hadntwanted her to get hurt knowing that he couldntbe with who he loved must have been eating him up inside you two arenteven married yet and you re already arguing draco said as he came back obviously satisfied with his little trip around the train pansy looked flushed what are you going to do when you do get married rattle each other up even more shut up draco kiara thought it best not to tell them just yet that if blaise had his way there was not going to be a wedding at least not with blaise as the groom a warm welcome a cold wind hit kiara face as she stepped out of the black car the door held open by the malfoy chauffeur they needed some mode of transportation that couldnteasily be detected and this was it draco was waiting for her by the large steps that led to the front of the manor and she linked her arm with his thankfully the steps were charmed to be ice free otherwise there would definitely be some kind of accident the rest of the surrounding area around the building was covered in thick snow you ll love my mother she has been in need of female companionship for a while now so there is no doubt she will love you as dearly draco said as they walked up slowly but surely around her you are free to be yourself around my father you will behave like a proper slytherin he will decide whether he likes you or not of course draco kiara answered absentmindedly not worrying about lucius malfoy her father had told her that he would treat her like he treated draco and draco did not appear to be in any way harmed perhaps slightly guarded but he looked fine no swearing either it unladylike i know draco good then there should be no problem no draco he fell silent and they steadily progressed up the stairs as far as kiara could tell from the outside the manor was much larger than snape manor and that was saying something in the car draco had felt the need to explain that they had moved to this manor their lancashire one after their wiltshire manor and estate had been taken under review by the government and according to him it was bigger than the one they stood before the journey had dragged so much draco could be good company when he wanted to be but that was obviously not today upon reaching the last step the large oak doors opened by themselves in such a majestic fashion that kiara had to wonder whether it was to impress or if the doors always did that the entrance hall was large and vacant decorated in deep reds and a hint of gold laced her and there it did not matter that they were gryffindor colours all that mattered was that they looked rich and impressive drably draco called out removing his outer cloak and gesturing for kiara to do the same she noted that he had changed from the jeans and woolly jumper combo he had been wearing on the train to smart trousers smart shirt and what appeared to be a cashmere jumper an expensive material both in the wizarding and muggle worlds a small house elf dressed in dark green appeared before draco kiara was forced to remember elvin who had been the one to help her escape she didntknow what his fate had been but knowing her father rage it had either been clothes or he had killed the poor elf drably bowed deeply to his master his nose touching the floor welcome back young master drably said in a voice that if kiara hadntbeen watching would have never believed belonged to the house elf it was high but it held a certain authority to it he would not disobey direct orders from his master but he was obviously not to be trusted take our coats draco ordered basically dumping the outer garments on drably this is miss snape she will be residing with us during the christmas period drably made a small bow in kiara direction where are mother and father i do not know where your father is and nor is it my business to know your mother is in the parlour awaiting your arrival that is all drably with another low bow a small almost inaudible crack and the house elf was gone kiara followed draco to where she supposed was the parlour all the while not thinking much about meeting narcissa malfoy if she thought about it too much she would become nervous and when that happened it induced a temperature change in her body instead she thought about what had alerted her about drably he looked normal enough and apart from the strange voice he sounded alright he was extremely polite and then it hit kiara he didntspeak like a normal house elf he spoke in full sentences with correct grammar and everything very unusual be polite draco hissed before pushing open the door they had stopped in front kiara didnthave time to respond instead she put on a shy smile and took in the room it was also much larger than the main parlour room at snape manor kiara couldnthelp comparing until now she had though snape manor was pretty large hello mother narcissa had been sitting in an armchair facing the fireplace her back towards the door and when she stood up she did it with such gracefulness and kiara already felt the utmost respect for her she was just like kiara had imagined her to be tall elegant and beautiful her pale blue robes matched her eyes and went well with her blonde hair it was not as light a blonde as draco s it was more of sunshine blonde welcome home draco she said softly looking at her son like he was the piece in her life that made her complete kiara expected her to hug him or the other way round but they exchanged a kiss on the cheek quite a cold gesture in her mind then again she could not judge she had never had a mother to share such a gesture with i trust the journey wasnttoo tedious it was fine narcissa turned away from her son and looked at kiara for a moment scrutinizing her carefully there were a million remarks passing through her mind to say about being examined but kiara said nothing she felt the need to impress the female malfoy but for no particular reason it was just a feeling of instinct after a silence that seemed to stretch for a good fifteen minutes in kiara mind a small smile appeared on her face kiara only a name severus would have chosen kiara was taken back by the remark severus had never chosen her name her mother had but if that what narcissa wanted to believe then she could it is nice to finally meet you thank you for inviting me mrs malfoy kiara replied smiling at the older woman it was my pleasure and do call me aunt narcissa we are all family here at least you re being here will encourage your father to spend christmas with us he hasntdone so in quite awhile now she sighed i suppose he been busy mother draco interrupted knowing full well that when women started to talk to one another stopping them was another thing entirely where is father i dontknow draco even if i did it isntup for discussion what your father does is up to him he will be home for dinner if you are worried about not seeing him today i wasntworried draco sneered seeming hurt at the mere suggestion well i going to unpack and get changed i ve decided baby blue and cashmere do not work well together for me very true aunt narcissa agreed try a darker shade next time i ll see you later he said as he walked past kiara leaving her alone with his mother she felt quite intimidated aunt narcissa took this time to further examine kiara pacing around her and every now and then shaking her head kiara would have felt a lot more comfortable if she knew what she was disapproving of was it her clothes was it her hair was it everything severus had always said she was beautiful in his eyes and draco had said she wasntugly but she hadntreally gotten a female opinion on her looks pansy could never be trusted and millicent bulstrode said you were pretty as long as you could get her to places you are your father daughter she finally said the same smile reappearing dark hair though i will grant you that it is less silky than your father s pale skin which requires a lot of make up to liven up thin but there is some shape to you and that unforgiving slouch why is it that you slouch i slouch yes you slouch you certainly dontstand tall if you walk into a room with that slouch you will not turn heads nobody will notice you and you are royalty you need to be noticed kiara gave her a puzzled look all this talk of royalty although she was sure there was no wizarding royalty and marriages were new to her severus had never liked to dwell on it he had mentioned once about finding her a suitor but nothing more behaving like a slytherin had come naturally aunt narcissa sighed my dear kiara it seems that you have gone for too long without a woman touch follow me what kiara didntknow was that she was about to endure the longest three hours of her life personally she thought they were a waste learning how to sit stand and hold oneself in different company was not how she had expected to spend her christmas holidays yet aunt narcissa was nice enough the name felt weird out loud after thinking of her for so long as mrs malfoy but by the time she had stopped slouching it felt natural and then came choosing robes to wear to dinner muggles muggleborns and some half bloods had no idea how lucky they were kiara may i come in sure the door open kiara was sat at the desk in the room she had been given writing a letter to severus she was going to let him know of hers and blaise intentions but also tell him that nothing was confirmed just yet it took longer to write than usual for fear of spilling ink on her outfit or getting it on her hands uncomfortable was another word that came to mind she was sitting in an odd position as to not crease her robes too much they werenteven hers they were just something aunt narcissa had bought in case she didnthave anything adequate dinner in ten minutes i just thought i d come and talk to you before we went down together draco said as he took a seat on the edge of kiara bed she didntreply instantly having just a few words left to write and she would be finished what are you doing writing to dad kiara replied as she signed off before holding up the letter admiringly it was straight there were no ink blots and hopefully no spelling mistakes about blaise would you read it for me and check it alright if you re sure she was it wasntlike she had written anything personal it was almost business like by her standards dear dad i am settling in well aunt narcissa is a very amiable person and we are getting on very well draco is his usual self i am glad that i am spending christmas here instead of at hogwarts and cannot wait for you to join us as well it would make it even more enjoyable of course i am not writing solely to drivel on about how i am i am writing to inform you that of this morning harry potter and i can no longer be deemed anything more than just friends in light of this i have decided that i am going to be serious about my future blaise zabini one of my closest friends and i have discussed the possibility of a marriage happening between us in the near future nothing has been set in stone yet but by the new year if nothing goes wrong i should be wearing an engagement ring presented to me by blaise we shall talk about it more when you join us your loving daughter kiara looks fine to me draco said handing it back to her she put it aside to send when her owl got back she had let her out to hunt and get used to the grounds i sure you and blaise will make a lovely couple like i said kiara said standing up to stretch her legs nothing set in stone blaise might decide he doesntwant to marry me or a better offer may come along for me stop being so pessimistic blaise is a bit stubborn it ll just take him awhile to realise that you re the best girl he got and like i said the better offer isntoften the best dontwant to marry blaise no not really who do you want to marry kiara said the first name that came into her head neville longbottom what i only joking i guess i dontfeel like marrying anyone at the moment i only sixteen it isntsomething i really thought about before she walked over to the full length mirror and looked at her reflection until now i didnteven worry about what i was going to wear to dinner mother did a good job aunt narcissa certainly had if this was all for dinner kiara hated to think what she was going to be wearing at the christmas and initiation balls that had been mentioned her hair had been pulled back into a single french plait a diamond encrusted clip at the end of it her face had been made up lightly so that she appeared to have some colour in her face and the kohl around her eyes made them stand out even more the robes were peach a tone that complimented her skin well but not a colour she would have normally worn given the choice are you sure i look alright you look fine let go down to dinner kiara followed him out noting that he had nothing to worry about he seemed to look alright in everything he wore even in the deep green robes he currently sported perhaps it was the malfoy gene she did her best to stand up tall remembering what aunt narcissa had spent the afternoon beginning to drill into her brain she was there to be noticed and that exactly what she had to do the two adults were already there seated at opposite ends of the long dinning table a small banquet in between them upon seeing that kiara had arrived lucius malfoy stood the resemblance between him and his son was so uncanny it was frightening if draco was to grow his hair longer they would be twins like his wife his composure demanded respect but his had a lot more authority to it miss snape so glad you could join us he said sitting down once kiara had thank you for inviting me mr malfoy she replied saying the same thing she had to aunt narcissa earlier that day she smiled politely not knowing what else to say the pleasure is all mine severus and i are good friends almost like brothers he speaks highly of you this seemed to please lucius for his smile broadened revealing several opal teeth and i of him let us eat now and converse later so they ate in silence apart from the noise of the cutlery against the crockery kiara concentrated on not getting any of the food on her robes occasionally stealing glances up and down the table every now and then she would catch draco eye who was sitting opposite her and he would give her a reassuring smile the adults kept themselves preoccupied with the food as the main meal was being cleared away to make way for dessert lucius took this as the time to converse how did you find that miss snape the food was delightful sir it the best i ve ever eaten kiara said truthfully it beat the hogwarts food and the house elves at snape manor never made anything intricate soup salad and the standard meals they could do vol au vent and crab cakes were another thing entirely good good i like my guests to have happy stomachs lucius smiled when will your father be joining us christmas eve sir why not sooner i not entirely sure he has business to take care of i suppose i wouldntknow father isntaccustomed to telling me his business severus isntaccustomed to telling anyone his business but enough about him tell me more about yourself he didnttell me nearly enough about you how well do you do in school what are your hobbies any aspirations for the future i like to think i do well in school naturally i do best in potions but i also do well in other subjects i dontgenerally like school but father is adamant i go although he has thought about getting me a private tutor instead kiara explained wondering whether this really did interest him or if he was just making conversation i donthave many hobbies i like to read and draw but that it really as for my aspirations i donthave many i dontconsider myself a career woman looking after my inheritance is my main priority you will be inheriting quite a bit will you not yes sir you are going to need a suitable partner i sincerely hope that you haventdecided on making harry potter that partner he said harry name with such disgust that even if that had been kiara original intention she would change it immediately no sir we are now simply friends have you put any thought into who will become your partner a little i ve had an offer but nothing has been confirmed as if that was all he had been after lucius gave a small nod and fell silent diverting his attention to the cheesecake in front of him draco caught kiara eye and he nodded as far as he could tell his father approved of kiara a n finally some willpower i seriously needed to update and here it is i ve written the next 10 chapters time will tell whether my laziness allows me to post i will try and get some stuff up once a week if possible no promises though fianc troubles dear kiara good to hear you are settling in well i will join you on christmas eve like i said for i still have business to take care of i am glad to hear that you and potter are no longer in a relationship perhaps it is not the nicest of things to say but he was a bad influence a nuisance and unnecessary package blaise will be a good replacement and if you are to wear the ring then i have no objections whatsoever we shall definitely speak later father kiara stuffed the short note in her trunk as aunt narcissa came into the room at exactly two thirty in the afternoon as she had said she would they were due to set of to buy suitable dress robes for kiara aunt narcissa had remarked that it was obvious kiara lacked female guidance and attire since the rest of her clothes either didntfit or were too muggle like kiara didntmention they had been picked out by tonks i suppose you have never been to promenade alley aunt narcissa asked offering the cloak that she had laid out for kiara that morning it was light blue with a thick white lining to keep her warm and also to match with the navy blue robes she was sporting this would be the first time kiara had worn robes outside apart from when at hogwarts muggle clothing appealed to her the most although she did not know why she had after all grown up with more wizarding influences than muggle no aunt narcissa kiara answered and took the cloak it certainly was warm and very well made it compared nothing though to the older woman forest green and silver cloak that she wore with such elegance thatkiara was sure in a lifetime she would never achieve then i am sure you will love it you and i are going to have shall we say a girl day out do something with your hair manicure pedicure shop for robes and anything else that catches our eye and finish off with a drink in the caf it sounds wonderful five minutes later kiara got to see how wonderful it was unlike diagon alley it wasntbustling with people a selection of people walked by the neat and expensive looking shops occasionally entering there didntseem much to do there but she smiled as aunt narcissa dragged her to all the places where she thought they ought to go she was being done a favour and kiara knew there was no other way to accept it but gracefully ah and finally madam beauxchaud she does the finest dress robes in the country aunt narcissa said as the door opened automatically to allow them to enter the inside was very organised and very large robes seemed to be organising by colour and type so it had to be large camille how nice it is to see you again the pleasure is all mine my dear narcissa the other woman replied kissing aunt narcissa cheek with the warmth of an old acquaintance camille beauxchaud was a tall woman with dark brown hair composed into a neat bun beautiful yet subtly so pale green dress robes accentuating her olive skin and who is this young lady this is kiara snape camille looked puzzled severus snape daughter oh yes of course kiara fought the urge to roll her eyes camille beauxchaud had no idea who she was unless it affected them directly not many people knew that severus snape had a daughter it wasnta hot topic once dismissed to look through the dress robes to see if she could see anything appropriate she heard them talk about her and saw the sideways glances thrown by camille she had made her way through the red section of the dress robes when she heard her name called kiara dear do come over here aunt narcissa said her voice travelled the distance kiara had placed between them but she did not shout rhianna gave up on the idea of ever wearing red and made her way back to the front where there now stood three women and blaise kiara said her lips beginning to curve into a smile but at the curious glance given to her by aunt narcissa she felt a blush creep into her cheeks she had yet to tell her of the possible union between the zabini and snape family or what was left of it kiara blaise acknowledged with a nod his wine red robes certainly were different from his hogwarts ones bringing out the brown of his eyes he turned to the woman standing beside camille looking at kiara in the same way that aunt narcissa had done the day before this is my mother helena zabini mother this is my closest female acquaintance kiara snape it is a delight to meet you helena said kissing kiara lightly on the cheek in her customary greeting she looked like blaise but her skin a shade paler a rich caramel and she was not tall in fact kiara was taller than her and that was saying something my son has told me much about you i hope it has all been good kiara replied a friendly smile on her face she was going to get on with the woman that stood before her because by april helena zabini might be her mother in law the thought made her felt queasy but she fought to keep her emotions steady one day had gone past where she had been able to keep her temperature steady this would be day two even if it killed her i have never heard blaise speak ill of you that i can safely say you must be a very close female acquaintance i would like to think so kiara would you mind helping me to find dress robes blaise asked causing kiara and helena to break the gaze that had been between them helena knew of her son proposition and was making sure kiara was suitable and kiara was simple fascinated by the storminess of her eyes they were brown and yet not so it was strange i afraid i am awful at these things i am no better but i will keep you company excuse me the men section was coincidentally placed furthest away from the three women two mothers and a dressmaker who had nothing better to do with her time than to gossip even if they could not be heard they were in plain view that didntmatter much though blaise and kiara only needed to talk so what colour do you like best kiara asked to start the conversation talking to blaise was a slow process but after awhile he spoke without being prompted to with a question or a debatable topic sometimes they process was fast and barely noticeable other times it could take a whole hour yellow he replied absentmindedly flipping through the green dress robes the traditional colour for their house a slytherin could never have too many green dress robes or even robes we are not announcing our engagement whilst you are wearing yellow how about blue blue suits you is that what you want me to wear blue he said the colour with such disgust that kiara immediately put the blue robes she had thought would suit him nicely back on the rail blaise continued to look through the greens not meeting kiara eyes it better than yellow it such a hufflepuff colour blaise tensed his hand stopping in mid air kiara cringed at her mistake i sorry i never meant i am insensitive sometimes she rested her hand on his arm of course you can wear yellow and when we get married we can have yellow flowers and we can decorate the home yellow i going to wear green blaise said slowly picking out forest green dress robes with silver and black stitching and lining you on the other hand will be in yellow we will match quite nicely you are asking me to wear yellow only last night aunt narcissa had been telling her that people like her never wore yellow not only was it associated with the relevant house it was seen to be too cheerful something that mainly purebloods were not i am not asking i am telling if we are to be married kiara you will listen to my instructions to wear yellow give me some credit blaise i know how to dress myself dontargue you re wearing yellow case closed besides the ring will match beautifully kiara watched with some awe as he continued to browse every now and then pulling one out only to replace it this was the blaise she had met on the first day of hogwarts cold aloof and arrogant everything kiara knew he was not this was not the blaise she wanted to marry kiara cursed sally anne it was the knowledge that he would never marry her that was probably bugging blaise she convinced herself that this was an off day it would take awhile for him over sally anne but it wasntlike this was easy for her either she wanted to marry for love like every other girl on the planet you choose it then she said having contemplated this bitterly she didntlove blaise more than a friend and one didntusually marry their friend he turned to her with a confused look as if only just noticing that she stood there if you want me to wear yellow you choose the dress robes very well after you have finished telling me which you think will look best he held up two dress robes both very similar one set was dark green silk with silver lining that contrasted well and the other was a very slightly lighter shade made out of velvet and the silver lining more subtle kiara who disliked velvet chose the silk one and a smile appeared on his face i see we think alike already now come we must choose something that matches and i though you were simply awful at these kind of things a little white lie goes a long way blaise murmured as he began to shift through the yellows they were now closer to aunt narcissa helena and camille who were now sitting down in the armchairs sipping earl grey and gossiping helena gave her future daughter in law as far as she was concerned a warm smile when their eyes met kiara returned the smile before turning her attention to blaise sifting after awhile he produced pale yellow silk dress robes with a silvery white sash around the waist that if blaise stood next to her would give the appearance of being green kiara had to admit there was nothing wrong with it but it wouldnthave been her first choice she would have gone for the classic silver there was still the initiation ball to think about though so perhaps then she could wear something silver preferably of silk or muslin depending on her temperature go try it on kiara didntbother to argue and went into changing rooms emerging clad in the dress robes there was absolutely nothing wrong with it in fact it was growing on her with a little bit of work on the hair she would look stunning at the christmas ball and she didntcare if she sounded very much like pansy parkinson at that moment after all now she was set to be married she was very much like her your son has good taste aunt narcissa said to helena loud enough for kiara and blaise to hear his eyes travelled up and down her body his brow furrowing as he stopped for a moment at the obvious places when he had finished his face relaxed and now for the other dress robes he motioned for her to go change and the join him in the men section as he walked past her he whispered sally anne would have looked better in those robes pretending that she was not hurt kiara went to change ms hemlock is ready to see you now sir severus gave the secretary a polite nod as he got up from his seat and made his way to gail hemlock office kiara social worker to hand the two copies of kiara diary so that she could see that kiara was happy and get out of their lives he hadntread much of it just on the days he suspected there might have been something important written down kiara entries were hardly novel length but they gave insight to her feelings what are you doing here severus said coldly his back straightening and the hair on the back of his neck standing on end william brentwood put the book he was holding down and looked up at severus a smile that the devil wouldnttrust playing on his lips ms hemlock took a coffee break i ll be taking this session he replied motioning at the empty seat in front of him do take a seat severus you dontwant kiara taken away from you now you donthave the power to do so au contraire as the minister of magic i do you haventbeen elected yet yet a small technicality to be fixed in a week or so now sit severus obliged not taking an eye off the man in front of him he could not be trusted he wondered what william wanted now the last time it had been a proposition kiara either became a death eater or she was placed back in his care kiara had opted for the more dangerous one and even though severus wished she hadn t it made him feel smug kiara loved him enough to risk her life let get started shall we firstly how is kiara doing you ask that like you care just answer the question severus she fine staying at the malfoy for christmas the malfoy s so she will be attending the christmas ball i am hosting how can she not social suicide isntsomething i wish for her to commit is kiara yet engaged unofficially yes to whom william asked frowning slightly they re planning to announce it at your ball i suppose you ll have to wait until then severus said smugly happy that the smile that had been on william face at the beginning was starting to fade maybe after i read her journal i can take a wild guess what since i am taking hemlock place i am going to read her journal like she would have done now hand both of them over severus hesitated but took them out of his pocket placing them slowly on the desk he now wished he had read everything then there wouldntbe any nasty shocks if there were any thank you severus was forced to endure the torture of william sitting there reading kiara journal every so often laughing or shaking his head after it became clear that william intended to read the whole journal severus let his thoughts wander his mind rested on eleanor even now severus could hardly believe that the girl he had saved that night months ago was her daughter that is where he had seen the smile before kiara had inherited her mother smile along with almost everything else except perhaps the lack of trust that kiara possessed but eleanor had never shown in the few years severus had known her yes he and eleanor had gone to school together been in the same year even but she had been a gryffindor at the time severus had wanted nothing to do with that house especially whilst the four menaces to society were there it was only when she returned to help teach potions that they got to know each other better he remembered one particular night especially that night had gone so wrong in a number of ways but had felt so right that night had been the last night severus had seen her the night which the dungeon classrooms were completed and she left to be the wife she was meant to be not much variety in her work william said his eyes on an entry each one the same i hate my father severus doesntunderstand me harry hates me i think i love him i hate my father he ruined my life not much creativity huh takes after my father probably not one ounce of creativity in him maybe not creative but she isntstupid notice that she never says your name she knows i would kill her hasntstopped her before though has it severus asked smugly william closed the diary and threw both the copies in the roaring fire what were you bored already like i said she isntvery creative william answered shrugging now about this unofficial engagement i afraid it not going to happen see i need kiara to marry internationally and i doubt this guy will be i afraid that isntpossible why not i already consented well then un consent we both know that it is near impossible to do so without a valid reason so unless he attempts to kill her in the next six months before the wedding or the decision is mutual the marriage is going ahead he smiled inwardly at the frown that had appeared on william face besides i thought you were going to leave us alone after your visit to hogwarts i was and then i realised i couldn t a bond between father and daughter is a strange one i guess i ll never be able to leave her alone severus scoffed you are no father nor are you severus william replied leaning back in his chair casually at least kiara is my daughter by blood something that she will never be to you never william brentwood had obviously never heard of the saying never say never how wrong he would turn out to be how so very wrong a n heck why donti just double post while i at it save me a lot of time and give you more to read who knows when my next update will be next week i hope a n since i never update regularly i decided i d post the 5 chapters at once like a consolation prize of some sort i ve actually got written to like chapter 45 but i just so lazy when it comes to updating i need to make more of an effort hope you enjoy though i taking the story in another direction which you may or may not like some of the chapters are quite long just to warn you and if you hadntnoticed i ve shortened my name from thedarkladyofravenclaw to dark lady of r which i like better oh and some reviewers though nearly all seem to be anonymous have been reviewing and saying that kiara is a complete mary sue and i should have a warning i dontknow if it pointless to say this now but here goes warning my character is apparently a mary sue if you choose to listen the flames of some sad anonymous reviewers then stop reading even though you ve got this far if not do carry on thank you for your time preparing for a duty two days after the whole blaise thing in promenade alley kiara woke up early in the morning she could tell it was early without looking at her watch because the sun had only just began to rise without thinking too much she quickly threw on some warm clothes regardless of fashion or anything wrapped herself in her cloak and left her room she wasntsure of where she was going she just needed to get out of the manor and think about everything but marriage where are you going miss snape drably asked causing kiara to jump slightly she hadntnoticed him standing in the room that led out to the gardens turning to face him she concealed the annoyance in her face she had no doubt he would report anything she said or did to his masters i am going out for the walk in the gardens she answered alone that is highly unusual young ladies do not wander outside alone i can take care of myself if anyone should ask where i am then tell them i shall return in an hour or so very well he made a small bow and kiara turned opening the door cold icy morning air hit her thankfully her cloak was thick as were her boots and gloves otherwise she would have frozen the entire garden or as far as she could see was covered in thick snow apart from a path where only a thin layer appeared to be present deciding to stick to the path in case she got lost kiara breathed in the fresh air and attempted to rid herself of any thoughts of marriage it was all aunt narcissa talked about arrangements for a wedding dress fitting had already been made and in her room on the desk lay what seemed like hundreds of wedding magazines and catalogues ever since finding out blaise was who kiara was engaged to she had done nothing but run around making arrangements kiara just couldntfind it in her heart to tell her she didntcare whether the grapefruit in the fruit salad was pink red or yellow and if she wanted the flowers to be in a bouquet of 24 or 28 there wasnta great deal of difference draco was very happy with himself he seemed to think that now he had made the union she and blaise would live happily ever after of course she hadnttold him that blaise currently hated her for being the reason he could now never be with sally anne she didntblame him but the prospect of having to live with a bitter husband until one of them decided to kill the other was making her depressed kiara came upon a lone bench and decided to sit down she hadntwalked that far for the manor was still in view but she didntreally want to risk going further at least from where she was now sitting the inhabitants of the lancashire malfoy manor could easily see her christmas eve was in two days and kiara couldntwait severus would be coming over and she missed him so much right now she missed having someone around who wasnthung up in their social image someone who didntcare what they wore to dinner however she wasntlooking forward to the days after on christmas day was the christmas ball william was hosting and two days after the initiation then two days after that the initiation ball and on new year eve the parkinsons would be hosting a ball kiara would be glad to get back to school are you not cold miss snape kiara snapped out of her thoughts and turned to see lucius malfoy towering over her looking regal in his black robes and silver cloak his silver snake head cane adding to the effect she stood quickly and curtsied before answering no sir the weather does not affect me much mind if i join you he asked gesturing to the bench kiara had been sitting on no sir i think we know each other well enough now for you to stop calling me sir you call narcissa aunt narcissa do you not kiara nodded then you may call me uncle lucius your father and i are and have always been like brothers will you call me kiara then uncle lucius of course kiara he smiled at her and she smiled back she couldntsee why draco bristled at the mention of his father he seemed nice enough or at least in the past four days that was what he had appeared to be tell me something kiara what do you plan on doing for the dark lord after you are initiated i am not yet sure whatever he wishes of me i suppose are you willing to kill for the dark lord kiara took a moment to answer it wasntlike she hadntthought about it it was all she could when she lay awake in the middle of the night unable to fall asleep some memories refusing to leave she had wondered what it would be like to rob someone of the greatest gift they had been given what it would feel like to take someone from their families and yet she had not come to a conclusion just yet she knew time was running out and had to come to a decision soon but it was hard was she really ready to kill when the moment arises if he was to ask you to kill at your initiation would you yes if that is what he wishes of me if he asked you to kill severus would you no she said rather bluntly she could never have his blood on her hands if the dark lord wants my father dead he will have to get someone else to do it and if i die for my impertinence i know i haventkilled to sole person i truly care about so you are prepared to die i have been prepared to die since i knew what true pain was there was an eerie silence lucius had never imagined that kiara would have such a strong character severus had mentioned that she could be a handful but he had thought he meant it in a fatherly way that all she did was complain about her looks and clothes kiara was different she spoke honestly and already held the characteristics of a good death eater she would make her way to the inner circle in no time he smiled inwardly as he imagined the look on bellatrix face when she realised she was not the only female in the inner circle being a female there are other things the dark lord may ask of you lucius said breaking the silence she gave him a questioning look what more could voldemort want from his death eaters apart from their loyalty if you prove to be worthwhile i doubt he will but there are cases when he may ask you to pleasure either himself or high ranking followers and you must be prepared i must be prepared to be whored out kiara asked momentarily forgetting her manners that part of the package had not been mentioned just because i female all of a sudden i might end up pleasuring she stopped and took a deep breath she was not going to get worked up and do tell me uncle lucius how do i prepare for that if you are still a virgin find a way to not be and fast your first time is going to hurt anyway and death eaters tend to be rather violent a combination of the two is not a smart idea kiara sighed is there a way i can prove to be worthwhile pass all of his tests a follower of the dark lord should be able to perform the unforgivable and be prepared to be subjected to the cruciatus it would take for you to do something outstanding to be worthwhile to him bellatrix my dear sister in law took several years of pure loyalty and a few men beds before she got to where she is now and her years in azkaban did not go unnoticed uncle lucius i scared he stood up and placed a fatherly kiss on her forehead so you should be so you should what is scurvy grass used in sneezewort and something else i think check your textbook kiara replied not looking up from her own potions coursework draco muttered under his breath and reached for his textbook flipping it to the index and beginning to search through the small text for scurvy grass they were in the library seated at the desk closest to the fire and working on the pile of coursework they were to start ready for the new year having calculated that once christmas arrived they wouldnthave much time to do it they were attempting to finish as much of it in the next two days kiara was further ahead than draco despite the wedding planning she had to slot in every now and then but that was probably due to the fact she didntstop every so on and declare that she gave up like now i give up i dontdo coursework then what do you do girls draco replied kiara rolled her eyes i do girls i ve done pansy of course i did daphne before her mother transferred her to beauxbatons did millicent as a dare d draco kiara snapped putting down her quill and staring at him incredulously at what point did i say that i wanted to know exactly which girls you ve slept with i dontcare touchy you would be too if you were trying to get on with your coursework and had someone going on about their sex life now shut up quit complaining and just do the fucking coursework you re wasting so much time he mumbled something about pmt and went back to the coursework they had only been working for around ten minutes when they were again forced to take their attention from the pending coursework yet this time it had nothing to do with draco this time it was drably announcing a visitor master blaise zabini has requested the company of miss snape and if he should wish so young master malfoy he said bowing low before stepping aside to reveal blaise dressed smartly but not in robes instead he was in black trousers white shirt and brown jumper brown suited blaise blaise my friend draco said getting up to greet blaise anything to get away from potions coursework he really didntdo coursework kiara also stood up watching their brotherly hug noting that blaise was rather tall he was even taller than draco hallo blaise kiara said kissing him lightly on the cheek he smiled at her but kiara couldnthelp noticing the contrast in his eyes all three sat down in the seats surrounding the fire and kiara was the first to speak despite the fact aunt narcissa had spent a good hour telling her that a lady never spoke before a man so what brings you here canti visit my own fianc e without good reason he asked raising an eyebrow kiara blushed and mumbled a no she now saw aunt narcissa point it stopped you from saying foolish things like that i also came to present the engagement ring so you have it for the christmas ball and are you used to it your father approves of it you saw my father no but he came by the house to discuss some business with my father he took a small black box out of his pocket come here let me put it on you kiara stood up as gracefully as she could and walked over to blaise extending her appropriate hand the ring slid on easily and blaise kissed it softly before allowing her to see the ring that now tied her to him it was beautiful peridot and diamond stones were set in an intricate design on a gold band it would certainly match with the yellow dress robes as it would with the silver muslin dress robes she was wearing to the initiation ball and then again with the deep green ones she would be sporting on new year it beautiful blaise only the best for my fianc e let see kiara draco asked kiara turned and allowed draco to study the ring on her hand i impressed zabini gold usually looks tacky but this actually looks like its worth something of course the malfoy rings have always been silver i dontparticularly care no i didntthink you would so are you all ready for the initiation blaise asked taking the glass of wine from the tray drably had brought in and taking a sip kiara reached over her own glass and used this as an excuse not to talk as blaise looked for an answer lucius had scared her to some extent how can anyone be ready father says he ll definitely ask to have all three unforgivables performed and have the cruciatus performed on us and the dark mark isntgoing to pleasant and the dark lord is unpredictable draco asked draining his own glass and pouring himself another you as scared as the next person what i dontsee is why he wants us all of a sudden he must have a plan that involves almost qualified wizards and the odd witch in fact i think pansy and kiara were the only girls to get summons millicent the stupid girl apparently broke into tears at not being chosen i would too when war breaks out she isntgoing to have much protection is she kiara said i cantsay i looking forward to it but i ready it just another thing in life you have to get over at least as boys you have it easy how so draco asked pouring another glass blaise rolled his eyes use your brain draco most of the time girls are only good for two things to look good on your arm and to fuck now which one do you think would come in use to the dark lord and his followers oh i see the next half an hour or so was spent discussing the initiation and to kiara pleasure everything else apart from marriage every now and then she felt like she was back at hogwarts just talking to two of her friends and then she would look at her ring and realise that in the new year everything would have changed she and blaise would be officially engaged and two sevenths of the slytherin house would be bound to lord voldemort well i should be going blaise said standing up mother might get the ridiculous idea that i want to stay over too late draco said smiling when i went to the bathroom i met mother on the way back and your mother has sent a change of clothes to last you at least two days if you change every hour that woman is lucky i actually love her oh well show me to my room so i can settle in and change before dinner i ll do it kiara said standing up as well is he in the wing next to mine actually he in the same wing mother felt that you two should be close so blaise is in the room next to yours connected by a door for easy access should it be necessary kiara mentally reminded herself to whack draco round the head when she got the chance and reprimand aunt narcissa for that idea as she led the way her arm linked with blaise s do you suppose mrs malfoy and my mother are up to something blaise asked when arentthey fair point i suppose your mother would be the same i suppose i wouldntknow she chose to give her life to have me she sighed and felt blaise place a comforting hand on her arm there was the blaise she had come to know and love as a best friend oh well aunt narcissa is doing a perfect job and i have my father do you think our children will one day be in the same position as us never our children will marry for love i dontever want them to be in the same position we re in that if we survive this war we will blaise we just have to try hard enough they turned into what was the guest wing and currently kiara s there was the main bedroom she stayed in another next to it a library a little further on and several other rooms kiara didntreally need this is my room they walked on further this is yours do come in blaise said pushing open the door and pulling her in it was similar to hers but was a touch more masculine whilst kiara room used more pastel colours for its decorations blaise room had rich colours sit he motioned to the bed and kiara carefully sat down on the edge this was the first time she d been in the same room as blaise and a bed now kiara something been on your mind since i came what is it i was discussing the initiations with uncle lucius and he gave me a piece of advice to the whole female death eater thing kiara said staring down at her ring unable to meet blaise gaze and he said if i was a virgin it would be best if i wasntand fast and are you yes he looked at kiara with some amusement in his hazel eyes sitting down on the bed next to her he turned her to face him and kissed her his kisses were different to harry s there was no doubt in that harry was gentle an angel compared to the rough searching kiss blaise placed on her lips kiara responded knowing she would have to get used to it when they pulled apart for air a misplaced grin was on blaise face you re not bad nothing compared to sal but i ll get used to it kiara bristled but he didntnotice shall we get this over and done with now dinner in two hours plenty enough time to get it on with and then wash up kiara bit her lip she hadntexpected him to take it so nonchalantly this wasntthe way she had expected to lose her virginity having sex to prepare her for the possible duties she may be asked to perform everything had gone so lopsided blaise saw the fear and worry in her eyes and kissed her softly dontworry i ll be gentle a n yeah i finally updated it been like years since my last update this is a weird chapter written whilst i had chest infection i got a beta reader but cantpromise anything anywayz read on and dontforget to review seeing an old face the next morning kiara mood had decreased by a reasonable amount since the previous day and if that was anything to go by kiara was somewhat depressed she hadntslept all night and as he helped her pack a few things he couldnthelp notice that all the warmth and glow in her that had taken kiara three weeks to achieve had drained away in a single night severus didntblame her he too felt like sitting down and crying for his own safety but he had done it too many times to care go to death eater meeeting that is not cry he didntcare whether he lived or not but she certainly did as she fumbled with the zip of her overnight bag she broke down and started to cry tears streamed down her face and she hid her face in her hands as if she trying not to show severus that she was crying it was impossible not to notice she was he sat down next to her on the bed and put his arm round her he had done this so many times now but he still felt out of character as if it wasntreally him kiara it ll be okay i ll probably be battered to near death and brought home to die but i ll be fine after awhile i ll find a reason for them to keep me alive dontyou worry severus said leaning his head against kiara s he knew he was making an empty promise but he had long enough to think of something there was a chance he could die but kiara didntneed to know that and if i do die which i won t you ll be the richest girl in britain that reminds me that we have to find a suitor for you but that can wait i dontcare about money i want you to be safe go into hiding or something kiara answered through sniffs she wiped her eyes with her sleeve and pulled out of severus hold she had just got an idea it was a sure way for her to die but then she would die knowing that severus was safe you could uh show your loyalty by bringing me in i ve been enough of a burden kiara you re crazy never in a million years would i risk your life over mine and you know that so stop being so damn pessimistic when i being optimistic for a change plus you d miss out on the fun of going out with friends and spending your well my money i bet you d never done that before have you kiara shook her head and lent back on severus she didntwant him to leave but his mind seemed to be made up that my girl oh before i forget here your school list you dontneed the books because i got unused copies in my library just the other stuff and here the key to your vault you get a quarter of your inheritance now another quarter when you turn of age and the other half when i die okay now get off me so we can go kiara took the key and put it safely in the pocket of her jeans severus stood up and sighed kiara knew that heavy sigh meant that he was either nervous or very worried probably both he was now stood in front of her full length mirror spiking up his now short hair making sure it was presentable he was dressed in khaki golf trousers lime green open necked shirt and a tan wool v necked jumper once he had finished making sure his hair was fully spiked he slid on his brand new golfing gloves kiara walked up behind him and pointed at the back of his head you missed a spot she said pointing to an area that had been neatly brushed only the front of his head was casually spiked up severus immediately turned around and tried to see the back of his head in the mirror kiara raised an eyebrow and laughed i only joking you vain idiot your hair looks fine even though i dontlike this new muggle image it kind of makes a nice difference to see you in colours that arentblack as long as i a handsome vain idiot i fine what do you think people reactions will be when they see me in my new style he grabbed a golf club and struck a pose kiara couldnthelp giggling she knew that laughter would be one of the reactions we ll just have to wait and see wontwe bloody hell professor did one of your potions backfire or something ron exclaimed in shock he was the only one that spoke harry hermione ron and remus stood in the living room of grimmauld place looking at severus with a look of utter amazement not even a hello had come out of their mouths yet severus sighed and checked his watch waiting for them to snap out of it yeah um severus what happened to you you look remus stuttered the first to break the silence he ran his hand through his hair and let out a low whistle he really didntwant to admit it but he had to normal not like a freak no more i ll take that as a compliment no my potions didntbackfire they never do i just rethought my wardrobe and my image as the new member of the country club i need to look presentable severus said briefly not wanting to plunge deeply into he reasons behind his new look which reminds me i have a golf game in ten minutes so i best be on my way turning to kiara he enveloped her in a hug and didntcare whether his students and former enemy were blinking to make sure it was their potions master but as he went to pull out of the hug he saw a tear fall down kiara face looking up at remus he made eye contact and simply stated just give us a moment please remus nodded and led the three curious teenagers out of the room he sat down and motioned kiara to do so too that was the second time this morning she had cried and severus didntmean to be insensitive but how many tears could this girl hold he knew that kiara was wearing her necklace he could see it quite clearly hanging round her neck and that would be a reminder of him but maybe something else would comfort her as well he looked at his hands trying to think and there he found the answer his ring he never took it off but he could on this one occasion taking off his gloves and then the silver ring with a celtic design engraved into it off his little finger kiara look crying isntgoing to stop me going but if you want you keep my ring until i come back you can if it will make you feel any better he offered the ring to kiara who lent on him admiring the contrast it made on her pale skin it was a surprise it fit any of her fingers to severus they seemed so skinny kiara stopped crying and again wiped her eyes with her sleeve you never take this ring off kiara mumbled still recovering from the tears i know so keep it in a safe place and when i come back give it back to me it just so that you have more hope in me coming back home to you there no way i going to die without that ring on my finger and if you do die kiara no matter how hard she tried couldntsee a way severus was going to live through this i won t say goodbye to the others i love you kiara i really do severus kissed on her on the forehead before standing up putting on his glove and apparating from the room kiara sat for a while playing with the ring on her finger thinking about the words he just said to her how could three words that felt alien to her affect her in this way i love you severus knew she had no idea what those words meant that probably why he hadntwaited for a reply a final tear fell down her face and she wiped it away quickly and stood up to go and see where everyone else was as she opened the door though harry and ron fell forwards and landed on top of each other harry struggled to get up as ron had fell and landed on him rather awkwardly he punched ron on the arm and he struggled up harry following kiara looked at them suspiciously knowing that they d been eavesdropping they blushed a nasty shade of pink which killed their efforts to look innocent all they needed now were crooked halos to complete the effect whatever you think we werenteavesdropping we were casually leaning against the door and you opened it ron blurted out only to receive an obvious hidden kick from harry he flinched and pulled a face what i mean is are you alright again ron flinched and tried again do you want to go now he flinched again but this time he stepped away from his attacker harry stop kicking me and talk to her yourself look we were eavesdropping hermione too but she smart enough not to lean on the door as much as i hate your father hope he well for your sake at that ron left the room so harry was standing there blushing with kiara wishing she didntfeel so strange inside yeah uh right so you um harry babbled staring at the floor he didntknow why he was feeling so tongue tied but it may have had something to do with kiara hurt look her big dark eyes glittering with tears he took a deep breath and tried again are you alright i will be it just with dad going to this meeting thing i not sure he ll survive this one i know it silly but i canthelp feeling down kiara answered smiling weakly at harry he avoided her gaze and looked at his shoes they were so interesting is there something wrong your father i him and i maybe it better if i didntsay anything you re upset enough as it is you dontneed me to make it worse let just go find the others and get some shopping done he took hold of kiara hand and tried to pull her out of the room but she was fixed firmly to the spot what could upset her anymore look i shouldnthave started saying what i was going to say you shouldnthear it not when it about your father you re right you shouldnthave but now you ve started you d better finish kiara clenched and unclenched her fists anger pumping through her she didntknow why she was angry now but she knew she was definitely going to be she took deep calm breaths and regained her calmness alright if you really want to know i dontcare if your father dies kiara i really don t see this house the guy that used to own it died partly because of your father and his hatred for him that guy was the only family i had and your father took that away from me i sorry but i couldntlie memories that he tried hard to push away came flooding back and he felt sadness as well as anger sirius was dead because of that poor excuse for a human you know what they say the truth always hurts i sorry for your loss and i sorry you dontcare if severus dies it your choice and i cantdo anything about it so i not bothered once again kiara mustered a weak smile and fought back tears and there was no way they would win for a third time one thing is funny though no matter how much he hates you he would do anything to make sure you lived anyway maybe we should go yeah we should with that he turned and left the room kiara behind him trying hard not to think about severus today was meant to be filled with excitement not worry as they stepped into diagon alley kiara was too taken away from the noise and excitement to care about severus or the fact harry hated severus to the point he wished he was dead she had never been around so many people or seen so many things in her life she wanted to see everything right now but first they had to get the money from gringotts the wizarding bank if they had known how much money she had in there ron hermione remus tonks and even harry wouldnthave gone down there if that was only a quarter of her money they couldntimagine how much she had in total as the cart containing harry kiara and remus drew up to vault two hundred and eighty three 283 the goblin got out the cart containing ron hermione and tonks came up behind them since they couldnthave possibly all fitted into one cart and they all watched as the goblin unlocked the door green smoke came billowing out and as it cleared everyone gasped it was hard not to the whole vault was piled high with golden galleons a few silver sickles here and there and hardly any bronze nuts visible kiara was amazed at how much money she had been given severus was one rich man she hurriedly stuffed money into a bag and got back into cart she was aware of how much they were amazed compared to her harry was poor and ron was well in poverty kiara wished that she hadntbeen the first one especially as ron collected a few galleons from the weasley vault she couldnthelp feeling sorry for him their first priority was to get a wand and it was best to get it out of the way since it would probably take the longest mr ollivander was quite unpredictable it could take the whole day to find the right wand the place was half full with what seemed like an entire family present there seemed to be an argument going on between the mother and presumably the eldest son if she doesntwant to get her wand now let her be i dontwant to get mine now either september is light years away so hold your horses he said rolling his hazel eyes and pulling a face another girl returned the face she was obviously the sister since the mother turned around and scowled you two always gang up on me why if your father was here you wouldntbe doing this to me so are you getting your wands now or am i going to have to resort to blackmail she snapped looking from her son to her daughter nobody noticed the old man with big pale eyes walk out of the shadows and stand between the two groups at least not until he spoke and they all jumped who will be going next time is ticking away mr ollivander said looking at both the groups in turn nobody answered a silence ringing through the gloomy shop no volunteers now let me see you look like you could be tricky come and we can get started he pointed to kiara before walking over to the counter she followed nervously but was reassured with the fact that harry and remus were on either side wand arm stick it out so it can be measured right kiara answered sticking out her right arm a tape measurer appeared and measured from her shoulder to finger wrist to elbow and knee to armpit before falling to the floor kiara lowered her arm uncertainly and watched mr ollivander looking along shelves taking out and replacing boxes ah this should do maple and unicorn hair nine inches very flexible and whippy give it a wave he said handing her a wand she waved it and a lamp shattered as if it was used to this type of things the lamp quickly rebuilt itself no no and no no maple kiara blushed with embarrassment but harry smiled he remembered when he had got his wand a high pile of wands had quickly built up and kiara pile of tried wands seemed to be piling up as well he turned around to see what the others where doing and tonks was entertaining the family that had been in the shop before them by switching her look every two seconds and hermione and ron were sat in a corner talking harry saw less and less of ron and hermione apart there were more arguments but they were petty little ones if he wasnta big fan of romance he could have sworn there was love in the air i knew you were going to be tricky i always have the same problem with particular families your not a potter or a weasley so you re either a richmond brentwood snape or a longbottom or you re just a really difficult person take your pick it might help me a little kiara eyes widened and she looked to remus for help what was she meant to say of course remus had no idea she was used to be a brentwood she could say she doesntknow and that would mean telling harry the truth i a snape kiara said ignoring the knowing look she got from remus all this wand had to do was to be the right one mr ollivander handed her a wand that looked very similar to severus and she gave it a wave nothing happened he snatched it away from her and climbed to the top of the ladder and retrieved a wand right on the top shelf he looked at kiara and then back at the box this should be it only a few of these were ever made and belong to a mixture of two powerful families what makes this so special is that it has two magical cores and usually the person who gets the wand their parents will have had one of the cores if this is not it i will hang up my boots kiara took the wand and instantly felt a warm feeling pass through her fingers she waved the wand and bright sparks like fireworks came out blinding everybody within a meter away the word finally spread across the room and once kiara vision returned to normal she saw that mr ollivander had a strange look in his pale eyes ebony and unicorn hair and phoenix feather ten inches springy do you happen to know who your mother was kiara shook her head and suddenly mr ollivanders eyes began to water of course you don t sad so very sad yes well that would be eight galleons the money was gladly paid anything kiara could do to get away from mr ollivanders gaze she felt a hand on her shoulder and turned around to see that it was remus kiara got a feeling that he was the only that understood what she was going through he smiled before asking for her list the day was still young but they had quite a lot of things to buy apart from what she needed for school there were still her clothes and extra stuff to buy after all she had the money the whole of diagon alley later tonks hermione and kiara were in oxford street gazing at all the selection they had they had ditched the boys who had gone home carrying all of kiara stuff including her unusual ginger tawny owl rather large selection of robes and cloaks and books all that was left now were her muggle clothes converting a quarter of the wizarding money she had taken out into muggle money had given her enough to buy a whole shop hermione where do you reckon we should go first i mean kiara full of money there isnta cheap store in sight where are we going tonks asked as they looked through every shop window they passed kiara had never seen so many clothes hermione cocked her head thoughtfully and smiled why fcuk of course and then top shop we ve also got to get some timberland boots and get some sports gear from jd sports does that sound good to you hermione answered stopping in front of a shop tonks smiled and all kiara could do was nod fcuk what was that air conditioning seemed to be on at full blast when they went in and it felt like stepping out of a frying pan into a freezer goosebumps appeared on kiara arms but she was more interested in looking at the clothes than whether she was cold or not they were looking at a couple of jeans when a voice came up behind them can i help you ladies said a guy in his early twenties he had a name tag on so he must have worked here he looked at them carefully in turn sizing them up so he was ready to help if they needed any help that is yes my niece needs a whole new wardrobe we need something from your summer range and something from your winter range if that possible tonks said pointing to kiara who blushed the guy nodded and went through the shelves and racks pulling out items of clothing a size 8 most probably we have nice pastel colours to go with her pale skin here you go these should do the dressing room is just this way he said leading them to the end of the shop if you need any further assistance donthesitate to ask well what do you think isntauntie tonks just the best tonks asked kiara as she tried on the clothes she had been showered with kiara stared at her reflection in the mirror and couldntbelieve it was her at all she had put on a little weight but the baby pink miniskirt with the white top and pink velour jacket still looked good on her everything looks alright i ll take the lot well she could money was no issue shopping bags at their feet kiara tonks and hermione sat outside a caf drinking cool freshly made lemonade and eating the best muffins available in the muggle world kiara couldntbelieve that she was actually outside enjoying herself with friends and a vault of money that was full to the brim there was a random discussion ranging from clothes to ice cubes everything was going fine until a man wearing jeans a plain blue summer shirt and a baseball cap pulled over his eyes pulled up a chair and sat at their table excuse me can we help you tonks asked politely although through her head other less polite words were running through her head what gave him the right to wander here and decide to plonk his butt at their table no not really the man answered not looking up a smile appeared on his face well then why dontyou leave oh i just came here to say hello to who hermione asked halfway between curious and annoyed tonks just needed one more word out of him and she would launch a full strength attack why your charming young friend kiara enjoy your freedom while he still thinks your dead until then have fun be sixteen have sex get drunk be wild ohand say hi to severus for me at that the man got up and left the table kiara had gone pale and her eyes had widened in shock who was this man he knew who she really was and there were only two people who did her father and wait who are you kiara shouted after the man she got up nearly spilling her drink and ran after him not really caring that she might be putting herself in danger the man carried on walking acting as if he couldnthear her she caught up to him and grabbed his arm tell me who you are the man lifted his baseball cap and kiara immediately let go of his arm and started backing away no he couldntfind her why was he in london anyway dressed as a muggle their eyes met and kiara just couldntpull her frightened dark eyes from thosedark green ones she had spent so many hours with him trying to give her an education that her real father didntwant her to have standing in front of her was vexus ripley a n dum dum dum what will happen after their little encounter will kiara be captured will severus be found guilty will kiara everfollow
