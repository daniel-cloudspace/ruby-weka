belong to her so for crying out loud just read please read and review i would really like to know what people think about my writing luv you all peace out liane chapter 1 the pilot it was a beautiful warm summer day when lily awoke in her powder blue bedroom as she got up she thought about hogwarts she could still see every color or the houses and the sky in the great hall even after the entire summer lily brushed her teeth and hair and began to pack her school things into her trunk her robes books caldron muggle clothes dress robes wand and head girl pin lily then headed for breakfast and as she began hopping down the stairs she noticed the door to her sister room was open lily climbed back up and peeked in the door to see petunia on the phone again as lily turned back to the stairs she thought of how boring it would be to constantly be on the phone good morning lily greeted her parents hi sweetie lily mother crooned hey there lil what ll it be for breakfast her father asked as he proceeded to take out a frying pan a bowl a whisk and of course pancake mix lily gasped in excitement do we have chocolate chips no her father simply replied while secretly trying to suppress a smile oh lily said totally crestfallen really of course we do oh you are really out of it this morning are you sure you are ready for your last year her father began mixing the batter as he spoke cut it out said lily with a sarcastic pouting face i hate talking about that and you know it well lily you know you have to begin thinking about it her mother interjected i know i know lily replied your future is very important her mother began as lily mouthed each word mocking her mother behind her back she had heard this speech at least 20 times just yesterday not to mention suffering through an entire summer you really ought to start getting prepared lily mother turned and stop mocking me her mother chortled and fake scolded lily as they both laughed lily and her mother were very close their personalities were similar their looks were similar minus her mother bottomless blue eyes of course lily had green orbs which lit up the room with their luster both lily and her mother were short at about 53 with straight soft bouncy red hair down to their mid backs lily always loved her mother hair how it swished each time she turned her head how she would always let lily style and brush it even when she was little and got it stuck in the comb but most of all lily loved her mother energy no matter what happened lily mother could make you feel better even after the worst day of your life lily mom would successfully pick you back up with a smile lily idolized her mother and wanted to be just like her lily got up and set the table with plates forks knives glasses and the milk and syrup seeing as lily younger brother maximus was at his best friend house lily only needed four of everything her father brought the pancakes to the table and called petunia to come downstairs and eat i coming geez petunia yelled back petunia and lily couldnthave been any different despite their being sisters petunia had poufy blonde hair brown lackluster eyes and horsy front teeth with braces she was tall and skinny and a total neat freak petunia was also obsessed with her boyfriend vernon dursley whom she had just met two weeks ago lily and her parents sat down to eat lily parents told her how much they would miss her and if she needed anything to just write and on and on the usual parent stuff when lily and her parents were finished eating her sister still hadntcome down her parents insisted that they would clean up and as they did lily thoughts turned to her father his light brown hair his golden hazel eyes she thought he looked tired but he still had that smile on his face lily remembered the only time she had seen the smile fade when lily grandparents died she was only four years old but she could tell something was wrong mommy was crying and daddy face didnthave its usual soft assurance lily had asked what was wrong and her father tried to smile and explain but lily saw right through him lily grandparents had been flying home from their visit to rome when turbulence took out one of the engines and caused the plane to crash into the ocean since then lily never trusted planes she liked her broom though because she knew she was in control of it but she ll never forget her father face lily loved her father so much and was very close to him they had a joking relationship bantering back and forth with extreme sarcasm she especially loved the twinkle in his eyes it always made her feel safe before she knew it it was 10 30am lily jumped up and raced up the stairs to grab her trunk she snatched a few lip glosses that she thought she may need and the picture of her parents that always watched over her as she slept she shoved her glosses into her trunk by the rest of her makeup save one which she stuffed into the pocket of her favorite worn out jeans and carefully wrapped the picture in between her robes then she closed and locked her trunk and began dragging it out of her room lily wished she could just levitate it down the stairs but she lugged it down instead lily then raced back up the stairs poked her head in petunia door and shouted bye petunia only response was to yell at lily to get out lily then went to say good bye to her parents bye dad lily hugged her father and kissed him on the cheek bye sweetie and have a good year her father replied bye mom lily hugged her mother and kissed her as well bu bye lily dontforget to write reminded her mother lastly lily shouted i love you both and as they shouted that they loved her too lily was gone with a loud pop lily disapparated to king cross station for her last time until when maybe one day later in her life her son or daughter would be accepted into hogwarts and ride the hogwarts express lily landed in a dark corner of the station and noticed to her dismay the infamous marauders minus peter they were just getting ready to cross the barrier lily tried real hard to hide but too late she was spotted by her least favorite of them all james potter hey there pretty lady james teased he was quite tall at 60 with dark brown extremely untidy hair which he now began to ruffle making it even messier his eyes were a striking golden hazel which captured the attention of almost every girl at school minus of course the untouchable lily evans he was probably one of the two best looking guys at hogwarts though he was the seeker on the gryffindor quidditch team he was surprisingly muscular james always liked to torment lily asking her out at least five times a day but to his secret dismay she turned him down every single time hi james she replied with no enthusiasm whatsoever you d think he d get the hint that i dontlike him but no that big fat head is so thick even the constant telling him that i loathe him doesntpenetrate that thick skull of his how was your summer james asked with a huge grin on his face better when i didnthave to see you potter she spat back at him oh i i just she had totally caught him of guard with her sudden malice ya exactly she concluded well ladies first said sirius jumping in to save his best friend hide and bowing down to motion lily through the gateway first sirius was the other one of the two best looking guys at hogwarts he had shaggy jet black hair which reminded lily of a dog and mysterious blue eyes he like james was around 60 though maybe a little taller with a cunning knack of conducting huge pranks and attracting large amounts of trouble the most noticeable thing about him though was his sense of humor sirius was always cracking jokes despite the implication of his name well thanks sirius but seeing as you guys she motioned with air quotes were here first acting like immature first years you can go first lily of course looked at remus to let him know she wasntreferring to him remus was the only marauder lily could stand he had light brown hair and blue eyes remus was lily fellow prefect and would no doubt be head boy he was smart sensible and not completely prank crazy wow men it looks like we ve got a little firecracker in our hands james retorted mocking lily air quotes lily gave him a death glare and turned to walk through the gate without so much as a glance back ugh i hate him i have no idea how i going to be able to stand him a whole nother year lily thought to herself lily screamed two girls running up to her at top speed and almost knocking her over as they engulfed her into their traditional bone crushing hug lydia lara lily yelled back at them as she hugged them come on let go find a compartment so we can talk pronto suggested lydia lydia was one of lily best friends she had medium length wavy brown hair and warm hazel eyes she was average height at about 55 but had the personality that made her seem so much bigger lydia was not too skinny and not fat but she had the curves of an hourglass lydia was spunky funny and always there when you needed her lara lily other best friend helped her carry her things as lydia led the way shouting move it or lose it head girl and best friends comin through lara had long shimmery blonde hair and sparkling blue eyes she was the tallest of the three at 56 and looked like a model lara was so much fun to be around and when the three of them got together things could get quite crazy lara was one of the top girls in their class despite her sometimes ridiculously outrageous comments but then again she was blonde a n no offense my blonde haired beauties the girls found a compartment towards the front of the train they loaded their things into the luggage racks above their heads but kept their owls on their seats lydia grey owl misty lara multi colored owl rajah and lily auburn owl scarlett hey guys i have to go set up the prefects meeting see ya in a bit lily waved good bye to her friends changed into her robes pinned her head girl badge on her robes and proceeded to the prefects carriage as she opened the door to the room lily could not believe her eyes and stood there with her mouth open completely horrified hey everybody well this chapter pretty much explains itself in the title but it also cute and funny and lots of secrets are explained in it i was going to call it secret secrets but i changed it at the last minute i hope you like it and please if you took time to read my story please take a minute to review and i ll luv you even more i hope you enjoy the chapter thank you to all my reviewers i luv you all lots you know who you are now go and read and enjoy liane chapter 10 spitfire is an understatement ok let try this once more lily said both lily and james were changed from their quidditch robes clean and full from lunch just keep thinking about the pillow even though your attention is on the cup in charms lily best subject and james worst they had been learning how to control objects while they were concentrating on another task using the contrata charm the contrata charm was similar to wingardium leviosa but it gave the witch or wizard even more control over the object allowing him or her to focus on other tasks or even levitate more than one object at once lily was having james practice controlling the pillow while he moved the cup across the table with his hand unfortunately the pillow kept dropping out of the air every time he picked up the cup ugh it no good lils i just cantdo two things at once but thanks for trying to help this lost cause james sighed as he plopped down dejectedly next to lily on the couch sure you can you do it all the time breathing walking talking she trailed off as her attempt to lighten the mood failed and she saw the helpless look on his face so she thought for a second and decided to attack the problem from a different angle when you play quidditch you think about what going on in the game but you re still searching for the snitch right james nodded with still a trace of defeat in his eyes lily heart sank about a foot every time she saw that in his eyes those eyes usually so filled with life and joy and mischief of course well think of this pillow as the game and the cup as the snitch something sparked in james head as he jumped up from the couch he yelled yah that a great idea then whispered let try it as if plotting a very mysterious prank so lily set up the pillow and the cup as james cleared his mind james then swished his wand right then left then right again and flicked it at the pillow as he shouted contrata the pillow rose into the air and james moved his wand right and left and up and down making sure he had control james took a deep breath and lily crossed her fingers and silently prayed to herself that he would be successful very slowly james stretched out his hand uncurled his fingers and closed them around the handle of the cup james tuned his head to the pillow and moved it right and left again just as he moved it up again he turned his head back to the cup as he lifted it off the table he did it as he moved the cup across the table he made the pillow to somersaults in the air and just as he set the cup down one sharp flick of his wand sent the pillow sailing into lily gotcha james exclaimed with a triumphant smile on his face well i hope you re happy lily replied huffily aww come on lils it was only a joke james whined he hated when she was in a bad mood but he hated it even more when he caused it lily was now lying on the couch out of james sight lily i sorry i didntmean to thump lily hit him square in the nose with a huge feather pillow gotcha lily replied gleefully her act had worked but only for so long for james took a cushion off the couch and threw it at her arm but she was quick lily swiftly charmed the cushion and it hit james right in the bum as he had been bending over to pick up another cushion hey not fair you used magic james whined so first of all who said i can t second you started it using magic lily flashed him a devilish smirk as she flicked her wand and two pillows hit him one on each side lily giggled it ll be good practice for you or can you not handle trying to hit me with a few measly pillows and block them at the same time lily challenged although james wasntvery skilled at using the contrata charm he was exceptionally good with wingardium leviosa poor lily james showed no mercy and lily instantly fell victim to an endless attack of feathers and cotton james had gotten quite skilled at the art of pillow fighting as a result of the marauders daily pillow fights when they had all shared a dorm right and left pillows bombarded lily despite her best efforts a couple times she caught him in the face but finally she gasped ok i give up james was laughing still and hit her a few more times pretending not to hear i i give up she gasped again what what that i canthear you james yelled back as a huge grin spread across his face i said i give up she shouted from beneath the colorful assortment of pillows cushions and anything else soft and light james could spot ooooohhhh that what you said james teased as he ceased his pillow brigade i thought you said keep it up he innocently claimed as he collapsed back on the couch sure you did lily rolled her eyes as she tried to catch her breath james thought she looked very cute with her red cheeks they matched her hair and really accented her eyes her eyes you know you really are ruthless with those pillows i think i going to have some bruises lily joked as she collapsed beside him what is he staring at lily wondered james snapped out of his trance no you won t you re such a baby evans james rolled his eyes jokingly lily playfully punched his arm and realized how close they were the right side of lily body was pressed against james left as they were both sunken into the couch james eyes bore into her longingly she could see the happiness in his eyes and she wondered why she ever hated him this is all james ever wanted to be close to her lily could feel herself surrendering to james intense gaze and encircling aura she could feel the warmth of his body as their faces got closer as she stared into his eyes she got butterflies but since lily had never experienced this type of butterflies before it startled her and she sprang off the couch saying we better head down to dinner soon wouldntwant to be late nope wouldntwant that to happen james agreed completely crestfallen lily instantly saw the change in his eyes and felt awful but being who he was james covered with a smile and said you re right people might think we re up to something he smirked with a suggestive wiggle of his eyebrows and a wink at lily she laughed of course and gave him another soft punch in the arm james although dismayed about what had just happened was back in heaven no matter what she did if she smiled he could never stay upset every time she smiled james was in heaven and left completely breathless suddenly he felt something pulling at his arm come on james let go snap out of it lily continued to smile and tug on james arm so they could go to dinner finally james realized it was lily pulling on him and he jumped up and began walking with her to dinner in the middle of their conversation about pepper imps and sugar quills the two of them were interrupted by the familiar barking of sirius black hey potter where ya been all day moony wormtail and i were just planning our next then he cut his jogging pace to almost a slow tiptoe and noticed lily standing there you know our next our next chess night sirius finally found his words chess night james asked completely oblivious to what his friend was talking about you know where we go out and play chess sirius said desperately winking at his friend and something thankfully clicked in james head ooooohhhh chess night how could i forget is that really coming up yup tuesday night alright but you ll have to fill me in at dinner james gave a microscopic head nod in lily direction which of course she noticed chess night sounds interesting can i come lily innocently asked she had a pretty good idea what the two marauders were talking about but she was determined to play devil advocate each of the present marauders turned to each other with his eyebrows raised in shock ummm james stalled it s it kind of a guys night yah only the guys you know just us immature marauders phew that was close james thought to himself he wouldntwant to betray any secrets getting together to plan the next big slue of pranks lily nonchalantly accused james thought he was off the hook until yah whatever you two can just go fill each other in on what you re going to do to the next poor soul who crosses your path but so help me merlin you ll be sorry if it me and you lily speared a finger at james contrary to popular belief you are not the center of the universe as you have been so accustomed to thinking i have now learned that you are the universe and i for one am sick of it you think you can get away with anything like you own it all well newsflash mr big shot you may own the pranking field of hogwarts but you do not own me lily spat at him with that she wheeled around and stormed away leaving one marauder with his jaw dropped to the floor and his eyebrows raised to the ceiling while the other was completely horrorstruck feeling like his heart had just been dealt the avada kedavra curse ugh how could i have been so stupid lily scolded herself once a marauder always a marauder he doesntthink about anyone but himself james this james that pretty soon his head will be so big that he wontbe able to get up in the morning then another more reasonable voice interrupted lily private pity party lily you just need to let him be who he is and either accept it or let him go forcing him to change wontget you anywhere lily finally realized she was running but she didntknow or care where she was going i know all that lily first voice responded but i had just hoped that smack oh sorry lily apologized as she got to her feet rubbing her head she looked up at the person she had just run into lydia what are you doing here haha ouch that a nice way to greet your best friend lydia said as she rubbed her elbow what am i doing here what are you doing here lily by habit had run in the direction of gryffindor tower without even realizing it but as lydia looked up at her friend she knew something was wrong hey are you ok they had been friends for a long time and lydia could always tell when even the slightest thing was bothering lily i just lily head was bursting and she knew she needed to get this off her chest so she finally gave in to her best friend you cantsay anything to anyone ok l ady promise and lily stuck out her pinky to lydia ok lydia said suspiciously then she stuck her pinky out to lily l ady promise they twisted pinkies together kissed their own thumbs and then made tiny l by extending their thumb and forefinger as they bumped hips lily let out a little giggle as she remembered the time the l adies made their secret promise handshake how childish they had been but they kept it as tradition ok what up lily lydia sat against the wall right in the hallway well it james lily started lydia gave a huge grin upon hearing this as lily joined her on the floor i sure you ve noticed that we dontexactly hate each other anymore duh lils sorry but you re not very good at hiding your emotions lily blushed it was that obvious lydia nodded well living together and all we ve been becoming good friends lily stopped at this point unsure of whether she wanted to admit that she thought she actually started to like him almost as if she could read lily mind lydia cut into her thoughts we dontkeep any secrets here remember i wonttell i promised already lydia sweetly assured her lily smiled at her friend i know i just cantbelieve it you see i think i actually began to like him not wanting to have to stop lily continued well you know at first i liked him and i was just playing a little hard to get actually if i remember correctly you were the one who told me to do that both girls smiled remembering that day lily smile stopped abruptly and she continued but that was before lily trailed off unable to finish her sentence keri i know i know shhhhh it ok lydia hugged her friend as lily cried silent tears and wished that her mother was there to comfort her lily mother always knew what to do and how to make you feel better even without magic lily it was an accident you cantlet that dictate what other people are like i know and when we came back this year i decided to give james another chance i felt that i had been unfair to him and that i had underestimated what he really felt but every time he mentions pranking i just i just if i had just begged my parents to let her stay we would have never even been outside lily sobbed shhhhh lydia took her friend head and put it in her lap the two of them were like sisters as lydia combed her fingers through lily fiery crimson hair you just need to calm down and listen to me there was no way for you to know that your uncle of all people would have been drunk on that night at that time and pass the two of you lydia made lily sit up and face her look at me you and keri pulled pranks all the time on your relatives you tow were more like sisters than cousins and i realize how hard that must be but it was a harmless prank but it was my fault we shouldnthave even been out there she d still be here if i hadntsuggested it lily screeched through her uncontrollable sobs lily lydia tried to calm her again please listen to me your uncle was drunk he was depressed he didntknow you two were his nieces he thought keri was trying to mug him none of that do you hear me none of that was your fault it was a series of awful coincidences and accidents the prank was my idea you know we were just trying to have a little fun before she had to leave lily sniffled her tears now began to dry i know it wasntmy fault but whenever i hear of or see james pranking people i just think about that night and how different things would be now if we hadntdecided to pull an stupid immature prank i know lily but you canttake it out on james he is who he is and you either have to accept it or let it go i really want to accept it you know that but i dontknow if i can it so difficult lily gave a defeated exhale hey cheer up it ll all work out i promise you just have to realize that what happened to keri was an accident nothing more nothing less lydia grabbed lily hands and the two of them pulled on each other and stood up in sync now pepper up it dinner time lydia started leading the way to the great hall as lily trailed in deep contemplation you know i think i finally going to tell him about keri maybe he ll understand why i get so worked up about it it might help do you think so lily asked lydia thoughtfully lydia gave lily an unsure look are you sure you want to tell james potter of all people one of your most personal experiences lydia wanted lily to think about things but she had not expected lily to think of this thought she wasntupset by her decision she was intrigued she had thought that lily would just forget about james because she could not deal with the pranks lily bit her lip in thought then nodded her head i think i owe him an explanation after how i blew up at him i pretty sure he ll understand but you know me and my outbursts they dontcall me spitfire just because of the hair lydia gave a little giggle it your call lils i know but i have to be able to trust him if i ever want him to trust me wait lydia shouted and lily cringed afraid lydia would start interrogating her asking her what do you mean by if i ever want him to trust me instead lydia flicked her wand at lily face and muttered refreshimado and lily make up no longer stained her face together they walked to where lara was sitting eating andreading a book as lily passed james he realized her eyes were a little red and puffy and he hoped that she had not been crying hey everybody i know it been a while since i last posted and i apologize i ve been really busy and sick so i sorry but thank you for sticking with me here a nice long chapter for all of you i hope you like it please let me know what you think i truly appreciate all of the reviews i get thank you so much and please continue to review and i promise i ll get the chapters posted faster wink wink well cheers enjoy liane chapter 11 true magic during dinner little slips of parchment appeared at james and lily seats the notes reminded them about their meeting scheduled for tomorrow night though it seemed as if the notes should have come from dumbledore lily had a sneaking suspicion that the notes had been written by professor mcgonagall the look of surprise and enlightenment on the headmaster face as he read the note reminded lily of a little boy who had just opened a box at christmas that contained a cute little puppy throughout dinner lily couldnthelp herself from glancing over at james she wanted to apologize as soon as possible but she didntwant to do it while everyone was there she was a little relieved when she caught his eye every once in a while on the other side james couldnthelp himself from staring at lily either he feared that she was still upset with him james wished he could tell her what the chess night really was but it wasnthis secret to tell and the thought of her crying made him feel even worse after dinner lily went with lara and lydia to the gryffindor common room when they got there lily noticed the marauders whispering in a corner unusually quiet but lily followed her friends up to their room and found a welcoming familiarity about the room and its four poster beds so this halloween ball business lara prompted in a business like tone ah yes lara and i have given it more thought we think that as well as the games we can have categories to vote for cutest couple and best dressed and stuff like that you know lydia explained that an interesting idea we could have a little charmed goblet for people to put their votes in you know like the goblet of fire that way we can keep prats like malfoy from voting for himself a hundred times lily added excitedly yah that a great idea we hadntthought about that lara commented next hogsmeade weekend the three of us are going shopping lydia exclaimed lily gave her a confused look dontyou think it a bit early to be thinking about that i mean we donteven have dates well i guess you re right but i love shopping lydia whined oh shush let focus on the task at hand getting dates i know who i want to go with lydia you re working on sirius right lara asked well not working on so to speak more like eating out of the palm of my hand lydia exclaimed with giddy excitement hey now we can all go in the same group how do you figure lily asked very confused by the whole ordeal well lara and remus sirius and me and you and james what wait as second there little miss when i said we were friends i didntmean like that lily shouted then she continued more solemnly almost as if she were sad besides he probably doesntwant to go with me anyways whatever lily you are so blind you cantsee what right in front of you face lydia knew that honesty was the best way to go with lily she also knew that she wouldntbe terribly upset at her for telling the truth but now you ll just have to find a way to occupy yourself because lara and i are scheduled for our daily meeting in our win over the marauders plan she then turned to lara lara dearest the secret ingredient please lara stood up and grabbed a bottle of what looked like perfume off of her dresser she then sprayed some on herself and lydia then to lily disgust and confusion lara sprayed some on lily too lily wondered how long it would take james to start choking on the scent but to lily surprise the love spell perfume all of a sudden didntsmell so bad in fact it smelled like lilies and lavender once lydia and lara were satisfied with their quick primping lara led the way down the spiraling staircase while lydia explained their plan of attack apparently she and lara were not flirting madly with the guys but they were sparking conversation mixed with humor a little hard to get attitude and of course flirting all thrown into the mix then somewhere between the third and second years rooms lara stopped and explained about the perfume of course it wasnta real love potion but supposedly it was charmed to smell a certain way connected to the guy she was thinking about when she put it on it was supposed to take on the smell that that guy liked most on a girl when the trio entered the common room lily noticed max and mikey entertaining their friends in a corner opposite them were james sirius remus and peter huddled over a table talking in hushed voices lydia snuck up behind sirius and tapped his right shoulder as she slid behind his left sirius turned to his right and realized what was going on before she realized what was happening sirius jerked to his left and picked lydia up and slung her over his shoulder tickling her mercilessly as he went to set her down on a couch lara then walked up to remus as peter skulked away from the table surprisingly to go speak with a pretty fifth year girl hey remus are you alright you look a little on the down side lara asked with sincere concern in her voice remus stood up and assured her that he d be ok then politely asked her if she would join him by the fire the two of them took a seat in front of the fire and began a conversation that left lily standing by james as he began to clean up the table as he collected all the paper the marauders had been crowding around lily saw a calendar her eyes were immediately drawn to the highlighted square labeled september 17th she then noticed two small words at the bottom of the square they read full moon and something clicked in lily head this must have shown on her face because a concerned james quickly covered up the calendar and asked what up lily quietly but intensely answered tuesday is a full moon duh lily trying to cover james asked so what does that mean well it means that our friend remus will be going through some shall we say changes lily whispered seeing the look of horror on james face she explained you learn a lot about the person you patrol with especially if you re really good friends with him and he always gone at a particular time every month you know about that james asked with a surprised yet slightly afraid look lily nodded yup and now i understand the chess night thing sorry about that by the way i hahahahahahahahaha lara look lydia shouted loud enough for the whole gryffindor tower to hear lydia was in fits of raucous giggles she and sirius were obviously having a blast lily smiled to herself about her friends but knew that if she were going to tell james about keri that they would have to be somewhere quiet hey james i need to talk to you do you think we could go somewhere a bit quieter james could see the concern on lily face and instantly knew it was important so he nodded to her stood up and said good bye to his friends sirius cracked a wise comment about james and lily having to be alooooone and everyone laughed even james who slugged his friend in the shoulder lily noticed for the first time just how perfect everyone was she was surprised to see lara hand in the bashful remus and winked at her as remus laughed at sirius and james then she tuned to lydia and sirius and realized how perfect they were both were cute and absolutely hilarious and kept each other in check they were all just right you coming james almost whispered in lily ear nevertheless causing her to jump she nodded and followed him back to their dorm what that smell it smells like flowers lily then remembered the perfume and thought it slightly amusing not to mention ironic that james favorite scent was lilies oh it just some perfume that lara put on me you like it lily asked hopefully but then she hoped that james hadntsensed that in her voice yah it smells really nice like lilies my mom said that when she was pregnant with me she couldntget enough of that smell so my dad bought her fresh lilies every day i love that smell realizing that he may have said a bit more than he should have or than he wanted to say james turned a slight shade of pink lily giggled at him when he blushed which made him even more embarrassed causing him to blush even more but lily mood fell when she saw that it was only five minutes to 10 00pm i guess we ll talk when we get back we ve got patrolling duty yippee lily exclaimed with sarcasm dripping from each syllable it was james turn to laugh i didntrealize it was that late already i gonna go grab the map i ll be right back james then turned and sprinted up the stairs less than a minute later they were back in the common room together staring at the map ah ha target number one of the night ladies and gentlemen lucius malfoy and narcissa black empty classroom floor four james said with a game show host air and a huge grin that clearly showed he was indeed up to no good in about two minutes slytherin lost a whopping one hundred points as that was the third time malfoy and black had been caught but there were two others caught that night though they were doing nothing nearly as bad as malfoy and black with about thirty minutes left in their patrol james noticed two little dots on the grounds of hogwarts one was a male and one was a female the two were out by the lake no doubt going for a moonlight swim hey lily look who we have here james pointed out the two dots by the lake lily gave a surprised gasp and started giggling looks like we may have to break up this little flirt fest but we gotta be real quiet come on follow me and james led the way to the grounds the two reached the outside air and headed for the lake oh man it chilly out here dontyou think lily said as she rubbed her arms lily was in a t shirt and a pair of jeans on a chilly september night james who had jeans a t shirt and a sweatshirt on took off his sweatshirt and handed it to lily here you go you can wear this lily accepted his offer and felt much warmer when the sweatshirt engulfed her in the warmth it still retained from james body thank you and to lily own surprise she blushed james was so happy his stomach almost jumped out of his mouth hey there they are james whispered then he chuckled good ole padfoot sirius was in shorts walking into the lake and trying to pull lydia with him come on no one here you said you wanted to do something exciting so let go swimming lydia who was again in a bad state of the giggles was trying to hold on to a nearby tree to keep sirius from pulling her into the lake sirius no and she giggled some more come on i didntmean let go get hypothermia no no lydia then lost her grip on the tree as well as her footing gotcha sirius caught her and flung her over his shoulder for the second time that night and headed for the water honestly the water is quite warm i promise lydia sirius black what do you think you are doing out here james bellowed sounding a lot like the caretaker filch sirius froze and lydia stopped kicking lily couldnthelp it she burst out laughing sirius unfroze put lydia down and headed in lily direction lily hid behind james and shrieked as sirius burst through the brush they had been hiding behind with lydia running to catch up you sirius demanded in a scandalized tone as he tackled james to the ground i ll show you to sneak up on me with that sirius grabbed james leg and started dragging him to the lake james was laughing so hard that he didnteven try to fight the impending destination of ice cold water just the look on sirius face was enough for james to have the hysterics to endure the forbidden forest hey hey lily said to lydia as she wiggled her eyebrows at her a little midnight swim lydia blushed hehe yup i guess so it wasntmy idea though so dontyou look at me like that little lady looks like your plan is working lily said excited for her friend well lara and remus were getting pretty comfortable with each other if i recall correctly she was laying her head down on his shoulder as he was rubbing her back you know i think she may be doing better than me how about you lydia asked noticing the sweatshirt well lily began but she was interrupted as james swept her off her feet and sirius did the same with lydia both guys started towards the lake with the girls kicking and screaming the whole way they high fived each other as the girls got out their wands and mouthed one two three each girl cast a different spell on their respective capturer lydia cast a jellylegs hex on sirius which caused both of them to land in the water lily caused some water to douse the entire front of james body as a result james fell backwards in the shallow water with lily on top of him by this time sirius had freed himself of the hex and was chasing lydia deeper into the water lily laughed at them and james heart skipped a beat as he fell victim to that beautiful laugh how those emerald eyes lit up with life and happiness baffled james because no matter what he always found himself drawn to her startling beauty lily turned back to james to see him just looking at her with wonder instantly she too got lost in his eyes and just as soon as the butterflies invaded her stomach she found her lips getting closer and closer to james gently she shut her eyes and immediately felt the energy between their lips she slowly tilted her head to the left and prongsie what sirius cantyou see i a little busy james said extremely irritated that he had interrupted then again james and lily had intruded on sirius and lydia date lily quickly stood up and acted as if nothing had happened lydia shot lily a quick glance that said just friends huh in that annoying accusatory voice then she announced it past twelve maybe we should head back before filch catches us sounds like a good idea come on gag let go james led the way back to the castle after they had all dried their clothes with their wands james and sirius were talking to each other about the girls and the girls were giggling about the guys finally lily and lydia hugged each other good bye as sirius and lydia went towards the gryffindor common room and lily and james headed for theirs sweettarts james said to sir and lady zanath then he bolted into the common room out of lily sight as fast as lightning confused by the sudden change in james demeanor lily was slightly put out so she shrugged and continued to walk into the darkened common room wondering about how to explain about keri when boo james jumped out of the shadows causing lily to trip over a chair james caught her before she hit the ground and for the second time in an hour he fell victim to her emerald eyes lily couldntfight it anymore either and she felt his face getting closer and closer to her own before either had a chance to object james free hand the one that wasnttrying to keep lily from hitting the ground cupped around lily face as he pulled her in to him connecting their lips in their first kiss a kiss so powerful and true filled with such emotion and energy that sparks were flying literally from the tips of their wands sparks were soaring through the air but both lily and james were too wrapped up in the magic of their kiss and the feeling of each other embrace to notice well guys thanks for your reviews i thinking that maybe if i

slowly they both pulled apart and lily opened her eyes to see james looking at her with a sweet smile on his face lily found herself smiling as well and she blushed and quickly looked away james chuckled at her reaction and the complete insanity of the situation and lily joined in finally james was the first to speak it pretty late maybe we should go to bed i mean separately i didntmean together i mean not that i would mind i mean i just gonna stop talking now it was james turn to blush it alright i know what you meant lily smiled and giggled at him both just stood there mulling over the situation but each was quickly lost in thoughts about the other suddenly lily found herself being pulled up the stairs by james strong but soft guiding hand finally they reached the landing and james pulled lily into a warm encompassing hug good night my lily flower james sweetly whispered in her ear sweet dreams lily pulled out of the hug very slowly and held james hands in her own good night james and sweet dreams to you too lily smiled and realized that she couldntstop she thought of how stupid she must have looked just standing there grinning like an idiot but slowly despite her mad grin they each went to their own door as lily went through her door she turned and stole one last glance at the smiling james then gently shut her door lily let out a huge sigh and ran and jumped onto her bed unable to control her excitement she didntknow what to do so she did what came natural she wrote about it september 14th well 15th dear diary you ll never believe what just happened even if i swore it true over my charms book james yes the infamous james potter and i just kissed i dontknow how it happened one second i was thinking about how i was going to keep myself from blubbering like a baby while i told him about keri and the next we were kissing it just like like paralyzed me it was like i was flying and dreaming all at the same time but without the broom or the sleep i not sure how to describe it other that it was the most powerful and intense thing i ve ever experienced even more so than flying i guess now that i think about it it the weirdest thing that ever happened to me i mean i guess realizing that he not as bad as i thought he was really does make a difference there just something about him that makes me feel like i can do or say anything it different from any other person i ve ever met what does this mean i wasntable to tell him about keri though but i have to admit he kind of made me forget about it as i sure he forgot about it too i guess i just not ready to tell him but where do we go from here i not sure if it should be anymore than just good friends true we did kiss tonight but i just dontknow what does it mean when you begin to like a lot the person you couldnteven stand to be near but he so fun and safe i dontknow i ve just got so much going through my head not to mention i dead tired maybe sleep will clear my head thank for listening yours always lily so lily put her diary back in the bedside table and took a shower she thought more about the whole thing how fun the night had been by the lake how sirius and lydia had been so perfect and funny together they really did seem meant for each other as the saying goes this sparked another thought in lily head that made her a bit sad as she finished getting into her pajamas she thought they really are meant for each other but am i meant for anyone i mean will anyone ever look at me and however i end up with and say that we re cute lily then began brushing her teeth someone who fun and makes me feel safe someone like knock knock lily are you still awake james knocked on the head girl door and caused her to jump quite a few feet in the air ya won shekon she yelled back as clear as she could with a mouthful of toothpaste she quickly finished brushing her teeth and went to open the door on the other side was a recently showered james in flannel pajama pants and a t shirt you said before that you wanted to tell me something i forgot for a second because i got ah a little distracted he admitted a bit embarrassed he paused watching lily reaction closely it sounded like something important lily mind raced should i tell him umm you sure you re not too tired she tried no i alright if you are james resolved alright one sec lily grabbed her favorite blanket off her bed and proceeded down to the common room lily sat on the ground with her back against the couch right in front of the fireplace wanting to be on her level and of course closer to her james plopped just to lily left and faced her so that he could look at her while he listened i have to get this out so that you ll understand why i get so weird sometimes i not doing this to get pity or anything but i want you to know the reason lily took a deep breath it going to be kind of difficult to get this out so please bear with me james noticed a hint of panic and fear in her voice that caused him to wonder what was going on but not ask about it i sure you think i a nut for always getting on you about pulling pranks but believe it or not there is a reason lily took another deep breath and found comfort in james attentive face my cousin keri and i were like you and sirius we were like sisters and always pranking people when the two of us got together you knew trouble was coming lily allowed herself a moment to smile at the memories and james didntpush her well we were getting together to celebrate her birthday with the whole family it was keri and her foster parents my dad only brother my parents my brother and me it was pretty late but keri and i always had energy we tried to convince out parents to let her sleep over but her parents were going to church the next morning and had planned a family day so wanting to end the night with a bang we decided to pull one last prank it was here lily started to lose it she took a series of deep breaths to try to maintain her composure but of course james saw all of it he wasntsure what to do so he said nothing he didntwant to risk making her even more upset we decided that we d jump out at the next person to pass us we hid in the bushes lining the front walk from the front porch to the driveway there were steps from the porch to the walk and then further along the way steps from the walk down to the level of the driveway the next person to pass was our uncle my dad brother well you have to understand that he just lost his job and got divorced from his wife so he was really depressed and didntknow how to deal with it again lily paused remembering watching a shadow come out of the front door and stagger down the first set of stairs we jumped out and lily tried to speak but she was having trouble we we jumped out and screamed boo immediately we started laughing we never could keep straight faces while we were pulling a prank but keri went to give him a hug and apologize for scaring him almost right after we jumped out and lily started to cry james scooted himself closer to lily and wrapped her in a hug lily shoved him off pleading no i have to get this out so you know why so james released her and lily caught her breath see he was drunk because he felt it was the right way to deal with it he was just going outside to get some air he thought that someone was trying to mug him so he tried to shake her off by this time lily face was completely tear stained and she fell and hit her head on the corner of the steps lily put her head in her hands remembering the sickening crack of her head hitting the step and then the thud that directly followed as her body hit the driveway after rolling down the steps james didntcare if she cursed him into oblivion he wrapped his arms around the sobbing lily to his surprise and relief her muscles relaxed and she cried into his shoulder james had never thought there was a real reason for her disliking pranks he just thought she didntlike being pranked coupled with her natural stubbornness lily was lost in a sea of thoughts thoughts about keri thoughts about james thoughts about what compelled her to tell him thoughts about how he must think she just an absolute prat who needs pity she felt james fingers gently tickling her back but she didntfight it in fact it felt comforting and actually good it reminded lily of her mum and how she would never fail to make lily feel better even if lily felt it was the end of the world eventually lily tears stopped and her breath returned to its even rhythm james smiled as he looked down to find her sleeping slowly james grabbed a pillow from the couch placed it on his lap and gently eased lily head onto his outstretched legs as he continued running his fingers along her back he thought about all the times he and the marauders had pranked lily he felt really truly guilty and before he dropped off to sleep he brushed the hair from lily forehead and kissed it the he whispered i sorry lily but dontworry i ll always be here for you i swear on my life to never let anything bad happen to you as long as i live sweet dreams my lily flower and with that james let his head rest back on the seat of the couch and dozed off james woke first and looked down at the sleeping lily how peaceful she looked while she was sleeping it was hard to believe that only last night she had been completely beside herself in tears and grief james moved as little as he could and attempted to see the time but lily stirred despite his best efforts she looked up into his warm hazel eyes the deep russet brown foundation with flecks of inviting gold and a touch of olive green made lily breathless his eyes wrapped her up tighter than his arms captivating lily in their safety i was one of those moments where silence said everything they sat almost reading each others thoughts as they stared into each others eyes lily was the first to speak this time what time is it i not sure then james craned his neck around and turned back to lily with a surprised look it almost 12 30 oh cut it out that not funny lily scolded with a smile james wasntsmiling you re not joking are you fraid not james replied as he shook his head and we have our first quidditch practice today james grinned lily was up so fast james would have missed it if he would have blinked see you in a bit then she frantically sprinted up the stairs and into her room leaving james watching after her and shaking his muttering girls before he too followed suit and went up to his room to change up in her room lily grabbed her bag from try outs and removed her quidditch robes she quickly changed and snatched her wand and broomstick before heading for the stairs james was just leaving his room as well and asked ready yup she replied and they both headed to the great hall for a quick bite to eat before heading to the pitch the rest of the team had eaten earlier and had left to warm up before james and lily had even left the common room so there they all were gryffindor very own dream team as soon as they were all up in the air it was as if they could read each other thoughts they all moved together in fluid motion lily max and frank wove in and out passing and scoring as one asher did well too he blocked about half of their astonishing shots with the speed of lightning sirius and mikey had a blast smacking bludgers at one another they took turns defending their chasers to work on hitting the bludgers away james of course caught the snitch and then threw it away again only to find it and catch it within the next three minutes but aside from showing off james would also watch what the others were doing so that he could make suggestions and see how the team was progressing as a whole after two hours of starting and stopping for suggestions and new plays james voice was heard alright guys let bring it in so lily grabbed the quaffle sirius and mikey each wrestled a bludger and james made one final dive for the snitch though he didntdive because he needed to he did it to show off for lily who was to james excitement watching with a hint of admiration ok great practice today everyone i think things are coming along nicely sirius commented the team there are a few things we can work on to make our offense even stronger but dontworry we ll get to that on tuesday today was just to get used to each other james explained so get out of here you re all done sirius shouted wit his usual grin so they all walked back to the school asher and frank in the lead while the others trailed behind mikey on the far left of the group then sirius then max then lily and james max tried not to smile when he realized that lily and james were both trying really hard to hide the fact that they were holding hands now please just press that little review button and type in a few words that all i asking and i will forever be indebted to you i ll even give you a starting point 1 do you think i should keep the whole diary thing or should i get rid of it does it add to the story 2 does this story move too slow too fast 3 does the whole keri thing make sense let me know thanks for reviewing liane hey everyone thanks for reviewing you all made my entire week i was so happy to see all the reviews that i was literally bouncing off the walls thank you to everyone and just as i promised here are your answers sjpgurl i glad you think it all makes sense and i glad of course that you like it i glad you caught the staggering reference to tell you the truth i originally had the whole keri thing being explained when lily ran into lydia that one time but i thought that it would be more effective and a lot more powerful if the reader found out the whole thing at the same time as james i hope that made sense lol but where did you go you disappeared i hope you come back soon and i hope everything is ok thank you for the review and i hope you are able to update soon because i miss my daily dose spygirl4747 ya a lot of people liked the diary thing so i think i ll keep it and i really happy that a lot of people understand the keri thing it was a bit tough to pull off so i hoping that it alright i happy that you like my story and thank you so much for the review disastamasta i really flattered that you think i portrayed them well i worked really hard on that and i glad you like the reality part of it all i like that in stories too and i think you re right it would be a bit odd if she all of a sudden stopped writing i was hoping that the keri thing wasnttoo random but you know how it is sometimes the smallest things in your life can shape your outlook but thank you andi glad i ve got you as a reviewer i glad you like it chika sosser69 haha i glad you caught the part about james eyes i spent some time on that little description of course being a girl i had to comment on his eyes hehe but i also happy that you like the keri thing i was hoping that i would show that lily wasntjust uptight thanks for the review i glad you like it tamsididi thank you soooo much i really happy that you like story and no prob about reading yours they were a treat to me to read they had me laughing so hard i sure that my reviews didntmake laugh nearly as hard as your story made me laugh if that made any sense anyways lol sorry i just one random thought after another i really am flattered that you like the story the way it is hope you like this chapter thanks again mysteriouslily thank you for your review i glad that you think the diary is something that lily would do it unbelievably useful for the plot because i didntjust want her to be thinking people are usually thinking and doing something else so i thought i d give th diary journal a try glad you like the keri thing too i ll keep the pace comment in mind too thank you so much for your review smilelikeumeanit yay i so happy you like it i see where you re coming with the diary thing but i just didntwant to have lily just thinking all the time because people are usually doing other things while they re thinking you know haha anyways i hope that made sense let me know i glad you like the pace dontworry about problems and stuff i promise the strength of the group will be apparent by the end haha the james and lily thing they re not together officially but they re pretty close i think and hopethis chapter will show you a bit more about the others thank you for reviewing and i glad you love it olgreeneyes first i would like to thank you for your reviews they had me smiling but now for this chapter review about the diary i hope the story is not revolving around the diary is it i hope not but let me know if it is and the keri thing let me know if you need a clarification just ask and i ll be more than happy to answer it was one of those things that i thought about a bit later but i didntwant to go back and add anything to any earlier chapters because i didntwant to deal with reposting and stuff lol but i felt that lily needed a reason to not like pranking because i didntwant her to seem so uptight hope that makes sense let me know thanks for the review again and i glad you like the story captainoats princesssparkle first i d just like to say that i like your name it very unique i really happy and flattered that you really like my story i glad you like the pace too i understand about the diary but i just thought that it would help explain lily thoughts a bit more i admit that it sometimes a bit repetitive but i needed it earlier and i didntwant to have to go back and take it out i also did it because i didntwant to just have her thoughts because not a lot of people just sit around and think without doing something else at the same time does that make sense let me know again i glad you like the story even with the diary bit and thank you so much for the review so thank you to everyone i was really impressed with the review turn out thank you so much you have no idea how much you made my day when i saw all nine reviews for this chapter i am forever indebted to you if you have a story you d like me to read donthestitate to ask i love reading them thank you again and i hope you like this chapter liane chapter 13 unlucky thirteen the team split up and went to their own rooms to shower and change lily and james then headed to the gryffindor common room together to hang out with their friends as they walked in lily saw sirius lydia lara and remus all on one couch laughing and having a splendid time while peter sat in a chair looking lonely so lily went up to him and tried to start a conversation hey peter what up lily asked smiling oh umm not much i guess replied a nervous looking peter wormtail are you ok you look like you got hit with the slug stomach hex or something james added he had noticed that peter was looking a bit shifty as if he didntfeel well i fine peter exclaimed as he jumped up and ran for the portrait hole james and lily exchanged confused looks then james followed peter to see what was going on what was that all about lydia asked lily i dontknow i just tried to talk to him and he got all nervous or something lily answered thoughtfully maybe he sick lily shrugged it off and sat on a big armed maroon chintz chair lydia got up from under sirius arm and sat on the arm of lily chair so that her back was to the rest sirius and his pouty face and lara and remus holding hands and laughing so lydia began in an excited whisper what going on with you and james oh lydia do you ever give up lily replied giggling at the lunacy of her friend then lara realizing that she was missing out on some great gossip flew to the other arm of lily chair so lydia told me about your midnight swim and it your turn now spill lara demanded with a grin you two are so outrageous lily said with an eye roll to top all eye rolls but then she finally broke down after the girls tickled her and threatened to never stop until lily told them every single juicy detail ok ok fine lily said still laughing with her hands up in the air in surrender yay story time lara giggled in a whisper ok well we were patrolling and noticed that lydia and sirius were out by the lake of course lily left out the part about the map because she wasntsure if they knew i assuming i dontneed to go over what happened there right lily asked with a look of i m sure you already spilled that to lydia yup i know all about that already said an extremely giddy lara her tone then turned sarcastically babyish as she cooed at lily and how you and jamsie poo were lying on top of each other and lara was cut off by lily hand flying up and covering her mouth lily could feel lara lips curl into a smile and lily stuck her tongue out at her as she let go of lara yah yah yah but do you want to hear the good part or not miss smarty pants lily answered with a smirk ooooh spill it lily marie evans or i swear i ll tell everyone about last night lydia warned her friend with a threatening pointer finger and her dazzling mischievous smile ok ok no need to get hostile lily teased then she proceeded in a whisper well we went back to the common room and i was thinking about how to tell james about keri before i knew it james bolted into the common room and as i walked in he scared me i kind of lost my balance and almost fell over but he caught me and lily trailed off and gave her friends that look of raised eyebrows and a slight smile letting them know that they could guess what happened no way lara shrieked causing the entire common room to stare at the three of them as if they were nuts which they were then both lily and lydia put their hands over lara mouth and brought her back to a seated position who would have ever thought lily and james potter together not to mention kissing by the way is he a good kisser lydia asked with unbelievable solemnity despite the odd nature of the question and the fact that her hands were still firmly placed over lara mouth lily just looked at her to see if she was serious or not then said i dontknow you weirdo lily replied laughing in disbelief realizing that lydia was serious i dontreally have anything to compare it to it was really great though then lily got carried away in her thoughts it was like i was flying but without a broom i dontreally know how to explain it other than it was powerful and magical and wonderful lily said with her gaze cast at the floor as she remembered the kiss and the way it felt as a small smile crawled onto lily face lara and lydia looked at each other with smiles even bigger and gave each other high fives this jolted lily back to the present what lily asked her friends as they were now staring at her with smiles that they were both trying hard to conceal nothing lydia answered quickly still smiling just that the situation is too cute and you kissed james potter lydia whispered lara finally managed to free herself from lydia death grip and added that sounds so magical he caught you and then you kissed oh lily you re so lucky not that i not but you used to hate james and now amore lara finished with a dreamy smile come on lara we have some catching up to do it looks as if lily may get a date before us lydia joked with lara as she grabbed lara arm and pulled her off the chair to sit by sirius and remus once again before lily had time to defend herself or ask any questions lily watched her friends flirt with their victims she found it rather amusing for a while but soon began to wonder where james was and if he had found peter maybe he just needs to be alone for a bit that how mum is whenever she gets upset about something not that that happens a lot mum i haventheard from mum and dad since i got here lily thought so she snuck out of the gryffindor common room and walked to her own room to write a letter to her parents dear mum and dad i miss you so much i hope everything is going well with you how petunia school is going pretty well over here i sure max already told you but we both made the gryffindor quidditch team quidditch is that game i tried to explain to you with the four balls and a team of seven players on broomsticks remember it kind of hard to explain but it a lot of fun to play you should have seen max he was so nervous but it was cute and he did very well i miss you both sooooo much i hope you are doing well i already excited about coming home for christmas it not that i not having fun over here but i miss you guys well send scarlett back with a reply pretty please otherwise i may never hear from you again just kidding but i hope everything is great hope to hear from you soon love you yours always lily ps mum i have something exciting to tell you about so make sure there popcorn and hot chocolate when i get back it you know what i mean love ya lily reread her letter hoping that her mum would connect the dots and realize she meant she had a boy story to tell her of course she could just say it in the letter but then her mum would have so many questions when she read james lily also didntwant her dad to get suspicious though she was close with him he was still a guy but lily and her mum were like best friends if lily ever had any stories especially about guys they would sit up in lily room and eat popcorn and drink hot tea or hot chocolate they were very close and shared almost all of their thoughts lily mum was the only person who had known of lily second thoughts about james even from the beginning and since lily only came home for holidays during the year she would have a clear head about everything on rare occasions like the fifth year incident lily would send a letter about how upset she was and how stupid james was but her mum knew the fine line between lily love and hate for james even if lily didntadmit it lily walked to the owlery unable to quiet her brain it seemed to be going a million miles a second she was thinking of her mum and dad and how she missed them she thought of james and quidditch practice and head girl duties and homework and the halloween ball eventually lily found her owl scarlett up on a perch with misty and rajah lydia and lara owls lily grabbed a piece of twine from the basket propped on a stool put out for students to use and was caught off guard when a very eager scarlett swooped down from her perch and landed on lily shoulder now i know you ve been cooped up for a while so have a nice time and take this to mum and dad then lily helped scarlett take off and watched her fly out of sight lily soon heard someone coming up the stairs so she turned to the door to leave but she stopped dead in her tracks when a tall student with white blonde hair permanently wearing a disgusted sneer opened the door flanked by his two cronies the sneer turned to more of a sneer of delight as his eyes rested on lily what are you doing up here mudblood malfoy spat if you must know i was sending a letter to my parents now if you would please move i have some things i need to get done lily tried to remain calm but it was quite a feat to accomplish when her blood was boiling in her veins oooh mail to those vile mudblood producing gits who shame and taint the pure line i shall like to send my wishes to them disgusting malfoy hissed through his teeth better than having voldemort worshipping attention striving oh look at us we re friggin pure bloods for parents lily shot back with fire in her eyes even though malfoy was about a foot taller than her she still came face to face with him how dare you speak that way to me you filthy little mudblood and with that malfoy made a huge mistake as he spat the insult at lily he backhanded her across the face lily stumbled backwards and felt her eyes water her face stung but she straightened up looked straight into his cold heartless blue eyes and retorted didntyour mother ever teach you to never hit girls or does she lack the same fundamental manners as you malfoy gave her a snide look and casually sauntered to the basket of twine and picked out a piece as he tied his letter to his owl hades ankle he nonchalantly replied well you see i dont hit girls but seeing as you re a mudblood that exempts you from being qualified therefore i suppose i could hit you as much as i wanted to malfoy now started circling lily like a cat on the prowl those of us with pure ancestry know that but i understand you re not aware of the facts you re just not shall we say high class enough lily was shaking with anger but was soon brought to her senses when malfoy sharply turned on her she thought quick and pulled out her wand which caused malfoy to slow his attack and retreat a bit as he too pulled out his wand in the background lily could hear crabbe and goyle guffawing and cheering on malfoy in their low unintelligent voices but lily couldnthear exactly what they were saying because her blood was pounding unnaturally loud in her ears finally she found some courage and her voice donteven think about it malfoy step out of my way or you ll be sorry oh my merlin what are you going to do to me malfoy mocked fright as he resumed circling her let see it you and me that one vs one but then there crabbe and goyle and he sarcastically acted surprised and no one else hmm looks to me like it three against one here and you re telling me to move then lily heard his evil cackle that sent chills through her body icy chills that suddenly turned to fire malfoy must have seen the change from fear to her well known fiery malice because he spooked for a second so you want to play malfoy baited regaining his usual scorn i dontknow do you think you can handle it lily paused debating whether to go but soon she was speaking again unable to activate the filter in her brain the filter that divided the thoughts in her head into the two categories of thoughts that should stay in her head and ones that should come out of her mouth a trait she received from her mum didntyour mum tell you to never play with fire my mum was smart and caring enough to tell me but then again your mum doesnthave a very good track record does she i guess she just doesntcare about you or maybe it because she just not plain smart enough lily silently cheered herself on but a split second later lily realized it was a mistake she quickly focused back to the situation just in time she saw malfoy mouth begin to form words and his arm begin to lift lily had to think quick or she knew she d be toast so she darted behind the basket of twine almost quick enough the spell grazed her left arm and immediately lily could feel warm liquid soak the sleeve of her robe lily then shot up behind the basket while malfoy was readying himself for his next attack and hit him with a bat boggy curse malfoy managed to get one last hex out before lily curse hit him and it grazed her left cheek it was enough pain to cause lily to have to hide behind the basket again holding her cheek trying to stem the flow of blood why you bloody little mudblood excuse for a witch i going to but what malfoy was going to do to her lily would never find out the owlery door burst open and lily could hear the voices of james potter and his best mate sirius black shouting curses at the three pieces of slytherin slime lily had never been so happy to hear their voices lily jumped up from behind the basket and stared at the scene malfoy face was still covered in bat boggy but now he also had pulsing boils all over his arms to match and james was still going after him it obviously wasntdifficult for sirius to send crabbe and goyle into a frenzy of fear crabbe had been hit with a jellylegs hex and as goyle was trying to unhex him while sirius was using wingardium leviosa to send dropping strewn straw into their faces he obviously found it amusing suddenly james yelped in pain lily turned to see him get kicked in the stomach by one of malfoy flailing legs malfoy could see anything so he just swung his limbs everywhere in an attempt to save himself eventually he found his way to the door but not before he hit james in the side with the same curse he had thrown at lily crabbe and goyle stupidly scrambled after malfoy with sirius running after them and like the madman he was he repeatedly screamed dirty vermin on the loose catch them before they infest the castle i not joking i sirius lily unfroze from her state of shock and frantically sprinted over to james are you ok she sat down right beside him of the bone covered floor james attempted to sit up but lily shoved him back down a bit too hard this caused james to gasp in pain you stay right there james potter gee i not dead yet but if you push me like that again i might be james gingerly reached his arm to feel his side where malfoy curse had struck him well that what you get for fighting lily replied huffily and quickly added what were you thinking you know it against the rules james could not believe her quickly he sat up to avoid lily pushing him down again but he instantly realized that was a big mistake he recovered quickly from his bout of dizziness and nausea and looked at her in complete disbelief that what i get for fighting james yelled between gasps of air and then shook his head in incredulity i just came in here and probably saved your life and you tell me that what you get for fighting you are unbelievable lily was still so shaken that she wasntbeing very reasonable even though she thought she was she was so upset that james was hurt that she dealt with it the only way she knew how by fighting with words saving my life is that what you call sitting here on the floor covered in blood arguing with me i should think not lily replied quickly rising to her feet she saw him give an exasperated sigh coupled with an eye roll and shake of his head sighing herself lily hooked her elbows under his arms and started to pull come on let get you to the hospital wing james rose to his feet in silence he didntwant to speak to lily at the moment partially because he knew it wouldntdo any good but more so because he felt that if he tried to speak his side might split completely open look lily began i sorry i just hate that you re hurt and i guess ow oh sorry what wro oh my gosh lily you re arm and your cheek james had just grabbed onto lily left arm for support down the stairs and realized her injuries for the first time we need to get you to the hospital wing right now lily laughed at james psychosis here he was the one losing copious amounts of blood and he was worrying about her mere scrapes whoa there tanto keep your pants on just what james was looking at lily with extreme suspicion clearly not understanding what she meant sorry to burst your bubble poppit james began tentatively but i not tanto who is that anyway and i was not about to take my pants off yet he added for kicks excuse me then she laughed it off remembering keri and how they always said that when people got a bit too excited i didntmean that you are tanto she giggled some more it just an expression you know like hold your horses get it sure james replied still obviously confused they continued walking in silence for a bit each needing their breath james side felt like it had just been hacked at by a meat cleaver and he couldntwaste the energy lily was acting as james crutch and since he was a giant compared to her she was having a bit of trouble keeping her legs going but lily wasntused to james being quiet so she was getting a bit weirded out so how did you know what was going on i mean where i was or that i was being attacked lily asked well after i talked to peter which he acting a bit odd now that i think about it anyways after i talked to him i went to find you i thought you d still be in the gryffindor common room so i went there first here james took a deep breath his side was beginning to burn so he tried to settle his pain down by breathing deeply the gang said that you had left and that they thought you went to look for me so i went to our common room to see if you were there when i couldntfind you i just well i james blushed you what oh come off it james what happened you loon lily prompted with a smile well i guess i could kind of sense that something was wrong it like i could feel that you were in trouble he paused a second to swallow his nerves and catch his breath he didntknow why but he was nervous about tell lily something so personal that he thought i know it sounds stupid but i felt it so i went to my room and grabbed the map when i saw you in the owlery with malfoy i knew i was right again james had to pause and catch his breath it was getting more and more difficult for him to breathe talk and walk all at the same time so i grabbed sirius for back up on the way i couldntfind peter not that he would have been much help and remus is well due any day now if you know what i mean yet again he paused to breathe so the two of us raced as fast as we could and you know the rest towards the end of his story james had been getting even more breathless more quickly he was getting even dizzier but he shook it off as best as he could he was a bit relieved to begin climbing the stairs because he knew that they were close but that also meant even more physical exertion well thanks lily said as she blushed and looked away from james she then mentally slapped herself back into the real world and focused on getting james up the stairs and into the doors of the hospital wing lily realized that james body was getting heavier with each step but she attributed it to the rapidly growing fatigue in her legs come on james just a little further and you can lie down on a nice comfy hospital bed but all of a sudden lily was hit with the full weight of james body and she could no longer hold it they both fell to the ground just outside of the hospital wing doors lily looked at james and realized he was as pale as a ghost how could i have not noticed his face draining lily how come you didntwalk faster or try harder lily screamed at herself then her melancholy jade eyes now filled to the brim with stubborn tears refusing to fall traced the path they had just walked she was hit with the realization of all the blood covering the floor drops footprints and small pools where they had paused to readjust or catch their breath marked where they had walked lily heart stopped as she turned her gaze back to james lifeless body in her arms she couldntmove she couldntspeak she couldntbreathe all she could think was that she had just let james potter die after he had just saved her

chapter 14 it ll be okay lily you need to get a hold of yourself breathe see he not dead he breathing he just really weak now get him some help yell do it lily inner conscience coached her through her shock as usual with the voice of her mother help madame pomfrey someone help lily shouted please blood lots of it help lily was now sobbing and in such shock that she was unable to make complete sentences now now deary what all the racket lily could hear the calm disapproving voice of madame pomfrey the short plump healer for the school through the doors the relaxed voice had just the opposite effect on lily it made her upset not being able to understand why madame pomfrey was so calm but it wasntlong before that composure was lost now what is it dear what going oh my heavens madame pomfrey jumped back with her hands on her heart please help he needs help lily pleaded tears freely streaming down her face of course vera get a bed ready now she called to the small healer in training madame pomfrey with one swish and flick of her wand whisked james limp body from the ground into the wing and onto the bed vera had just prepared then immediately she began working on james lily tried to see if he would be alright but curtains were put up and madame pomfrey instructed vera to attend to lily injuries the small spindly woman did not appear to be but nevertheless was quite strong lily kept trying to get up to see james but vera restrained her i just want to know if he ll be ok lily screamed and struggled in angst after lily last desperate attempt to see james by causing vera to dodge a hex vera finally forced a powerful sleeping draught into lily lily felt her muscles seize up her limbs and eyelids gain at least a thousand pounds each then suddenly she wasntaware of anything in a deep state of sleep when she finally woke up it took lily a couple seconds to remember where she was and why then it all hit her one huge wave of misery after another malfoy the letter the threats the pain james oh god james lily bolted out of her bed and across the small aisle to where james bed was her arm stinging the whole way there she ripped back the curtains to find a bed but no james the feeling of complete and total despair rippled through her like an icy chill he was gone and she couldntdo anything lily collapsed to the ground and began sobbing she couldnthelp it but she didntreally want to stop it either she didntreally care if the whole world came in and saw her in her present state james was gone lily only wanted her mum there with her she didntcare how childish it seemed she needed her mum and just as lily thought it a hand was placed on her shaking shoulder the touch was so incredibly soothing that she knew it had to be her mum lily turned to the comforting touch to look up into her headmaster sorrowful twinkle less eyes it alright miss evans james is just in the back room over there dumbledore tried to reassure her it not that lily wasnthappy that james was still close but it was the intensity of professor dumbledore gaze that scared her is he going to be alright lily choked out through her attempts of suppressing her sobs he should be alright but i afraid that i cannot let you see him professor dumbledore admitted with sorrow still in his eyes or was it extreme disappointment distress lily couldnttell why why canti see him i need to see him i need to tell him thank you for saving my life i need to lily screams suddenly turned into heart wrenching sobs saving your life the confused professor dwelled on the words for a moment then concluded to move on with his initial plan of action lily i think you need to tell me what happened i need to know exactly who when and why if possible a sudden authoritative tone entered his voice with new interest as the twinkle in his eyes returned it was such a change that lily immediately ceased her crying and sat up straight as the headmaster joined lily on the cool wooden floor of the hospital wing please start from the beginning well james and i went to the gryffindor common room after quidditch practice today wait what time is it lily asked realizing it was pitch black outside with the exception of a few stars fighting to be seen beneath the thick clouds about 11 30pm it is still sunday he answered thank you i just wanted to make sure it was still sunday then lily explained the entire story to her headmaster only leaving out the little part about the marauder map which luckily for lily he didntask any questions about after a minute or so of professor dumbledore processing the story lily asked is everyone else alright even though lily really didntcare about the slytherins she thought it would be rude to only ask about sirius well i assuming they are all alright you and james were the only two not at dinner i would assume that by the time you and james were on your way to the hospital wing dinner had already begun and that would be why you didntsee anyone dumbledore trailed off and looked particularly thoughtful you know miss evans james lost a lot of blood so it will take at least until tomorrow afternoon for him to fully heal can i see him lily inquired hopefully i am afraid that only family is allowed in the room at this time michael is in there with him right now as for you i think you should go back to bed and sleep the rest of the night here dumbledore stated as he rose to his feet sir are you sure i cantjust pop my head in for a second lily was really content on seeing that james was alright she still could not get the image of his pale face or the feeling of his unnaturally cold limp body out of her head well you see miss evans madame pomfrey is very strict about her rules so if i helped you to break one poppy would most likely diagnose me with some illness that would prevent me from ever eating a cockroach cluster again but poppy is currently in her office filling out paper work i personally happen to know that mr potter door is unlocked as he said this professor dumbledore ever so slightly tipped his head in the direction of the door then continued i am going back to my office to get some sleep you will be alone for ten minutes before madame pomfrey comes to check on james behave yourself and do not break any rules lily stared in puzzlement at her headmaster as he spoke but when he finished with a minute wink of one ocean filled eye lily understood professor dumbledore helped lily to her feet and with a nod said good night miss evans then he simply strode away and softly closed the door behind him almost instantly lily raced to the room occupying james though she tried to enter noiselessly both mikey and james started when she came through the door sorry lily whispered with a slight wince oh hey lily greeted a sleepy mikey what time is it almost midnight lily answered really oh man i better get to bed i ll see you later lily bye james mikey said with a brotherly squeeze of his hand then mikey left to go back to his room and lily was left alone with james lily half jogged half sprinted the short distance to james side and as soon as she was there she held his hand in hers for a moment lily just held his hand thanking god for the warmth of it as she so vividly remembered the iciness of his skin as she held him in the hall hey lily how are your arm and cheek james asked her quietly lily thought to herself about how crazy james was here he is the one mortally wounded asking how i am with my tiny scratches my arm and cheek are fine you nut how are you doing much better now what happened anyway the last thing i remember is explaining how we found you and then going up the stairs and then i blacked out i dontremember anything the next thing you know i in a hospital bed with mikey sitting next to me james eyes then got that glazed look of someone working very hard to think of or remember something well we made it up the stairs and you collapsed i thought you were dead lily hoped james couldntsee how hard she was fighting to hold back the tears building in her eyes as she recalled the events so visibly it was hard not to feel the same emotions she had felt at the time i screamed for help and madame pomfrey finally came james you lost so much blood lily whispered more frantically than she had intended to james brought his hand to her shoulder and tried to ease her pain he had read somewhere about this girl in america who could make people feel better with her mind and he hoped that it was working on lily i tried to stay with you but she wouldntlet me then they put me to sleep by forcing that awful sleeping draught down my throat lily grimaced just at the thought of it it ok now see i all in one piece james gave her that inside melting smile as he held out his arms to show her he was alright lily smiled and took james open arms as an offer for a hug she pleasantly surprised him by curling into him as best as she could while keeping her feet on the floor but then she remembered about the time restraint and pulled out of the hug i have to go in a few minutes though madame pomfrey will have a fit if she sees me in here but before i go i just wanted to say thank you i dontknow what would have happened if you hadntshown up and i didntget a chance to really tell you lily looked quite distraught as she explained this remembering the moments when she was thinking that she wouldntbe able to say thank you ever lily i should be thanking you if you hadntbeen there i would have laid in the owlrey and probably died james tailed off finally realizing the weight of these words you re funny if i hadntbeen there none of this would have happened lily tried to give a little smile ya i guess you re right james teased as usual lily gave him a soft punch in the arm ow oooch careful there this is a very fragile package james tried to joke as he grimaced in pain sorry lily apologized as she frantically gave him a hug but what was intended to comfort him was a bit too hasty and ended up making it worse ok lily calm down fragile i need bubble wrap lots and lots of bubble wrap james joked now taking short spastic breaths i so sorry james lily pulled away and sat in fear of hurting him which james found slightly amusing i should be going i dontwant madame pomfrey mad at either of us get better soon i guess i spending the night here but i have to go to class tomorrow i ll get your homework for you though now get some sleep of course all of this was said in a whisper for fear of alerting madame pomfrey lily then tucked james in and gave him a peck on his forehead as he said good night my beautiful lily flower sweet dreams good night james lily replied as she slipped out of the room closing the door behind her lily then hopped back into bed just in time to prevent herself from being seen by madame pomfrey it felt like only two seconds to lily but a few hours later she was awoken by madame pomfrey and sent to get ready for class lily showered dressed and prepared herself for the tsunami of questions that she knew would bombard her at breakfast as lily entered the great hall just as she predicted lydia lara sirius and peter plus mikey and max all ran over to her practically knocking her to the floor remus of course lily thought was indisposed but the thought was quickly forced out of her mind as her friends almost all at once began asking are you ok what happened where james what going on what were you doing what going to happen to whoa guys one at a time lily put her hands up to gesture a stop as well as ward off any blows i fine and james is fine too he ll be back in class after lunch so you can all just take a deep breath and a chill pill lily chuckled at her friends and sat down at the table but lily what happened lara asked eagerly lily then proceeded to tell the story again of yesterday adventure this time to her friends who reacted at every perfect part as if rehearsed some ooh s some aaah s but the most memorable was lara outburst as she heard the things malfoy had said to her friend she surprised everyone even sirius when her normally civil tongue spoke why that unbearable revolting pretentious arrogant ass lily had stopped in mid sentence to ask if her friend had just swore for it was a very very very rare occasion for lara to swear so lily gave her friend a high five for the great insult that malfoy of course deserved and then of course there was sirius expected comment as he entered the story your own personal knight in shining armor at your service comes to save the day sirius said the very last part in a sing song voice which was brought to attention by lydia teasing begging him to never sing again as long as there are living things in the universe we all like being alive thank you as lily told the very end of the story she did so with her head down to her plate not wanting her friends to see the pain and worry in her eyes looking for a change of subject lily realized how incredibly hungry she was with her head still down lily began eating ravenously but when she looked up at her friends she saw that they had obviously not dropped the subject and she had to try insanely hard not to let orange juice come out her mouth or nose all six faces were staring at her in such disbelief and wonder that she thought they looked like fish out of water what we re ok now lily assured them but but wow lara whispered thankfully for lily the mail came preventing any awkward questions from being asked immediately lily spotted scarlett then held out her arm as scarlett swooped down then landed on it lily untied the letter attached to scarlett leg and began reading as scarlett helped herself to some of lily now abandoned breakfast dearest lily it so good to finally hear from you we re all doing well over here but we miss you and your brother so much petunia is good she actually engaged isntthat wonderful she getting married to vernon this coming summer we re very happy for her we re so happy for you and max too congratulations on making the quidditch team we hope you do well this year we really miss you and love you we cantwait for christmas either i know we said we wouldntgo crazy on presents this year but i found the perfect present for you but donttell your dad haha he ll think i crazy but i cantwait to hear your story lily does it by any chance have something to do with a certain young man named james james potter maybe but of course i ll have the hot chocolate and popcorn ready i hope everything is going well for you we miss you and we love you say hi to max for us love mum dad and petunia now it was lily turn to stare in disbelief how did she know it was james sometimes i swear that woman has seer blood in her lily thought to herself as she tucked the letter into its envelope but she was soon jerked out of her thoughts by lydia pulling her from her seat to go to muggles studies lily shoved the letter into her bag and thought about how great christmas was going to be but then remembered that it was only the third week of school everyone took their seats and class began today they were learning about equipment that muggle doctors used x ray machines ct scanners mris etc hey lydia what if i used that x rai thing on you hmm i wonder what color bra you have on sirius wondered sirius black lydia hissed cantyou ever take anything seriously then she followed with a pretty good slug in the arm but dearest sirius cooed at her i always sirius oh no did you take me for someone else does that mean you really dontwant to be my girlfriend sirius asked in a scandalized then extremely hurt tone oh seriously black you are going to be the death of me lydia rolled her eyes but saw the hurt look on his face making sure the teacher wasntlooking lydia gave sirius a quick but sweet smooch on the lips sirius then imitated cartoon characters by hanging his tongue out of his mouth panting like a dog and then pumping his arms in and out from his chest imitating his heart beat lydia just giggled at him and lily who had been observing the whole ordeal thought it was all very cute she once again thought that they were for sure absolutely perfect for each other lily then found her thoughts turning to james she found herself hoping that she and james were that perfect together but then quickly shoved the idea out of her head no matter how perfect it may feel lily knew that it could never be perfect lost in this train of thought she started arguing with herself she really didntknow why she thought that it couldntbe perfect because she did want it to be but there was this nagging feeling telling her that for some reason their ending would never be fairytale material lily finally got hold of her whirling thoughts and scolded herself for being so unreasonable of course i ll be able to have a fairytale ending it what every girl dreams about and what every girl deserves or at least one close enough where i ll be in love with someone and live happily ever after if i want it bad enough it will happen i know it will could james be my prince char miss evans lily snapped out of her daydream yes professor i sorry lily blushed a deep red almost matching the color of her hair what was the question dear please do try to pay attention what does a muggle doctor use to mend a broken bone the professor asked the question again slightly flustered at the head girl caught daydreaming in class that would be a cast lily responded a mixture of gauze and plaster shaped to cause the broken bone to heal correctly they come in many different colors you can also get them waterproof thank you dear that is correct a cast the professor then went on to elaborate on the subject wow lily sarcastically thought to herself what a great omen here i am dreaming about my happily ever after with james and i get in trouble sniffle sniffle only a measly seven reviews i know you all can do better than that come on you guys are what

report on my insanity but i happy to make your day you re so sweet i love your story and you make my day with your reviews too thank you again chapter 15 betrayal well well well look what the lily dragged in sirius teased as james walked into the great hall just in time for dinner prongsie sirius yelled at him receiving a head nod from james how are the battle wounds general prongs remus asked as james sat down and instantly began piling food onto his plate fare aw kai james attempted to speak through his mouthful of food but only succeeded in spraying his friends with bits and pieces of mashed potatoes and steak you may want to try first actually chewing and then swallowing your food before you start talking joked a smiling lily who was now joining the marauders with her two fellow l adies james then very politely smiled chewed and then opened his mouth to display his chewed food james lily half laughed and half yelled and at the same time lydia and lara uttered exclamations of disgust then proudly so everyone could see james gulped down his food was that better james asked with the look of triumph still on his face i guess if you were trying to imitate little baby robins waiting for their mother to regurgitate worms for them to eat lily said with sarcasm dripping off every word as she shook her head in disbelief so what took you so long i would have been able to come back during lunch but madame pomfrey threatened me with a sleeping draft when i stood up and almost took a header into the bedside table she said that she was still worried that i had lost too much blood or whatever james shrugged and shoveled even more food in his mouth did she make you drink blood to gain it back lara asked the group turned and stared at her what james asked with a look that combined disgust horror and disbelief all in one well i read about this famous author she looked toward the ceiling in thought i think his name was albert camus yes that what it was she exclaimed as she tipped her head back down to face the bewildered faces of her friends he was coughing up a lot of blood from tuberculosis so his uncle made him drink blood to gain it back eww lydia exclaimed as everyone looked away and exhibited some form of disgust except remus that quite interesting really it amazing how muggle medicine has evolved remus commented causing lara to blush anyways sirius shook up the scene us marauders need to go have a meeting so if you would kindly excuse us we will see you lovely ladies later sirius winked at lydia and began heaving his friends from the table james gave one last longing look at the food or maybe it was lily but followed his friends after nearly four hours of gossip and magic makeovers lily had had quite enough girl time so with her little mermaid look lily favorite muggle movie character she headed to the common room lily hair was in big thick curls while her eyes sported tri color shades of violet eye shadow and some light pink gloss on her lips the girls had also put long thin metallic curly green ribbons at random places throughout her hair it had been fun with two other girls making themselves look like dolls along with her but lily now felt like a clown with all the make up on and since she was the only one at the moment she felt even more out of place sweet tarts lily announced to sir and lady zanath the couple smiled at her and let her into the common room the sight that met her made lily smile there was the big bad james potter sleeping at the table and drooling over his defense homework oh what a nut lily sighed to herself she gently shook the sleeping james wha no lils please dance with me please go with me james sat up with his eyes still closed obviously still trapped in his dream yes of course i will lily quietly whispered to herself and pausing as she imagined how utterly wonderful in would be to go to the dance with him then she tore herself away from her thoughts and shook james again causing him to finally wake sleepily his half closed eyes rested on lily and he nearly jumped out of his skin much less his seat at the sight of her after all she was dressed like the little mermaid what lily asked a bit frightened by his reaction dreading the next words out of his mouth quickly james recovered and started at lily he couldntbelieve what he was seeing he had never thought lily eyes could get any greener but here she was in front of him her emerald eyes sparkling brighter than he d ever seen them lily blushed under the gaze james was casting on her and she felt the butterflies again the butterflies of nervousness and elation all flying intricate patterns in her stomach causing the familiar but minor queasiness finally aware of the drool on his face and book embarrassed james swiftly wiped it off with his sleeve thankful for the slight break in the intense staring lily caught her breath that until now she was unaware was being held sorry it just your eyes well they re really really green james exclaimed in amazement he couldntthink of anything to cover with so he told her the truth but now that it had actually come out of his mouth he mentally kicked himself for sounding so pathetic and stupid oh lily responded thoroughly surprised yet equally pleased i think it just the make up you see lara informed me that green eye shadow on green eyes makes them less green but if you put on a different color especially brown or purple lily took a deep break and blushed a deeper red sorry i rambling again no i like it i mean the eye darker stuff if that what you call it and of course your rambling too it looks nice i mean not that you didntlook nice before i mean you did you looked beautiful before and now too i lily put a finger to james lips and giggled at his craziness they both seemed to cause the same effect on the other nervousness and then a constant flow of thoughts in the head and out the mouth before actually knowing what was being said i glad you re ok you really had me scared lily thought back to the night before and was amazed at how much it had really affected her she and james hadntreally talked about it of course there was the five minutes that night but that wasntnearly enough time nor even close to the ideal circumstances to talk about something like that yah me too thank you again lils sincere gratitude flowed from james mouth as well as from his honey chocolate eyes lily didntsee it coming but in the next second james had her wrapped in his strong arms i dontknow what i would have done without you james whispered in her ear oh james i dontknow what i would have done if i d lost you lily whispered back trying to keep her voice strong and her knees from giving in to the shivers he sent down her body but after all this was the second time lily had come face to face with death and she was extremely thankful that this time they all survived james leaned back from the embrace so he could look at lily but still hold her close i promise i ll never leave you lily i never want to see you this sad so i promise that as long as i have the strength to breathe i ll be here with you james strong and assuring voice comforted lily but she couldntkeep her eyes from tearing i ll never leave you either lily gasped out before she pulled james back into the hug not wanting to ever let go after a couple of lingering minutes wrapped in the safety and comfort of each others arms they pulled away and without a word they both started gathering james things then they climbed the stairs to the landing and went into james room to put his things away james then walked back into the hall with lily thanks again lily i dontknow how i could ever repay you for something like that but i hope you have sweet dreams i hope you do too james lily replied as she giggled good night lily said as she once again curled into james he kissed the top of her head and whispered good night my lily flower then gently kissed her soft glossed light pink lips leaving lily breathless he looked down at her face with her lips parted and her eyes still softly shut he smiled and kissed her forehead once more before releasing her with a last goodnight and going back to his room as lily went to hers the next day remus was not in class and only the marauders and lily knew why true to her word lily had never told anyone about his secret even since the every first time she had even thought it could be a possibility but with lara getting worried and asking questions things got a bit weird at lunch but lily lara whined couldntyou just ask james i mean he one of remus best friends lara if you re so worried why dont you go and ask james lily retorted she didntmean to sound callous but she had already endure half a day too much or lara constant interrogating ask me what james and his fellow marauders minus remus of course came over and sat next to the girls ask you if you know where remus is lara persisted when several seconds passed with no answer she figured that they obviously didntunderstand do you know where he is he not feeling well but you knew that james responded yah he got real bad fall allergies and a weak immune system poor guy he always getting sick sirius added well i think i ll go visit him and make sure he alright lara stated as she rose from the table no james sirius peter and lily shouted at the same time as lily pulled her friend down both lara and lydia looked thoroughly confused he not in the hospital wing madame pomfrey said the best thing for him is rest so he in his room sirius replied without so much as a blink as if he d said this exact same thing a thousand times before plus he doesntlike the hospital wing anyways well i dontsee why i cantgo make sure he alright said a very exasperated and annoyed lara he contagious james replied yah he got a nasty flu bug sirius added possibly even chicken pox peter added or maybe even worse added james not safe for pretty girls like yourself sirius commented you could get it and who knows what would happen then peter reasoned and you could pass it on exclaimed james the whole school could get it followed sirius it could turn into an epidemic exaggerated peter the school would be quarantined james dramatized and you wouldntwant that now would you sirius finished lily jumped in at this print to cut off her friend who was about to protest saying you know lara maybe we should go to class and pay extra attention maybe you can take notes for him so he doesnthave to when he gets back now becoming more confident lily ventured that way you could teach him what he missed i sure he d really appreciate that lily assured lara lara still looked unsure and she was about to speak again when james exclaimed we ve only got two minutes to get to charms quickly all six deserted their unfinished lunches and discussion and began sprinting to their class that was close lily whispered to james as they led the pack running to the charms classroom yah that the closest call we ve ever had james replied stonily lily was a bit taken aback by his tone but she shrugged it off the rest of the day things went fairly smoothly with the exception of james slight avoidance of lily which didntreally upset her until he kept mercilessly picking on her during their quidditch practice before that she had credited his grouchiness to his being back in school after the accident and the close call at lunch but at dinner that night things got even weirder among many other traits lily had that unnerving trait of saying what was on her mind especially when it came to james she had never had a problem telling him what she thought of him but he was used to that by now what wrong she whispered in his ear as she reached for the corn the girls were sitting on one side of the table while the guys were sitting opposite them nothing he replied gruffly come on james you might be able to scare off your other friends like that but you cantscare me tell me what bothering you lily persisted ok you want to know why i upset he hissed back why was lara asking so many questions huh she never asked them before so therefore someone and he said that word with focused eyes on lily must have said something to get her curious james concluded and what lily challenged you think i said something well who else knows and is great friends with her answer me that in case you haventnoticed just within the past couple of weeks lara and remus have been getting pretty close so dontyou think it only natural that she would start wondering where he was this brought nothing but silence from james making lily even more enraged i cant believe you thing i would tell lily burst causing the whole gryffindor table to stop with their food halfway to their mouths and stare after a few moments of deafening silence people started eating again but kept staring not wanting to miss the newest development in the lily and james story come on guys james said to sirius and peter but eyes still glued to lily let go aw but james i still eat sirius began but stopped mid sentence and mid bite when james turned his gaze to sirius on the other hand i wouldntwant to cover this body with calories he joked trying to lighten the volatile mood come on peter sirius jerked his friend to his feet by this time james fiery glare had turned back to lily and sirius noticed the pure hurt lily was trying to hide come on james let go sirius advised then throwing a wink and blowing a kiss over his shoulder to lydia he escorted one clueless friend and one friend whose ticking clock was about to hit zero out of the great hall once out in the hall sirius broke his calm exterior what is wrong with you i think she told james replied not breaking his infuriated manner or glare i think she told them that insane you know she d never tell sirius persisted how are you so sure peter interjected receiving a death glare from sirius i mean she not the same as us he trailed off what the bloody hell is that supposed to mean sirius yelled at the top of his lungs as he defended lily once you befriended sirius black he would defend you to the death i was just saying peter began saying what sirius barked back wormtail you re lucky you are a marauder or you d be at least seven feet under by now sirius threatened he turned to james james you know she wouldnttell she been moony friend almost as long as we have and she known about it longer than we have and still hasnttold sirius began gaining control of himself come on listen to yourself you know that lily wouldntbetray remus or us you know that james took a deep breath and cleared his face of anger you re right i know she wouldn t look peter cried as he pointed to the darkened night sky and the almost completely visible full moon bugger sirius exclaimed as the three of them broke into a full speed sprint towards the whomping willow by the time james got finished with the small perimeter check around the tree peter had already transformed and sirius was halfway through sirius felt the thick warm coat emerge from his skin his face elongated and his now snout grew wet and cold and extra sensitive the world became black and white and very loud as his elbows and knees bent backwards and finally his hands and feet became padded protecting him from the ground as his tailbone lengthened until he could feel his tail wagging with anticipation remember the plan james reminded in a low voice then he too transformed the all too familiar thick bristly pelt rose from his skin and engulfed him in its warmth his fingers and toes snapped together and became as hard as rock forming his hooves like sirius he felt his elbows and knees bend backward his tailbone only slightly lengthen and his face elongate his neck grew as well and the world became much louder then right next to where his ears were now he felt the stiff intricate weaving of his antlers break the skin and stand tall on his head prongs picked up all three wands in his mouth to carry them to the shack so they wouldntbe picked up when he started for the tree wormtail had already frozen it so prongs followed padfoot in from now on they wouldntbe able to communicate so they had to stick to the plan that is why they made them after all prongs hooves echoed in the tunnel padfoot panting could be heard and wormtail scurrying feet added to the sound as well and soon moony frantic scraping and howling could be heard both prongs and padfoot mentally and physically braced themselves for the short threat ahead climbing up padfoot leg to his head wormtail struggled with the lock but succeeded then padfoot turned the knob with his mouth and pushed open the door the normally restless werewolf froze in mid rip or the already shredded chair and stared at his friends with relief padfoot went right to moony right and after dropping the wands on a nearby table prongs went to moony left wormtail took his normal place on prongs back and together all four of them left the shrieking shack through the back they made it safely to the surrounding woods without being seen of course moony didntact up because when his friends were in their anamagi form the man still saw them as friends but the werewolf saw them as potential threats they would restrain him if they had to and he was very thankful for that once in the woods each marauder began his specified task tonight wormtail was to get into zonko joke shop and unlock the door padfoot would then open the door with his mouth his specialty to let himself in together they would stealthily raid the shop but not too badly they justified it by remembering how much the shop marked up the prices prongs stayed with moony to keep him under control together they looked for a good spot to rest and maybe some leftover food from the three broomsticks then together they would wait at the back of the shrieking shack for padfoot and wormtail to return the plan went on without a hitch as usual until prongs heard voices he perked his head up and opened his ears to full attention he looked over at padfoot to see if he had heard it too and when he saw the big shaggy black dog in a terrier like hunting position he knew they had to move fast quickly padfoot and prongs pushed moony up while wormtail scampered to the shack to unlock the door prongs then led moony as padfoot made sure he hid or picked up everything in his mouth to prevent suspicion yo ho yo ho a pirate hiccup life for hiccup me a drunken voice sang in the distance keep your voice down macnair you know what he d do to us if we were found another voice advised in volume just above a whisper by this time padfoot had stopped in mid dig and prongs had returned to see where he was helping padfoot cover the fire ice lollipops they heard now where is he hiccup supposed to meet us macnair asked ugh do you ever listen and keep your voice down the other voice answered now prongs seemed to be screaming let go with his frightened marble sized eyes just as the two men entered the clearing padfoot and prongs leapt out of sight once back in the shack it was almost sun up but none of the marauders could discuss what they had just heard that was the biggest setback of transforming they couldntcommunicate that well with each other but now the whole group seemed to understand the message stay quiet and stay low the four friends heard the voices of the two men come close then slowly fade away it wasntuntil prongs broke the silence with a big sigh that he realized wormtail was gone getting the attention of padfoot by pawing the ground prongs mimed frantic searching to signal padfoot to do the same since they couldntturn back into their human forms until sunrise they spent the remaining time maneuvering their bulky bodies around the shack looking for a possibly distressed rat at daybreak he finally turned up and the other three were already back to normal where did you run off to wormtail james asked umm just went out i guess replied a timid peter out since when do we split up and go out inquired a rather peeved sirius well it not like i do anything anyways burst peter close to angry tears you two are the ones to hold him back not me i just a small pathetic rat remember then peter began back down the tunnel to the school james and sirius exchanged bewildered looks as they half carried the worn out remus to the school they got him to the hospital wing and headed back to the school before either marauder spoke what the bloody hell was with peter sirius almost shouted he was obviously annoyed and upset with how peter had been acting that day you know i not quite sure but i think it around the time his mum died last year maybe that what making him edgy he was real close with her james answered yah but it was still odd sirius paused and thought for a moment how was it that she died again his mum found his dad with some muggle woman the slimy git and when she tried to talk to him about it the woman husband walked in on the scene and shot her instead of his wife james paused and thought about how he d feel if someone had murdered his mum he knew he d hate whoever had done it you know he not as strong as you he cantput up with his dad like you can put up with your family and that what gets to him but i surprised that he doesnthate all muggles i know i probably would no you wouldn t you re nowhere near that low sirius replied yah i guess you re right i ll see you in a couple hours though james said with a tired smile yup have a good nap and dontbeat yourself up about peter he ll probably be fine later night mate now remember to review even if it just one word you ll make my day i promise thank you so much to all of you for reading and extra props to those who review luv you

for the review i glad you liked it and i hope you like this one too well thank you to all and i hope you all like this chapter liane chapter 16 intervention it was about 4 30 in the morning but lily knew she wouldntbe able to get back to sleep she had just finished her shower and was now drying her hair with her wand but her mind was not at all on the task it was running a million light years a minute last night james had completely attacked her for no reason and lily had spent the rest of the night alone in her room crying and writing in her journal until she fell asleep her tears had been a combination of hurt and frustration but most of all confusion lily could not understand what had caused james to think she had told he knows i d never tell how could he even think it something little spooks him and he back to his good ole self it not my fault so blame it on everyone else no it couldntpossibly be me bull it was no more than a coincidence and he knows it i dontget it arg she screamed aloud why she knew james was out so she was safe to yell as loud as she wanted she was near to tears again just thinking about how his attitude towards her had changed so quickly how he looked at her before yesterday and how they kissed no no crying lily demanded herself but she knew that he d come to his senses sooner or later and whenever that was she knew she d be there for him if he gave her a semi reasonable explanation coupled with lots and lots of begging as she pulled her pajamas back on intending to get back in bed and at least try to sleep she heard a knock on her door lily are you in there she heard james ask lily went to the door pulled it open and met his tired face with a glare what do you want i just needed to talk to you he replied what if i had been sleeping you would have woken me up because you had to talk to me lily challenged with a bit of her returned spitfire attitude towards james i guess it just goes to prove that you really do only care about yourself actually i heard you talking to yourself or whatever it was you were doing in here and i wanted to come in and apologize for what i said earlier his statement met with the embarrassed silence and blushing cheeks of lily like usual she wasntquite sure what to say she was still mad but now she was embarrassed as well so she tried to cover with words since retreat was not in her vocabulary well whatever lily couldntthink of anything else so she shut the door but just as she was closing the door james put a hand out and stopped it oh and by the way i sorry and he really meant it even if it did come out a little edgy then he let the door shut and went to his own room to get as much sleep as he could on the other side lily now knew there would be no chance whatsoever of sleeping all hopes were dashed with james most recent possibly his first ever apology why does it seem like every time i ve got things going right they just fall down on me and then i stuck i donthave anywhere to turn because everything is just such a mess lily thought in despair as she plopped down on her bed so she did what any girl does when she trapped she decided to talk to her mum the only problem was that her mum was probably three thousand plus kilometers away so she had to settle for writing dear mum hello again how are you and how did you know it was james potter one of these days you re going to have to share your little secrets with me but first i hope that everything is going well with you and dad and petunia tell her that i happy for her and vernon i dontknow if you were notified or not but on sunday night i had a little run in with my good ole buddy lucius malfoy nothing happened that couldntbe fixed but it wasntpleasant just thought you should know but now to the real reason i writing other than of course that i love you and want to write you i have a question did you and dad ever get into fights where he snapped at you for no good reason i mean for no reason if you did how did you forgive him i mean if it was just an attack without warning or rationale i guess i just not sure what to do but thanks for your help even if you can t but i ll hopefully see you soon and talk to you even sooner i love you and hope you re doing well love you always lily when she was finished writing it was almost 5 30 but she d rather wait for the morning post than go back up to the owlrey again so she folded the letter and tucked it into her bag and pulled out her potions things and checked over her homework hey sirius what going on with james and lily asked a winded mikey during thursday quidditch practice they had a bit of a row on tuesday sirius puffed then smacked a bludger and they haventreally been the same since it quite immature if you ask me so why dontyou do something i mean you know they re just being daft mikey said you know that not a bad point what did you have in mind asked a very interested sirius well i was thinking that it not that serious so maybe we should try talking to them you know have each person talk to both lily and james at different times you me max remus peter lydia and lara maybe between the seven of us we can knock some sense into their thick skulls mikey replied with a huge hit of a bludger when he said knock yah i think you re right i think that should fix it without us getting our hands too dirty then sirius paused and thought for a bit this might be a dumb question but what would we say exactly well you do want them to be together dontyou mikey asked and sirius nodded then all you have to do is tell james that tell him as a friend that you think whatever is going on between them is stupid and immature and that he should grow some balls and stop being so sissy wow have you had a lot of time to think about that sirius asked with something of amazement in his voice eh mikey shrugged i guess it all those years he been my big brother and beat up on me and stuff i finally get to tell him off for once mikey grinned mischievously so when do we start the intervention program sirius asked in a very businesslike very military like style as soon as possible lieutenant black as soon as possible i ll take tonight dinner shift while you tell the others i think the process should all be completed tonight you know kind of overload their brains and give them something to laugh and talk about when they get back to their common room they ll think we re stupid and crazy and they ll laugh and realize that they are actually the stupid and crazy ones mikey replied so i assume that you will see lydia before dinner so you may want to tell her so she can keep lily distracted do you copy yes sir general mikey sir over and out then with a last hand salute sirius dove down just in time to smack a bludger that was about to hit frank hey lily could you help me with this potions crap it completely useless and i dontget it lydia asked while they were eating dinner sure but i cantpromise that all of it will be right lily replied with a smile on the other side of the table mikey had come to join james and max joined sirius and the others what going on over there james asked mikey oh nothing sirius is crazy it could be anything mikey replied with an air of that not being important but i wanted to talk to you about something else alright shoot tiger girl problems because first i should have you know that i obviously not that great at it he said with a glance at lily actually that what i wanted to talk to you about girl problems repeated a now highly interested james well yes and no not my girl problems your girl problems mikey admitted with a look over there gaze directed at a now laughing lily james heart collapsed and his stomach hit the floor that laugh that smile those eyes were all mad at him and they had a right to be mad at him but they obviously didntknow the love and remorse he felt towards them james you know you love her that all i ever hear about ok not really but i know you do and as a brother i know that i need to tell you all of this it my job to be your brains on the outside and plus i really like her and i know she good for you you need someone to challenge that big head of yours sometimes you know what i mean mikey asked yah i know what you mean but little bro you re going to realize how difficult women can be someday and then you ll know why i so hesitant they re a lot more complex than we simple minded men think and they re much more fragile yet much much stronger than we give them credit for i just not sure james i know it may be difficult for you to admit it but look at you you re miserable and lonely without her face it even before you two were sort of together you werentthis bad mikey paused to let it sink in then went on if i know one thing about you james in all of the years of being your brother and your friend you never give up the things you love without a fight that could land at least a dozen people in the hospital mikey said with a chuckle so if you really love her dontlet her go mikey stood up i ll see you later big bro and went back to his part of the table james sat there silent in pure realization he knew mikey was right and he knew what he had to do it was just the actual doing it part that was going to give him trouble but he didntget much time to think about it before sirius came over on the other side of the table lydia was still pretending ignorance about the homework until lara cut in and told lydia to go talk to remus about it because she had to talk to lily so lydia went to talk to remus and find out what this whole top secret plan was sirius said he didnthave enough time to explain it before dinner he only told her that she had to find some way to distract lily so lily i ve been your friend since first year and it seems like we ve known each other even longer so just bare with me while i brutally honest with you lara took a deep breath and plowed on i know that maybe we dontalways see eye to eye and that i can be kind of ditzy at times but it doesnttake a minister of magic to see that you re miserable without james you know that you two are meant to be together so i think you need to forgive him for what he done and be happy again lara it sounds way easier than it really is i mean he completely blew up at me for no reason and i dontknow if i want to deal with that for the rest of whenever lily replied lily it really is simple though do you love him because if you don t then you re right it not worth it but if you do then you shouldntlet anything stop you i know you and you re not one to let things challenge you and win over you you fight for what you know is right and i know that in your heart you know that being with james is right lara then stood up to let someone else have a turn then with a genuine smile she finished with so smile and go get it then much like james before lily sat deep in thought but not long after lara left max took lara empty spot hey big sis how are you i ok i guess i having a fairly odd day but that alright how are you asked lily completely unaware of what was all going on with the intervention i ok but i canthelp noticing that you and james arentholding hands anymore much less talking max admitted what lily asked completely taken by surprise oh i saw you guys last week holding hands after quidditch practice and it not that much of a secret that you like each other and lily that what i need to talk to you about i know i just your dorky little brother but i know how you feel about james though you may think you re good at lying you re not every time you lied to mum or dad about cleaning your room i considered telling them max said with a chuckle but i didn t but lily i know that you really like james and that it doing no good trying to convince yourself that you re mad at him but i really was mad at him lily said a bit desperately exactly you were mad at him so stop being so first year ish because we all know that my job even though i a third year and be who you really are i know it doesntmatter but i really like james i think he a great honorary big brother and i want both of you to be happy you know what you have to do love ya sis then max too went back to his part of the table lily did know what she had to do but she didntknow if she could when she saw lydia making her way towards her she realized what was going on and quickly removed herself from the situation lily got up swiftly picked up her things and went to her room back on the other side of the table both sirius and remus were giving james the third degree as kindly as possible prongise boy sirius started you know we re your best friends so you have no choice but to listen to us or we ll be forced to make you james we know that you and lily are kind of having a disagreement and we just want to let you know that we re here for you remus quickly made to leave but sirius grabbed him and pulled him back down moony you say it or i ll be forced to make you say it sirius threatened you know i d do it alright alright remus replied with a chuckle james we both know you and lily really well we are both of your friends and we feel that it our job to let you know what we think we we think that you and lily should stop being immature and get over what was said between the two of you sirius interrupted i mean grow some balls stop being so sissy and get serious wait a second you re already here james proudly said as he caught his friend making the big mistake against himself yah yah yah but seriously listen to us sirius continued i am listening to you sirius and i know what you re saying and i know you re right but james trailed off as he watched lily get up and leave the table he started getting up when sirius and remus pulled him down we re not done with you romeo i know what you re thinking it easier said than done but you have to risk that sirius guided james take it from me remus advised you donthave anything holding you back except yourself take it from those of us who have other reasons and take advantage of it be yourself and if she still cantsee what a great guy you are then you know to let it go but i know lily she a great girl and aside from all the brains she scared but she knows what right you just have to ask yourself if it all worth it thanks guys i think i know what i ve got to do james stood up see you later sirius and remus high fived each other and watched james disappear up in her room lily found scarlett waiting for her with her mum reply she opened the window and let her in she untied the letter then let scarlett sit on her knee as she petted her and read the letter dear lily oh my goodness it certainly is a bit crazy over there isntit yes i heard about you and james getting hurt and i hope you thanked him profusely tell him that i thank him as well and that i glad you and him are alright as for your question my word yes we have before we got married we had one particularly foolish fight your father thought that i was only going out with him to get closer to his best friend can you believe it his friend told him that hoping that we would break up and then he could go out with me your father didntcall me or talk to me for about a week before i finally got the guts to talk to him he listened to me and then told me what he was told and we laughed about what had happened you see if you just keep talking to and actually listening to each other you will be fine as much as you may not want to listen you must if you want a fighting chance and judging by your letter i guessing that you do want a chance let me know what happens good luck love you always mum lily as usual found comfort in her mother words even though they were on paper she knew her mum as usual was right and that once again head girl lily evans was being stupid so lily decided to wait for james down in the common room she quickly changed into her comfy pajamas and went down with her favorite blanket and conjured a pillow once sitting on the couch quidditch practice had been pretty vigorous and it was now taking its toll on lily she gave into temptation and lied down on the couch and vowed that even though she was lying down she was going to stay awake and just as her eyes were closing and her breathing was about to morph into its steady in and out the portrait hole opened and she was immediately awake james lily said a bit louder than she intended as she sat up lily james spotted her and walked over to the couch i need to talk to you i know and i need to talk to you too james put a finger to lily lips to quiet her first let me say this or i not sure if i ll ever be able to remember it lily i dontwant to hurt you anymore all the times that i d pranked someone in front of you it must have torn you apart and i truly sorry for that but you dontknow what you do to me every time i around you i lose my cool i jump to conclusions and the conclusions always hurt you and i dontwant to hurt you anymore james took a breath and met with lily unbelieving stare lily i love you and that why i have to stop i love you too much to hurt you anymore then james walked away and went up the stairs and lily heard his door shut completely horrified and confused lily sat there for a minute or so thinking about what had just been said it was true he did hurt her with all of that but lily knew that it didntmatter she knew he was right but she knew he was wrong he did hurt her but he d hurt her more if he did this lily ran up the stairs and bolted into james room she met with a shirtless james in his boxers and immediately she blushed and exited the room sorry she whined with embarrassment through the door but she was also thinking about the amazing sight she had just witnessed tight muscular legs a six pack thick sculpted arms and shoulders all topped off with a gorgeous face it alright you can come in now james called back lily cautiously opened the door and gingerly stepped into the room as if the floor were going to fall out from beneath her but seeing james inquiring face gave her back her confidence in a quick couple of steps she was across the room in front of james she knew this was the only way to get through to him she did something she had never done before she rose on her tiptoes looped her arms behind his neck and kissed him with all the passion she had ever known unable to resist her beauty and courage james kissed her back despite what he said earlier he knew they were meant to be together but he also knew that he had meant what he said about not wanting to hurt her it took lily even more willpower to pull herself out of the kiss but she managed she the looked up at him lowered herself to her feet then without remorse smacked james in the head ouch what was that for asked a surprised james now holding the side of his head that was for what you just said to me replied a calm lily i was hoping it would knock some sense into you then lily eyes and her tone softened as she gazed up at him you say that you dontwant to hurt me anymore so you say you have to let me go well i sorry but i dontbuy that crap if you leave me that will hurt me way more than any stupid little fight so you either need to deal with hurting me or promise that you ll love me like i love you and at least talk to me before you go accusing me of things like that james stared at her in such a way that lily wondered what she had just said he opened his mouth to speak and closed it then he opened it again and closed it again in a loss for words finally on the third time he found his voice you just said you love me do you really mean that uh lily thought and realized that indeed she had said it i guess i do yah i do lily admitted with an embarrassed yet pleasant smile james gathered lily in his arms causing their foreheads to touch then he whispered i love you too then before she could say anything else he kissed her again ok since this seemed to work last time i

preparation for for the next couple of weeks the routine stayed pretty much the same every day quidditch practice was intense as the team was preparing for their match against hufflepuff and when the match came max got hit with a bludger pretty bad in the shoulder but recovered and threw the last assisting goal to his sister right before james caught the snitch resulting in the team first victory of the season james and lily were also extremely busy with their head duties since the halloween ball was right around the corner and then of course there was the merciless teasing and bragging from all those involved in getting james and lily back together they simply would not let james or lily live it down but all of this on top of normal studies was beginning to take its toll every once in a while one of the seventh year group would snap but quickly apologize after a rather snippy snap from lydia lily worriedly asked james what he thought would happen to the group when they took their newts nevertheless the group was becoming inseparable the couples lily and james lydia and sirius and lara and remus were only becoming closer most of the time peter stayed with the group but every so often he would slip away sometimes noticed and other times unnoticed by the rest of the group alright gang let plan lydia whipped out a piece of parchment and a quill and some ink and began heading the parchment with the words hogsmeade weekend uh lydia lily muttered as she read the title dontyou think it a bit early to be thinking about that nonsense it only fourteen days thirteen hours and seventeen minutes away lydia pleaded frantically lydia i think that last little breakdown you had permanently hindered your mental capabilities lara teased just because you like to do things at the last minute doesntmean all of us do lydia warned at this point the marauders all stood up as they had been only watching with looks of disbelief and horror at the idea of already planning but as soon as they made to move they halted oh no you don t lydia threatened causing the boys to cringe sirius black dontyou move james and remus both reflexively relaxed well good luck with the planning nazi james clamped sirius on the shoulder and displayed a huge grateful and gloating smile the what lydia asked outraged though she hadntreally heard nothing dear sirius assured giving james the death glare but then cracking a grin at the joke hey lily jumped up and walked over to james dontthink you re going to leave me here all by me onesie self lily pleaded with a slight pirate accent and big green puppy dog eyes of course i wouldntme lady james replied with a successful attempt at the accent but a failed attempt at sounding happy about the whole thing now if we re all through with the sappy crap could we please start this planning lydia whined the group silently sat back down at the table and listened while lydia laid out the whole day at first the others voiced their opinions and ideas but what was supposed to be a lydia writing and everyone agreeing planning session soon revealed itself as a lydia writing and choosing and telling everyone what to do planning session just as james and sirius were about to cast hexes on an unsuspecting lydia who was currently writing down what the group was to do from 2 00pm to 3 00pm lily jumped up causing james and sirius to abandon their attack i sorry lydia but james and i really need to discuss our head duties as she grabbed james hand she kept talking so as to keep lydia from objecting i only humbly request that you dontplan anything too exciting from 4 00pm on because james and i need to get back to help set up she then gave her friend a quick hug as she finished with i trust you ll keep everyone in check and plan the best hogsmede weekend ever by the end of her exaggerated compliment she was yelling from the doors of the great hall while james was throwing a pitying look at sirius and remus who were still trapped in the clutches of the maniac planner as he was being dragged from the hall the last scene made him laugh he saw lara attempting to follow lily but instantly being pulled back to her seat as lydia threatened oh no you don t and he also saw sirius grateful look at remus for staying then his smile at his girlfriend and the very last thing he saw was sirius mouth to him hey it what i love about her that was a close one lily exhaled as she plopped on the couch in the head common room it not that i dontlove the girl to death but i swear if i had had one more second of her pre problem planning i think i would have screamed i know what you mean sometimes remus gets a bit like that too james took his seat next to lily and thought for a moment actually we all get like that especially sirius when it comes to marauder mischief of course you can count him out of the homework planning james chuckled good ole sirius yah but you know we re going to pay for running out like that really how so i mean what could she possible do to us asked a overly confident james obviously you dontknow lydia as well as i do lily replied causing james to flinch at the possibilities i mean lydia and i have been friends forever lily trailed off as james gave her that questioning look that seemed to ask forever ok fine we ve been friends for almost six years but we know each other as well as if we d been friends forever she ll find a way to get back at us you can be sure of that whether it through planning an even more insane weekend or by not speaking to us for a couple of days she ll get her revenge well you re the one who ran james teased haha lily replied sarcastically well i wasntthe one about to hex her silent and plus i d much rather be sitting here doing nothing while she plans the weekend i mean it not different than if we were sitting at the table with her she d still be complaining and arguing the plans before deciding just to do it her way no matter what any of us says lily giggled at this but you gotta love her sure james replied not knowing what to say looking for a new subject he asked you know why do they call it hogsmeade weekend i mean it not like we go for the entire weekend we only go for a day so why dontwe call it hogsmeade day or hogsmeade hours lily laughed alright i get it no more friendly lydia stuff but you should know you are horrid at changing the subject well i tried now how about this dance who are you going with he asked as he inched closer to her any suave he described as he ran his hand through his hair sexy debonair men catch your beautiful twinkling eye with the last comment he gave her his patented attempt at being sexy eyebrow wiggle i suppose there is one replied lily as she played along feigning deep thought and at the same time turning from james but i just not sure she trailed off smiling inwardly at james surprised expression well who is this man surely you must tell him of your thoughts for him james continued i suppose i could but you must know he is not a man but only a boy who thinks he is a man lily then gave a wistful yet sarcastic giggle and said yes how childish he is hearing this james broke the act and began tickling lily one of his most favorite pastimes you think you re so funny huh well what does that say about you then you re the one going out with the boy who only thinks he a man ok ok lily shrieked as her mirthful laughter filled and warmed the room as well as james heart and soul i take it back what was that again james asked as if he hadntheard i said i mr potter ms evans james immediately stopped tickling and lily stopped laughing both of their heads snapped towards the secret set of stairs which neither had heard open and which now were filled with the figure and sky blue robes of professor and headmaster dumbledore i apologize for interrupting but i need to see you in my office immediately there is a situation that i need your help with yes professor what is it lily asked as she quickly rose and headed to the stairs with james following i will tell you once you are settled in my office with the teachers do not panic for we will get this under control but be on your guard their headmaster warned on their way up the stairs james hand found lily and he could tell that she was scared her cute small hands that were just the right size for him to hold were cold and slightly shaking james lightly squeezed her hand to let her know he was there and she squeezed back determined to press on once in the office james and lily nodded to the teachers already gathered and took the two open seats in the front row no more than 30 seconds later professor dumbledore was beginning in his powerful yet calm voice first i would like to assure everyone that there is no reason to panic we must stay calm for if we lose our heads we lose our sight hearing and most importantly our minds dumbledore continued some of you may have already heard so i request that you please remain silent until all are informed for those of you who are unaware of what has happened let me explain only twenty minutes ago death eaters as well as voldemort appeared in hogsmeade none were killed but several were injured here he paused and allowed a light shimmer of conversation to advance but soon he was speaking again as you all know the halloween ball is approaching and it is coupled with our first hogsmeade weekend we will not be canceling the trip because i feel that the present danger can be dealt with quite easily with the cooperation of all so i propose this all students will check in with our caretaker as well as ms minerva mcgonagall professors wimble lotvcka and trallick will be keeping an eye on the first and second year students here at the school and the rest of us will be patrolling the hogsmeade grounds professor dumbledore sat back on his striped chintz chair any questions comments concerns or objections after a few moments of silence the headmaster rose and said well i guess that settles it thank you all for coming and i hope you have a good night the teachers then slowly got up and dispersed while james and lily looked at each other with confused expressions together they walked over to their headmaster and james asked excuse me professor could i ask you a question well you obviously can as you have just proven however you may ask me one more question the lively professor teased umm well we were wondering why you called us up for the meeting james responded i mean we re not teachers ah yes i almost forgot i will need the two of you to keep an extra sharp eye out for anything unusual and if in fact you do come across something unusual i need you to immediately contact any professors you see and help gather all students back to the school can you do that for me i suppose lily replied but she seemed unsure professor do you really think something big is happening i mean something that will affect the students here ms evans i only have my personal opinions on the matter i think that something big is happening yes but i also think that you should not be frightened for in fear you will find that only evil wins so i suggest that the two of you go back to your rooms and do your homework and get a good night rest and you ll feel better in the morning and i dontthink it necessary for you to alert any students about the matter i dontwant panic to spread for there is no reason for it consider our lips sealed thank you professor good night lily replied good night professor james also bid good night ms evans the headmaster replied with a slight bow towards lily and good night mr potter also bowing to james then the two were off back down the stairs and back into the common room wow lily sighed wow it alright lils i promise it will be alright james comforted as he wrapped her in a hug i know it just scary i mean one minute everything perfect and we re virtually carefree and now now we ve got hundreds of kids and classmates to look after and evil to avoid i mean it sounds like something out of an intense science fiction mystery lily exhaled i know it all kind of surreal james agreed but dontworry it ll all be alright are you going to be alright james released lily halfway from the hug holding her at arm length and stared into her fervent eyes yah i ll be fine i just worry about max and mikey and lydia and lara and shhh it going to be alright you ll see besides no one can hurt any of us with dumbledore so close as long as he here nothing terrible can happen james pulled her back into his arms he loved the way she fit to him and you can bet that i ll be there for you nothing will happen if i can help it i love you lily marie evans after that night the others in the group noticed a more intense air surrounding lily and james they seemed to be more openly exclusive to each other not annoyingly so but just open before the couple was a bit hesitant about others knowing about them but now it seemed like whenever you saw one the other was right there and they were holding hands to the rest of the group it was finally happening and they were happy for them but to others it wasntsuch a great advancement often members of the group caught slytherins eying the spectacle with disgust or oddly enough jealousy and then there was the occasional female obviously envious of lily and the occasional male jealous of james but this didntstop the couple love for each other soon enough it was the weekend of all hallows eve and the school was as chaotic as ever teachers were running about putting up decorations and organizing the hogsmeade trip while the students were wreaking havoc tearing down decorations and dragging mud into the castle from the muddy grounds for it had been raining all week but the rain did not dampen any spirits james and lily had casually pushed any danger to the backs of their minds and awoke on the hogsmeade day bright and early to meet with the group at breakfast around seven nice of you two to join us this fine morning lydia said clearly upset that james and lily were slightly late continuing with her role of insane weekend leader well we ll just have to spend two minutes less at zonko s this earned a groan from the four guys well let go but we haventeven eaten breakfast lily whined well i guess you should have thought about that before you decided to be late let go with that lydia marched off in the direction of the exit with the others sleepily groaning in tow that the planning nazi for ya sirius whispered to lily and james i heard that lydia shouted back causing sirius to cringe and james and lily to laugh once in the village lily and james snuck off while the group was at the first shop looking for costumes to go get some breakfast they stopped at madame puddifoot for some coffee and bagels once filled they snuck back into the store and resumed their search james and lily had decided to go as sir and lady zanath since they already looked a great deal similar sirius and lydia decided to go as lord and lady shabbit and remus and lara decided to go as count and countess dinova peter and his date decided to take a more traditional twist on halloween and were going as mr and mrs frankenstein all in all each couple was pretty different from the others each with a very different need costume wise lily thought it quite pointless to be searching around in all of the stores lydia had mapped out since lily and james didntneed the most live like bloody stitches ever and peter and isadora didntneed beautiful ball gowns and tuxedos lydia lily dragged her friend off to the side near a rack of spiked capes dontyou think it kind of silly for james and me to be here if i need a ball gown and he needs a tux and dontyou think it silly for remus and lara to be here if they need old fashioned colonial garb and your point lydia asked as she checked on the group i mean i think we should just split up and go shopping where we know we need to go dontyou i mean it would save a lot of time and then we d have more of an opportunity to go have fun all together lily tried to convince her friend here you can tell everyone it was your idea and all i promise lily knew that lydia pride was the main thing holding her back from agreeing though she knew lily was right fine let split up lydia hugged lily thanks for putting up with me i sorry about all of this i dontknow what i was thinking it alright lyd i forgive you lily finished with a smile alright gang huddle up lydia called once everyone was gathered she began i apologize for all of this planning nazi craziness and i can only plead temporary insanity this self joke made the others relax and smile along with lydia but it been brought to my attention that we ll get more time to be altogether if we split up and shop so go on and we ll meet back at the three broomsticks for lunch around noon good luck lydia bid them farewell and grabbed sirius and headed toward a store with more ethnic based costumes how did you do it james asked lily as they walked to tuxes gowns and magic do what lily asked oh you mean get lydia to act civil haha you ve just got to know what to say and how to say it make it seem like her idea and offer her the credit she just one of those people who doesntlike her pride being hurt well you know what i think james asked and lily looked at him inquisitively i think that we are going to get you the prettiest dress ever so that everyone will be staring at you and no one will have to look at me and see me all klutzy me and dress shoes dontgo well together james whispered the last part lily just laughed her heart fluttering laugh causing james to grin even bigger and he silently wondered what in the world could possibly be better than this lily had finally gotten all her giggles out and the couple entered the grand store immediately she was struck by its power and beauty she d never been to a store as grand as this all the glitter and gems and shoes and gowns took her breath away the look of awe on lily face was enough for james to die happy he knew she d never really been to any big wizarding stores but he wasntprepared for the satisfaction he got by surprising her like this lily didntknow where to start she figured she d need a green dress but what style or make or shade she had no idea after reveling in the store glory for a minute or two more she finally realized the tall blonde witch standing in front of her can i help you today madame she asked lily just nodded stupidly still taken aback by the store the woman laughed sweetly at her reaction and continued my name is zarina and i would be happy to help you today what is your name lily lily evans lily replied well it nice to meet you miss evans answered zarina and who is this nice young man with you lily finally fully snapped out of her trance and responded this is my boyfriend james potter we re here looking for a costume for our halloween ball well ms evans if you would follow me i can certainly assist you and mr potter if you go over that way the employees over there would be more than happy to assist you thank you very much james responded see you in a bit lils have fun james wished with a quick peck on her cheek then he turned and walked to where he had been directed now ms evans what sort of dress do you have in mind zarina asked as she began walking towards the back of the store seeming to already have something in mind well james and i decided to go as sir and lady zanath so i was hoping for some sort of green ball gown but there are so many types here i dontknow if i ll ever be able to choose lily sighed i ve got a couple of ideas here stand right on this platform zarina directed her to a circular white platform in front of a three paneled mirror just stand normally no need to be nervous zarina chuckled lily hadnteven noticed she had been holding her body so tightly but she was thankful for the released tension but suddenly a tape measure started circling her measuring her height and torso and everything important for fitting while a quill recorded the measurements in a table on a sheet of parchment as the tape measure was dancing and the quill was scratching zarina pulled out several shades of green putting each up to her face and either discarding it or setting it on a nearby table finally she snapped her fingers causing the tape measure and quill to fall allowing her to approach lily with four different slips of color she raised the first one to lily face this first one is called shamrock it would complement your fair skin but it may clash with your freckles a bit this second one is shimmering jade it nice with your hair but your skin may look paler next to it she then lowered that slip and raised another shining bottle green one of my favorites and it complements you nicely but this last one emerald city also balances your color and it has the smallest hint of metallic purple here and there that really shows off your eyes lily looked closely and held the last two in her hands she was on the verge of giving up when she remembered how james had reacted to her wearing the lavender eye shadow let go with the emerald city great pick i was hoping you d choose that one zarina confessed now to choose the style of the dress you said gown so i assume you were thinking something with a long pouffy skirt am i right lily nodded something like that and zarina whisked her wand at lily legs and a long pouffy skirt took the place of her jeans ooo i love it lily exclaimed now for the top hmmm let look at your measurements quick zarina levitated the parchment to her and quickly scanned the numbers just as i thought let just try this to start and we ll make some adjustments zarina once again flicked her wand at lily only this time at her top half causing a dress top to take the place of her shirt and attach to her skirt the top had long bell sleeves with slits up to her elbows on the inside of her arms there were small ties at her elbows with cute little bows holding them in place the top had a boat neckline that scooped just low enough to show her lone beauty mark but not dangerously or unacceptably low the bust line had a gathered look with another little tie and bow just beneath her bra line leading to a smooth straight line up to the skirt part of the dress the back was simple matching the line of the front but with a deeper scoop in the back and without the gathered material the skirt slowly belled out and touched the ground for the most part the dress was a silky material except on the bell sleeves the gathered material at her chest and the skirt in these places there was a thin chiffon layer over the satin here especially the dress gave off the hint of lavender color making the greens in the dress and lily eyes ten times more vivid wow lily whispered afraid to disturb the dress beauty she just stood there admiring the dress and how it fit and looked and felt it made lily feel like a princess you know i dontthink i want you to change anything wow she whispered again my goodness i think you re right dear it fits you like a dream and looks gorgeous too huh i didntknow my wand had that in it she joked causing lily to giggle too zarina allowed lily a few more minutes to marvel at the dress before continuing now we must accessorize she stated simply excited as she whisked a few boxes of shoes over if my measurements are correct zarina began your feet are a nice size eight do you like heels actually i really dontcare for them lily admitted i sort of feel tall enough i guess no problem i feel the same way myself most of the time zarina tittered personally i recommend the ballet slippers she stated as she removed the lid from a box and revealed the slippers have you ever heard of them lily went momentarily speechless staring at the slippers when she finally found her voice it came out as a whisper yes yes i have lily was lost in remembering her dancing days she had been taking classes since she was three and had always dreamed of being a ballerina seeing the slippers brought back the memories of her twirling days and some of the hurt she felt when she learned that she would have to give it up well do you like them zarina asked cautiously noticing the change in her customer demeanor i love them lily whispered the slippers were the color of her dress with tiny white flowers around the inner edge the also had ribbons may i try them on lily asked shyly of course dear zarina exclaimed careful not to drop them lily picked up a slipper like she was holding an extremely expensive glass vase sitting on the stool close by lily slipped her right foot into the shoe she first tightened the strings to fit the width of her foot and then began crisscrossing the ribbons like she had so many times before after expertly putting the other slipper on she carefully got to her feet well how do they feel zarina asked with bated breath like i walking on air lily replied truthfully zarina smiled and then retrieved a small necklace and pair of earrings from the stash of boxes on her small table try these on she instructed with a grin lily first put on the earrings they were smaller dangling earrings only about three centimeters long the posts were silver but an emerald city green piece of chiffon ribbon served as the main part of each earring suspending a rhinestone flower matching the ones on her slippers the necklace actually turned out to be a choker it too had the mesh like ribbon with a rhinestone flower charm in the middle you know if the dress wasntcovering your slippers i d say the flowers are a bit too distracting but the dress goes to the floor and the flowers on the jewelry are absolutely divine on you zarina complimented i so jealous she teased but then resolved with a truthful comment of you look truly beautiful dear i should say so said a voice making both zarina and lily jump james entered the viewing platform with a huge grin on his face i ve got the matching vest and cumber bund but i no match for you i d look like a bum james joked but honestly lily you look absolutely gorgeous breathtaking very funny james lily retorted sarcastically the she turned to zarina so i think that it dress up time is done already james asked with the air of a giggly first year girl zarina chortled at the couple and then turned to lily and flicked her wand causing her normal clothes to return and all of her jewelry to soar into boxes and the dress to a hangar alright let go ring er up she exclaimed merrily as they walked to the register lily stomach stared tossing james noticed the change and whispered what wrong uhh what was i thinking lily replied obviously in despair there no way i can afford all of this it was fun but i need to go somewhere cheaper i dontknow what i was thinking lily smacked her hand to her forehead and shook it in hopelessness well dontyou worry i ve got enough i ve got my mum card for this place i thought we may need it so i got her to send it james resolved james no i can buy my own clothes lily snapped but then she calmed and apologized for it and continued explaining really it ok i could never ask you to do that i ve got enough for a gown just not from here lily fine james knew there was nothing he could do to change her mind but he knew he might be able to use his gift of creativity and get around her stubbornness i really think this dress is amazing on you and you deserve it if you want i can pay for it and you can pay me back when you get a chance or think of it as a christmas birthday and valentine day present lily mulled it over in her head she really wanted the dress but she didntknow if she could let james pay she finally decided fine i ll let you pay but i paying you back and you re not getting me another present for the next ten years deal and lily stuck out her hand james smiled at her stubborn nature and shook hands with her deal alright dears zarina cut in not realizing the conversation going on the total comes to please it a gift james cut in much to lily horror if you would charge it to this account please james requested handing the helpful employee his mother card the account is under my mum name a minute later a beaming james and a fuming lily were out in the street laden with their or rather james mum s purchases lily began immediately upset at james for what he had done why couldntyou have just but james cut her off with a sweet kiss knowing that she was only arguing to prove herself geez you two get a room will ya the familiar bark of sirius called to the couple james then only dipped lily back and pretended to snog her mad not aware of the joke many passers by shook their heads and muttered about children these days raging hormones and lack of manners james then righted lily grinning and feigning innocence i sorry what did you say mate prongsie boy wow i ve got to hand it to you that one took guts sirius responded obviously impressed hey i ve got to use the little boy room i ll be right back the sirius bounded off towards the restrooms hey lily lydia familiar voice called what are you up to lily spotted her friend approaching and noticed much like herself lydia was carrying bags of purchases as well hey lydia we just got done shopping how about you oh same old same old just trying to keep track of the free spirit named sirius have you seen him lydia asked with a laugh yah he had to use the lue james responded come wait over here james had already set his packages down on a bench near an unnecessarily extravagant landscape of flowers grass and a larger than life bush he helped lily and lydia with their packages and sat on the bench then dragged lily down to sit on his lap before she could protest so lily what did you get i cantwait to see your dress lydia exclaimed clearly free of any obsessive planning symptoms well i got a gown shoes and some but before lily finished her sentence two arms enveloped in the sleeves of a heavy black cloak reached out of the bush behind the bench and grabbed lydia mouth and neck tugging her backwards terrified eyes and all oooo cliff hanger and not a happy one riot girl i think that was you sorry to leave it like that but i promise i ll get the next chappie out fast please review i promise i will write full length responses to all who review in the beginning of the next chapter thanks everyone now review tell me what you think good bad improvements you tell me i very open to any ideas or thoughts and of course

you need someone to proofread or read and review you lily and james story donthesitate to ask i d love to because i love this stuff if you couldnttell heheehehe i almost forgot to tell you all about the chapter names for chapters 17 and 18 the name for chapter 17 was supposed to be preparation for but the dots didntshow up so i going to attempt to put them at the beginning of this chapter name but i not sure if they ll show so the title for chapter 18 will be the confusion of life so thus and i sure you can all figure this out preparation for the confusion of life but without further ado in alphabetical order here are my replies to all who gave me the gift of reviewing coco pop i didntreally want to go with the whole james being insanely rich and buying lily everything but since harry ends up with a small fortune some one had to have had the money so the potters being an old wizarding family i figured it would have most likely been his side but lily paying off her dress so no worries hehe i not sure about the ballet thing at the moment jest because i not exactly sure how to do it because she d have to give it up for being an auror anyways but if you ve got any ideas feel free to write hehe but we ll see hope you like this next chappie and i hope you review again thank you hottiesplomiegurl lol thanks for the compliment on the clothes and there more in this chappie but

pulled out her wand making sure to keep her eyes on her terrified friend lydia tilt you head lily screamed the instructions before james could act not wanting to interfere or make things worse all he could do was watch lydia tilted her head to her left allowing lily a clear shot at the attacker right arm bollaro lily screamed she hit the attacker right in the arm causing him to yelp in pain and release lydia as boils and other skin fungi attacked his arm oh you ve got me yelled the attacker now fully retreated into the bush but something about that voice turned the teens heads especially lydia s who was currently on the ground where she safely retreated to when she was released lily lydia exclaimed what did you do the three students rushed toward their attacker as lily rounded the bush she spotted packages lying by the flowers then she noticed a leg in jeans death eaters dontwear jeans lily thought to herself and she was right there lay the infamous pranking sirius black on his backside in the mud with a school robe halfway on so that it covered his arms sirius lily yelled are you ok she asked frantically sirius carefully fumbled up with his good arm lily what the hell did you hit me with my arm feels like it going to burn off sirius stated wincing and cradling his mangled arm hey could you teach that curse to me it pretty nifty and may come in handy against some certain slimy slytherins that i know of he continued this time with a huge mischievous grin wha lily stammered what in the hell do you think were you doing black you scared us half to death lily bellowed geez lily he just got hit by your hex pretty bad and you start on him right away cantyou ever give anyone a break lydia accused lydia james warned as he glided to lily side and put a hand protectively on her shoulder you know he really shouldnthave done that what with all that been going on then he turned to sirius you realize that dontyou mate yah and i really sorry about that i guess it was just one of those marauder impulses sirius sincerely admitted just a bit embarrassed but lils could you counter this thing quick i dontwant any permanent damage done to this body sirius attempted to be pompous but they could all see that he was in pain lily quickly performed the counter curse and gave sirius a quick hug thankful he was still in one piece sirius lydia exclaimed why are you apologizing she the one that hexed you whoa there lydia it ok i shouldnthave pulled that prank it my fault sirius walked to his girlfriend lily was trying to save your life for all she knew i really was a death eater he tried to soothe her with his words his smile and a hand rubbing her back why are you sticking up for her lydia bellowed what if you had really gotten hurt i sure even then you d be protecting her lydia was now in tears her friends watching her with horrified and shocked looks what is with everyone freaking obsession with lily evans with that the disturbed seventh year ran off the remaining three exchanged disturbed looks with lily very near to tears i going to go see what up sirius told the other two then he looked at lily dontworry about it i know you were just trying to help her then he ran off in the same direction lydia had just moments before james quickly cradled a melting lily now doing nothing to hold back her sobs james guided her over to a big strong tree so she could have something to lean back against and a bush to shield her from invading passers he left her there only a moment to retrieve their packages from the bench on the other side of the shrubbery when he returned lily had her knees bent up her arms around them and her face buried shhh james coaxed as he sat next to her it ok he comforted taking her head and putting it in his lap it ll be alright she ll come to her senses he assured as he stroked her hair and tucked it behind her ear i just thought lily began through her tears about what dumbledore said you know watching out for weird things and i just thought i thought she tried to go on but another bout of sobs overtook the distraught girl i know lils i know james promised her as he continued to cradle her and stroke her hair i guess you ve just got to remember that she doesntknow all that we do he rationalized i know and i wish i could tell her but we re not supposed to lily sobs started to subside and no one is obsessed with me well that the only thing i going to disagree with you about james grinned lily began to protest but she was cut off by james i am i am completely obsessed and in love with you with this he gently brought lily head back to his face level then kissed her tear stained cheeks absorbing her salty sadness i donteven know where that came from lily stated filled with true sorrow and hurt it ok lily we ll get this all figured out i promise james assured then sealed his promise with a kiss now let scoot because we ve got a hall to decorate with that he got up then helped lily to her feet as well lily wiped her eyes once more and then set her determination back in place the determination that gave james confidence too lily and lydia avoided each other until the last possible moment which wasntthat hard because lily had to go decorate but lara being who she was would not let their immature bitching festival as she so daintily put it get in the way of their plans to get ready together before the dance needless to say the seventh year gryffindor girl room was eerily silent for an entire half hour while each girl dressed herself they were the only three in the room since the other occupants were either in the common room or in other rooms with other friends from other years or houses only until lara and lily were trying to figure out the spell to hide their zippers on their dresses did lydia speak right before the girls were about to try a spell that lydia knew would ruin their dresses lydia stepped in saying no just no here let me she instructed with authority lara smirked at lily basking in the glory of their successful ruse while lydia attended to her dress as lydia was concealing lily zipper lily bravely spoke lydia i know you re mad at me but i want you to know that i was only trying to help you there are just some things that you dontknow about that really drove my decision lily took a breath and proceeded so i sorry if i hurt your feelings and your boyfriend and i hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me and talk to me soon so we can figure out why you think people are obsessed with me lily finished and braced herself for the worst instead she turned to see that lydia was for the second time that day crying oh lily lydia gushed through her sobs i so sorry i dontknow what came over me and she hugged an astounded lily and continued holding onto her friend as she spoke or rather cried i just got scared and i know that a lame excuse but then when sirius stuck up for you i felt betrayed and i know i shouldntbe jealous of you because i seventeen and you re one of best friends but i mean look at you you re so pretty and smart and funny and nice you re head girl and you re a chaser on the quidditch team oh lydia lily laughed at her friend stupidity as she too began crying i was so scared that i was going to lose you and who cares about me sirius wouldntabandon you for a second even for the chance to spring the biggest prank in hogwarts history lily then pulled out of the hug and looked at her sobbing friend lydia look at you you re beautiful and smart and so talented you re on your way to becoming a healer you re going to help so many people dontyou for one second think you re less than me or anyone out there you hear me lily instructed as sternly as she could through her tears she knew lydia had grown up with a bunch of family problems resulting in her low self esteem so it was her self acclaimed job as a friend to boost it whenever she could and she knew that she hadnthad the chance lately because of all her head duties lily i so sorry lydia sobbed again as she hugged her friend again and the two of them stood there hugging and crying in their ball gowns i hate to be the one to break up the tear fest but we ve got to still do hair and make up lara good naturedly snapped the two from their trances immediately lydia and lily dragged lara into their hug resulting in the three of them giggling like they did back in their first year my life would be worthless without the two of you lily gasped as the three of them began calming their laughter no you d still have jaaaaaames lydia teased which by the way missy you ve neglected to update us on what been happening between the two of you she scolded and dontgive me that innocent look we ve seen you two with our own eyes mind you but lara cut in it ll have to wait until tomorrow let get cracking so the three girls spent the next 45 minutes gossiping and doing each other hair and make up when they were all finished they all looked in the mirror and admired their handiwork on each girl one final touch lara stuck a finger in the air with a manner of importance she quickly grabbed her perfume bottle from her table and brought it over alright ladies lara instructed hold out your wrists then lara sprayed the right wrist of lily lydia and herself which they all then rubbed against their left wrist keeping in mind their boyfriends of course then lara sprayed each girl neck on both sides thus completing their primping session all done lydia squealed excitedly as she hugged her two best friends our last halloween ball at hogwarts ever lara added ready for a night of endless partying lily asked with anticipation dripping off each syllable yaaaaaah the two others hollered in unison then the trio made its way down the steps to the gryffindor common room smiling laughing and dancing lydia was the first down in her sassy spanish dress she wore a scarlet off the shoulder satin dress with a pattern of intricate black embroidered flowers all over a black tutu material under skirt could also be seen and was great for dancing lydia black salsa dancing shoes added to the spice along with the black velvet choker and numerous black bracelets covering her wrists her hair was down in dark bouncy ringlets giving her a fun sexy look at least in sirius eyes her make up was in silvers and reds silver eye shadow with silver glitter and red blush and bright red lipstick were all applied to complete her feisty air why hello lady shabbit sirius bowed to lydia how do you do my dear lord shabbit lydia played as she admired his costume it reminded her of the bull fighters she had seen in pictures her parents brought back from one of their many trips to spain lady shabbit had originally been known as se orita ramirez so when the couple was married lord shabbit graciously agreed to keep close ties with spanish tradition this is why lord shabbit wore spanish clothes though his last name had no ties to the culture whatsoever sirius sported black leather pants and boots that fit perfectly his loose half open white blouse gave him a particularly sexy rugged look and the red black and silver cape and whip added even more flavor but all of this was graciously topped off with sirius long black hair making him look even more sexy in lydia eyes hey lydia james sirius yelled guys watch what i can do sirius then proceeded to remove his whip from his side whoa there sirius james replied with his hands up in surrender put that thing away dontyou remember that for after the dance james joked funny potter truly hilarious sirius replied with a meter thick of sarcasm coating each word but really he whined like a little kid i ve been practicing since i got it he then swung the whip in a huge circle above his head causing many around him to dodge for cover it all seemed to be going well as he brought the whip down expecting a huge crack but suddenly it veered off course and smacked him right in the forehead sirius instantly found himself tangled in the whip as he tried to fight it off the already laughing group began shouting for him to keep it up for he was winning in the fight for his life as he finally got himself untangled sirius wiped his brow panting i m alive good thing you showed that whip who boss lydia teased as she cautiously took the whip away from her boyfriend and gave him a peck on the cheek yah he puffed good thing i showed that whip yes dear it ok lydia patted him in a wifely fashion fighting to keep her laughter and smile from bursting out of her just rest you ve had a long day next was lara who had been listening for the conversation and laughter to die down in a huge grin and her old english garb her victorian style dress was white and gold the skirt was long and pouffy with a white petticoat underneath the sleeves were long and the neck line was very conservative and typical of the era the main pattern was a soft gold background with shiny silver and white crests embroidered everywhere but the chest area here was just a simple white fabric v that began wide touching both of her shoulders and coming to a point just above her navel her golden blonde hair was done up in a french twist with a few ringlets framing her face she also had shiny gold and silver eye shadows giving her a mysterious yet sophisticated look showing off her ice blue eyes soft pinks were used for her cheeks and lips so they wouldntdetract from her eyes remus stepped forward and offered lara his gloved hand as he said how do you do countess dinova and he kissed her hand remus had on tighter but not too tight victorian style slacks of dark grey with matching buckled shoes his shirt was of a golden beige that matched lara dress and a big kingly looking cape of silver white with the traditional faux fur collar splendid and you oh count dinova lara asked taking in remus handsome appearance couldntbe better he answered truthfully and if you liked what i could do with my whip exclaimed an all too familiar voice you should see what i can do with a sword no one really paid attention to the insane zorro wannabe but they heard the eminent thud and resulting ouch causing another spell of laughter and many exasperated shaking heads and finally lily came down in her gorgeous emerald city green dress it was a green a bit lighter than a normal green but not too olive like her slippers matched and her jewelry sparkled just like her eyes when she saw james james dressed in his black tuxedo and matching emerald city green cumber bund vest and tie complete with tails on the jacket and a cane which he insisted on nearly lost it when he saw lily thank goodness his friends werentpaying much attention as they were all talking amongst themselves james knew the dress looked wonderful on her but seeing it right then he wasntexpecting the true beauty he saw lily hair was all curled and loosely pulled back allowing several curls to frame her face while the rest took their place down her back her eye shadow was tan and lavender bringing out her green eyes a hundred times over her cheeks a pale pink and her lips were a light glossy pink as well my dearest lily i i mean lady zanath james stammered tugging nervously at his collar he then traded hands with his cane bowed and kissed lily hand lily giggled and replied my good lord zanath and she curtsied and tipped her head to him well sirius announced let go shall we and without waiting for any response he held out his arm for lydia and led the way on their way to the great hall the group met up with peter and his date isadora from hufflepuff both dressed as count and countess dracula isadora was a pretty sixth year girl with dirty blonde hair and brown eyes she was a bit on the plump side but that did not detract from her beautiful face in fact lily thought it added to it after everyone greeted the couple they all resumed their great trek to dinner and the ball when they entered the hall lily and james friends had to fight hard to keep from gasping the sight was amazing first the sky was clearer than it had been the whole week and the stars shone as bright as the almost full moon above when one looked up he or she also saw about two hundred live black bats flying around there were another three hundred or so decorating tables and walls jack o lanterns around the hall added to the spooky air their orange faces lit up the hall occasionally speaking to those that passed asking how scary their faces were streamers and confetti blanketed tables and chairs while candle lanterns lit up the dance floor and other floating candles shed light on the tables the tables had been shrunken to accommodate the smaller number of students attending and separated for easy access each table had ten seats so the group took one close to the dance floor due mostly to the girls pleading their menus were placed at their seats but no food adorned the table like it usually had this was something new to all of the students what do you suppose we re supposed to do asked a very confused sirius as he took a seat at the edge across from james there were no heads at the table do you think we re supposed to wiggle our noses or something then sirius did just that making a very amusing sight lily laughed so hard that she tripped and smacked sirius in the back of the head sorry she whined you know lily you ve really got to watch where you re going sirius replied as he rubbed his head you cantkeep hurting me like this i dontthink i can take it much longer he teased as he attempted crocodile tears lydia laughed at his insanity anyway dear back to your question she teased as she took her seat next to him and across from lily i not sure maybe he expects us to have already eaten she offered nah i expect that he cooked up some special surprise for us lara volunteered as she sat next to lydia with remus on her right maybe we ll have magical waiters and waitresses or maybe voiced the spunky isadora the plates will magically whisk out and levitate back with your orders she took her seat next to lily with peter to her left or maybe you ll get a chance to talk to people you haventseen or talked to in forever exclaimed a familiar voice lily lara and lydia heads snapped to the voice quicker than a bolt of lightning alice the trio screamed at the same time alice had graduated the previous year so the girls were very excited yet confused to see her how did you get here lily asked well frank and i are still going out and he asked your headmaster special if i could come to the ball he decided that there was no problem with it so i came she squealed with joy and pulled them all into a hug once again the four girls had been very close even though alice had been a year ahead as the girls proceeded to have a shrieking and giggling fest isadora included the guys all greeted frank who was obviously in their year but had an early birthday nice costume mate sirius complimented with a manly handshake and pat on the back careful not to knock frank bolts off his head as he was dressed as frankenstein your attention please commanded the transfiguration teacher professor mcgonagall and the students reacted and took their seats alice seating herself next to peter and frank next to remus thank you minerva the headmaster gestured for her and all to sit welcome all to our first and only halloween ball of this year everyone clapped and many laughed at the humor they all knew professor dumbledore and his sense of humor so contrasting to the serious nature of their transfiguration teacher this year he began as he signaled to the decorations never this extravagant before will be a bit different from prior years dances first i sure you all noticed more decorations this year courtesy of our head boy and girl mr potter and ms evans these two have spent a lot of time planning this ball so if you will all please join me a round of applause is in order then the headmaster as well as the entire hall broke into applause with sirius remus and peter whistling and hollering the loudest secondly the headmaster began bringing the complimentary silence of the hall that accompanied his voice each time he spoke there will be games and tournaments for the couples to play dancing will of course be a must and students and teachers will be able to request music this earned a slight titter of conversation from the students and teachers then the headmaster continued lastly you will see that there is no food at the table but only a plate utensils and a menu then twinkle in his eye grew a bit brighter as he paused here the yellow stars and moons on his plum robes seemed to flicker in the candle light seeming to keep up with the mysterious spirit of the occasion so i only leave you with this piece of advice please read over your menus carefully and thoroughly decide what you would like and notify that which will be holding it leaving the students and many teachers perplexed professor dumbledore took his seat and calmly said pork chops mashed potatoes and punch to his plate what happened next was almost too incredible to believe such a sight had never been seen at hogwarts before his plate seemed to grow just what he ordered out of thin air causing everyone to gasp the headmaster picked up his goblet and drank some punch but seemed to notice everyone staring at him he chuckled almost losing his juice in the process and stated well dontjust sit there tuck in chaos filled the hall as orders echoed back and forth and food appeared out of nowhere the students conversations filled the hall as the smells of food tugged at their tummies ahhh laughter food and music dumbledore sighed to professor mcgonagall three of the greatest forms of magic it a shame we dontteach them here but sir could you imagine the classes minerva countered what would the professors give for homework and tests what would become of them her serious manner caused the headmaster to laugh oh minerva he sighed loosen up it halloween he declared with a large smile and clamp on her shoulder this resulted in a nervous laugh from her and the comment albus you are quite the joker arentyou why professor dumbledore replied sheepishly i dontthink i ve blushed this much since my mum kissed me in front of all my friends in the sixth year only more blushing from mcgonagall met this comment back at the students table sirius and james were both on their fourth plateful of food their goal was to be the first one to eat his way through the entire menu so far sirius was winning as he was almost done with his fourth plate and james was merely halfway through you better not be counting on me to roll you back to the dorm lily teased james because if you are you can plan on sleeping here with the bats all night but james only grunted in response as he was keeping his death glare of determination fixed on sirius lily then shot a look of let do it at lydia who knew exactly what she meant and it was on oh james dear lily cooed in his ear sirius my love lydia whispered softly each male kept eating but at a slightly slower pace as each was interested in what the girls had to say i ve been thinking each girl said quietly with a silent grin this caused each guy to snap their food stuffed face at his girlfriend not only sporting spots of mashed potatoes and gravy but also looks of confused yet excited expectation they each gulped down the food in their mouths both lily and lydia slowly leaned into james and sirius respectively giving them each a sweet innocent eyelash batting look let dance each girl shouted they shot up grabbed the closest hand of their boyfriend and pulled them to the dance floor as the guys slowly and dejectedly removed the napkins from in their shirts and followed with disappointed and defeated looks those still at the table burst out laughing absolutely howling at the situation and its irony the quartet was dancing altogether on the dance floor to a particularly fast song lily and lydia were nothing short of crazy on the dance floor throwing their arms up turning twisting and in lily case smacking sirius in the face you know lily we ve really got to stop meeting like this sirius teased rubbing his head yet again sirius we really should stop fighting you just get me so upset and i tend to lash out you should know that by now she played along oh lily let never fight again i dontwant to get beat up anymore sirius pleaded this caused the whole group to hoot at the situation what i was being serious you re going to have to be a lot more than serious if you think you re going to stay here mudblood lover snarled the all too familiar voice of their favorite slytherin malfoy cantyou just give it a rest for one night lily shot back ooo i see she a bit feisty tonight boys malfoy persisted then he turned to james you better put a muzzle on her next time you take her out she might bite someone and infect them he spat i wouldntbe talking malfoy james threatened as he stepped towards him lily quickly grabbed his arm letting him know that she didntwant him to start anything malfoy of course noticed this and sniggered at it what you need permission from your bitch to be a man or are you just completely incapable of being a man really malfoy you cantjust give it up for one night can you lily exploded coming right up to his face with the dancing going on around them none of the teachers were aware of what was going on i ll show you how to give it up mudblood i ll show you what it like to be with a real man malfoy challenged that was the last straw for james he came barreling at malfoy but sirius held him back knowing a fight was just what malfoy wanted he tried to tell james this but he wasnthaving much luck james scraped and threw wild punches in malfoy direction tell me malfoy lily began as she spat out his name with almost as much malice as he said her name why is it that you hate me so much are you really a scared little boy underneath that devil exterior or does it have something to do with your parents did your sleezball daddy have an affair with a muggle what is it please i dying to know lily baited malfoy pierced her with his menacing and obviously seething stare i ll tell you why i hate you evans you represent all that is tainted in this world everything filthy and unsuitable for living you are like a bug an ugly dirty bug that constantly annoys people and needs to be squashed malfoy inched even closer to her face spitting on her with his rancid breath with each syllable you are a filthy mudblood and you will never succeed in this world because you are contaminated infected impure and foul lily temper was way past it breaking point and was now starting to show in her flushed cheeks clenched fists and shaking body behind her she could still hear james struggling to free himself from sirius grasp but every shred of her attention was on malfoy she wished she could have just smacked him or caused him major pain but it wouldntbe worth losing her prestige so she thought quick and came up with a safe yet ingenious plan contaminated you say she dared infected then very slowly she brought her hand up and placed it on malfoy shoulder keeping it there as he turned his head to it well whatever disease i have i guess you ve got it now then she removed her hand turned away and walked toward a stunned james everything then went in slow motion lily saw people backing away with horrified looks on their faces and she saw james mouth open and yell something to her that she didntunderstand he was pointing at her no not at her at where she had just come from at malfoy lily turned just in time to see the stream of blood red sparks shoot at her now

your review vickiicky yay i glad you liked that it was really sirius and not an actual death eater i didntlike when lydia got mad at lily either but it just kind of seemed like it should happen lydia is insecure about herself so the whole situation spooked her but it resolved itself in the end awwww thank you and its imperfect lol but dontworry about it i do that stuff all the time and i usually end up making new words more lily kissing lol i ll see what i can do and the tension between the gryffindors and slytherins will be seen a lot more in chapter 20 so dontfear about the lily kissing

to everyone who reviewed i luv you all well here we go with the next chapter i hope you all like the answer to the cliffhanger thank you to all who reviewed so on with the story liane chapter 19 a simple thing faster than lightning lily whipped out her wand and cast a frighteningly good shielding spell and just in time too malfoy spell was inches from her face until it suddenly hit the invisible barrier and bounced back with full force but unlike lily malfoy wasntquick enough and the spell hit him square in his chest the wounded malfoy staggered back half in surprise and half from the spell then fell to the ground he appeared to have escaped unscathed aside from the fact that he was unconscious immediately malfoy fellow slytherins were at his side attempting to revive their fallen leader but lily who was very satisfied that he got at least a fraction of what he deserved turned to her friends speechless as they were and calmly walked back over to them as soon as her hands found james right on cue a slow song began gliding over the dance floor causing couples to pair up and the overall mood to quiet down quick thinking there lils james spoke softly into her ear you seemed to know exactly what to do i impressed really that funny lily replied a bit confused i had no idea whatsoever what i was doing i guess it becoming sort of reflexive or something like that at this james placed a finger to her lips to cease her rambling then as close to her ear as he could get he whispered just know that i ll always be here for you right here by your side he said softly as they danced and what you did with malfoy back there i would have been there if sirius hadnttackled me but so you know he said pulling them slightly apart so he could look at her i think it was bloody brilliant and james whisked lily off her feet and twirled her in circles lily giggled and her laughter filled james with its warmth making him feel like the luckiest guy in the world he finally set her down a couple spins later leaving them both a bit dizzy but this didntstop lily mind from going a million thoughts a second let play a game i ll bet you cantcap more bottles than me she baited with a grin do you want to bet on that he countered with his own rebellious smirk yup and dontthink that i ll go easy on you potter lily retorted with a demanding air just because that thick head of yours convinces you that you re unstoppable doesntmean it sways the rest of us she continued with an air of mock earnestness seeing james jaw go slack at her words she took silent pleasure at her win and tapped her foot in thought hmmmm shall we say one week worth of potions homework then potter or are you too scared she challenged with the grin returning you re on said james shaking her hand and just so you know i not in the least bit afraid of you evans last one there is a rotten pumpkin hey chorused some nearby jack o lanterns that entire night was one of the best nights if not the best night of their lives games dancing prizes singing laughing malfoy being knocked unconscious and more laughing they were all for that one last night completely carefree light hearted and untroubled teenagers how could any night ever match the merriment that this one brought together they all agree that they had never had so much fun before and probably never would sadly they didntknow how right they were the group merrily made its way out of the great hall singing the newly written song by james sirius remus and peter that they all knew by this point since it had been sung so many times by the boys great green globs of greasy grimy griffin guts mutilated manticore meat dirty little bundimun feet french fried erklings swimmin in a bowl of blood i need a spoon and my wand but i ve got a bowtuckle they all chorused loudly and happily down the hall while many people stared at them disgusted eventually after the fifth repeat of the song james and lily bid their friends farewell as the group parted ways to go back to their own common rooms exhausted they clambered into the portrait hole james with his jacket and cane in hand and the top few buttons on his shirt undone and lily with her hair flying free and ballet slippers hanging around her neck both collapsed onto the couch as soon as they saw it what a night james sight his limbs feeling like they usually did after a grueling quidditch match yah lily breathed i thought i d never stop laughing after sirius and lydia won cutest couple james laughed remembering it as well i think that kiss turned mcgonagall cheeks to a nice permanent shade of beet red i doubt it they ll even be back to their normal color by monday lily giggled and dontforget you owe me a week worth of potions homework mr big wild shot lily said with raised eyebrows and unsuppressed laughter yah yah james waved her off obviously wanting to forget about it i still maintain that bat slew me with its death ray eyes here james gestured in a maniacal fashion along the lines of trying to make his index fingers appear to be coming out of his eyes causing lily to laugh even more if it hadntbeen for that bat i wouldnthave detention on monday honestly professor trallick nose didntlook that bad lily who had been laughing all through james excuse ceased abruptly it 1 11 make a wish she squealed as she shut her eyes crossed her fingers and proceeded to lose herself in deep thought james who didntunderstand what she meant refused to admit his ignorance or ruin the moment just followed lily instruction he closed his eyes and wished for the one thing he had wanted since first year a long happy life with his one and only the girl sitting right next to him he opened his eyes to a yawning lily and couldnthelp but grin tired how how could you tell she asked through her yawn as best as she could and finished with a smirk well let go then shall we lady zanath certainly my good sir then the two lugged themselves to the steps lily in the lead following with his head drooping he hadntnoticed lily stop and ran into her ooof lily then dramatically fell onto the steps with a hand to her forehead causing james to chuckle at her antics he held out his hand to her come on up we go sorry about that he said as he helped lily to her feet no problem lily replied then turned to the stairs stairs she spoke to them prepare to meet your maker lily eyes silted in fierce concentration her body was so tired and sore that the stairs seemed like an endless mountain she would have to scale james felt her forehead are you sure malfoy curse didnthit you ha ha she replied sarcastically without turning to him then lily secured her hands on the railings and tentatively lifted her right foot to the first step ow ouch ooch she exclaimed with each step but as she neared the middle of the case she knew she wouldntmake it so she released her hands from the railings and reached them out two steps up and continued to crawl the rest of the way only to be cheered on by james howling laughter you think it soooo funny dontyou potter lily called over her shoulder well you wontbe laughing so much once you try it and she sniggered with the thought trying to maintain his macho man disposition james waited until lily was up and sitting out of the way then taking a running start he jumped up the stairs three at a time landing right in front of lily on the landing but as soon as he stood there he realized his mistake his tight muscles began shaking and the pain cut through his legs like a knife howling in pain he collapsed beside lily as she like any caring girlfriend laughed at him alright you ve carried on long enough lily resolved five minutes later with the dregs of her laughter still remaining anyways you think it bad now wait until monday it ll be the worst then i promise she carefully got to her feet then held out her hands for james who heard what she had said and was now fake crying still crying crocodile tears he grabbed her arms and pulled himself up well what did i tell you lily asked with a smug look at james what do you mean james asked concernedly tears ceasing immediately what do i oh honestly james you are a prat she replied laughing james gasped as if he were on stage and took a step back with his hand to his heart i beg your pardon madame but i am no prat lily only laughed at this and hugged james around his middle they then hugged and kissed goodnight and with the last hug james lingered a bit too long and playfully pulled her towards his door i dont think so lily played back in a high pitched voice just kidding lils you know i wouldn t james replied then with his eyes rolled to the side he teased well tonight anyway james lily exclaimed as she smacked his arm and laughed then she hugged him one last time goodnight james lily said with an air of finality but the hint of laughter vetoed it as being serious goodnight lils james replied dragging her into one last embrace sweet dreams you too the lily reluctantly pulled herself from his strong arms and trudged to her room once inside she let out a long breath as the night washed over her she changed into her comfy pants and a t shirt as quick as her leaden body would allow her she made herself brush her teeth and remove her make up with a flick of her wand and when she finally flung her worn out body into bed she passed out instantly but what met her was not a calm sleep that usually comes upon those who are exhausted instead she found herself dreaming a dream so real it felt like she was awake rest did not quench her overtiredness lily found herself walking down a well kept almost beautiful spot lit path in the middle of a forest so pitch black and horrible that it easily rivaled the depths of the forbidden forest on the hogwarts grounds lily knew she was looking for something but she didnthave a clue as to what it was in only a minute or so lily came across james taking his hand in hers the hand that made her feel safe the two walked on in determined silence only a couple of minutes later to lily surprise they came upon four circular flat rocks each rock was a different color she saw one black one grey one brown and one red something pushed her to pick them up so yielding her instinct she put three in her pockets and kept her hand around the grey one while her other hand sought james reassuring grasp for the next couple of minutes lily followed the twisting path with only the haunting sounds of the surrounding forest as the only signs of life apart from her and james his hand comforted her kept her safe and gave her courage to continue on but right as lily convinced herself that she d be safe if only she stayed on the path a snake broke that assurance lily tried to get around it but for some reason she knew that she could not step off the path the darkness around it threatened to swallow her with the slightest misstep so with her hand clenched around the single grey stone she thought quick and tossed it at the snake spooked the snake slithered away into the shadows defeated but unharmed so lily and james were free to continue again for quite some time without interference but again they came upon the same black snake and this time lily noted the reddish diamond upon its head frantically lily grabbed the brown stone and scared the creature away with a sigh of relief but soon it tried to attack them again causing her to throw the red rock as it got bolder and advanced on them further frightened now more than ever lily with only the jet black stone left and james presence to give her courage wasntsure how many more times she d meet the snake but just as she began thinking of other ways to scare it off the vile creature was back and more determined than before again seeing no other option lily threw the final stone at her quarry but this time the snake was not alarmed or scared much to lily horror instead the snake caught the stone in its mouth clamped down hard with its jaws and shattered it shattering any hopes lily had of progressing unscathed not knowing where else to go or what else to do lily tried in vain to reach a stick or anything near to her that would help her fight of the serpent but unless she stepped off the path there was no way for her to reach so her attempts were in vain the snake was so big and so powerful that it made lily feel like she were a gnat and it was an elephant she stretched as far as she could but the snake broke her from her efforts it turned on her with its blood thirsty eyes and for one moment lily stared into those eyes unafraid its menacing glare threatening to crush her only made lily want to fight more but as soon as that renewed vigor came it was lost as the serpent clamped its razor sharp teeth around her arm lily screamed as the pain seared through her she could feel its fangs and its venom seeping into her wound the edges of her vision began darkening threatening to overtake her with the pain but suddenly the pain ceased and for a split second she thought she might be dead but she forced opened her tearing eyes to see james wrestling the snake which was now the size of a very large boa constrictor lily tried to run and help but james waved her off and spoke for the first time save it keep it safe at least that what she thought he said she was pretty sure but his grunts and yells in his effort of fighting the snake garbled his words lily struggled to understand him further but it proved impossible she knew she should run but she couldntjust leave him there so again she headed for james intending to help her heart crying out for him but his time it was not james words that froze her in her tracks it was his scream the scream of a man in complete agonizing pain lily face drained of any blood that was left as the cold nauseating feeling swept through her like a tidal wave it took a moment for lily mind to comprehend what she was seeing but she forced herself to look and to think she saw that the snake as despicable as it was had wrapped part of its body around james left arm and was pulling while it sunk its gigantic fangs into his shoulder a sickening pop reached lily ears as james shoulder dislocated and she had trouble keeping herself from retching at the sound lily eyes would not listen to her mind pleas to look away now the snake had james whole body locked in its scaly bind she watched as james blood seeped from his shoulder wound as some trickled down his face his glasses were already gone he screamed for lily to run but her feet seemed to be rooted in place and all she could do was watch the horror unfold disbelieving she heard the snake hiss at james as it drew back to attack causing lily to cringe it opened its enormous jaws large enough to swallow a pig whole its fangs already red from james blood and seeping the same black poison it had used on lily gleamed bright in the sickly pale spotlight on the path filling lily with more fear and hatred she had ever known in her life then to lily horror the snake attacked quicker than the blink of an eye stealing the air from lily lungs as it sunk its ivory daggers into james exposed neck lily screamed bloody murder cheeks crimson and hair in her face lily bolted upright in her bed with the tail end of her scream she felt her body damp with sweat and shaking hastily peeling off the covers she shoved her unsure feet to the ground her blood throbbed in her veins and she could hear it booming in her ears she tried to heave herself from her bed but her aching muscles protested and she fell to the ground hot tears had already dried on her face but a new stream flowed as the pain slashed through her again burned into her vision was the last moment of her dream it was as if she had stared at the sun for too long burning the picture into her retinas she tried to push the picture from her vision forcing her eyes to adjust to the darkness they strained to pick up any photon of light they could find but her tears kept getting in the way again she forced her body up this time grabbing her bed sheets for balance she stayed there with the bed for support until the rapid quaking of her legs slowed to an occasional shudder determined lily fought her way to the door and flung it open she quickly crossed to james door and didntrealize what she was doing until her hand was on the handle she wanted to see that he was still there she didntcare how intense the pain was she wanted no she needed to see that james was alright but she wasntsure it running to him in the middle of the night was such a great idea lily tried to slow her rasping breaths and stop her freely flowing tears but her body only shook more from the exertion of her fruitless attempts and the still ringing shock of her dream it had been a dream hadntit awkwardly she pushed james door open and scrambled into the moonlit room james sat up awoken by the noise and stared at her lily it three in the morning what are you james began but as his eyes quickly adjusted to the dark he saw her disheveled figure her hair gleamed in the moonlight damp and matted with sweat and all over the place her breathing was ragged and tears were drenching her face her body shook as she help onto the doorknob for dear life and in one swift movement james was off his bed and holding her james she gasped you re alive her words came out in odd pitches and gulps she kept muttering between her sobs but james was only able to understand that one sentence james you re alive he didntquite understand it but he picked her up like a small child and carried her to his bed he didntcare where he put her but he needed to calm her down and find out what was bothering her he knew it was sappy but it killed him to see her like this as james set lily down on his bed she only became more frantic he grasped her hand squatted beside her much to his thighs dismay and put his right hand to her forehead you re burning up he couldntbelieve how warm she was and he covered her in his blankets james she said through her now slowing sobs you re alive please just stay i dontwant you to go i dontwant you to die stay please with each word she came closer to tears and by the end she was fighting hard just to get the words out calm down lily he tried in a soothing voice dontworry i here remember he kept sweeping his hand across her forehead and down her arm hoping to calm her her cries began slowing and her breathing began its long journey back to normal but he could do nothing for the pain and fear in her eyes and that scared him the most after a long couple of minutes james finally spoke lily he began tell me what happened what did you see by now she had stopped shaking and crying she looked at james with terror in her eyes and said the snake it killed you and and you said to go but i didn t i couldn t lily choked out as yet more tears fell silently from her eyes it took all her strength to sit up but she did and flung her arms around james neck determined to prove that he was indeed by her side not knowing exactly what to do james just held her he rubbed her back and whispered in her ear soon his overworked quads screamed out in pain from his awkward position combined with their already being sore he was tired and his muscles burned so he stood up careful to set lily back on the pillow assuring her he wasntleaving and climbed up onto the bed to lily right james lay down next to lily on his side as the frightened girl curled into him feeling safe in his arms she beneath the covers and him above them lily got as close to james as she could she knew now that it had been a dream but she still jumped at every little sound it had been too real and too horrible for her to forget the forest the stones the snake what did it all mean she tried to keep her mind busy afraid she would see james die again if she slept but james deep voice was now humming a tune a soft sweet soothing tune that hypnotized her eyelids shut her last thought before the darkness of a dreamless sleep overtook her was not of fear but a simple thought of i didntknow he could sing he heard and felt her breathing slow and flow in the even rhythm of sleep james finished the tune his mother used to hum to him and carefully let his head down from his hand he was worried about lily he d never seen her this scared and he still wasntsure what it was that had frightened her no not frightened her terrified her but he would have to wait until the next day she was sleeping and obviously didntwant to talk about it so james brought the covers up to lily chin then let sleep sweep over him as he held her close determined to protect her james woke the next morning to find lily was no longer in his arms but a quick scan of the room told him she was sitting in a chair staring out the window james saw her damp hair telling him she must have showered the bags and dark circles under her eyes told him she hadntslept well if she got any sleep at all and her occasional shiver showed him that he needed to be at her side without a word james hopped from the bed and encompassed lily in a hug that he hoped would tell her that he was there for her but lily body didntyield to his embrace she remained stiff as a board with her eyes still focused on the air right outside the window james released her praying that she wasntupset with him though he had no idea why she would be so he stared at her trying to find some sign to show him that she knew he was there he gently pushed her hair from her face and cupped it in his right hand finally a response lily tipped her head into his hand ever so slightly as her eyelids fluttered as if waking she turned to him and looked at him as if she hadntseen him in years lily shifted the rest of her body from the chair to james who was now kneeling on the ground closing her eyes and calming with his touch james held her as if saying that he d never let go the silence sealed their promise and their love with a simple embrace a simple breath a simple understanding the rest of the day the two stayed in james room with the exception of james carefully going to the kitchens to grab some food for the two of them he had to go in the invisibility cloak because he didntwant to run into anyone especially his fellow marauders since they were supposed to be planning their next chess night but he really didntwant to explain why he couldntbe there so he brought the food back to his room and towards mid afternoon finally coaxed lily into eating something lily eventually explained the dream and why she had been so frightened james responded by assuring her that he was alive and didnthave any plans to be killed by a snake causing lily to giggle a bit relaxing the mood incredibly he also suggested maybe going to the divination teacher professor phillips to see what it might mean and finally after lily relaxed a bit from james humor and comforting presence she slept just like a baby right in james arms in the chair she had been in when james first woke the next day the gang wanted to know the scoop on why no one had seen either of them the day before first they all asked politely but as breakfast began and lily was dragged between lydia and lara and james between sirius and remus slightly more scandalous things were suggested just as lydia was beginning a question with her eyebrows raised in that come on you can tell us the truth look hundreds of owls swooped into the great hall scarlett swooped expertly to lily and landed lightly on her outstretched arm it served as a distraction and ended up being a letter from home dear lily how was the ball what did you wear was it fun did you have a good time with james was he a gentleman of course he was silly me but how are you dear i know i just wrote recently but i have a quick question for you the christmas ball is on the night of the 23rd correct because max has been asking me if he can have dinner at his friend mikey house that night since he cantgo to the ball i wanted to double check the date with you because well you know as well as i do that sometimes your brother has a tendency to forget things so let me know and i hope that you had a great night at the dance love mum james and lily sittin in a tree came the sing songy voice of sirius interrupting lily thoughts k i sirius and lydia cam james voice over sirius as he stood up sittin in a tree ten times louder than his friend k james and lily sirius bellowed so loud that the whole hall went silent and stared at him as he was now standing on the bench and red in the face from shouting are two great people arentthey sirius quickly began clapping to cover his embarrassed silence but no one accept a gaggle of giggling girls all part of sirius fan club joined in his clapping so he muttered and took his seat embarrassed which was a very rare state for sirius to be in on cue as ever as soon as everyone resumed their meals the other six in their group of seven burst out laughing and didntstop until they were in muggles studies muggles studies brought about nothing very exciting except detention for james and sirius who continued to try to outdo one another and ended up almost setting fire to the cookies they were supposed to be watching herbology however was quite a different story the class was taking a short quiz on identifying and potting various plants each student would be given a set of earmuffs dragon hide gloves protective eyewear and a plant of some sort through her plastic goggles lily could see that devil snare lay before her naturally she knew exactly what to do careful to grab it at the base with two gloved hands lily lifted the plant from it container and about a minute and a half later had it successfully repotted leaving her to daydream until everyone else was finished her eyes drifted over her classmates james skillfully potting a mandrake but not before sticking it in sirius face lara having a bit of trouble containing her periwinkle puff but getting it under control with a bit of help from remus her eyes danced around all the different plants in the room ones with flowers others with thorns her eyes the glanced out at the trees of and vines of the forbidden forest lily mind wandered there as well what could all possible be in there she allowed her gaze to linger a few moments longer before she pulled her attention back to the class but just as she was about to turn two glinting orbs seemed to stare at her from very near the ground instantly lily mind whirled back to her dream and to the cold pitiless blood red eyes of the snake she saw james yell to her she saw the snake ready for its attack she saw the gleam of its venom filled fangs and blacked out so what did you think i hoped you liked it so here are some questions to get your gracious minds thinking how was the answer to the cliffhanger did everyone get what they deserved what were all

thanks for your review i glad you like it is this a soon enough update prongsie jamesie i glad you like the marauders personalities i know the lily lydia lara thing may be a little hard now but i promis it has a purpose chapter 2 twisted exclamations lily straightened up composed herself closed her mouth and demanded james potter you give that badge right back to the poor bloke you stole it from before i take points away james just smirked at her why isnthe getting upset why doesnthe just give it back he doesnthonestly think anyone will believe he head boy does he potter i swear i ll take points as much as i want gryffindor to win i ll do it lily screamed at him lily lily oh beautiful lily haventyou heard i didntsteal it i am head boy james replied with the biggest smile he could conjure now be serious lily pleaded you called me love sirius poked his head in the door what lily exclaimed thoroughly confused you called my name i just wanted to know what it was that you wanted luuuuuuvvv sirius joked unfortunately for sirius lily was not in a joking mood you two are seriously impossible lily screamed no he jamesly impossible i siriusly impossible sirius said with a triumphant smile spread wide across his face as james went over to high five sirius and congratulate him on his sirius cleverness all lily could do was exclaim argh then shake her head and mutter boys all of this year prefects began to pile into the car and lily was absolutely relieved to see remus remus james has gone and stolen your head boy badge lily whined remus to lily utter surprise looked slightly embarrassed umm lily i m not i not head boy remus confessed lily could have just about died with shock and embarrassment oh remus i so sorry i didntmean no no no it quite alright really i dontmind remus interjected remus was being honest for he didntthink it a good idea for him to be living in such close quarters with anyone other than a marauder for those special circumstances but by this time lily was speechless lily was now just trying to accept the fact that james potter was head boy lily was in complete disbelief lily walked right up to james who had been half watching lily and half listening to sirius tease him about lily reaction and just stared right into his face with the oddest look ever uh lily i know i sexy and all but damn woman i didntknow you thought i looked this good i flattered james exclaimed with a huge grin creeping across his face lily was snapped out of her trance like state of horror and screamed james potter who on earth do you think you are i was not looking at you because of your looks cause lord knows they re not good enough to goggle at for a person with at least half a brain but i was staring at you trying to figure out how an egotistical bigheaded joke like you managed to get head boy which by the way requires that you arent the biggest prat that ever lived lily bellowed at him james was completely taken aback and was now the one in disbelief he looked hurt but the outside was nothing compared to the inside where a whole had just been cut in his heart this outburst was worse than usual and lily and james didntspeak to each other until the meeting was over james broke the silence first you really think all of that about me james calmly asked as they cleaned up after the meeting lily rage had cooled off a tiny bit and she wasntyelling anymore which was a huge step yes potter but i dontthink it i know it because you are it lily replied icily you know i promise i really not that bad if you d just give me even half a chance and i was only teasing about my looks before i thought you knew james tried stunned lily stuttered i a well i a sorry lily finally said but you re still an egotistical git and with that lily stormed out of the car to find lydia and lara james just stood there awestruck partly because of her abrupt exit but more so because lily evans had just been civil i cantbelieve it she apologized to me me james potter the person she cannot stand to be in the same room with for more than two minutes with out screaming after about five minutes of these thoughts and continued staring at the place where lily stood last remembering her complete and utter beauty james wiped the drool off his face pushed in the last two chairs and set off to find the rest of the marauders lily in the meantime found her friends in their compartment but unfortunately they were not alone sirius peter and remus had joined them although lily did not mind remus in fact she was very good friends with him the fact that they were all in there meant that james would be joining them peter whom she hadntseen until now was a short plump boy his hair was a mousy brown to match his small watery rodent like eyes once in a while peter made humorous and even intelligent comments but unlike the rest of the marauders peter was an awful student as much as they wanted to help him peter was basically a lost cause just then none other than james potter entered the compartment jarring lily out of her thoughts so wishing to ignore james at all costs lily started gossiping with her friends about their summers then as lydia was just getting into a particularly juicy part of her summer fling story james called lily my love it is time we must depart good go then lily said impatiently as she continued to listen to lydia no you must come as well bid your friends a fond farewell and follow me james announced putting on an act of chivalry you must be munching on dungbombs again cantyou see i in the middle of a story i donthave time for you shenanigans if we must depart then go i dontsee the problem but i not going with you no matter how much you beg me lily hissed at him alright i guess i ll just have to make our rounds all by my lonesome james shrugged knowing for a fact that this would get her attention oh lily exclaimed jumping out of her seat then she turned to james and the energy she had seemed to have exited her body completely let go then she muttered after you m lady the most beautiful most gorgeous most wonderful most save it potter lily hissed and shove it where the sun dontshine ouch evans james gasped faking injury to his heart even sirius looked up just in time to catch the fainting james sirius and james had pulled this many times that hurt said the now limp body of james hanging in sirius arms potter lily began in a seductive tone yah james exclaimed excitedly jumping from sirius arms let go lily yelled breaking the act and with that james bowed his head in defeat and walked out the door as soon as lily closed it sirius howled with laughter alright lily started let start at the back of the train and work up hey lily what happened to i not going with you no matter how much you beg me james joked donteven start potter lily said rolling her eyes so james just nodded and followed his beautiful goddess lily everything was going well or at least better than lily thought it was going to be then to lily surprise she opened a particularly noisy compartment and saw her brother maximus evans the scene couldnthave been more hilarious lily younger brother max was standing on one of the seats shouting no way pasta is waaaaaay better than grilled cheese i mean come on grilled cheese is just cheese and bread lily laughed there was her short 50 red haired skinny little brother trying to win his fight by attempting to make himself seem taller max was a loud one but smart even though his mind was on food a lot on the other side michael potter max best friend since their first year screamed nu uuuh grilled cheese is the bestest and i win so there mikey was tall for a third year at 56 with light brown hair and blue grey eyes he was almost as loud as her brother neither of them had noticed lily come in hey what are you two screaming for lily teased making them both jump hey lilymeister max yelled as he almost tackled his sister to the ground maxamillion lily shouted back as she hugged her brother jamesypooh yelled james startling everyone in the compartment max mikey and their friends kyle alex maria isabelle and liz all laughed at james joke but lily just rolled her eyes what james asked innocently i felt left out he then turned to his brother hey there sport what up james asked while giving his little brother a noogie well not much since last time i saw you since right before we got on the train mikey said with that you should have known that tone and a nudge in james ribs and eye roll in the direction where maria was chatting with her friends ooooohhh is she the one you were telling me about all summer james asked excitedly nudging mikey back yes so dontyou dare go messing things up mikey warned half joking and half serious well i glad you had fun max but i gotta go now and finish up my rounds with this bloody dolt over here lily said unenthusiastically ok sis i ll see you later and max grabbed mikey arm and pulled him back to their friends bye mikey james waved and mikey waved back with a huge smile for his older brother with that lily closed the door and continued walking just as lily was getting used to the calm quietness once again james asked lily will you go out with me potter how many times do i have to tell you lily pleaded as they passed by a compartment of slytherins only once when you say yes james replied oh very nice try potter but sorry you are assuming and are mistaken lily paused waiting for james to start whining again but she looked at him and he looked as if he were waiting for

like to welcome disasta masta back to the story and i would like to extend a warm welcome to our new reviewers barbwirekisses notyouraverageblond and rachel hope you all keep reviewing and more points go to hottiesplomiegurl for the best guess at the interpretation of the dream an extra thanks goes out to spygirl4747 singdownthemoonhorselver prongsie jamsie lunerflower and iluvgerardbutler for their awesome reviews in case anyone was wondering the rocks in the dream symbolized the three times that lily and james defied voldemort and the last time that they were overcome the black snake with red eyes naturally symbolizes the evil lord voldemort the fact that james jumps on the snake is parallel to how he fights voldemort first and tells lily to take harry the spot lit path represents the right and good path and the surrounding woods represents the evil and dark ways well here we go with the next chapter hope you all like it chapter 20 discord dispatched slowly lily opened her eyes but couldntreally see anything she felt strong arms holding her but at the moment she wasntsure who they belonged to she heard voices asking her questions but she didntunderstand them and she found she was lying on the ground but she couldntremember how she got there through her blurry vision she was able to make out her professor squatting in front of her are you alright dear lily blinked her eyes trying to make them focus she tried to say she was alright though that wasntthe truth but the sharp pain in her head and the fact that she couldntget her vocal chords to cooperate prevented her from answering well we had better get you off to the hospital wing then up you go slowly now her teacher guided lily heard james low voice say that he would take her and she didntprotest in fact lily would have much rather had it that way so she let herself be guided out of the greenhouse and into the fresh air of the hogwarts grounds once lily lungs breathed the cool crisp air it was as if she finally woke up she remembered the devil snare and the quiz the forest and then the eyes the eyes that triggered her flashback reflexively she stopped in her tracks and swung around to where she had seen them when she didntthe eyes she scolded herself for being so foolish of course the eyes or the animal they belonged to wouldntstill be there are you alright james asked snapping lily out of her thoughts and making her realize that there was someone there oh oh yah she said as she collected her thoughts i fine i just she trailed off had a day dream he asked concernedly yah i just saw thought i saw a snake and i guess my mind just kind of wandered that all lily shivered at the memory and james tightened the arm he had around her shoulders well we better get you to the hospital wing james concluded as he began walking again no i ll be alright lily said quickly she didntfeel like explaining why she was sent to madame pomfrey i just need to clear my head i guess are you sure i mean you fell pretty hard james insisted i fine lily sighed slightly annoyed i just need to lie down and think they walked a bit further without speaking lily breathed deep and her head began clearing james kept throwing her sideways glances to see if she really was alright the color was coming back to her cheeks but that could just have been the cool air nipping at them lily are you sure james persisted clearly concerned for her you could just get some pepper up potion or some chocolate james lily snapped would you just let it go i fine ok i dontsee what the big deal is i only fainted it not like i dropped over dead lily stopped again and was all out shouting with annoyance by this point stunned to silence james had stopped a bit before lily causing her to turn and face him his expression was hard for lily to read through her mounting anger and frustration but from what she could still make out she saw he was hurt lily forced herself to calm down and take a deep breath but when she opened her mouth to apologize james cut her off you re right i sorry he stated shortly i just thought that you know what never mind he finished softly then he turned and walked back to herbology now it was lily turn to stand there speechless she almost went after him but her now pounding head forced her to turn around and head for the her dormitory she took a shower and sat looking out the window mulling things over in her head until lunch hey lily are you alright lara asked when she saw her friend walk into lunch yah i fine have you seen james she asked looking around umm yah lara replied looking at lily with utter confusion lining her face he sirius remus and peter grabbed some food and left i not sure where they went though remus kind of gave me that don t ask look lara stated with the concerned attitude like this had never happened before why well we kind of had a row lily admitted as she sat down and helped herself to a salami sandwich what happened lydia asked sitting across from lily and lara i donteven really know lily sighed brushing it off like it was nothing but the truth was it was slowly eating away at her changing the subject she asked about what they had done in transfiguration her friends must have gotten the hint because neither of them brought up james or any of the marauders for the rest of the lunch with only ten minutes remaining the girls said their goodbyes and lily split off from the other two as she made her way to her defense class when she entered the room she wasntsurprised to see the guys at the back two tables so lily took the hint and sat at an empty table away but not too far from them and waited for class to start professor trallick greeted the class and launched right into the boring part of class as they all called it so biting her lip in determination and concentration lily took out a smaller piece of parchment and began writing trying hard to make it look like she was taking notes instead she wrote a note of apology james i sorry about what i said earlier i know you were just trying to help i had no reason to blow up at you like that and i sorry i hope you can forgive me love lily lily read it over a couple of times it was short simple and hopefully sweet satisfied she folded it up and waited for the perfect moment and about a minute later professor trallick turned to the blackboard and guiding her chalk with her wand wrote the notes she wanted the class to copy it was now or never wingardium leviosa lily whispered as she swished and flicked her wand she quickly guided the note across the room to james all the while shaking with nervousness the note folded neatly into a square hit james who was playing some game with sirius in the side of his head he jumped a bit then spotted the note which was now on top of his unopened book at first he just stared at it with the utmost interest he then grinned and shot a look at remus and peter but his surprise showed on his face when he saw peter was sound asleep and drooling on his book and remus was busy writing down notes confused james stare snapped back to the letter then without a moment hesitation he pounced on it and ripped it open lily watched him carefully from behind the cover of her book as james eyes slowly traveled down the short piece of parchment his face changed from the look of interest and scheming to one of interest amusement and understanding without so much as glancing in her direction james scribbled down something on the parchment haphazardly refolded it and was about to send it back over to lily when sirius snatched it out of james hand to lily dismay he opened the letter and read it as a maniacal grin and disbelief flowed over his face once he was finished reading which was quite a task as james kept trying to summon the paper back to him he turned to lily with an intense stare of disapproval shaking a finger at her and shaking his head he didntrealize professor trallick had stopped talking are you going to rejoin us mr black she twittered as she walked over to his table after tripping over two bags and getting her robes caught on a chair she made it to his side five points from gryffindor mr black i not quite sure what you think you are trying to pull but i assure you it will not be in my class sirius gave her his best sad puppy dog face trembling bottom lip and all and it seemed to catch her attention really mr black my two year old nephew tries that with me and if a cute little thing like him cantchange my mind with it you certainly won t apparently after six whole years of giving teachers that face they caught on and it no longer affected them the professor tut tutted and scrambled back to the front of the classroom almost knocking over a couple of chairs on the way lily turned her attention back to the two guys and almost snorted aloud with laughter when she saw sirius face his cute puppy dog face had now drooped into more of a whining bulldog face his eyes flickered a bit with contempt but the rest of his face fell even further with his defeat james stole this opportunity to stealthily grab the letter back but without moving even a muscle in his face sirius clenched his hand back around the note james sagged again defeated quickly checking the status of professor trallick sirius risked a small gesture at the letter then a finger in lily direction with a question in his eyes as if asking lily if the letter was truly from her and not some evil imposter lily nodded ever so slightly and it was amazing how big of a reaction this caused sirius ostentatiously feigned passing out with a hand to his head and the letter clutched to his heart james now looked at her with even more admiration impressed by her daring had lily evans head girl of hogwarts really just passed a note in class james and sirius were clearly astonished as was lily come to think of it folding the letter back up just as carefully as james had sirius handed it back to its part owner james the whisked it softly back into lily hands excitedly she opened the letter and read dearest lily do not fret you have much to learn i forgive you and your slight touch in the head and calmly request that if you indeed feel the need to shout at me again that you at least warn me so i may adorn my delicate ears with my ear plugs thank you so much love james lily giggled at the sarcastic nature of james letter and looked up to find james holding up a pair of ear plugs eyeing them meaningfully laughing even harder lily nodded really what is going on with this class today first mr black now mr potter and ms evans our two heads no less professor trallick scolded in a scandalized tone dontmake me move the three of you like first years or i ll be forced to give the three of you detentions do i make myself clear both lily and james stared at her and nodded yes professor lily crimson faced with embarrassment and james smirking as if sporting this threat as a badge of honor tried not to burst out laughing they realized that they were not the only ones attempting to stifle their laughter for occasional random spurts of laughter could be heard throughout the classroom five points from gryffindor each for both ms evans and mr potter display of rude behavior an otherwise strong and impressive statement from professor trallick was punctuated with her chalk copying down every word of her reprimand in mad and rather large scrawling upon the blackboard what are you all laughing about this is not a laughing matter she continued exasperatedly as the piece of chalk continued to squeak wildly with each word as if the class were back in their first year they all continued laughing at the absurdity of the situation many were purely laughing at the chalk but many were laughing at the fact that people were laughing at the chalk they were all at least 17 for goodness sakes thankfully the bell rang and saved the class from further point deductions and stomach cramps from the continual laughter and when the class returned from their break it was obvious that their professor had figured out the reason for their amusement from the erased blackboard to her red cheeks they could all tell she had figured it out the rest of the class the fun part was spent practicing the advanced defenses one could use against occamies the plumed two legged winged creature with a serpentine body found in the far east and india according to newt scamander in his book fantastic beasts and where to find them in between observing the students whom were practicing on transfigured rats professor trallick would randomly throw incriminating looks at the blackboard trying to catch any piece of chalk that may be mimicking her behind her back this caused lily james sirius and even remus to snort with laughter throughout the class dinner that night was much better than lunch earlier that day lily hadntrealized how much she enjoyed having meals with her friends if it werentfor them she would miss her friends way too much but once they began teasing her about the defense fiasco that almost resulted in her getting a detention she changed her mind and concluded that meals were definitely enough back in the head common room lily laid on her stomach in front of the fire with her nose in her transfiguration book frantically trying to catch up on the class she missed that day only until james stuck his nose directly in her face did she realize he was there oh she exclaimed clearly startled sorry i didnthear you come in i see that james chuckled i just wanted to let you know that i sorry about this morning i deserved it and i sorry you dolt you did not deserve it lily laughed i just got bent out of shape over something that i canteven understand or explain to myself but i sorry well james thought if you insist he joked but i off to bed then i a bit tired and we ve got an intense practice tomorrow he said a bit too cheerfully for lily taste lily groaned dontremind me james fidgeted as if he had something on his mind but he wasntquite sure how to put it lily now dontget mad at me but i ve got an honest question for you and i want you to answer it truthfully lily blinked at him with concern but nodded for him to continue are you sure you re going to be alright for the match against slytherin it just that ever since you had that dream you ve been a bit jumpy lily thought for about a tenth of a second then without blinking replied i fine i can do it i promise besides who would you find on such a short notice lily gave a wide grin just dontworry about me i ll be alright now you ve got a practice to plan and shut eye to catch and i ve got homework to do so just relax and quit worrying alright she gave him the best reassuring smile she could and kissed him lightly on the cheek alright james sighed goodnight then lily he said and gave her a quick kiss then stood up goodnight james lily replied then as he headed for the stairs as she resumed her homework but not two sentences later she remembered about her mother letter and decided that her brain needed a break from her transfiguration homework anyway dear mum the ball was lots of fun thank for asking james and i went as sir and lady zanath a famous wizarding couple i wore this gorgeous emerald city green ball gown with matching ballet slippers it was lots of fun indeed we danced laughed ate played games and i knocked malfoy unconscious but it was his own fault mind you james was tons of fun and a perfect gentleman so dontworry mum to answer your question yes the christmas ball is on the night of the 23rd the hogwarts express will be taking all those who do not wish or cannot attend the dance back to king cross station that morning then the next day all those attending the dance will have lunch then depart at noon christmas eve day so max is going to mikey house for dinner that neat you know mikey is james younger brother did you know that are you going to let him go well i guess i ll see you on the 24th then i cantwait to see you and dad i miss you guys so much tell dad i love him for me and i love you too mum i ll talk to you later and see you soon love lily she then stuck the letter in her bag so she could send it with scarlett the next day then lily returned to her homework and didntgo up to bed until around 1 30am the following week was mass chaos not only were they given massive amounts of homework causing james to get double the potions homework due to his bet with lily but quidditch practice was so crazy that even sirius complained and he helped plan it but even quidditch practice seemed like nothing compared to the atmosphere between the gryffindors and slytherins everywhere anyone turned fights broke out among rival students students were given detentions points were taken away and people including some unfortunate professors who had tried to stop the fighting were being guided to the hospital wing people with boils or gashes rushed around with towels pressed to bleeding injuries broken fingers often resulted in the injured holding his or her hand like a fragile eggshell slytherins and gryffindors alike hexed jinxed and cursed right and left defending their name and their team to put it simply any place where both a gryffindor and a slytherin were present was nothing short of a war zone and ground zero was anywhere and anytime malfoy gang met the marauders despite the girls pleas the marauders fought valiantly resulting not only in detention for the whole next week but only a few patches of agitated skin among them while malfoy and his gang sported their new green and silver mohawks to match their uniforms as sirius put it the morning of the match lily woke startled to see james standing above her instantly shoving the remains of her dream from her head something to do with a bottomless lake of green water but that was ridiculous rise and shine sleepy head james chanted with a grin sleep well lily yawned i guess to what do i owe this pleasant surprise she asked as she sat up i just figured that you were getting some great shut eye so i brought you a quick breakfast james presented a plate with various fruits and some apricot marmalade on toast lily favorite suddenly aware of her morning breath lily blushed and took cover a bit deeper into her blankets seeing james perplexed look she slid from her covers i ll be right back once she had brushed her teeth and gone to the bathroom she came back and found james transfiguring a pillow into a little tray for lily to eat on also a lily in a small vase to garnish the makeshift table she slowly walked into the room and carefully sat on the bed ooo strawberries and powdered sugar lily grabbed a strawberry and greedily dipped it into the sugar after shoving most of it into her mouth she realized what she was doing even though james was her boyfriend it amazed her at how easily she could get embarrassed in front of him lily smiled sheepishly then again realized her mistake red juice coated her teeth and white sugar still remained on her lips just the sight caused james to chuckle at first he tried to stop it but soon he couldnthelp it he wiped a bit of sugar off her nose as he laughed heartily do you want some she asked after she swallowed her strawberry james only continued laughing at her gesturing for her to continue no i already ate but thanks so lily finished her breakfast a bit more politely than her first strawberry but tackling the toast with some zeal thanks for breakfast no problem now hurry and change we ve got to be at the pitch in fifteen minutes james then cleared the dishes turned the tray back into a pillow and exited the room but not before leaving the flower on lily bedside table ten minutes later lily and james trekked to the field talking about the various scenarios that could result from this game they decided that winning by about fifty points should give them a good enough lead for the next game and help them secure the cup various shouts were heard as they entered the team locker room mostly hellos and a few where have you beens each member of the team now in their scarlet and gold uniforms grabbed their brooms and gathered for a huddle alright team james began slytherin sirius said grimly the big one james added the big kahuna the great mountain alright we get it this is the game of all games to out do all games to come lily sighed we get it hey that a good one big e sirius gasped admiringly big e was lily new nickname on the team usually they all called each other by their last names but since there were two evans and two potters on the team the rest of the team namely sirius decided on big e for lily big p for james little e for max and little p for mikey all four had complained about the names especially the two potters as their names caused the most laughter controversy and outrage but sirius mind was set and the fact that the names bothered them set it more than anything anyway james cut in watching the time we ve trained hard for this match harder than we ve ever trained before sirius interjected yes so you all know how important this game is james continued so let go out there and kick some slytherin arse the overexcited big p jumped in the air with a whoop but he was the only one he looked around at them all as if it had been a personal insult that they hadntjoined him but everyone else aside from sirius who just eyed his best mate as if he were contaminated with spattergroit was too nervous to join in the excitement aw come off it we ll be fine james attempted to assure them just play like you all do in practice and we ll be fine realizing that this approach wasntworking james clenched his teeth narrowed his eyes and spoke with a normal but intensified voice are we gonna let those dirty evil death eater momma boys steal our cup from us ending in a full blown yell this seemed to wake up the sleepy and scared team for they all smiled and yelled no or in sirius mikey and max cases hell no max lily whispered disapprovingly what he shrugged and turned his attention back to james this team is winning the cup even if it the last thing we do i swear by that he finished as the team agreed and swore by it too especially mikey who added we ll either win it or die trying so let get out there and skin those green haired wankers to the bone sirius cried earning an evil glare from lily each teammate mounted his or her broom and flew into the stadium as the announcer called out each name after circling the stands a couple of times sirius and james in the lead blowing kisses to the cheering crowd the team began heading to their places only the slytherins jeered as the gryffindors appeared both teams took their places each leering at his or her counter part madame meyer blew her whistle for the captains to shake hands lily watched as james shook malfoy hand and sirius shook lestrange s it was hard to tell who was more upset about this gesture but soon madame meyer blew her whistle again signaling for everyone to be ready lily took her place next to frank with max on his other side watching the quaffle in madame meyer hands rather than the sneering nott across from her madame meyer whistle blew as she threw the quaffle into the air instantly frank hands stretched and closed around it as he shot higher into the air lily zig zagged beneath frank as max went in front of him to help block a bludger came towards frank but he ducked out of the way just in time however the quaffle slipped from his fingers for this very reason lily was placed under frank and she snatched up the quaffle right from malfoy hands lily dove hard with max and frank just behind her she saw the hoops ahead and scaled back up another bludger came her way but mikey batted it out of the way lily saw max open and launched the quaffle to him max beelined for the right hoop causing keeper avery to instinctively cover it blocking any chance for a shot but at the last minute max threw it through the center hoop scoring ten points for gryffindor resulting in a joyous uproar from three fourths of the crowd malfoy now snatched up the quaffle and hightailed it to the other end of the field with nott and rookwood close behind sirius batted a bludger at malfoy but crabbe was a bit faster than he looked and hit it back at sirius who hit it at rookwood right as he was about to catch the quaffle but it hit his shoulder and lurched him off course leaving max open to catch the quaffle max darted back towards the three hoops dodging bludgers and players alike he passed to frank who passed to lily who pulled a quick one on avery and scored another ten points for gryffindor this got malfoy so upset that his face bloomed red reminding james and sirius so strongly of christmas now that it matched his hair that they started singing god rest ye merry hippogriffs at the tops of their lungs in the mean time malfoy flew over to avery and swore a number at him only making james and sirius laugh harder and sing louder smack sirius who hadntbeen paying attention to anything but malfoy decorations was hit in the face with a bludger from goyle thankfully goyle aim wasnttoo great sirius only got a bloody lip and a fierce attitude from it he raced after the bludger as fast as he could sirius then rounded on it and whacked it with all his might back in the direction it had come from goyle stared stupidly at it as it came towards him but got out of the way just in time however by watching out for his own neck instead of the team s he botched another attempt to score the bludger intended as payback for goyle flew right into nott broom almost throwing the rider off the quaffle soared from his hands and into lily s lily raced to the hoops with the quaffle tucked under her arm she saw max wide open and tossed it to him but only a split second too late so saw the bludger heading for her brother just as it approached his arm mikey came out of nowhere and redirected it towards avery a true shot the bludger hit its target with massive force knocking avery from his broom and leaving max to score but two seconds later max was on the ground beside avery and the crowd was booing in protest crabbe had hit a bludger at the back of max head right after he had scored the whistle blew penalty shot to gryffindor madame meyer yelled over the outraged crowd frank took the shot and scored easily avery was still a bit shaky from his fall back in the game max wiped some blood with the sleeve of his robes away from his nose and flew more determined than ever forty to zero they were so close but nott passed the quaffle to malfoy who dodged a bludger and scored despite asher courageous effort lily took the quaffle and surveyed the pitch her best bet was a hard right close to the stands so she went for it but with malfoy to her left and rookwood to her right she was quickly sandwiched between the two brutes she threw the quaffle to frank who was just below her but as soon as it left her hands she realized the trap nott came from just behind her and stole the quaffle in mid throw this time asher efforts paid off and he caught the quaffle in a spectacular one handed save causing another roar of cheering from the gryffindors and their supporters gryffindor had the quaffle and scored but then slytherin scored gryffindor got it again but missed due to malfoy near tackle of frank fifty to twenty slytherin tried but failed to score another ten points leaving gryffindor to grab the quaffle and score making it sixty to twenty another outstanding save by asher and another great pass between siblings soon made the score seventy to twenty time to start playing hard defense and looking for the snitch sirius and mikey followed each bludger like hunting dogs hot on the trail of the fox james circled like a hawk eyes open and probing but another roar from the slytherin crowd told him they had scored again if only they had prevented that goal a second longer for james just caught sight of the snitch but had to let it go they were only up forty points now seventy to thirty but finally two goals later one gryffindor and one slytherin james spotted the glint of the snitch again he didnthesitate for he wasntsure when he would see the small gold ball again and a forty point lead wasntthat bad putting on full speed james dove towards malfoy right ankle and lestrange streaked after him with a small lead james followed the snitch past malfoy and towards the gryffindor hoops now neck and neck lestrange and potter zoomed past the crowd and just as james heard the taunts of the slytherin crowd lestrange push shoved james the slightest bit forward instead of away allowing james fingers to close around the tiny golden snitch the pitch erupted with cheers and james narrowly missed a few hufflepuff heads as he struggled to pull out of his path and fly back to the ground to his team sorry i didntwait one more goal but i didntknow when i would see the snitch again james huffed as he landed behind his celebrating team sorry lily asked incredulously while you were flying around malfoy max pinched the quaffle right out of his hands he was too busy watching you so by the time he realized what was going on we had already scored she exclaimed potter shouted an infuriated voice james turned to face the still neon green haired malfoy had to save your mudblood bitch arse we were just about to take her from behind but unfortunately you stopped us why you son of a james began james lily cut him off just let it go he not worth it what too scared your big bad boy friend canttake me mudblood malfoy sneered look guys the mudblood has to save her cowardly boyfriend arse he laughed at his own joke as the slytherin team joined in why you pompous arrogant toerag lily shouted rounding on malfoy you think that just because your little cronies worship the ground you walk on that everyone should bow down to you you re nothing more than a cowardly bullying bloody arse james had to do a double take at his girlfriend lily evans head girl lily evans swearing what was the world coming to first passing notes in class and now swearing what you dontthink everyone should bow down to me well you re right there are few who rise above but he whipped out his wand surely a mudblood like yourself should i think you need a lesson in manners petrificus sublas malfoy yelled lily felt her knees give out and collapse beneath her she was kneeling on the ground in front of a laughing malfoy he turned his back on her and lily felt the jinx lift but what was she going to do she didntplay quidditch with her wand it was too much of a risk and a hassle so she seized the next best solution shooting to her feet lily balled her fist brought her arm back and just as malfoy turned to face her she swung her fist out with all her might but just before her knuckles connected with malfoy nose she felt a jerk behind her navel and her feet leave the ground for a moment she thought she had touched a portkey but she swiveled her head to see that james had grabbed her let me go i ll take the mickey right out of him i ll knock him senseless lily kicked and shouted wildly but james would not loosen his grip she continued to struggle until she saw a smaller familiar figure jump onto malfoy back which was again facing them as he was now laughing even harder with his friends max who had been listening to the conversation vaulted onto malfoy back and grabbed him around his neck while his other hand sought to punch any part of malfoy face it could find seconds later crabbe and goyle were wrestling max off malfoy but mikey only stepped in to take his place and being a bit bigger than max he was doing quite a bit more damage by this time both teams were fully aware of what was going on and of course everyone wanted a part in it first i would like to say that this chapter is dedicated to all those affected by the king cross station bombing while rewriting the chapter i realized that the station was mentioned in this chapter so england this one for you that was

also happy you liked the hair thank you for your excellent point about cliff hangers i wish more people saw it that way because i ve got some reviewers that hate cliff hangers and others that love them and dontget me wrong i luv them all and there nothing wrong with that it just that it is unrealistic to fill the whole thing with cliffys just as it is unrealiztic to omit them entirely i just want everyone to be happy yay i glad you liked the defense class haha thanks i know i the author and all but i like to see what others think and see it i can incorporate what they like and hate and make it into a story that i enjoy i mean i dontdo everything reviews say but i definitely consider it good point about the magic i mean they are at a magic school for crying out loud i hope this next chapter changes your opinion let me know if it enough lol thanks for the suggestions and opinions though lol thanks for the lack of typos comment haha i know what you mean about it detracting from the story and it does kind of break the mood it would be almost impossible get rid of all of them and still keep writing and posting on time so i sorry for any that slip though but i glad you appreciate my attempts to get rid of them and i glad you like the questions at the end of the chapter hope you like d the sixth book i loved it thank you so much for your review and i hope to hear from you again riotgirl72 thank you so much sorry again about the mix up i certainly will keep sending you the updates and thanks again for reviewing my story hope to hear from you again spygirl4747 yay that was my favorite part lol thank so much for the review hope to hear more from you vickiicky i sorry it wasntas funny as you hoped i ll certainly try harder on that aspect just for you i hope this chapter helps lol sorry i didntword the infor question well enough the way that i justify james being hurt by lily is that he was shocked by her snap and that just attributed to the hurt in his mind he was just trying to help so when she snapped it was like she was saying that she didntneed his help it hurt him to hear that since all he wants to do is be with her and help her well i meant the time he was in the story was he sirius enough sorry i didntword it better and sorry he wasntin the story enough yay glad you liked the quidditch i was hoping it would be realistic enough and about the hair i was just more or less talking about the fact that his hair was turned green i glad you re proud of lily haha good point about the cliff hangers most of the time those that do like the cliffys have the whole love hate relationship haha good point about the punishment no one else mentioned that hope you like the first part of the chapter hint hint yay glad you liked the increased gryffindor slytherin thing i believe it was you who mentioned that as well haha glad you liked the fight it was my favorite part too you ll certainly hear more about it in this chapter as a result lol sorry to make you think i guess you re kind of like sirius in that respect it quite dangerous for everyone in a 30 mile radius when he thinks he just a ticking time bomb awww i so glad you like max and lily being on the team together one of my sisters wonteven read my story because lily on the team witch lol anyways it doesntsay anywhere that she not on the team and plus i think that she was very smart and that with the pushing from james it plausible dontyou think but i do want your advice i luv your opinions they re honest and that what i want to hear lol i reread the books just before the 6th one too i luv harry potter but i dontdoubt that you know more lol lol hope you got the book and read it how did you do on the trivia lol sorry again about the mix up i just did it by sight which i now know was a mistake sorry your formal apology is coming up thank you so much for the review and for reviewing even when i wronged you hope to hear more from you to all first off i would like to formally apologize to vickiicky she had the longest review of chapter 19 i had judged by eye and because she had one of her famous vertical messages in it my mind was to say the least tricked so vickiicky i very sorry for my mistake and i hope you will accept my apology and maybe one day forgive me now next i would like to wish ms lunerflower a happy belated birthday it was her birthday on july 16th talk about a killer birthday present the longest review of this chapter and yes this time i used word count on microsoft word belongs to queen of duct tape sorry to you for the mix up as well but the title is rightfully yours this time great job and i dare everyone else to outdo her but of course i appreciate every and any review i get even if it one word i would be lost without you all and welcome to our new reviewer 2005girl thank you so much for joining us all and finally without further ado chapter 21 i hope you enjoy it let me know chapter 21 colorful punishments absolutely disgraceful completely unacceptable fighting between students over a game no less shrieked professor mcgonagall her snow white nostrils flared with each accented syllable and her lips tensed in the straightest line james had ever seen when they werentstretched in a yell what exactly were you all thinking when you decided that it was acceptable to fight i was thinking about how ugly malfoy was and how he may look better if i reformed his face a bit with my fist sirius whispered to mikey who tried hard to stifle a laugh by shoving a cut fist into his mouth be sure mr black that what you have done will not go unpunished this example that you have all set is positively repulsive and intolerable she declared in a dangerously low voice i dontcare what anyone of you said and no mr avery she said to him as he began to open his mouth in protest i do not care who attacked who first i know that for some reason you all dontget along but you donthave to act on it physically really you d think that 7th years would be at least a little bit mature she admonished psst did you really give malfoy a blood nose james whispered to max while professor mcgonagall back was turned ye mr potter she barked as she turned so fast that james head began spinning again this is not something to be proud of so if you could please take this seriously she reprimanded you are head boy at this school dontyou have any respect for that honor if you do at all you certainly are not showing it by fighting and corrupting younger students like mr evans she stopped and took a huge breath as if she were praying for patience because of your immature behavior and lack of self control professor slughorn and i have decided that both teams will not be serving detentions lily and several others sighed a breath of relief at this but will be suspended from any quidditch practice until december both the slytherins and gryffindors broke out in protest angrily shouting about how ridiculous this was and how unfair it seemed complain all you like but the punishment is staying as is professor mcgonagall stated crossly now i suggest that you all either head off to the hospital wing to get cleaned up or go to lunch you re all dismissed she concluded with a wave of her hand with looks of extreme anger the students all left grudgingly starring daggers not at mcgonagall but at each other outside they all split up gryffindors and slytherins but none of the gryffindors took their head of house advice instead every gryffindor including head boy and girl sprinted to the gryffindor common room where they knew their entire house would be waiting because of the fight the victory party was starting early and would no doubt be going as late if not later than any normal celebration high five max my boy james yelled once out of earshot way to sock it to him right back at you mate max grinned through a cut cheek did you see how great your right hook got him i doubt if madame pomfrey can even fix his eye hey and what about mikey elbow to lestrange jaw asked an impressed and bloodied lip sirius by the look of it i d say it was at least dislocated and that arm lock you had him in so mikey could get him frank grinned widely he never stood a chance and i ll bet his fall from being knocked unconscious gave him a great lump on his head did you see the way asher took on nott and rookwood inquired an awestruck mikey i didntknow someone could twist two different shoulders so far i didnteven know shoulders could twist that far until i tried responded a baffled asher now sporting a purpling eye and torn robes but frank nice work on crabbe i sure he got some broken ribs then the good ole tackle of goyle and avery james asked raising a split and bloodied eyebrow sirius mate avery will be spitting out dirt and grass for a week guaranteed and goyle will probably have to get plastic surgery for his nose and a toupee for his lost hair thanks to max and mikey double team yah but you know it may have helped goyle more than hurt him sirius said thoughtfully how that frank asked laughing well i think after they beat him up there were more girls looking at him then than there were before and i dontthink it was because he was bleeding sirius scoffed the group shared a hearty laugh yah but it sure didntcome without a price mikey grimaced rubbing his neck yah tell me about it max agreed massaging his knuckles that guy has one hard face he laughed causing the whole team to join it well the whole team minus lily who had been silent so far pumpkin pasty sirius announced to the fat lady the portrait swung back as loud cheers and even singing reached the teams ears butterbeers were shoved into the heros hands as they were guided to the best chairs and couches by the fire food was passed to them as they were all hounded with questions about the fight and what it felt like to finally beat up a slytherin even lily let loose for a bit and told her highlight of kicking the parts that classified malfoy as a male the party continued well into the night only disrupted by dinner where the house only continued its celebration more loudly and wildly than ever the students with muggle ties began singing we are the champions and soon the whole gryffindor table was singing it with as much zeal as they could muster the party only ceased when professor mcgonagall came in for the third time and threatened them all with detentions and extra homework so around three in the morning lily and james said their final goodbyes and trudged back to their dormitory what a day huh james sighed a grin still plastered on his face yah lily replied halfheartedly i suppose james gave lily a sideways glance are you alright fine fine lily paused then after walking another length of hall in silence she spoke again this time with uncertainty shining in each word i just dontknow if i can do this james we re just so different she unraveled through eyes slowly filling with tears and a voice cracking with emotion they continued walking but james gaze swiveled to lily with misunderstanding written all over lily i dontunderstand maybe i just overreacting but that fight today was scary and i just lily took a deep breath if a bunch of seventeen year olds can cause this much damage what is it going to be like when voldemort attacks she fought hard to keep from crying not wanting james to see her weak oh lily you can t sweet tarts he said to the picture you cantlet that worry you today was because people insulted you and others personally we ve pretty much just stood there for the past six years and taken their verbal abuse supposedly too mature to retaliate voldemort is a whole different playing field to compare the two is like comparing us to muggles it just different is it because i see two groups both the enemy of the other both hurting each other well the hurting leads to fighting and do you know what the fighting leads to killing dying murdering each other are we really that different the good people and the bad she asked as her tears fought to break free with her emotion ok it not that different he said turning to face her and stopping her in the middle of the common room just halfway to the stairs but standing by and watching evil take over good and trample over innocent people is just as bad if not worse than fighting lily his tone softened and he paused i mean why are you training to become an auror he gently placed his hands on her shoulders i know i just i just dontwant to see anyone get hurt or worse what if something happened to max or mikey or lydia lara sirius remus or peter i dontthink i could ever forgive myself if any of them got hurt because of me i scared to find out what will happen if i go and fight and i scared to find out what would happen if i didntfight lily collapsed into james shoulder with a sob he slowly rubbed her back trying to comfort her i know lily but you know what i scared too we all are it not going to be a walk in the park with this voldemort guy but we have to try if we ever want to live our own lives in freedom that what you want right for us and everyone else lily nodded in response it ok to be scared i dontthink there one person who not but we have to work through this together all of us i have a feeling that teamwork is going to be pretty important in the coming years but that the only way we ll stand a chance lily lifted her head to look at him his now deep purple eye and cheek split lip and cut forehead didntexactly help matters but it did increase her wonderment how in the face of so much danger could he still be strong enough to deal with her stupid moments like these and comfort her i sorry james i so sorry she sniffled as she buried her face in his shoulder again dontbe sorry i understand how you feel he whispered it ok we just need to stick together james held her for a bit longer then guided her up the stairs and into her bed he tucked her in kissed her goodnight and then set off for his own bed and once he was changed and lying down lily words played i his head are we really that different well of course we are they re killing to gain power and for the sick fun of it we have to do it out of necessity i scared i know i scared too lily i am too the next day all the gryffindor quidditch players saw madame pomfrey at one point or another to get their various cuts and bruises fixed though no one was seriously injured madame pomfrey still scowled at them and reprimanded them for not showing up the day before but the harassment they received from the school healer was nothing compared to the looks they were shot from the slytherins though no fighting broke out like it had the day of the match and the week leading up to it the stares were quite lethal on tuesday after a particularly intense double charms lesson james stress level increased even further mr potter may i see you for a moment squeaked tiny professor flitwick right after the bell had rung james waved lily and the others to go without him and approached his charms professor desk with an iceberg of dread settling in his stomach yes professor mr potter i canthelp noticing that for the past two weeks you ve still been having some problems with your nonverbal shielding and deflecting charms now normally i would let you figure it out on your own but with your being head boy and n e w t coming up i would strongly advise you to find someone who could help you mr mcmillian from ravenclaw is quite good at them and yes of course so is ms evans but please for your sake work on them because they are almost guaranteed to come up in your n e w t and are certainly required to become an auror thank you professor i will do my best james concluded well good luck then mr potter professor flitwick smiled then turned to the tables and began cleaning up james exited the room feeling even worse than he had when he had been told quidditch would be banned until december and the only way he got through that was by gloating the fact that gryffindor didnthave another match until after the christmas holidays while slytherins had to play hufflepuff only two days after they were allowed to begin practicing again talk about provoked snakes but now after he had been strong and there for lily he would have to ask her for help with his schoolwork they had already done shielding and deflecting charms in fourth year but he had already had trouble so when they went to nonverbal he knew he d be bad at them right from the start he knew he shouldntbe embarrassed to ask her but he still wanted to impress her he tried to think of ways to get around asking her but he decided that he d rather ask lily and get it over with than ask bert mcmillian and get it shoved in his face that he cantdo shielding and deflecting charms his hand went back to his hair and tousled it a habit he was trying to break if lily could stand that she could stand him asking her for help he resigned without looking james rounded a corner and ran straight into lily ouch she landed hard on the floor sorry lils james helped her up i wasntwatching he apologized as he gave lily both his hands and helped her up since he hadntfallen it ok i alright she smiled as she rose i just came to see if you were coming to dinner or not what are you doing down here anyways james looked around the dungeons how long had he been walking around the school and how had he gotten down here i was just walking and i dontknow i ended up here i guess he rambled truthfully then another thought occurred to him how did you find me lily blushed with a little help from messers moony wormtail padfoot and prongs she confessed as she took out the enchanted piece of parchment mischief managed she said with a tap of her wand how did you potter evans barked a haunting voice echoing across the dungeons what are the two of you doing down here filch asked accusatorily and what is that he pointed a gnarled finger at the now empty parchment in lily hand nothing she said quickly as she stuffed it in her robes we just we were just walking is that a crime now filch looked momentarily taken aback at lily snappy words but his young face recovered quickly it is if you re up to no good let me see that parchment he snarled lily face reddened but james covered for her it a personal letter from her mum surely you cantconfiscate a personal letter from home he challenged it was filch turn to blush come on mrs norris we ll get our chance someday we ll get our chance he vowed quietly then he turned and left the dungeons that was a close one lily let out the huge breath she had been holding since she saw filch yah it was james replied his face unreadable come on let go to dinner both students went to dinner laughing at what had just transpired dinner was also filled with laughter as sirius kept making his carrots tap dance across to james plate who kept swearing that he had already eaten his carrots when in fact he hadnteven taken any at all likewise while sirius concentrated on moving his carrots to james plate lydia levitated her entire helping of steak kidney and onion pie which she found out she didntlike at all over to sirius plate whom didntexactly enjoy the taste either the scene was a riot that was until malfoy and his goons stopped by aww how cute malfoy drawled why dontyou two just coat yourselves in our mashed potatoes already he said as he flicked his wand at the bowl of potatoes and levitating them half a meter off the table and get it over with sirius magically forced the bowl back down to the table as if he were arm wrestling malfoy you d love to see that wouldntyou malfoy sirius goaded look you could even do it with snivellus good one sirius peter praised and you say i pathetic malfoy mumbled yah well at least peter has friends lily shot ooo that hurt evans malfoy mocked injury but i suppose that these friends did you call them are a bit better than your normal crowd of flobberworms and rats why you lily began no no lily james grabbed her arm and brought her back to a seated position causing malfoy to grin wickedly you see malfoy here is just jealous that there are actually people more attuned to talking than the voldemort worshipping scum he is surrounded with here and at his own house james replied smartly as the grin was wiped off malfoy face even his evil parents ignore him and it probably no wonder since he goes around muttering things to his imaginary friends they probably think that one of their practice curses permanently touched their little guinea pig in the head poor boy you malfoy snarled as he raised his wand at james mr malfoy may i remind you that magic is not permitted in the great hall or any other hall in this school professor mcgonagall scolded and malfoy quickly stashed his wand in his robes or perhaps you would like another two weeks of no quidditch practice i didntthink so now she said to the group of slytherins if you would kindly return to your seats and finish your dinner sinking their teeth right into this treat of slytherins in trouble james and sirius mocked teachers scolding them behind mcgonagall back they wildly gestured wagging fingers and mouthed each word their professor uttered keeping faces just as stern as hers eyebrows were knitted and furrowed as nostrils flared and went white the sight was quite comical as the slytherins faces purpled with rage but they could do nothing suspicious professor mcgonagall turned quickly around and saw the gryffindors enjoying their meals and talking amongst themselves perfectly normal satisfied she walked back to the staff table sat down and continued her meal while back at the gryffindor table the group laughed uncontrollably after dinner the group split up as usual once again to a chorus of their now famous song other students didntstare disgustedly anymore instead they slowly joined in until the whole school knew it and could sing it in a round during dinner first the ravenclaws then the hufflepuffs and finally the gryffindors since they knew it the best with a marauder minus peter because he was so shy at the head of each table guiding the students along in their musical display they even got dumbledore to conduct them he tried to get the slytherins and the other teachers to join but he was only able to convince professor trallick who ended up knocking over several goblets and candles with her wild gestures and dancing so james and lily danced their way back to their common room laughing and singing you know you re really great at this whole dancing thing james puffed as lily leapt into the portrait hole and an exhausted james followed well i hope so i did dance for about eight years straight lily gracefully lowered herself to the couch only slightly out of breath as james plopped down beside her breathing as hard as an angry fire breathing dragon it nice to know that money didnt completely go to waste she grinned what do you mean asked a confused james what do you mean what do i mean lily laughed well obviously coming to hogwarts halts any dancing dream i had the market isntreally looking for ballet dancing witches what are you talking about you re really a great dancer you were just doing those little those little things with your feet james lifted his feet off the ground and tried to move them as fast as he could but he only succeeded in looking as if someone had cast the tap dancing jinx on him lily laughed you mean entrechat quatres eh those arenttoo difficult it the entrechat trios you have to watch out for she concluded seriously but seeing the look of bewilderment on james face made her giggle once again but if it what you really want to do he trailed off hopefully i guess i ve come to realize that there are much more important things than dancing in the back row of a famous company lily said as she gave james a meaningful look then she turned her gaze to the fire anyone with enough training can do that but being able to do magic that something that not everyone can do i figure if i ve been given this talent then i had better use it she continued thoughtfully as if she had thought this through before but was saying it aloud for the first time saving people from that dodgy stupid voldemort character is so much more important than chasing the ever moving dream of doing fouett s and grand jet s on a stage her glance glided back to james well i guess if you put it that way he said softly once he was sure lily had enough time to finish whatever thought was in her head he gently changed the subject for he knew this conversation was very important and slightly painful for lily speaking of saving people maybe you can help save me and my charms grade he grinned his million galleon smile at her for the millionth time that night she had to laugh at him alright what is it well it s well i guess lack of my ability to perform a satisfactory nonverbal shielding and deflecting charm we kind of reviewed today is there any way you could help he asked with his big hazel puppy dog eyes of course she smiled which one do you need help with lily inquired umm james looked down and almost blushed a deeper shade of red than the couches any of them would be helpful he responded quietly alright well lily stood up and took out her wand let start with protego then shall we well stand up she smiled i ll go easy on you i promise tentatively james rose to his feet ok first let go over the wand movements lily began about two minutes later james had mastered the wand movements and another minute later he had mastered the nonverbal wording and was ready to put them together ok now i going to shoot a jinx at you and you try to shield it lily and james took their stances at opposite sides of the common room ready let go james replied now confident that he could do a shielding spell properly and effectively alright on three lily instructed one two three lily cast her best jelly legs hex at james certain he would shield it protego james yelled in his head he grinned as lily spell met his shield and went right through it suddenly james legs couldntsupport him and he fell to the floor with a loud thud james lily ran to him are you alright she gasped the hexed james pushed himself up to his elbows wand still in hand yup i ok what happened why didntit work he asked frustrated i think you moved your arm left instead of right she replied thinking hard she closed her jade eyes and visualized james attempt in her head no she retracted as she opened her eyes you moved it left then right instead of right then left she stood up well let try again come on get up i can t james replied simply lily gave him a confused look the jinx oh lily smiled sheepishly of course she then completed the counter curse and helped a shaky james to his feet if it not too much to ask could you do a curse that wontcause me too much or preferably any pain he asked laughing lily answered sure anything for you james dear she teased ok on three she repeated as both students took their stances once again one two three lily shot a color changing curse quite similar to the one james and sirius used on the slytherins it was one she could easily counter if he got hit and didntcause any pain so she aimed it right at his head protego he screamed once again in his head a bright blue stream of light came at james and met his shield then to james relief the light melted away into his shield yes james jumped in victory great job lily smiled now let try a deflecting charm for the next two minutes or so lily explained the hex deflecting charm they had learned in their fourth year defense class which james seemed to pick up rather quickly soon he felt very positive he would succeed and begged lily to let him try alright let try it please james begged clearly excited about the prospect ok lily gave in on three yah yah i know james waved her ahead go on go on alright lily sighed one two three lily shot the same color changing hex at james head james head burst with the incantation for the deflecting charm but as lily verbal curse came at him james who had been slightly preoccupied with acting overly confident cast his charm the slightest bit too late he caught it in mid connection flailing his arm a bit wildly in surprise as half the spell hit james knocking him over and the other half was deflected lily caught off guard was hit with the other half of the spell and likewise knocked off her feet head aching james sat up rubbing the back of his head the slight that met james eyes almost caused him to burst out laughing but the look on lily face stifled his laughter before it even came out lily was already standing up ready to continue apparently unaware of her vivid blue hair it took every shred of control james had in his body to keep a straight face well let try again lily smiled broadly showing almost every pearly white tooth i ll fix your hair after we re done james then realized that his hair must have been just as blue as lily s on three and pay attention this time her grin spread even wider one two three she shot the verbal color changing spell at james again this time with a nice hot pink color james bellowed the deflection charm in his mind but his attempt failed again as lily spell got all the way through his poor effort and hit him square in the mouth now james had a matching set of hot pink teeth to match his hot blue hair lily almost went wild with giggles and struggled to contain herself ok she gasped through her mirth on three she took a deep breath as james fixed her with an icy glare after one more outburst of laughter which she apologized for lily was ready one two three she changed the color to orange this time and flung the hex at james again james mind erupted with his hollered deflecting charm but his lack of conviction as he was now getting slightly discouraged resulted in the spell turning his eyebrows and eyelashes a ripe hot orange i give up james said hopelessly i guess i ll just fail nonverbal deflecting charms but i just dontget why i cantdo it i dontreally have trouble with much else james sank into a puffy chair dejectedly it alright i sure with a little more practice you ll do just fine lily consoled walking over to his place of rest here she sat on the arm of his chair and turned to him but before she could perform any counter curses james pulled her from the arm onto his lap and kissed her they pulled apart and lily giggled what james asked clueless you just look so beautiful with blue hair orange eyebrows and pink teeth she giggled even more with what he demanded incredulously then he recovered and retorted aww gee thanks lilykins in an overly sweet and high pitched voice now change it back he said his voice and attitude changing to an exaggerated direct gruffness giggling still lily performed the counter curse first on his teeth which changed back to their normal shining white then his eyebrows and lashes returning them to their deep black color and finally she did the counter curse on his electric blue hair but unlike everything else it didntchange sure she had made a mistake she tried again still no change she started to panic and attempted to change his hair back yet again james now realized the look of confusion and fright on lily face what wrong he asked with the air of what else could possible go wrong umm lily stammered well you see i cantseem to fix she almost let out a snigger to fix your hair what he exclaimed in disbelief he ran to the nearest window and checked his reflection oh no he groaned try again there got to be something you re doing wrong or something he stated frantically lily tried about another dozen times with much complaining and pushing from james before she gave up sorry i did everything right it just wontwork she slumped into the couch disheartened i bet it had something to do with your not paying attention and then flailing like a madman she reported thoughtfully while james threw her an indignant look convinced she meant it maliciously but then she smirked at the hilarity of the situation i guess you ll just have to she began laughing hysterically keep your new look hey potter that right laugh all you want then james smirked too you just watch i bet it will become the new fad at hogwarts and what gives you that thick idea she challenged raucous laughter still escaping her lips well i mean with both of us walking around with blue hair who knows he shrugged while smirking with utter satisfaction on the inside lily laughter ceased immediately what do you mean both of us you re the one with the blue hair and as much as i love you james potter i have no intention of joining you and she tittered a small laugh of waving the subject off whatever you say he shrugged the grin now seeping out onto his face but if you ask me i think it a bit late for you to pull out now he stated cryptically her eyes squinted with suspicion what exactly do you mean she asked slowly as if afraid of the answer james just shrugged if you ask me your hair looks absolutely stunning but donttake my word for it go look for yourself for a second lily sat perplexed and blinking blankly but then her eyes widened in understanding and she raced up the stairs so fast it was hard for james to believe she hadntflown he heard a door bang open then a loud shriek of horror grinning james made his way up the stairs silently laughing but happy that he wouldntbe the only one walking around with hair the color of professor trallick favorite robes well how do you like as always let me know there are so many of you out there with me on your favorites or your alerts and you do not review

gryffindor team conversation about the fight did it explain it enough lily behavior did you understand why she was how she was do you understand why lily is scared did you enjoy the return of the great green globs song was the color changing too typical was it too repeated between lily and james and the malfoy incident how was the ending what was the funniest part what was your favorite part

beginning how dare you say you didntlike it lol too severe i see i was definitely thinking about having them all have detentions but as i played with the idea more and more i decided that the bad was more severe from mcgonagall pov because the people being punished were so involved in quidditch so it would natually be more of a punishment for them but they re not even banned for a full month so i dontknow that it too severe but i completely respect and honor your opinion i glad that you can tell me honestly that the best but that just where i was coming from haha boys will be boys will they ever glad you understood lily i was hoping the readers would because i didntwant them thinking that she was back to her old self of too extreme the green globs song i believe was in the haloween ball

that you asked lol i blushing over here but i not sure about a sequel but i currently have the map and first chapter of a sort of prequel it going to be during the summer after the gang fifth year same characters and stuff but it will be more attempted humorous not so much drama but i wontsay anymore because i still debating on writing it and posting and all that would you read it let me know because i kind of interested to see if people would read it or not but i know what you mean about not liking some parts of the 6th book i the same way i think that it was almost too fast and that she could have put a lot more in with more detail but it was still awesome i glad you liked the color changing thing i was hoping that people would and i esthatic that you liked the ending for once i

stories as well glad you like the questions i happy you thought the mcgonagall part was good some people thought it was too severe some too nice but it nice to know that most people thought it was good the whole umbridge with harry fred and george kind of influenced my decision because i was debating between the ban and detentions but i decided that mcgonagall would want the message being sent so what better than banning delinquent students from the thing they love the most to get the message through haha right on about the male gender yes i glad you also got the lily thing i didntwant people think that she was too extreme or too much a fraidy cat you know the green globs song was originally in chapter 19 a simple thing the lyrics are there and it mentioned in chapter 21 haha yay

some new faces and a welcome back to reviewers barbwirekisses and singdownthemoon glad to have you back well i hope you all enjoy this next chapter let me know see you at the bottom chapter 22 past and future presents the next week riotous laughter followed james and lily everywhere they went except for their dorm where they were alone and couldnthelp but laugh at each other sirius acted as though it was his birthday every time he saw either of the two and christmas every time he saw them together he and remus howled with mirth at the mere sight of the couple causing james to attempt to pummel them but it was two against one and although james got a few good jinxes in he was bound by ropes gagged and forced to endure his robes being turned various colors by sirius and remus while peter watched and laughed all in all the day their hair finally managed to change itself back was one of the best days of lily and james lives true it wasntnecessarily an oddly happy day it was just an overwhelmingly relieving day the other marauders and l adies however were not relieved on the contrary they were rather disappointed and continued trying to hex the couple hair back to its lovely shade of electric sapphire but after being threatened by professor slughorn in their potions class they were forced to stop for the time being anyway needless to say james and lily both improved tremendously in their ability to block feeble hexes the rest of november rolled by with fierce winds and to james horror snow so that on their first day of being able to practice again the grounds were under a foot of the soft white flakes with the same blizzard still howling overhead but how are we going to practice in that asked a horrified asher at breakfast that morning for he had just found out that james was not calling off the practice for that afternoon i think our captain has been hit one too many times with a bludger he muttered i cantseem to understand it either replied frank it just doesntseem plausible we wontbe able to see or feel our limbs or catch any sort of ball at all he added with the most incredulous look he could muster the pair was talking as loud as they could in the hopes that james who was only a few seats down would hear them and realize that not only was quidditch practice in these conditions horribly cruel but it was suicide lily james said a bit annoyed i ve already told you dontworry about practice we will figure it out even if the whole team has to tie itself together we will practice he stated stressing every word and you two down there he called to asher and frank you can stop wasting your voices on trying to convince me not to have practice i know what i doing so save it he added sternly so that afternoon after their horribly intense lessons where their professors seemed determined to start cramming as much information into their students brains as they would hold the gryffindor quidditch team rendezvoused in the gryffindor common room to hopefully dissuade their resolute captain from his plans to kill them all james you canthonestly think we re going to follow you outside do you challenged his brother mikey who ever said i was going outside james replied with a smirk he glanced around the circle of his teammates and saw each mouth hanging open in shock you canthave honestly thought that i would have made you all go outside he said in a disappointed tone well we just thought mumbled lily rather sheepishly and there your problem james beamed you thought this received him a nice punch in the arm from lily as well as a more relaxed and comfy mood from his team he guided them into a corner of the common room conjured a whiteboard and some markers and began charming them across the board surface each member of the team pulled up a chair or a pillow and watched intently feeling that they owed their captains at least that much for not making them go outside three hours three new plays and many mock incidents later the team dispersed and headed for dinner for the next few weeks nothing incredibly exciting happened slytherin won against ravenclaw though only by a margin of 30 points and remus and lara had their first fight lara wanted to stay up late in the common room the night of their two month anniversary a small request that would have normally been natural remus would have gladly stayed if that hadntbeen the night that his furry little problem as james called it would emerge in the end remus didnttell lara why he couldn t lily felt sorry for lara and remus and was stuck in the middle though lara didntknow what lily knew she still begged her to work on remus so that he d tell her but lily refused she knew it was wrong to put remus in that situation and she couldntlie to lara but with much comforting and reasoning from lily and james the couple decided to agree on letting the subject go and accepting each other and soon the last day of classes was at hand the students would all have one last hogsmeade weekend and then the hogwarts express would leave with all the students not attending the christmas ball their last potions lesson was unusually enjoyable as their assignment was to see who could make the best revival potion a potion to wake any sleeping or injured person naturally lily was awarded 20 points for gryffindor for her perfect concoction and tested it on the snoring james beside her professor slughorn suggested it as james was sleeping during his lesson but no hard feelings were kept for james bolted up and skipped around the room singing i a little teapot before he realized what was going on professor slughorn explained that the potion is more commonly used for persons in injury induced slumbers and should only be used on those sleeping persons who could not be awoken by a gong exploding two inches from their ears needless to say james was a light sleeper hogsmeade sprung out of nowhere and surprised all the students most were preoccupied with getting their seemingly endless piles of homework completed before the winter holidays so they wouldnthave to worry about it but almost every student sighed in relief and abandoned his or her studies for the last hogsmeade weekend of the year so gang what are we doing today james asked the group now sitting at breakfast the morning of their final hogsmeade weekend of the year well i was thinking lydia began but sirius cut her off and so were the rest of us we d like to have some say in the planning this time oh most gracious planning nazi he teased well you wonthave fingers to write with or a head to think with if you keep calling me that lydia threatened but i guess that would be a step up for you since you never write or think and your fingers and head just get in the way i d be happy to chop them off for you she grinned as sirius shot her a hurt look well you two lovebirds can duke it out later or the rest of us will just plan the whole thing in the ample time we ll have remus sarcastically chided well james intervened zonko and honeydukes are a must as long as we go there i ll be happy enough to even accompany you all to the hog head if you d like james patted his almost nonexistent stomach yup nothing stands between me my jokes and my sweets sugar sirius yelped the group laughed and sirius frowned what what so funny with a pitying look lydia patted him on the back oh nothing to worry about dear she said in a motherly mocking way well i d like to stop at the three broomsticks lara added i just love how butterbeer warms you right up alright said remus counting on his fingers we ve got zonko s honeydukes and the three broomsticks anyone else well i need to do some christmas shopping so maybe i ll just meet up with you all at the three broomsticks said lily i was planning on getting my parents some gifts now because well i haventyet and i thought they d enjoy some of the things i saw last time well you re not going by yourself james added i ll go with you i ve got shopping to do too he exclaimed with a triumphant grin so do i lydia added and me said lara i guess it settled then you all go shopping and remus and i will go raid the candy shop said sirius jumping up with a tone of finality what called an outraged lydia i was only joking sirius nervously chuckled as he sat down of course i wouldntdo that but as he said this he rolled his eyes in james direction causing him to chuckle dontworry lily laughed i think i going to get max some stuff from both of your favorite places so we ll still go yippee sugar sirius gleefully screeched mail here lara observed and sure enough hundreds of owls swooped into the great hall carrying packages for students staying a school letters about where and when to meet and various others as well lily spotted scarlett as she dodged her way around many other owls now landing on the gryffindor breakfast table gracefully she landed on lily shoulder and stuck out her leg with a letter lily relieved her owl of her letter and allowed her to eat some of her now abandoned cereal lily opened the letter and read dearest lily i just so happy that you decided to come home for the holidays i thought for sure you would stay at school with your friends but i am thrilled that you chose to come back sorry i haventgotten back to you sooner but we ve been very busy planning over here between your father work associates and mine we re expected to be at so many different parties and all i d like to do is sit in front of the fire with a nice cup of hot chocolate and talk to my family oh well but i did know that mikey and james were brothers you remember that one summer when they both came by for dinner they were so polite and now it turns out that since you and james are together and max and mikey are such good friends we parents feel left out so the potters have courteously extended their invitation to include your father and me isntthat nice well of course we accepted so the six of us will be having dinner at the potters the night of your christmas ball i sure you dontwant to hear about it but jennifer that james mother is just such a dear woman she is so kind and amusing we ve already got plans for boxing day as well we figured that since our children are all great friends that we d probably get along too it is almost alarming how right we were well i cannot wait to see you again i just want you to know that i love you more than you will ever know i cannot wait to give you your christmas present i really think you will like it and dontforget about our date with hot chocolate popcorn and your stories i will see you soon love mum lily face broke into a grin at the thought of this letter her mum and james mum were now good friends what luck lily always knew that she d never have a problem with her parents approval of james but the fact that their mums were friends made everything even better plans for dinner twice in less than a week lily grin spread even wider and she practically skipped to her room to grab the things she would need for shopping with the thoughts of her christmas holidays to warm her you say our mums are good friends asked a confused james as the group headed across the grounds to hogsmeade yup lily beamed blimey james whispered disbelievingly then he turned to face her with a huge sincere smile on his lips this is great i mean i never thought it would be a problem but now this and now they re friends and and wow he finished still unbelieving isntit great lily and james entered the village and joined back into the conversation their friends were having alright but where do we go first lydia asked lily get your lovey dovey arse over here she teased yes my happy ray of sunshine she teased back poking fun at her friend dangerously high rate of taking over and going slightly mad where do we go first zonko and honeydukes are both pretty busy right now where did you want to go for your mum and dad presents lydia inquired i was thinking along the lines of jewelry for my mum lily thought aloud so maybe glistening charm for her but i not quite sure about my dad lara piped up we are on the same wavelength today lils i was thinking jewelry for my mum too well isntthat just a bit frightening james said with something of horror on his face though it was a joke alright sirius cut in let go then he announced militarily as he frog marched a giggling lydia in the direction of the chosen store remus and lara followed hand in hand and james offered lily his arm which she accepted with a grin what are you going to get your parents ah well james sighed i was hoping you could help me with that you see i kind of known for giving terrible presents lily face went from amusement to terror you want me to help you you cantbe serious remember what happened last time i tried helping you or do i have to remind you about the failed attempt and the permanently blue hair well for one i not sirius and two yes i do remember but i d much rather like to forget if that alright with you he added slyly but in order to convince you i will tell you about just two of the disasters and maybe hopefully you will reconsider go ahead but i dontthink anything that you re thinking could be bad enough to change my mind she finished with a look of resolve well two years ago my mum kept complaining to sirius and me about how messy our rooms were and how she didnthave the time to clean up after us so as a present we decided to hire a maid to come and clean for her but you see she never told us that she wanted us to clean our rooms she only said that she wanted them cleaned she told us that if we ever hired anyone to clean up our messes for us again that she d kick us out so that we could clean other peoples messes much less our own for a change when i told her that it was the lady job and that she got paid for it she told me that all the money in england wouldntbe enough to clean the pigsties sirius and i lived in lily just laughed and said i can only imagine and for my father james continued well he just kept saying that he wanted peace and happiness in the house for christmas so sirius and i went to the local muggle grocery store and asked for something that could cause peace and happiness so the clerk showed us to the alcohol and said that anything in those two aisles would cause just the effects we were looking for needless to say the clerk was fairly young and inexperienced so the next day my dad opened the two presents one bottle marked peace and the other marked happiness when he started laughing and couldntstop we just thought the presents must have worked so we boasted about how our presents were better than anyone else s james chuckled yup those two incidences and several others have followed us to this very day with countless retellings at each christmas i sure my parents will tell your parents about them you two were quite the mischief makers lily giggled yeah but we ve learned a lot since then not to mention we re much more mature james stated pompously hey prongs didntyour mum say she wanted us to cook christmas breakfast this year sirius shouted from up ahead i think so james called back why what did you have in mind mate this place delivers a full five course breakfast on christmas morning and it only fifteen galleons for five people sirius yelled back unable to control his excitement really james exclaimed as he ran to catch up with sirius shaking her head and laughing at their childishness lily caught up with lydia as they entered glistening charm wow just look at his place lara gasped as she joined the girls and remus went off to gather the gaping children as the three girls walked into the shop they could not believe their eyes though the store was not huge or large at all in fact every centimeter of it was or held jewelry every wall was made up of drawers every counter sported a glass case with countless beauties on display or various racks of treasures tables turning stands and cupboards dotted the space holding all sorts of gems it was definitely an l adies kind of place ooh look at this lydia shrieked as she ran to the nearest display case and pointed out a jeweled tiara fit for the queen that nothing come and see this one lara called back as she touched a necklace with a very large colored stone in the middle that was shaped into a flower and these rings lily gasped arentthey just divine lara and lydia both stopped goggling over the accessories they were observing walked over to the still engrossed lily and gave her the most incredulous looks they could muster divine since when have you ever said that lydia asked in concerned disbelief yeah who are you are you feeling alright lara questioned yes i fine lily laughed causing her friends to exchange concerned looks but we re here for our mothers so let go shop she grabbed both of her still apprehensive friends hands and hauled them over to a wall rack of matching sets fifteen minutes later lara had picked out a nice triple stringed necklace for her mum in her favorite turquoise color lydia had narrowed her decision to two different sets of heart earrings and lily had only decided that a bracelet would be ideal for her mum her mum ears werentpierced because she was a bit self conscious about them and she always tried to hide them so earrings wouldntwork her mum already had tons of necklaces as gifts from family and friends she practically had one to match with every outfit she had and she only ever wore one ring her wedding ring so lily naturally decided on a bracelet do you think she d like the blue ones or the red ones lydia asked for what seemed like the millionth time holding each set up to her ears well what her favorite color lily asked for the millionth time it blue but i just dontknow that she d appreciate another pair of blue earrings lydia whined frantically while lara who had heard this same statement a million times mouthed it behind her back lily laughed but sobered immediately as lydia fixed her with a menacing glare that clearly stated this is serious lydia lara finally cracked i sure your mum will love the earrings no matter what color they are they could probably have fangs hanging from them and she d still love them would not lydia pouted would too lara retorted would not would too would not would girls lily almost shouted to the two arguing friends would you calm down please we re in a store for crying out merlin the two feuding girls looked ashamed and embarrassed and ceased their petty argument sorry lily both girls apologized dontworry about it lily smiled as she hugged both girls now what do you think about this bracelet and lily who had used the time the girls were fighting to look for the perfect present for her mum pulled a silver woven bracelet from behind her back it had a medium sized charm held in the middle of the bracelet completing the circle so it wasnthanging it was an emerald flower encircled in a ring of silver so that the back of the flower resembled a small silver plaque wow lara whispered that s that s perfect lydia breathed and after a couple of seconds she snapped out of her trance how do you find all the best stuff so bloody easy oh lydia lily reasoned it not perfect i just thought that the flower would remind her of me you know once we finish school and get jobs our parents wontreally see us often i just dontwant her to forget me lily lara whined dontsay that well it the truth you know lily trailed off then she took a deep breath and began again but i think i am going to get something engraved on the back maybe something like well hello o o o o darlings cooed an inhumanly high pitched voice fancy seeing you here lily and her two friends turned around to face the mysterious speaker and were met with a sight so horrifying the girls had to brace themselves on the counter that was now behind them there stood two of the most frightening people the girls had ever seen decked out in the gaudiest earrings most colorful tiaras at least one of every necklace in the place fifty bracelets per arm and a huge chunky ring per finger stood a grinning james potter and sirius black freda have you ever seen three more beautiful young ladies sirius asked in a soprano titter you know georgina i dontbelieve i have james freda cooed but certainly three young ladies such as you have three young men around here but where could they be by this point remus had caught up with the group breathless he gasped you have to help me i tried to stop them but they re bloody fast they threw me for a loop around the three broomsticks it took me a while to figure out that they hadntgone in but i swear i tried to stop them i have no idea where they went at this time every girl was wiping tears of laughter from her eyes remus was still panting but had now figured out that the two women standing across the way from him were in fact not women at all and freda and georgina were speaking animatedly to one another and gesturing wildly with their bracelet ed arms searching for the three strapping young men alright ladies lily began seriously our dashing yet completely mindless boyfriends have abandoned us to shop on our own but since they are indeed not here and wouldntbe able to help us if they were i was wondering if you might like to help us i sure your expertise on the matter of jewelry would be most helpful lydia and lara fell into another lapse of giggles but lily swatted them in the shoulder and they quieted immediately for a moment james freda and sirius georgina looked as if they were going to break the act in defeat but a sly grin reemerged on their faces as they exchanged looks of cunning understanding then they laughed the same seemingly helium induced laughs as before much to the girls horror of course m dears tittered james freda in her girly voice we are just the women to help and it a good thing we showed up right freda continued the smirking sirius georgina you ladies are in for a real treat jewelry just so happens to be our specialty so what did you think thumbs up down middle way down way up way middle not that that made sense lol but let me know please i would love to know why you like or hate my story lol just a simple click a few pecks and one more little click is all it takes and now questions did you enjoy sitting in on a quidditch practice do you sympathize with lara

james mocked in a womanly voice uh oh no sorry mam we were just uh looking is all he replied to himself in his best sirius voice honestly mate i thought you were going to run out of the shop with your tail between your legs he added in his normal tone while struggling with his tie shove off james sirius growled it not like you jumped up with confidence either mr we were just checking the prices sirius shot back well i saw the two baddest quidditch captains both with their heads in the sand and their tails between their legs goaded remus aw moony dont be jealous that you didntget to dress up with us james cooed you ll get a chance i daresay we could whip up something for you james said as ceased the battle with his tie for a moment to shoot sirius mischievous look wait what happened asked a confused peter jealous remus inquired jealous you say why would i be jealous of two grown wizards who still cantput on their own ties remus asked shaking his head and grinning umm yeah about that james began you wouldntmind giving us a hand would you ole buddy ole pal sirius chuckled the better half of me is telling me to leave you two to figure it out on your own so that i wonthave to be there on your wedding days dressing you but the marauder in me is telling me to just sit here and laugh and maybe help you after you ve caused yourselves injury in your quest remus grin spread even wider james and sirius knew what they had to do with one look at each other then the two of them bolted across the floor landed on their knees at remus feet and began begging shamelessly oh please remus what can we do to convince you to help us we could do your homework or get you anything you want from honeydukes or zonkos or alright alright remus chuckled i ll help you but not because you ll do my homework because you d probably make a mess of it and not because you re going to get me anything from you favorite shops because you d probably end up eating it all anyways but because you re my friends and because you re going to behave yourselves tonight this brought the gasp of all gasps from james and sirius mouths gasp they then chorused together you dontmean james began but he was so distraught that he couldntfinish his thought does that mean no eating contest yes james it means that you cantbe a pig remus replied stoically but with the trace of amusement in his sky blue eyes behave sirius added incredulously how could you wish such a horrible thing on anyone yeah we thought you were our friend james whispered dramatically i am you nuts remus laughed that why i doing you this favor i ll do your ties and make you behave so that your girlfriends dont kill you of course why didnti think of that sirius exclaimed at his epiphany wouldntwant james here to upset poor lily no would we mate well if i were you i wouldntbe too worried about lily if i were you i d watch out for that loaded wand lydia james joked and you re not much better prongs sirius retaliated with your now boys remus shouted then he continued in his polite calm manner calm down relax you both should be worried about what time it is we ve only got remus glanced over his shoulder by george we re supposed to have rendezvoused with the ladies two minutes ago well we would have been down in time if sirius wasntso touchy james huffed as he shoved himself up off the floor no if you werent so bloody rude we d have been early sirius shot as he too stood up yeah well if you werentso but james was cut off for remus had just cast a silencing hex on him he was getting quite a headache so what oh mighty but sirius was cut off by remus quick handiwork as well and finished his sentence with a noiseless insult now remus began quickly whisking james and sirius ties finished we must all be going he then swiftly guided their dress robes over their heads as well and their shoes in front of their feet james and sirius were knocked off their feet onto remus bed with the force of the robes therefore giving their shoes a chance to stuff themselves on the boys feet in less than five seconds the two were back on their feet completely dressed tied shoes and ties included silently fuming there now we re all dressed and ready to go isntthat great remus looked his two friends faces glow red with fury he did what any good friend would do and laughed oh the joy of pea but remus was hit with double non verbal hexes and was silenced immediately what going on peter asked stupidly thoroughly annoyed with each other the marauders marched down the staircase one behind the other pushing shoving pinching kicking anything they could do to harm one another without magic needless to say this didnt include peter who straggled behind the group slowly realizing why his friends werenttalking there you are lara squeaked with excitement her soft purple robes swayed with each hurried step towards the marauders but with each step her smile slowly drooped what wrong with the lot of you thayvul gun n hetscheechovr peter mumbled as his eyes searched his shoes i sorry i didntquite catch that what did you say peter lara inquired kindly they ve all gone and hexed each other he responded more clearly ooooohhh lara said understanding dawning i can fix that she announced happily as she pulled her wand from her robes the three silenced boys retreated a few steps and sirius jumped into james arms in fear lara then raised her wand intending to perform the counter curse but to the marauders relief lily and lydia both came running in just in time to see what lara was about to do lily silently flicked her own wand causing lara to fly out of her hand now lara what have we told you about hexing people lydia mock scolded what going on anyways lily asked well the dolts we call our boyfriends have gone and hexed each other silent lara explained impatiently i was only going to help them oh lara dear dontmake me bring up the time you silenced your younger sister and then caused her tongue to be numb for hours when you tried to lift it it wasntpretty lydia reminded well let go shall we the now vocalizing sirius announced both girls turned to him lara with a look of surprise and lydia with a look of fury you dog she spat not knowing how right she was why would you lie about such a pointless thing what do you mean lie i did nothing of the sort sirius said with true wounded ness in his voice what lydia shouted so loud that whoever was still left in the common room turned to look at the group how can you shhh lily coaxed to lydia whom she had just silenced there there lydia just calm down that a good girl now listen can you do that for me lily asked a lydia now beyond fuming mad you need to stop this insane arguing sirius is a good guy he really likes you but if you keep treating him like dirt he going to think that you dontlike him lily explained calmly the fact that lily was telling her this in front of everyone was the thing that made lydia calm down the most now while you and lara were bickering i lifted the hexes on the boys they didntlie they were hexed but i just lifted it are you going to behave now lydia nodded her head with an apologetic look in her eyes lily then undid her hex and lydia flew full into an apology to sirius lily turned to the rest of the group shall we go then as the group made its way through the school to the great hall lydia continued her apology to sirius who just kept telling her that to make it up to him she had to keep giving him kisses lara remus lily and james just kept teasing the couple at one point james caused sirius robe to cover his face just as lydia was about to kiss him for the millionth time all in all if anyone had seen the group in the hallway he or she would have dubbed them the weirdest people he or she had ever seen and walked away covering his or her face afraid he or she was going to be attacked after their headmaster traditional speech the group was starving mmm look they ve got pasta la carbonata lily exclaimed pasta la wha wha whata james asked laughing pasta la carbonata lily answered laughing as well it pasta with egg and bacon and did someone say bacon sirius cut in honestly sirius you canthear me when i right next to you trying to explain muggles studies homework but you can hear a stranger an the other side of the world if he or she were talking about food lydia laughed haventyou figured out that he got a one track mind remus asked good naturedly chicken fingers sirius yelped causing the group to laugh even more just think lily began to james our parents and brothers are all having dinner right now how do you think it going oh lily james grinned it going fine i sure what there for our parents not to like i mean james lowered his voice unless your parents are undercover special agents or something lily fixed him with a look that said this isn t a joking matter well they are muggles wait you re parents are muggles james exclaimed in disbelief well why didntyou tell me that before oh this is terrible what lily asked nervously what do you mean you knew they were lily started to freak out a bit but when james grinned lily caught herself smiled at him threateningly then threw a roll at him james just continued to laugh you should have seen the look on your face it was priceless he then dodged another roll lily evans head girl throwing food lily then stopped in mid throw as if suddenly realizing the same thing she put the roll she had picked up to launch onto her plate sat back down and calmly resumed surveying her menu aw come one lils james begged i was only joking he then put his face between her face and the menu with what else but his signature puppy dog face lily fought hard to keep herself from bursting out laughing but she did it lily then fixed james with her best oh yeah look and then set her menu back on the table james grinned see that wasntso ba right into his open mouth lily shoved a roll stopping anything james was about to say she then grinned at him james dontyou have any manners lara scolded honestly lily i dontknow how you put up with him lara shook her head as the marauders laughed moments later the whole table joined in after several minutes lily was the first to speak as it is tradition for the boys to have their who can eat the most contest i ve thought about it and the girls and i have a proposition oh lily sirius cut in we re not allowed to have an eating contest sirius relayed with a meaningful glare at remus are you afraid lydia challenged what do you mean afraid sirius is afraid of no one he announced good because lydia lara well not so much lara but lydia and i feel that between the two of us we can eat more than you guys lily dared my love do you have a death wish james asked with amusement in his words and on his face what you dont think we can do it lily shot back lydia and i havent eaten all day we ve been saving up for this well you know lily if they just want to bow out and shy away because they re scared there nothing we can do we ll just win for sure that way lydia added slyly now hold it right there missy sirius put his hands up we he gestured to himself and james are not afraid of two girls especially the two of you you got that right james added we ll certainly entertain your challenge but you have to convince remus to let us do it lily and lydia turned to remus remus will you please let them you know it ll be worth it to see them lose to two girls lydia tried on one condition remus began and james and sirius high fived each other you two girls better win oh you can count on it remus lily replied now pumped up for the games to begin about two minutes later the table was rearranged so that lily and lydia were sitting facing james and sirius lara and remus didntwant to participate so they each sat at the heads of the table to judge peter was with isadora and her friends this time are you ready to cry james goaded lily yeah i ready to cry tears of joy when i kick your sorry arse lily shot back causing james confident grin to slip into a look of confusion now we have the ladies to my left and the men to my right remus began the object of the game is to eat more than your opponents the lovely lara will be keeping score and i will be watching for any cheaters on your marks are you alright lily asked james yeah i feel fine why james inquired get set oh nothing i just wanted to make sure that you were ok now because in a few minutes time you re going to be begging me to stop celebrating lily replied confidently wha go remus announced immediately the girls told their plates what they wanted to eat right there they got a handle on the boys for they were still a bit confused but only for a second then they set off at the speed of thestrals plates of pasta bowls or soup dishes of salad platters of meat all clanging on the table as the contestants ate their way through countless courses however much cheating was going on none of which was called lily and lydia unnoticed by the two boys across from them who were intently focused on their food were vanishing a couple plates every now and then remus and lara helped eat some of the food for the girls when they could chance it but every time the boys looked up there would just be the two girls going full steam ahead after a good half hour of eating nonstop the boys were getting full they would look up from their food to check on the girls but from what they saw the girls were still going full speed sirius and james were now looking to each other for assurance but each could only see eyes filled with disbelief and mouths full of half chewed chicken and pork chops alright we give james surrendered i canteat anymore yeah i couldnt eat anymore if you paid me sirius breathed ok well i just going to finish this plate and then we ll tally it up and see who won lily said as she chewed her grilled cheese hey it max favorite lily laughed sweetly keeping the mood light and fun making the boys feel that much more defeated after lily had finished her grilled cheese and lydia had finished her pasta lara began tallying up the number of plates each team had cleared this is close she would mutter occasionally or oh my goodness look at this then finally after two agonizing minutes lara announced we have a winner all heads snapped to full attention for the boys we have a whopping 43 plates total the table clapped for the boys and james and sirius half heartedly gave each other a high five but they were too full to do much celebrating and for the ladies drumroll please a staggering 48 plates lara exclaimed congratulations ladies you ve won james and sirius were baffled but too full to care they just hung their heads in shame while the rest of the table danced around in celebration lydia and lily each put out their hand to shake with their opponents but after their hands clasped the girls pointed at them stuck their tongues out and laughed it was all in good fun of course how did you what did you i dontunderstand james gave up neither do i sirius agreed i guess we just underestimated them again and you ll never do it again right lydia asked sweetly let dance lily shouted and grabbed james hand uhh lily he whined cantmove too full aww is da poor baby still sulking because he lost lily teased i guess i ll just have to go find someone else to dance with me she trailed off as she inspected the dance floor no james gave his best attempt to jump up i ll go lily just laughed at this poor sight james was halfway out of his chair leaning on the table for full support with an arm in the air it alright we can just sit lily giggled as she went to aid james in sitting back down but he jumped up all the way grabbed lily and dipped her whispering may i have this dance you just look so lovely tonight i couldntresist my goodness arentwe the charmer lily blushed of course you may but i must admit i was eyeing you as well you are irresistible to me james then swept her back to a standing position as the rest of their table clapped and cheered unaware that they were being watched james and lily were startled a bit but they quickly recovered and took their bows and curtsies the group then entered the dance floor to a fast paced popular song the girls grabbed the guys and led them to the very heart of the floor and they all began dancing with each other laughing dancing singing lily was beginning to wonder if there was anything better could you just imagine if max and mikey were here james shouted over the music yeah they d be going wild max loves this song lily yelled with a grin i ll have to remember to tell him about it then a slow song came on and the group naturally separated into their pairs james took lily hand and spun her into him cradling her and swaying to the soft beat of the music james yeah he whispered back where do you think we ll be in five years she wondered aloud james then slowly spun her to face him with one hand on her hip and the other holding her hand to his heart five years hmm well i would hope that we d both have successfully become aurors i d hope that voldemort would no longer be around and i d hope that you d have changed your name for me he added the last one softer than the rest lily smiled inwardly what do you mean well that i hope in five years that we would be married maybe i mean if we were still together and you didntgo back to hating me that is james grinned you are unbelievable lily whispered smiling i couldntpossibly hate you after all we ve been through james i love you i love you too lily james whispered back as he pulled her closer to him lily heart fluttered every time he said it she too hoped that they would be married someday james was really all she could have ever hoped for all she could have ever dreamed of who would have thought that the scrawny messy haired boy who knocked her over in their first year and continued to harass her for the next six years would have grown up to be the handsome strong man who was so caring kind and gentle as the couple swayed to the music it was as if nothing existed past their world but something stirred inside lily it was as if someone had suddenly taken hold of her stomach her head and her heart and squeezed with all their might she had only experienced this sensation a few times before but never to this magnitude once when max had fallen off of his bike in the second grade and broken his arm and once when her dad had a heart attack it was as if she was connected with her family connected in some deeper way especially when she closed her eyes when she closed her eyes she could almost feel what her family was feeling almost see their emotions and their moods in her vision and now she knew something was very wrong her breathing became shallow she felt lightheaded and felt her legs quake beneath her it was a good thing james was holding her or she might have ended up on the ground lily are you alright james asked desperately can we go sit down lily asked her voice wavering in and out james guided her back to their table and waved to the others that it was all right so they wouldntget worried and have to stop dancing he poured her a glass of water and handed it to her what happened are you alright yeah i just i dontknow i think maybe all that eating wasntsuch a good idea lily purposely shoved her first thought out of her mind she didntwant to think that something like that could possibly be true of course it wasn t since her dream her mind had been reeling and she thought very dramatic things but rarely ever let them come out of her mouth yes that was it she was just sick from eating so much everything else was fine can i get you anything else do you need to go to the hospital wing james asked concernedly lily smiled at his thoughtfulness no thanks i alright go back and dance have some fun lily tried james just laughed i wouldnteven think about going without you james then pulled a chair up to lily and placed her head on his shoulder just close your eyes and rest thanks james lily replied then she shut her eyes and listened to the world around her she could hear james breathing beside her she could hear the band and the students singing along she could even pick out her two best friends voices she could hear the clatter of dishes from those still eating and the shuffle of feet on the dance floor she could hear someone screaming someone crying out for help she could hear dishes breaking and things being knocked over dessert sirius yelled as he came running over to james and lily honestly mate how can you still be hungry james asked him it should be illegal to eat so much lydia muttered as she followed him off the dance floor hey it sugar how can i resist sirius responded seriously is lily sleeping lara asked oh uh james looked down at his shoulder yeah i guess she is she said she wasntfeeling well before do you wan shum cake sirius asked through a full mouth of chocolate cake causing the group to laugh and lily to stir james noted the distressed look on her face but decided to ask about it later just in case it was another bad dream so he squeezed her hand in assurance are you feeling better lydia asked noticing that lily was awake umm lily began still waking up and realizing where she was yeah i alright why are we sitting here let go dance lily shot to her feet with james and ran to the floor lydia and lara exchanged concerned glances but shrugged it off as just another of lily quirks and followed her to the dance floor so i guess no one wants any cake asked a disheartened sirius reluctantly following lydia and wiping his mouth on the sleeve of his robes james was having a tough time keeping up with lily but when she stopped she stopped so suddenly that he almost ran into her lily he shouted over the crowd are you sure you re alright he yelled but he wasntsure she heard because her back was still to him and the crowd was really loud so he carefully turned her towards him lily eyes were wide and set staring into space her mouth was slack but set she looked frightened lily james shook her slightly lily then it was like a switch was flipped she shook her head and the look disappeared sorry she apologized i guess i kind of just spaced out let dance lily no james held onto her though she made to leave what wrong nothing i fine i promise lily assured him and herself then she took his face in her hands i alright just stay with me james noted the look in her eyes the look of determination it was the look she got whenever she was working on some particularly hard homework or ready for a quidditch game lily i would never leave you good then let dance lily smiled and began bouncing to the music still not completely satisfied with her answer or resolve james was hesitant and bothered but he followed and danced anyways because it was what made lily happy phew what a night sirius exclaimed as the group exited the great hall tell me about it my feet hurt from all the dancing lily said as she limped across the hall here james kneeled hop on and he pointed to his back giggling like the schoolgirl she was lily accepted the piggy back ride from james the gang laughed sang and joked their way back to the gryffindor common room and into the nice squashy furniture the boys went and got some nice hot chocolate hot apple cider and due to sirius complaining of hunger they retrieved some popcorn as well this left the girls alone for a little while to gossip about the night mostly little stories of stupid things their boyfriends did or reliving the eating contest but the girls realized now that they had come apart a little they were still of course best friends but they didnt always share everything like they used to they were not as close as they used to be popcorn and hot chocolate lily asked disbelievingly but excitedly that what my mum and i always eat when she trailed off realizing how ridiculous it would sound if she said when we talk about boys and girl stuff when what asked the ever so sensitive sirius black when i come home from school lily forced out thinking on her toes that nice lydia responded my mum and i have mini peanut butter and jelly sandwiches she squeaked my mum and i have pop tarts lara added well my mum and i have twinkies sirius added in high pitched voice uh oh georgina back i think remus warned causing the whole group including sirius georgina to howl with laughter it wasntuntil their laughter died down and lara checked the time that the group realized someone else was in the room someone they didntnormally see in student common rooms professor dumbledore lara asked caught by surprise yes i hope you all had a very good time at the dance you ll have ms evans and mr potter to thank for that however i need to borrow them for a moment if you dontmind i afraid this business cannot wait the headmaster informed them of course professor what is it lily asked worriedly as she jumped to her feet i ll need you to come to my office please if you ll just follow me then professor dumbledore explained goodnight ms kalada mr black ms kaladim and mr lupin sleep well then he turned and strode out of the portrait hole without a single glance back obediently lily and james followed james looked back and waved goodbye to his friends but lily eyes were fixed ahead once they were outside the portrait hole and after the fat lady bid farewell to the headmaster and the two head students james hand finally found lily s he squeezed her hand to let her know he was there he hoped nothing had gone wrong at the dance but apparently something must have why couldntstudents just behave for one night as they came upon the headmaster office lily mind was tired from all of the racing it had been doing she was going crazy thinking about all of the possibilities that could result in her and james needing to speak so suddenly with the headmaster and more importantly what had happened to cause their normally jovial headmaster to be so quick and curt with her friends why did his eyes not seem like they belonged did something happen at the dance did some of their decorations cause harm was the band alright did someone get hurt after what seemed like an eternity of climbing stairs the trio finally made it to the top through the door and to the headmaster desk please take a seat professor dumbledore gestured to two chairs in front of his desk with a quick noncommittal wave of his hand slowly he rounded his desk and sat in his own chair his fingertips went reflexively together and his eyes peered over his half moon spectacles at the young man and woman in front of him what i am about to reveal to you will no doubt come as a shock i have had to tell several other students this unfortunate news at other times in the past but it is with even deeper sorrow and regret that i must now tell the two of you professor dumbledore took a deep shuddering breath with his head down in the meantime lily and james minds were racing james still held tight to lily hand he didntdare let go it was the only thing keeping him from screaming at the man in front of him to hurry and tell him what happened if the news was so important why didnthe tell them right away how could he be so calm if the news was so dire what if someone needed help immediately and they were just sitting here watching their headmaster breathe lily on the other hand had become numb she didnt know why but her mind began shutting down and simply wondering what she was doing she was unaware of james hand holding hers it seemed that she had lost feeling in it mr potter ms evans their professor began again after his deep centering breath i truly regret to inform you that your parents and your younger brothers have been killed gasp gasp that one was just for my sister i miss you so what do you think omg i know tell me now what you think i need to know but i also need to know some other things did you like the marauder action in the beginning did you understand everything going on at the dance are you surprised is it all too sudden is this all possible favorite part and just overall how do you feel about this if you do feel it all confusing i promise that the next chapter will straighten things out and explain them i also hope that if you think this is all too sudden that you ll at least read the next chapter and then decide if you re going to drop the story the next chapter is going to be very important and very pivitol i leave you with that comfort at least i hope it a comfort as for the polls we have five for disliking coconut and only two for liking it lol i find that so funny because it was just the opposite when i did the poll at work the poll for this week is if you had to would you rather eat alligator or worms two of our reviewers have eaten these things you two are braver than i ll ever be but i also have another question that i think is quite interesting if you can could you tell me what does jk mention in the 6th book that i had in my story before the 6th book came out the two things are very similar hint it is mentioned in my chapter 11 true magic can you find it the first one to connect the two will get the next chapter dedicated to her good luck finally i d like to thank you all one more time

made individual people smell things unique to their likes and it was freaky because of the love potion perfume in chapter 11 that the girls put on so congrats to you five this chapter is for you enjoy chapter 24 the curse of denial what it couldn t it can t what what lily finally forced out of her mouth you cantbe serious i sorry ms evans but i assure you i am speaking in the most serious manner professor dumbledore answered his gaze drifted sadly over the students sitting opposite him so young so talented and now so alone he truly wished there was more he could do but he knew they had to learn and make their way on their own he had faith there must be some mistake lily said with a half laugh my parents couldnt possibly be well they cantbe they re just not alright she screamed tears of fury stinging her emerald eyes please sit down ms evans i know this is hard but you need to listen their headmaster continued solemnly your parents and your bother max were at the potter house for dinner correct yes sir lily answered anger still in her voice and her position still standing but what does that have to do with anything i dont understand my parents arenteven magic ms evans please i implore you to take your seat and listen tiredness and sadness radiated from his words and his eyes death eaters about a dozen of them came to the potters house tonight their mission was we believe to kill harold potter a most famous auror and a most outstanding wizard and man at the mention of his father name james who had been silent up to this point inhaled sharply as if the name itself had stung him but i dont understand lily said with a steely tone hurt and confusion shone like beams of moonlight through her eyes but her mouth was set in determination professor dumbledore took a deep breath planning the best way to approach what had happened he had not expected lily to react like this and his plan was thrown off kilter we believe that they were not expecting any other people to be there we can only guess that the death eaters wanted to make a clean job of their task in order to omit a trail they killed everyone there to leave no witnesses behind they would have been successful for a while had it not been for the extra security measures on the potters house from the ministry he paused and gave this fact a chance to soak in i am truly sorry the entire staff as well as myself are here if either of you should need anything do not hesitate to i need the truth lily shouted stamping her foot her eyes struggling to hold back the tears you said that if we needed anything you d help so i need the truth i demand it ms evans i am telling the truth professor dumbledore replied sadly i dontbelieve you you re lying lily swooped over to the hunched james who had remained sitting in his chair she crouched before him his lifeless eyes now at the level of her distraught and denying ones she grabbed his shoulders and pleaded tell him to stop lying but james did not respond his eyes had a glazed lost look lily let out a sob and shook him harder james you have to tell him tell him to tell us the truth ms evans professor dumbledore stood up from his desk this simple nevertheless powerful motion spooked lily and she fell backwards knocking into her chair please clam yourself i understand it hard but you cannot handle people like that he finished sternly as he pointed to james who was still sunken in his chair with lifeless eyes but as he remembered what had just happened to the two students two students who were now alone in the world he inwardly scolded himself for being so firm his head found his hand and he rubbed it as he contemplated what action to take next just then another figure entered the room i have contacted her sister at the time she was at her fianc home she is still there now professor mcgonagall reported as she stepped further into the room she has been told what has happened and has been warned of the consequences of her telling that to anyone her eyes drifted over the scene from dumbledore risen form to james lifeless one to lily on the floor beside an overturned chair she looked questioningly at dumbledore and what of the muggle neighbors and policemen he asked tiredly they are being told that it was a gas leak she replied a bit more shakily thank goodness you re here professor lily sighed with relief as she rose to her feet maybe you can tell me the truth can you please confirm the fact that my parents are really fine and that professor dumbledore is just playing a little joke on us he doesntbelieve me lily pleaded exasperatedly whatever professor mcgonagall had been expecting it wasntthis her eyes betrayed her change in emotion they had been conveying fear and sorrow but now there was pity dear girl what do you mean she asked slowly and as sweet as she could she didntunderstand what lily was talking about she feared it might be some traumatic stress effect professor dumbledore has just told james and me that our parents and our brothers are dead you know as well as i do that they re perfectly fine but he insists they ve been murdered by death eaters lily laughed at the outrageous claim just tell us that this whole thing was a terrible joke so that we can all go to sleep and forget this horrendous flop lily persisted ms evans i sorry to say but she gave a sideways confused look to professor dumbledore professor dumbledore he telling the truth fear flickered in lily eyes for the first time that night but seeing the sorrow in her headmaster eyes and the pity in professor mcgonagall s the fear was immediately vanquished and her anger renewed why were they keeping up this horrible joke fine i guess i ll just have to go figure out the truth all by myself if you wonthelp me and james wonthelp me i ll do it myself she screamed shaking with fury you ll see once i ve found my parents and my brother and james family and found that they re all perfectly fine you ll both see with that she burst from the room and pounded down the spiral staircase i dontknow whom they think they are pulling this joke it certainly not funny i mean why would they kill our families they ve never done anything wrong it just not possible and if they did they certainly would have killed james and me with them no they re fine i just know it now let see i just need to get as far away as i can and so lily ran she raced up countless staircases she bounded down endless halls her mind raced with possibilities as to why her headmaster and deputy headmistress would be trying to make her think her parents had died everyone has gone mad i swear i must be the only sane person left even james believed them and with the thought of james another slew of thoughts intruded her mind will he be alright what if he really believes them with the last thought lily pushed her legs to move even faster tired sweaty legs shaking and gasping for air lily stopped in a disserted hallway where she thought she d be far enough away to think and plan she checked again to make sure the coast was clear then began pacing i ll need the most superb owl in the world some parchment a quill and some ink if i just write a letter to mum and dad they ll send one back telling me they re fine now the problem is where do i get the owl and the parchment and the quill and the ink what had initially sounded like a great idea now started to sound terrible she paced faster at this realization becoming more and more nervous lily knew she couldntrisk going back to her dorm it was too close to dumbledore office and james might be there what am i going to do i ll have to risk it i dontknow where else to get wait a second lily stopped pacing i dont remember this being here huh i must have walked further than i thought just like magic which was of course entirely possible a door had appeared seemingly out of nowhere lily didntreally think twice about it since she was in a hurry but she could have sworn that it hadntbeen there lily grabbed the doorknob and pushed open the heavy wooden door behind it was a quaint little room it had a nice big chair and a squashy couch in front of a fireplace there was a desk there as well with parchment a quill emerald ink and just off to the side a strong snowy white owl with large amber eyes she was so surprised by the room that she almost yelped in surprise but she caught herself just in time the readiness of the room was to put it simply scary but reminding herself of what she was there for lily pushed the weirdness out of her mind raced to the desk and began scribbling a letter to her parents and her brother dear mum dad and max i know this is all going to sound very odd but i think everyone at hogwarts has gone mad professor dumbledore yes the headmaster just told me that you three and james parents and brother were murdered isntthat insane it a terrible joke they re playing and they wontbelieve me that you re all alright so if you could please just send some sort of letter back with this beautiful owl i d really appreciate it that way i can prove that you re all ok i dontknow what i d do with myself if you all really did die well thank goodness you re all alright i hope dinner went well and i really hope you all like the presents i got you sorry to wake you up if you re sleeping but it just couldntwait as you can see i love you all mum dad and max love always lily there once they respond and i get the letter back professor dumbledore will have to believe me lily then sealed the letter grabbed a piece of thick twine and approached the owl now i need you to get this to either my mum or my dad or my brother dontleave them until they ve written me back alright lily asked the attentive owl as she tied the letter to its leg the beautiful owl hooted in reply then whisked out the window in flight lily watched the amazing sight the owl flew high into the sky blending into the snow and the clouds so that only when its wings flapped could you tell there was an owl there the breeze blew at her loose hair and her warm face she closed her eyes just feeling the cool air against her skin it felt good after all the excitement lily could have waited just like that for the owl to return but like everything these days lily wasntable to enjoy a full peaceful moment without it being interrupted take the dance for instance the night would have been as perfect as one could expect until the stupid joke beating up malfoy after the quidditch match didnteven last for that long and now just as she was calming down after a chaotic night someone had the guts to disturb her as quick as a cat with a murderous glare on her face lily whipped around to see who had entered the room and disturbed her peace lily came a low timid voice is that you james the glare and the anger immediately vanished from her and relief and joy took their places how did you find me she asked as she ran to him the map he responded quickly but that not important lily what are you james you have to believe me our parents and our brothers are fine i just know it i dontknow why professor dumledore and professor mcgonagall are acting so strange but i ve just written a letter to my parents and max she relayed with a huge smile as soon as their reply comes i ll be able to prove that they re all alright and she hugged james in celebration james heart sank he couldntunderstand why lily was acting this way he felt her embrace him but he was frozen he didntknow what to do he felt lost he felt like he was surrounded by complete darkness he could feel his fingers and his toes but he couldntsee them but the worst part wasntthe darkness it was the cold ice had replaced his blood chilling water surrounded and trapped him he was lost there was no lily hugging him no floor beneath his feet there was just this absence of everything but the darkness the ice and the cold james lily tried to bring him back to earth so to speak are you alive hello o o o lily shook him gently and giggled cut it out you re always the jokester but james didnt respond his eyes didntmove he didntbreathe he was completely stiff then he felt himself being pulled though reluctant his legs moved awkwardly in the direction he was being led he sat on a couch but he didntknow where or why he lied down and found his head in lily lap but he didntknow how he got there but his eyes closed instantly and the shock began to settle settle but not dull rarely did he ever cry in fact he couldntremember the last time he had but now he didntknow what else to do he couldnthelp it and all the pain he should have felt as soon as his headmaster told him his family fate came creeping out his eyes silent tears raw pain his hopelessness drowned him as sleep overtook him lily had led a stiff and tired james to the couch managed to get him seated and then took his head in her lap she stroked his hair and smoothed his face but now she felt hot liquid soaking through her dress robes she glanced down at james to discover that he had been crying but now he was sleeping the world no longer made any sense to lily and with the last thought of her parents sleeping in their bed and max in his she too drifted off to sleep happy tap tap tap tap lily bolted awake it was the owl with her parents reply lily stood up not noticing james had moved and sprinted to the window where was it where was the owl with the letter she couldntsee him lily banged open the window nearly breaking it and stuck out her head where was the bloody owl it had just woken her up and now it was playing games here pretty owl come here she sang on high pitches as she stood on tip toes to reach more of her body out the window nothing answered except for strong arms pulling her back from the window lily what do you think you re doing james demanded as he pulled a struggling lily from the window fright lacing his words i lily began deliberately as she straightened her robes with an annoyed force was trying to find where that bloody owl went with my reply again she searched fruitlessly out the window though she didnttilt as far out lily james began emotion finding its way through cracks in his voice it not coming you believe them it wasntan angry question in her voice this time it was injured realization sadness pity almost dontyou she demanded as the disbelief and betrayal found their way into her vocal chords lily just couldntunderstand why james would choose to believe other people over her why didnthe believe her dont worry she said softly as she squeezed his hand you ll see james was past his breaking point with lily act he wished he had some other way of making her see it but he didn t and if there was another way he couldntsee it lily he began firmly you arent going to get a reply he hoped that was enough because it not only killed him to be this frank with her but it killed him to be this frank with himself he didntneed her to be denying the truth he needed her to grieve with him to accept it and then figure it all out but she laughed and it hurt i dontsee how you can say that i just heard it tapping on the window the bloody thing woke me up the owl is the owl is not coming back he cut into her words with his tone coming close to exasperation lily eyes gave away her fear for the second time that night james dont say lily they re dead all of them they re not coming back accept it there is nothing you can do about it the owl is not coming back with a reply you re not going home to your family your parents wontbe waiting for you your brother wontbe waiting he trailed off as he realized that everything he was saying was true for him as well with a breath james forced himself to regain his composure but it was lost the instant he looked up at lily and saw tears marring her gorgeous green eyes all we have is each other he reached to her cheek and wiped away a tear no she whispered and shook her head no i cantbelieve it i won t she shouted with drops of her sorrow falling even more freely as she pushed his hand away again she went to the window her eyes frantically searched the skies for an answer but in her heart she knew the truth she just couldntaccept it why she screamed into the night as her grief came to the surface and cascaded out of her eyes and mouth in sobs why they never did anything to anyone why them why all of them her anger and her distress became more uncontrollable as each second passed her sobs wrenched her stomach and she collapsed to the floor knowing it was best for her to vent her anger james had simply watched with his own tears of loss but when she fell he went to her james wrapped his arms around lily and held her tight shhh he whispered as he held her lily sobbed into his chest why she repeated again but this time with defeat that ripped james heart in two it not it not fair she gasped between sobs every word that escaped her lips grew softer than the one before it her certainty was exhaled in every breath and loss was inhaled in its place rocking back and forth james held onto lily with his life they d be damned if they thought he would step aside and let them take her away he lost a mother a father and a brother in less than an hour he wasnt going to lose lily too james stroked her hair and cradled her as her sobs began to recede a bit he gently kissed the top of her head rocking her to a slow steady beat he struggled with his own grief telling himself that he had to stay strong for her if only for a few minutes images memories and streams of thought flashed before lily eyes her mother washing dishes all covered in suds her father setting up the video camera on her brother first birthday her mum pouring over all of her paper work in the study but seeing lily and dropping it all to help her ride her bike her brother flashing is patented grin as he tore into a steak the size of his head her father again coming home covered in cooking grease from his long days in his professional kitchen max his first time in diagon alley and the way his face had lit up max in his robes his first day of hogwarts her father her mother her brother all surrounding the christmas tree with sleep still on their faces but love and happiness in their eyes lily would never see that again another gut wrenching sob escaped lily throat followed by another and another she was bawling again but she didntcare she had no one left what was she supposed to do without her father without her brother what was she going to do without her mum no she protested as she hit feeble fists against james chest battling for an escape from the terrifying reality that held her hostage an escape that could never be james did his best to hold her and he finally got control though she didntput up much of a fight feeling a wave of uncertainty and hopelessness wash over him james let go of the blockades he had put up around his lungs and his eyes and let his emotion take over he had tried to be strong for lily but he couldnthold back the pain anymore and as the two teenagers sat on the floor of a magic room in a magic school filled with na ve sleeping students dreaming happy dreams as the couple clung to each other afraid the other would be taken crying together for each other for themselves for their murdered families for the fact they would never celebrate birthdays or holidays marriages anniversaries or births together again or ever as lily and james went through the most painful experience of their lives as all of the sadness and horror was realized and accepted as evil continued to rise higher and higher with every passing second outside snow began to fall oh dear what do you all think let me know did it move at a good pace was it

but i dunno i just thought that with something as big as basically your entire family dying at once and only a sister that hates you left i just thought that it would be so hard to comprehend that lily would withdraw and i saw her disbelief as her withdrawl does that make sense lol sorry if it doesn t but i totally see where you re coming from and i appreciate it but no green red and pink

great that you re reviewing my story thank you so much alright all here we go chapter 25 saving friendships what now asked a sighing lily it was only a couple hours later the moon was still out peeking through the clouds and the snow was still falling i i dont know james confessed for the past two hours or so he and lily had cried remembered and slept well they caught catnaps neither could really sleep their minds raced too fast for sleep to be plausible hearing the honesty in his answer lily snuggled closer to james enveloping herself in the safety of his arms the initial shock was beginning to wear off lily didntknow which was worse denying it or accepting it the brutal truth was that she was never going to see hear smell touch or feel her family around her again all the true family she had left was her sister petunia lily couldntwait to see her again she knew they hadntbeen getting along since her acceptance letter from hogwarts but lily was willing to put the past in the past and in a sense start over with her sister lily felt that in a way she was lucky she would still have her sister james had no one lily hugged him tighter still determined to show him that she was still there and she wasntleaving him i love you james lily whispered tightening his hold on her james whispered back i love you too lily he kissed her sweet comforting lips that were just for him the only thing he had left lily he didntlove her because she was the only one left he just loved her more because of it he felt her shiver as a breeze of winter air swept through the open window he gathered her closer yet and thanked the heavens for her strength comfort and most of all her love james sensed lily breathing even out to its steady rhythm of sleep a journey he had felt so many times before like a sleeping baby james carried lily slumbering form from their newfound room through the halls to her bed in the heads dormitory she seemed so small in his arms so helpless so dead he could hear her shallow breathing as he whispered the password to the portrait he hugged her closer as she stepped over the threshold into the common room all the thoughts of his family were shoved with brutal force to the back of his mind where he refused to go they fought to break free but he denied them lily stirred as james met the stairs shhh he whispered to her you re all right lily seemed to settle upon hearing his words her muscles relaxed and her eyes rested up on james whatever she saw there comforted her her arms found their way around his neck and she held tight as he climbed up the last couple steps careful not to hit her head james used his elbow to push open lily door he walked blindly into her room but he knew his way around her room better than he knew his way around his own house he came up on the right side of her bed and gently set her down he took off her shoes and her dress robes leaving her in a pair of black cotton pants and a black tank top gently he pulled back the covers and eventually pulled them up to her chin sweeping away the hair from her forehead james bent down and kissed lily head good night he whispered with a slight waver in his voice lily seemed to be asleep so james kissed her once more on her cheek and left the room lily lie awake though her eyes were shut she needed to be alone as much as she loved and needed james lily knew her mind required some time to calm down and stop reeling from the night her eyes sprang open with the soft click of the door closing for a while lily lay there in quiet accepting silence for now the silence was divine she didntwant to talk about what had happened she didntwant to hear what anyone had to say about it and she didntwant to hear excuses or explanations as to what had happened the silence was saving but as the silence passed lily grew angry why did her parents leave her couldnt they have run or sent a message or saved max why did they just give up and die lily threw the covers back from her she sprang out of bed and began digging through her trunk by moonlight she needed to get out to take a walk clear her head clear her heart she needed to think and she couldntdo it in a sweet warm calming room lily needed the heartless and merciless cold to shock her to numb her from everything she felt she didntwant to feel she threw aside books and socks robes and skirts she realized she was unpacking everything she had gotten ready to go home but she wouldntbe going home anyways so it didntmatter what this lily hand clasped around what felt like paper while she searched for her warmest sweater unsure lily lifted the object from the trunk but her arm stopped in mid ascent as she realized what she held it was max christmas present a box filled with chocolate frogs bertie bott every flavor beans glacial snow flakes the new fizzing whizbees and his favorite toungeburners a funny feeling hit lily like a speeding semi truck it was a mix of sadness loss and anger she ripped the box open savagely throwing the wrapping paper aside she tore the top of the box off as she went to the window tears of defeat hammered from her eyes as she flung the box out the window with all her might she ran back to her trunk and dug until she found the package for her dad non stick spray for pots and pans magic non stick spray her father had been searching for some that would actually work but as it was so new none of the products were that great but lily had found some that would save her father huge amounts of time in his kitchen she had been so excited about the present she had gotten him now a present he wouldntget funny how that works the anger rose again inside lily like the blast of a bomb going off in her chest she threw her father present across the room it hit the wall and left a dent but lily couldntcare less the only one left was her mum s where did she put it lily wreaked more havoc on her trunk but she finally came up with the present and a paper stuck to it lily removed the small box wrapped in silver paper with snowflakes and the piece of paper on top of it the letter on top of it the last letter her mum sent to her eyes swimming with tears lily read through the letter her mum had been so happy she was going to meet james family she was so happy that she was going to see lily but not anymore no more late nights swapping stories with hot chocolate popcorn and each other as their only companions no more early morning calls to see all the presents under the tree no more exchanging presents no more lily felt a new surge of tears form behind her eyes she brought the letter up to eye level with a hand clenched on either side ready to tear but she couldn t how could she rip something that was so close to her mum at one point she broke down and threw her mum present instead a heart locket something her mum had been looking for it had a tiny moving picture of lily in one side and one of max in the other when it was opened a little inscription flew into the air just long enough to read it then it disappeared it read in your heart forever the words described the connection between lily her mum and her brother both lily and max had discussed how they felt closer to their mum because it had just felt like she understood them and their world better with more compassion and understanding they couldntreally explain it because they knew their father loved them just as much but the words also stood for the fact that their names were of course in her mum heart locket but her mum would never read it she would never see the pictures or catch on to the irony of the words immediately lily realized her mistake she ran and collected the locket hugging it close to her as if it were some bit of her mother living through the present next she recovered her father spray lily laughed imagining the look on her father face if he had opened the present then lily searched for max sweets but she couldnt find them she breathed deep as a gust of wind gave her goose bumps she remembered throwing it out the window just to make sure lily went to the window and looked out there it was a box a couple stories down half covered in new fallen snow as quick as she could lily threw on a sweater and her heaviest cloak she raced out of her room and down the stairs out the portrait hole around the halls down some more stairs and out into the fresh cool wintry night air she magically water proofed her socks and kept them warm as she jogged around hogwarts to find the place beneath her window arms still clenching her mum and dad presents then she saw it a dark splotch on the pure white snow clearly it didntbelong there she dashed towards the present and slid to it and there she sat like a toddler at christmas in the snow surrounded with presents her laughter rang through the grounds birds fluttered in the forbidden forest at the sound lily laid back and welcomed the coolness of the snow on her back she moved her arms up and down and her legs side to side making a snow angel her mirth warmed her insides as her out layer froze in the snow but she didntcare she remembered the snowball fights she had with her family at times all five of them were out there building forts and tunnels even keri came into her memories she and keri had taken on the rest of lily family together keri lily thrust keri death out of her mind and focused on the fun they had pranking lily parents and sister snowball fight on these very grounds came to lily mind too her and lydia and lara vs max and his friends and then eventually the marauders whom insisted on joining in eventually the memories faded and lily slipped into a quiet cold slumber lucky for lily james had heard her from in his room and had come to check on her only to see her lying outside her window but a second glance showed james the slightly covered footprints leading to her laughing position james left her to her own thoughts as he explored his and half an hour later he realized that lily had stopped laughing he rose from his seated position by her window and spotted her still on her back in the snow he smiled at the sight and thought of grabbing his camera and taking a picture but then he asked himself who would want a picture reminding them of the worst night of their life with his wand and some tricky wrist movements james levitated lily and the packages surrounding her up into her window for the second time that night james put lily into her bed but this time couldntget himself to leave he thought about going back to his room but he felt so alone so awkward so out of place there lily soft slumbering form did nothing to convince him otherwise james gently closed the window with a sweep of his wand then went to lily side he lowered himself onto the bed wrapped a protective and tender arm around lily and fell asleep almost immediately the next morning both lily and james woke in each other arms lily didntstir at james unexpected presence she only moved closer to him and he closer to her each was thankful the other was still there and still alive such a simple thing most people take for granted but to lily and james it was no small thing it was the only thing lily and james got dressed and met each other in the common room from there they sought out their headmaster the couple found him in his office waiting for them with some breakfast professor lily began i sorry about what i said to you last night i come come ms evans dontfret about it i ve had much worse said to me professor dumbledore assured her with a slight smile his words brought a tiny blush to lily cheeks ms evans mr potter i regret bringing this up and i am terribly sorry that i have to do so but we need to discuss the funerals any small comfort or dreg of happiness or hope that had been in the room seemed to have exited with a great big whoosh at these words lily and james faces both resembled dark grey storm clouds as their faces took on an ashen color both lily and james forced themselves to talk about the subject they knew their families deserved a funeral and it would be selfish to put it off because they were lost in the end it was decided that the funerals would have to be held separately though lily and james both wished they could be together so they could just get it over with in one shot not that they didntlove their families they just didntknow if they could take two funerals in two days but they toughed it out it would be too much of a hassle and too suspicious to the muggles if they found out both families died at the same time not to mention witches and wizards dressed in black robes and black wizard hats professor dumbledore helped lily and james so much with the process they often wondered what they would have done without him he made it easy for them to pick out flowers churches services coffins headstones in the end it was decided that the funerals would have to wait until after christmas day the evans would be the 26th at their local church and the potters would be the 27th at a small center near the ministry of magic and there one more thing before you go professor dumbledore cut in as lily and james made to leave for their dorm the door to his office opened and three blurs came running in and nearly tackled lily leaving four other people carefully entering the room lydia lara alice lily cried with relief as she was engulfed in their sea of arms and tears hey guys james greeted uncomfortably but he was saved from any further pleasantries by a surprising manly embrace sirius clamped a hand on james back and when he broke the hug james was surprised to see a glimmer of a tear in his eyes then james remembered that his parents were just like parents to sirius as well how you doin mate sirius asked gruffness in his voice still here james replied with a forced smile how about you dontworry about me he tried but he failed at trying to be strong and not care he and james both had tears streaming silently down their faces they tried to wipe them away but they werentfooling anyone they hugged again on the other side of things the girls were a sobbing mess it was almost comical and they did laugh at themselves several times but every laugh attack was followed with more tears from on the other side of his desk professor dumbledore watched with a sad smile then after he was satisfied he exited the room and left the teenagers to themselves i came as soon as i heard alice exclaimed as she hugged lily tight lily had stopped crying even though the other girls still were it was beginning to settle and lily was tired of crying she felt it was unnecessary and stupid in fact but she hugged her sobbing friends tight oh alice you didnthave to and our parents insisted that we come home but we fought and stayed here for you spilled lara as she wiped her eyes oh girls lily giggled as she wrapped her friends in another hug you didnt have to your parents are going to be so mad at you yeah lydia replied but we dontcare if they cantunderstand that you need us more than them well then they re just stupid i hungry lara complained all of a sudden and the other girls laughed through their tears lily was however thankful for the interruption oi potter lily yelled over the crying and the laughing and the hugging james head snapped up like a deer in headlights noticing the change in address to his surname what is it evans he joked back once he had confirmed that lily was indeed smiling we need some food over here for the birds she shouted back over the heads of her friends she saw james broad smile and it made her feel that much better well let go then james beckoned to them all cheerfully as he herded them all out the door he waited until all but lily were headed down the staircase to wrap her in a hug he kissed her sweet lips and breathed her in thank you he whispered in her ear not just the words but his sudden action and passion sent welcome shivers down lily spine all she could do was smile stupidly and blush at him when he pulled apart she felt like she was on a first date or a little schoolgirl she loved that about him how he could make her forget everything with one motion and she wanted to forget a lot these days the rest of the day was spent eating and talking about normal teenage things lily wasntthe only one who wanted to get lost and forget about everything but then again it was christmas eve a time traditionally spent with family and there was the glitch lily and james didnthave one left to spend time with but their friends had anticipated this and were prepared the group headed back to the gryffindor common room after their christmas eve dinner lily and james friends had planned a little surprise for them hot chocolate hot apple cider pumpkin juice butterbeer cookies ice cream homemade christmas cookies and popcorn lay waiting for their arrival the common room had also been decorated by some very kind house elves and when james and lily followed the others in they gasped at the state of the room happy christmas the group shouted with great big smiles on their faces their joy injected itself into lily and james and the atmosphere immediately lightened oh you guys didnthave to do this lily exclaimed though thanks was dripping from her words nonsense lily remus smiled it was the least we could do oh remus lily sighed as she embraced her close friend thank you so much i dontknow what i d do without you look at all the food sirius shouted he obviously had recovered from his shock as usual sirius random food related outburst received a great eruption of laughter from the group tears were shed but this time they were tears of joy sirius you helped get all the food lydia laughed as she patted her boyfriend head but i didntknow there was so much dang i good he said slyly with an egotistical drawl that caused the group to shake their heads and laugh more they all grabbed their drinks of choice and toasted to a happy christmas as they all began to settle down and take seats by the fire james sat on the floor against a couch with his knees up and lily sat in front of him leaning her back against his legs when james wasnt sipping his butterbeer his hands were on lily neck or back he couldntkeep himself from touching her it was like his hands were drawn to her like two magnets but neither seemed to mind all through the night the group laughed ate told jokes played charades and just enjoyed each other company they never felt so good to be alive and they had never felt closer in a bittersweet way the death of a loved one brings the survivors closer together as it was doing now with lily james lydia sirius lara remus alice frank and peter sugar sirius james and remus yells echoed in the fairly empty common room the only other people in the room were the rest of the group who were all now stretching after their rude awakening with smiles lily slowly opened her eyes to see james and his fellow marauders ripping through presents like they were well presents she looked to the foot of her makeshift bed of a couple blankets pillows and the floor there were about a dozen or so presents lying there much to lily surprise morning lily lydia stretched yeah good mor morn morning alice greeted as she stifled a yawn ooooo thank you so much lydia lara squealed as she hugged her friend in her hand was a nice set of drawing chalks these particular chalks could be manipulated with spells to remove them and make them permanent they were much like the muggle paint programs on computers lily had used in elementary school you could undo or redo but with lara skill at art she probably wouldnthave to undo you re welcome lydia laughed as lara hugged her lily smiled at her friends and continued to observe sirius now having opened all of his presents was acting like any small over active child would act at christmas he and remus were gathering all of the wrapping paper they could find plus pillows and blankets and making some sort of a pit apparently the plan was that they would take turns jumping into it james was thanking frank and frank was thanking james lydia was thanking peter who was blushing and looking at his feet lara and alice were hugging and thanking each other for their gifts all smiling and happy it made lily smile too this was how christmas was supposed to be this was what it was all about friends altogether happy smiling thankful for all they had there wasntanything better her gaze turned back to the presents sitting by her feet lily was dreading opening them for as long as she could remember she had had a kind of phobia about opening presents in front of people she had never liked it but she would do it if she had to she didntlike it but that was life let go get some food i famished sirius whined mate you just ate all of the candy we got for you plus most of mine james exclaimed in disbelief but look at me sirius countered as he turned sideways sucked in his already flat stomach and put a hand on the front of it and one on his back i wasting away i shrinking down to nothing alright mate james chuckled but on one condition he added seriously sirius at full attention nodded and waited for an answer as the suspense built you have to promise you re going to stop eating my candy and everyone else s got it james finished with a huge grin cross my heart sirius crossed it proudly with the ever scheming smirk on his face and you cantask them with the puppy dogs eyes james added matter of factly sirius smile fell slightly and you cantjust eat any candy left unattended he continued sirius eyes glimmered with hurt and you cantbully anyone into feeling sorry or afraid of you to get their candy or sugar for that matter james finally finished and faced his friend now pouting face james gave a hearty laugh at this i dontsee what so funny sirius shot back but then he cracked a grin and joined in with his best mate laughter boys lily muttered as she smiled and shook her head let go eat she instructed the others still smiling at james and sirius she was glad sirius had suggested it that way she was saved from opening her presents in front of everyone to make it less obvious she vanished her presents to her room so she could open them later away from prying eyes in good spirits the group trooped off to breakfast in their pajama and bright eyes no one could keep the smiles off their faces as they headed for the great hall all was good in the hogwart world christmas morning presents friends food laughter jokes all that was needed for a wonderful fun and

chapter chapter 26 saying goodbye it time james softly spoke into lily ear he brushed the hair from her face as her eyes fluttered open good morning he smiled though it was a smile with a twist of sadness lily eyes opened fully she slowly stretched and yawned hoping to delay the inevitable as long as possible she forced her mind to be as lethargic as her body as she sat up to face james pain and fear flashed in her eyes as clear as crystal james saw it and scooped her in a tender embrace she didntcry she didntallow herself to cry anymore once she had gained her composure lily gently pulled from james and with one last kiss upon his cheek she headed for the bathroom to get ready she slipped in for a quick shower but she got lost in the warm mist lily felt like she was in another world for fifteen minutes a world of steam and suds until a soft knock and james concerned voice brought her back to reality are you almost done we have to leave soon james said with the tone of someone who would rather be doing anything else than reporting this fact he tried to sound soft but no level of concern in his voice could change what was being said lily dried herself and her hair and returned to her empty room in her snowy bathrobe slowly she plodded over to her closet black it was of course the color of choice at funerals but lily didntwear it because everyone would expect it she figured that black was the perfect color because it mirrored her inside her heart felt as black and cold as night just like before she felt frozen inside her simple black skirt flowed just below her knees a black woolen turtleneck sweater warmed her neck but did nothing to warm the loneliness inside fiery hair was pulled tightly into a crisp bun and only magically water tear and sweat proof mascara accented her pallid face are you ready james inquired softly as he walked up behind her he held her and watched their reflections in the mirror as he touched her cheek with the back of his hand yes she whispered as she closed her eyes savoring the warmth of his hand his touch alone seemed to reach the iciness inside her james hand came to her shoulder then trailed down to her hand he clasped it and slowly led her from the room lily eyes fixed themselves in a different world as her body followed the warmth black black pants black dresses black shirts black shoes black ties black mood it seemed sinful that the flowers were so white and the church so colorful and beautiful lily slowly made her way down the center aisle towards where the three coffins were surely lying she refused to look but they drew her in nevertheless they drew her to them with their scarred and ghostly hands each shine of varnish a faint beckon she tried to fight to push away to break free from their grasp but a reassuring hand safely guided her forward i here james whispered in her ear she took a deep breath demanding her heart to stop pounding but it wouldntlisten it just kept up its jack hammering pace as lily tried to steady her shaky legs long enough to reach the front pew where the rest of the group minus peter who had gone home for the holidays sat as she came nearer to her family lily forced her eyes shut she couldntlook at them she didntwant to she wasntready to say goodbye then again she thought she d never be able to then as if it were yelled from the top of the world lily heard her elementary teacher quietly say oh petunia dear i so sorry almost breaking her neck lily head snapped around to look at her sister with a cry of relief lily took off running for her sister finally she could be reunited with the last living member of her family it was like a breath of fresh air after spending a lifetime in a dank cave petunia lily cried though there were no tears petunia looked up and for a second she too looked relieved to see her sister but a slight cough from her fianc vanished the delicate glimmer of feeling petunia seemed to have composed herself she stared hard at lily neither relief nor happiness nor any hope whatsoever on her face or in her eyes only one thing lay there and lily would know that look halfway across the globe blame she d seen it so many times when she accidentally made things happen or she told on her older sister but those times lily knew what she had done this time that look made no sense it stopped lily in her tracks lily pleaded with her eyes begging petunia to stop looking at her like that and hug her begging her to be her sister petunia couldnt forgive lily if lily hadntbeen a witch and been going out with james potter her parents and little brother wouldntbe dead true max had befriended mikey but after all he was a freak too but it was lily fault she was the first one to become a freak and if it hadntbeen for her max probably wouldnthave been one either how could lily think that she petunia would be happy to see her lily watched her sister stare at her with her condemning eyes as she passed her to sit in the front pew opposite where james sat now she saw that reproachful glance change to a dangerous glare of hate tears of anger sprung to lily eyes but before she could do anything a consoling hand placed itself on lily shoulder she turned mrs pax lily gasped with relief oh lily mrs pax soothed as she gathered lily into her arms how are you dear lily let her cheek rest on her boss shoulder mrs pax was the librarian whom lily worked for when she was home for the summer and christmas break my mum and my dad and max they re they re oh oh dear that enough shhh she hushed i know dear i know mrs pax lily lifted her head up is it alright if i take off this break i just dontknow if i could if i would be able to work of course dear she exclaimed with a sad smile dontyou worry about that and if you need anything dear i always here thank you mrs pax lily replied as she regrouped bells started to ring and people calmly hurried to their seats lily turned from mrs pax with a promise that she d find her after the service she slowly glided to her place between james and lydia keeping her eyes on james the entire time his eyes not only comforted her but they gave her a safe place to look with the coffins looming so close lily took her seat and the service began she fought her eyes with all her might to keep them on the person talking and not where her parents and brother lay only a few meters from her james hand found hers as his other arm slid its way around her shoulders protecting her lydia also grabbed her friend free hand then it was lily turn to speak she rose slowly keeping her eyes on the pulpit eyes dry but legs shaking she turned to face the people gathered there were so many of them it took lily by surprise she hadnt expected so many people to be there just a few close family friends not every person her family had contact with or at least that what it seemed like lily even thought she saw professors dumbledore and mcgonagall in the back dressed in muggle clothes she took a deep breath and began i dontknow much but i know i love you and that may be all there is to know lily paused after reciting a line from her parents most recent favorite song all there is to know by aaron neville and linda rondstadt my parents lived that line they always told me that love could get you through anything as long as you believed and never let go but what happens when all those you love are suddenly gone again she paused and let this sink in it would seem that you would give up in hopelessness but that not what my parents would have done lily smiled they would have held onto that love and cherished it until the end of their days well that day has come so now what lily looked around in question at the people sitting before her we do what they would have done we keep their love in our hearts and carry it with us until the end of our days you canttell me that you would just let their love die with them it wouldntbe right or true they would have wanted all of us to go on with our lives and love without regret to stick together no matter what and never forget the love you have for all of those around you even if it may seem hopeless even if it seems like your best friend has let you down and turned his back on you you have to keep faith in him you cantstop believing if you stop believing you ll only fuel the evil surrounding us all that feeds off of our hate for one another lily took another deep breath she wasntsure where all of that come from but she had a strong feeling it was from her parents and her brother i guess what i mean to say is love love if you ve never loved before love if you ve loved and lost just love one another and keep on loving love was all my parents and my brother knew and i sure they still know it lily took in the people before her she remembered meeting almost every single person in the room and now almost all of the people before her were wiping tears from their eyes lily understood why but she thought she d much rather see them smiling and remembering the good times they spent with her family with her eyes glued to james lily descended the podium feeling confident that she had made a point she smiled at him and he smiled at her as she sank into her seat beside james and he others her mind dwelled on the smiles of her family before she knew any time had passed lily was being guided to her feet she looked at james in question but his eyes were fixed ahead lily turned to see what it was it was time to pay respects to the deceased and like a lead weight all the sorrow returned had james not been holding onto her it probably would have knocked her off her feet the light in the church seemed to dim before her as her eyes focused on the coffins ahead slowly without much purpose she walked to her parents and her brother and as her vision cleared she saw a white poof perched atop a nearby candle stand note still attached and all instantly lily recognized the owl she had sent to her parents and brother the one that was not to leave them until he had a reply had he been with them this entire time as she walked she kept her eyes on the owl the loyal beautiful owl it all seemed to go in slow motion as lily came upon the coffins she took a series of deep breaths to keep herself from vomiting she could picture her mum dad and brother so vividly it was as if they were standing next to her lily felt her hand drawn to the owl to the letter still tied to his leg she walked towards the owl and the letter and carefully removed it from the owl leg as she stood over the coffins trying to see through them her hand crumpled the note into a tight ball the owl took off in one great white swoop taking lily breath away as it flew to the sun angelic do you think our parents and brothers are here watching over us lily asked after a long silence she and james were sitting if front of the fire in their common room lily hadntwanted to go to the reception at her house she decided she would leave petunia alone since it was obvious she preferred it that way i dontknow maybe james replied as he ran his fingers through lily warm auburn hair james was sitting on the couch with lily head in his lap as she lay on the couch you mean you dont think they can see us she asked as she sat up to face him her question was said with more curiosity and worry than accusation well i dont know james repeated as he looked away uncomfortably i think they are lily replied as she lay back down i just think that if there isntanything after this life it would be kind of a waste dontyou think i mean especially in the magical world if moving pictures dontconvince you that some part of a person lives on after death i cantthink of anything else that would i guess james mumbled then he started tickling lily in between her laughter she shrieked james stop ok we wonttalk about it james james stopped tickling eventually and lily laughter began to subside he gathered her closer to him lily yes james i love you i love you james she smiled he smiled too and hugged her closer to him he loved the way she felt against him warm like towels out of the dryer small so he felt like he could protect her in a moment notice perfect but the best thing about it was he knew she felt the same way the potters funeral went very much the same way as the evans except james didnt have an older sibling blaming him for everything he considered himself lucky but james like lily couldntcry anymore but unlike lily he didntfeel he could give a speech sirius did instead and that is when james almost lost it sirius stood up at the pulpit and began with his planned speech but sooner than he could control himself his mind went to all of his memories of the potters and how they took him in as their son his thought streamed out his mouth and before he knew it he had tears in his eyes in front of all those people if he had had any control over it of course he wouldnthave cried sirius black did not cry especially in front of people james went to his honorary brother and embraced him after that the ceremony was quiet and when they went to pay their respects lily thought about the few times she had met mr and mrs potter two summers ago they never really had the chance to know the girl who loves their son that thought struck something in lily and she realized that her parents really didntget a chance to see james and lily happy together either sure they had met him he made sure of that but they had never seen him and lily happy together well i guess they will now they ll just be seeing us from up there she thought the whole group had come to the funeral once again though not everyone had met the parents they had all certainly met the brothers and of course they had to be there for support for their friends it hurt them all something like this takes a certain toll on people but the group fought to stay strong for one another lily was surprised to see sirius crying but she remembered how james always talked about how his mother had taken sirius in as a son james got up and spoke much the same as lily did but the whole time he spoke lily mind was somewhere else she saw his lips move and his hands gesture but she did not think about the words coming from his mouth in fact she wasnteven quite sure she could hear them the man standing before her once was her enemy in fact almost all of the time she had known him she had disliked loathed even hated him how did they grow to care so deeply for one another what was it that had changed her mind about him what was it that kept him trying to please her like fate determination love could that four letter word truly be that powerful can a person mind and heart really turn that quickly or had lily heart only even been made to fit james and as lily watched james speak he looked at her like he did from the first day she met him and lily smiled despite the somber mood he loved her james potter loved her more than anyone else on this planet ever could and she loved him equally back his eyes held her gaze for a few more seconds as this unspoken stream of thought continued between the two of them it was as if they could read each others minds but isntthat what people say two people in love are almost like one person breathing loving and thinking as one lily couldntthink of a better way to describe it as she watched james descend from the platform he lowered himself next to her and almost collapsed into her side she held him as the next speaker rose to the platform and as he shook in her embrace she willed him to know how much she loved him i love you too lily james whispered lily smiled alright tell me what you thought i know it was a bit short but i just wanted to get it out there so that you all knew i wasntquitting and like i said before i ve started the next chapter and i like it better already so just bare with me if this one was not your cup of tea if you will thank you so much i apologize again and i am forever indebted to those of you who review this chapter thank you so much forever your s liane hey everyone sorry it been taking me so long to write and post these chapters but i ve had so much school and choir and dance stuff that i going crazy but i am in essence finished with my finals i ll be back home on saturday yay so now i can go back to a chapter a week yay does happy dance so i wontbore you with the details i will only leave you with the famous words of albus dumbledore tuck in chapter 27 testing the fragile it was almost time for school to continue again new year eve began a new chapter in the group life it was becoming more apparent to them all that the end was just around the corner soon enough they would all be split up and pursuing different career paths they wouldntbe able to walk down a few halls and say a password to talk to each other or in james and sirius case just say the other name into a mirror lily and james knew they loved each other and they hoped their love would sustain the big transition but sirius and lydia began fighting more as the stress took its toll and remus secret was straining his relationship with lara even more these days the deaths had contributed to the stress more than any realized but for lily and james it only brought them closer but it wasntonly companion relationships that were being tested friendships were also being tested lily loyalty to her girlfriends was being pushed as lara insisted that she knew or could find out about remus but as she knew she couldnttell her friends were upset that she wouldnttell them peter nowadays was becoming even more jumpy he would disappear for hours on end and by the time the group realized he was gone he was off the marauder map his friends were beginning to worry and ask questions peter would always pretend he didntknow what they were talking about but the day the rest of the students returned the group found out what he was up to hey prongs can i b b borrow the map please peter stuttered uh sure wormtail what for james answered going to meet your girlfriend sirius teased oh n n n n nothing just a little a little l l l late night stroll i guess peter responded to his feet alright james said with a sideways glance but bring it right back he held the map out you re just going to give it to him sirius cut in front of him outraged well why not he did help us make it james reasoned yeah but by himself what if he gets caught sirius be reasonable peter knows his way around the castle as well as any of us remus added peter snatched the map from james hand as he nodded then he took off out the door without looking back james and remus gave each other the look and bustled around as a confused and outraged sirius yelled about how sketchy peter had been lately and how he would have never given him the map what are you two doing sirius asked in suspicion as james got out his invisibility cloak and remus retrieved a spare piece of parchment he had finally taken a break from his ranting for a breath well james began while you and lydia were arguing earlier tonight remus and i were talking about peter and how to fix whatever is going on with him so we devised a plan to catch him in the act remus continued james and i conversed loudly about how the marauder map would reveal anyone anywhere at anytime and how awful it would be if someone was trying to be secretive about it james explained so we just made sure peter heard us talking about it and we knew we had him so james and i made another map so to speak remus unfolded the parchment he had in his hand sirius meet the wormtail tailer james introduced sirius looked skeptically at it for a second before regaining his composure blimey how did you do it sirius asked in amazement well it not as high end as the original but it works remus began see we just had to put a tracking spell on the marauder map and peter shoes and tie it into this paper we played around with retracing the original onto this one but i figured out a way to sort of copy and paste if you will the original onto this one now it wontshow anyone but peter and it doesnthave any fancy wiping tricks or password hints so if we get caught we re screwed james finished merlin remus gasped what james and sirius demanded at the same time he in the slytherin common room what they shouted let me see that james demanded as he snatched the map out of remus hand well i ll be pickled in murtlap essence he going to be sorry he ever became friends with us sirius growled sounding even more canine than he did when he was transformed what do we do remus asked well we cant wait here all night let go i ve got the cloak and if we re all careful we can do it james assured do what exactly sirius asked well we cant just leave him in there we have to go get him what if they attacked him and he lying there unconscious james insisted well i never thought about it that way sirius replied sheepishly let go stop dawdling james yelled they sprang into action running out of the room and down the staircase there was almost no one left as the students were probably trying to fulfill their new year resolutions of more sleep so the marauders got out of there with no problem they threw the cloak over themselves before exiting the portrait hole then dashed awkwardly down the corridor to save peter slow down you re going to get us caught remus hissed to his two friends the sight would have scared muggles into fainting spells three pairs of running feet the middle pair attached to running shins and knees and the front pair attached to thighs and the lower torso of a man sirius slow down moony right if we get caught no one will be able to help peter james reasoned sirius only response was to slow down a couple of paces what was that james hissed slow down mate i heard it too remus added sirius stop finally sirius heard the noise too and stopped dead in his tracks the only problem was that james and remus were trying so hard to keep up with sirius pace and they didntnotice right away that he had stopped only two words could describe what happened as a result marauder bowling james hit sirius remus hit the pair and they all tumbled to the floor in accompanying loud crash es thud s and swears what the devil a voice from around the corner spoke what going on over there the footfalls of the unidentified person grew louder and faster as marauders scramble to regain their standing position and stealth that my hand you dolt would you be quiet ouch that my knee that was my chin my hand there someone coming who is it i dontknow come on we have to get out of here this way then the tangle of visible floating limbs snuck into a door nearby after one of the limbs brandishing a wand followed a voice command of alohomora to unlock it breathing a sigh of relief the three marauders relocked the door threw off the cloak and pressed their ears to the door to listen for their mystery authority figure hello is anyone there what was all that noise the voice continued james knew he had heard it before but he couldntplace the face to it after a while the voice died down and the trio listened as the footsteps walked off that was close james sighed too close remus breathed let go sirius resolved but this time will you listen when we tell you to slow down james reprimanded yeah yeah mommy let go sirius replied irritably neither of the other two marauders noticed but james face went slightly pale at the mention of mommy sure he knew sirius had meant it as a joke but the word had a new connotation nowadays but james pressed on so the three marauders once again threw the cloak over themselves and headed out the door not before long they came upon the dungeons and the entrance to the slytherin common room james checked the map again yes he still here but what on earth could he be doing do either of you know the password sirius asked anxiously no remus replied of course i do james answered with a tone of you should have known that in his voice murderous manticore he whispered to the painting but it didntmove the hideous creature just blinked at the invisible space in front of him unfazed murderous manticore james said again a bit louder and more forceful than the last time blast why isntit opening could you have the wrong password remus asked no they just got it today i handed it right to those two apes unless they james trailed off and his demeanor went from puzzlement to fury at the speed of lightning why those prats they must have changed it they know they re not allowed to do that james for merlin sake keep your bloody voice down sirius demanded sorry i just what was that remus cut in it sounds like get over here james instructed just as the portrait swung open again the three hurriedly dashed out of the way who there came the deep yet fumbling voice of crabbe uh uh m m maybe i should go peter spoke from quietly in the common room it was just loud enough for the group to hear what wrong pettigrew are you scared your little friends are going to come find you but then again they would have to care enough about you to find out came the sneering voice of lucius malfoy sailing out of the portrait hole they care about me squeaked peter i just i think i should go a split second later peter flew out of the portrait hole as if an invisible foot had kicked him oops sorry called a sarcastic malfoy peter scrambled nervously to regain his standing position but as soon as he stood upright the portrait hole had closed peter looked around fearfully before setting off towards the gryffindor common room the three other marauders beneath the cloak exchanged confused and alarmed glances though some were angrier than others they all agreed silently to follow every once in awhile peter would jump at the sound of a creak or scuffle but the other three remained hidden it was very difficult to hide three nearly full grown wizards beneath one cloak but they managed however sirius patience was wearing thin so before either of the other two could stop him sirius burst out of the cloak what the bloody hell do you think you were doing in the slytherin common room peter jumped so high it was a wonder he didntsmack his head on the ceiling i i i he stuttered as he nervously fiddled with the map you you you you what sirius mocked sirius james hissed keep your voice down so we dontget caught please no i want to know exactly what wormtail was thinking when he started fraternizing with dolts like malfoy we ll find out but right now is not the right place what about well my pet growled the low voice james had heard earlier that night what have we here students out of bed filch the new caretaker stroked his cat mrs norris as he eyed the four marauders it was only until he heard the voice that james realized where they were right outside the door they had hid in earlier real smart guys he thought to himself no need to worry james said quickly thinking on his feet i will handle it i was patrolling and came across these mischief makers painfully filch slowly smiled if you could call it a smile james wasntso sure how much a person could smile when he had almost no teeth and the teeth that were there resembled the hufflepuff colors dontbe silly mr potter patrolling duties do not start until tomorrow night peter sirius hissed as he made small wiping motions with his hands though he was trying to be discreet he had chosen the worst time to say anything for no one was talking over him peter who was still rattled from being ambushed by his friends had no idea what sirius was talking about but filch caught on what do you have there boy filch snarled as he slunk towards peter with the speed of a lithe young boy that none of the marauders knew he possessed filch snatched the map out of peter hands peter looked as if he would cry what is this filch asked why are you carrying around a blank slip of parchment boy peter who looked like his birthday had come twice in one year squeaked in delight oh no reason thinking with his usual intelligent manner remus had quickly cleared the map as he stood next to peter the moment filch appeared filch however was not so easily fooled tell me what this does boy he was getting flustered with not being able to figure out what the parchment was really be reasonable it just a slip of parchment now will you kindly give it back so i can escort these hooligans back to their common room james replied professionally no so fast mr potter i am confiscating this i ve been around long enough to know that the four of you spell trouble now but james did not wait for any further explanation boys this way now and james marched them straight to the common room ignoring filch yelling he didntstop until the four of them were in their room then he promptly bid them goodnight and left for his own room in the head dorm despite pleas for him to stay james opened the portrait hole to find lily sitting in the common room as soon as she saw him she stood up from the couch and walked over to him with a kiss there you are i ve been wondering where you ve been she smiled me too james replied dejectedly you know how we ve been suspicious about peter lily nodded well we followed him tonight and found him in the slytherin common room lily gasped no well there got to be some explanation that exactly what i thought but when we got there it seemed like he was there willingly we only heard him tell malfoy that he thought he should go are you sure that all you heard i mean there has to be a reason peter is a good person you know that i seriously doubt that he would put his friendship with the three of you in danger lily grabbed hold of james hand and led him to the couch for a second james allowed himself to get lost in the feel of her skin on his he loved her so much he admired her after all that had happened to them within the past few weeks she was still there for him helping him with his problems what lily giggled snapping james out of his trance i sorry james blushed umm i think malfoy said something about peter friends actually having to care about him but i dontsee how that makes any sense maybe you should just talk to peter it seems like he lost he a good friend to you i think he wants to be your friend but he feels kind of on the outside but we always try to include him he the one who never around anymore james replied defensively i know i know but maybe he just feels left out and that the reason why he never around lily suggested further i dontknow i just saying that i find it hard to believe peter would go to malfoy without a reason lily yes james why is does it seem like everything is falling apart lydia and sirius lara and remus the marauders the three of you girls it seems like we re all drifting apart it felt like heaven to james to final voice what had been troubling him since christmas eve that night was the last night james could remember all of them being happy together despite the deaths of course lily looked at a loss for words i dontknow she finally said but i can promise you that i will be here still lily snuggled up closer to james determined to get lost in his warmth she did that a lot lately it made her forget about everything going on around her lily yes james lily smiled i mr potter ms evans came a voice they had heard so many times coming from the very spot it came from now they turned to professor dumbledore at the foot of the hidden staircase i so sorry to interrupt but there is a situation that has arisen that i hope very much you can help me with anything professor lily jumped up what is it james asked well i have three boys up in my office that were apparently making so much noise that they woke up the entire gryffindor common room dumbledore replied with a sad smile only now did lily realize that her headmaster was in his nightclothes she blushed i knew i should have stayed with them james shook his head it my fault professor i sorry james it not your fault lily replied either way i was hoping that one or the both of you could speak with them it seems like they are troubled about something but they wonttell me what it is right away professor james said quickly as he hurried right up the stairs not bothering to wait for lily so what do you think hehe we will see

thanks so much for the review sorry i didntget this chapter out sooner danradluver01 aww you make me blush i so glad that you enjoy my story you really liked how lily responded to her family death aww

honored thank you so much for the review i really enjoyed reading it and i so happy that you like the story sorry i couldntget this chapter out sooner disastamasta lol i was back and then i disappeared again lol sorry thanks so much for the review though i glad you liked it sorry i couldntupdate sooner forgive me thanks again for the review goldpen lol dontworry about the order of the questions they re really just a starting point if you want to write a review and dontknow what to say and i ve kept them because overall people like having them there but you dontneed to answer them lol i want to know what you think lol but i glad that you think it going well that a really neat way to go about the advice thing it cool lol glad you liked the new map lol thanks lol glad you liked the quidditch match lol you cantbelieve lily would attack she gt quite an attitude in the flashbacks and stuff i dontknow i think if provoked bad enough she may slip once or twice lol hmmm regards to the comment on how fast they are getting over the deaths i dontknow that they are getting over them quite as fast as one may think i think that because they have each other and such good friends they re not really allowed to get depressed because there are so many people around them that care so deeply but i dontthink they are over the deaths in any sense i feel that they are still deeply disturbed with it all but that they feel they have to be strong to the outside world for the good of the school so i dontknow if that helps but that what i feel inside and when they re alone i can honestly say that i sure they think about it almost all of the time but that they try to keep themselves busy in order not to think about it dont be depressed it always good to have someone to talk to but sometimes we block ourselves off to others because we know they wont understand i guilty of it but if you look hard enough and keep your mind open enough the right person or persons will come around and you ll find that you can talk to them about anything but if we keep ourselves closed we have no chance of finding them have hope i like to think i good at listening and giving advice so if you need anything just let me know i so glad you like the story sorry i couldntget this chapter over sooner thanks again for your honest opinions those are the best reviews thanks again heather gernenz haha thanks so much james and lily have openly admitted the love thing however it doesnttake away from the effect of saying considering all that happened and the chances they ve had to pull away lol i dontlike peter either however he got to be there to get the whole effect of the story ooo i love candy canes lol sorry i didntupdate sooner but here you go ilovedrew88 awww thanks so much for the review you love it i blushing thanks so much i know i feel the same way it sucks how everyone else is sort of falling apart but we all know that something along those lines has to happen you know sorry i couldntupdate sooner thanks again mrs katie weasley i glad you like my story i know how you feel about the blending thing lol so i ll review a bit for you now this is the fic where lily has a little brother named max and james has a little brother named mikey lily and james are head boy and girl and are now going out lily has two friends named lydia and lara and therefore have nicknamed themselves the l adies lydia is currently going out with sirius and lara with remus hope this helps thanks again for the review black first i love your name lol and i blushing you love my story aww thanks so much i so glad that you see the bigger picture of the story i really trying to convey all the things you are seeing thank you so much thanks for the suggestion about peter i totally agree with you but i justify his jumpiness by first how jumpy he was when he was first found as scabbers second since he hasntgone totally deather eater yet i feel that he unsure as to what he should do and he not sure who he feels safer with he doesntwant his friends to abandon him but he doesntwant the other side getting mad either so i think there had to be a point where he was just as jumpy in the start as he was in the end in the middle i feel that he had to have grown into a good liar and all since james and sirius and remus were his best friends there had to have been some pureness in him at first right i dontknow maybe that just me but that my story but you obviously are completely entitled to have your opinions i was just trying to explain my reasoning i not sure how far the story will go till we shall see i depends on how long everyone holds on and whatnot lol but thank you so much again for the review my favorite reviews are those where people are completely honest with me so thank you so much sorry i couldntget this chapter out sooner thanks again natasha kershka natasha thanks so much for your review i glad you like the long chapters i like your long reviews lol aww glad you liked the funeral i was worried that it would be too cliche and too mushy but i glad to hear you liked it i love sirius too though he not my personal favorite but he one of my sisters favorite lol so i know how you feel your suggestion just happens to be about the exact thing in this chapter that so funny that you suggested it and it was exactly what i had planned i hope you find it satisfactory thanks so much for the suggestions we ll see where the story leads and how long everyone holds on thanks so much for the review here the next chapter hope you like it i ll be waiting for your chapter as well nikkyb thank you so much for the review i glad you liked it you spent all day reading it aww thanks so much how long did it take you sorry i couldntget the post out

spygirl4747 thanks so much for the review glad to hear from you again sorry i didntupdate sooner chapter 28 to throw or trust old habits as james and lily reached the landing in their headmaster office they were greeted with an awkward silence there sat remus sirius and peter in front of professor dumbledore desk sirius was sporting a slight bloodied lip but it was nothing in comparison to peter there was no real harm done but peter blackening right eye and his split cheek were enough to prove that sirius had come out of the brawl better off what in the bloody hell happened james demanded sorry professor james added blushing slightly but whether it was from embarrassment or anger lily could not tell it seems that in my old age my attention span has shortened i haventthe slightest idea what you are talking about but please continue dumbledore waved james on peter said that he was attacked and brought there sirius didnt believe me peter squeaked why would i believe you we heard your new buddy malfoy sirius barked james you you you have to believe me peter ran to james how can we trust him sirius demanded rising to his feet his face reddening deeper causing his lip to bleed more freely i your friend peter pleaded but he but james held up his hand and cut sirius off james stood for a minute or so staring at the ground in deep thought peter still stood small in front of him while sirius remained standing by his chair only remus and lily had not moved since the beginning of the conversation remus what happened james asked after the long silence remus seemed at first reluctant to speak but after another drawn out uncomfortable silence he explained well it happened pretty much as they said you left and sirius accused peter peter denied it and sirius well let just say he let it get to him i tried to stop them but it getting to be that well i a bit tired we ll put it that way sirius peter is our friend he would never do anything to harm us you know him james reasoned but sirius didnt seem so sure james you know as well as i do how odd he been acting lately every time we turn around he gone and we cant find him anywhere james thought hard once again he turned to peter can you explain yourself lily thought peter had never looked so scared in his life his face which had been bright red with color now bore the resemblance to that of a grey cloudy sky i i i well i ve been sneeknoutoseiz peter mumbled i sorry you what james asked peter took a deep breath i ve been sneaking out to see izzy he said barely audibly as his face resumed its tomato color see there you have it he been sneaking off with his girlfriend probably got caught by malfoy and his drones thus ending up here james tone hardened with his next sentence sirius i think you owe peter an apology we re all friends we cantbe keeping secrets from one another this is what happens when friends lose trust we all fall apart james defeated voice trailed off sorry mate sirius grabbed hold of peter hand and pulled him into a hug lily walked up beside james and took his hand in hers as she rested her chin on his shoulder well there we are glad we got that all figured out how about a little shut eye before your big day back tomorrow dumbledore blue eyes shone happily lily got the feeling that james had just voiced exactly what he had been trying to teach the school right james snapped back into action good night everyone i quite sorry i forgot to mention if you james and lily here would kindly wait one moment i would like to have a word their headmaster bowed in apology of course sir lily replied quickly lily james and professor dumbledore bid goodnight to the other three marauders then turned to each other please have a seat dumbledore flicked his wand and one of the three chairs in front of his desk vanished as the remaining two moved closer to one another pardon me if you believe it is not my place to say but i would like to commend the two of you for your strength both of you have sustained a terrible loss but you haventlet it tear you apart i am no less than impressed with how you have carried on not only are you keeping yourselves together but you are keeping your friends close lily could feel the tears again but she pushed them from her mind and her eyes refusing to let them win but she couldntkeep the heat from rising in her cheeks at the memory of her family her only saving grace was james hand she held it a little tighter i would just like to remind you that just because you ve gotten through the break with no problem doesntmean that the rest of the school year will be easy there will be questions from wondering students consolation from concerned teachers and even jeers from students less than sensitive i would just warn you to keep your heads level in these dark times people often jump at the slight of a hand dumbledore peered at the pair of students opposite him over the tips of his fingers dontworry professor we ll be alright james assured his headmaster as he assured lily by squeezing her hand back thank you professor lily nodded that what you get for being a mudblood evans and that what you get for dating one potter malfoy spat whispering from his table behind the pair he slapped high fives with crabbe and goyle as lily willed james silent just let me hex him while professor trallick back is turned james pleaded with lily james no you heard what professor dumbledore said she hissed back in between taking notes besides he not worth it you know that yeah but he shouldntbe able to get away with that james who had long since given up on taking notes eyed malfoy i could take him i sure you could lily replied airily in the mean time i could distract professor trallick while sirius jumped on goyle and remus hexed crabbe lily laughed it about as improbable as getting the map back from filch after a few moments of silence in which lily believed she had made her point james kissed lily on the cheek and exclaimed lily you are a genius only after james had gotten up to tell sirius and remus the plan did lily realize james had taken her seriously frantically she waved her arms to try to get james attention and call off whatever it was he was planning on what is it miss evans professor trallick voice made lily stop dead slowly she turned to face her teacher as malfoy and his cronies sniggered behind her umm well you see er i well spit it out dear girl professor trallick prompted impatiently can i speak to you in private lily hinted with her eyes over her shoulder well i suppose so she responded though she looked unsure as james watched professor trallick lead lily from the room and into her office he was putting the finishing touches on the plan are you sure you can handle this moony yeah what are friends for huh remus gave a weak smile alright if you say so james shrugged on three he whispered one two three it all happened so fast even the nosiest of neighbors wouldnthave been able to see it coming remus sparked his wand and caused a thick cloud of smoke to encircle the area around malfoy crabbe and goyle a second later james was restraining malfoy sirius was wrestling goyle down and remus was jinxing crabbe still a mere 10 seconds later all six boys were out of the classroom door thankfully for the marauders there was not a soul in the corridor alright boys next broom cupboard james instructed levitating an unconscious malfoy in front of him a few minutes later the three marauders were back in their seats laughing silently about the state they left the three slytherins in only a few moments after the three marauders had returned to their seats lily returned from professor trallick office resolutely she walked to her seat sat down and resumed taking her notes on the chapter lily an excited james whispered lily you wouldntbelieve what we did excuse me but i taking notes so if you would kindly leave me alone i would like to finish them lily hissed james was taken aback of of course he turned away from her in thought sirius chucked a parchment ball and hit james right in the forehead he mouthed what up james shrugged his shoulders with his hands up in the universal sign of i have no idea he turned back to lily what wrong lily slammed her quill down i trying to take notes if you haventnoticed not to mention you just made me an accomplice to a crime i had no intend to commit so if you re through with your stupid questions i would like to finish my notes lily honestly i dontunderstand then it is wise to keep that fact to yourself and to yourself only then as if it had known all hell was about to break loose the bell rang signaling the end of the lesson quickly lily stashed her things in her bag and dashed off james sat looking utterly stumped dontworry about it mate sirius clamped james on the back she ll come around i know i just wish i understood her he trailed off then he snapped back to the present the trio headed for the door now let go help malfoy gabbe and coyle out of the closet shall we sirius smirked calmly the three traipsed to the cupboard they left the three slytherins in on three one two three well what have we here sirius shouted down the corridor so that everyone first through seventh years stopped in their tracks and stared james opened the broom cupboard door on the cue and out tumbled crabbe goyle and malfoy the corridor erupted with laughter for there were the three toughest slytherins dressed like girls they sported jumpers high heels pigtails bras blouses and make up and were looking very dazed as they held onto each other for balance however the only thing that managed to accomplish was making them look as though they were hugging each other and ladies and gentlemen they finally come out of the closet james yelled triumphantly causing those in the hallway to laugh even louder but james smile faded at the sight of a flourish of red hair he started after her but the crowd was so thick he lost her in the sea of people eventually james found his way to the head dormitory he scrambled up the stairs and knocked on lily door he listened no answer he knocked again but still no answer came so he tried the handle it opened with ease under his hand he pushed the door open and saw no lily where could she have gone if anyone knew lydia and lara would so james set off to find them he thought about grabbing the map but then he remembered that filch still had it so he set off for the gryffindor common room have either of you seen lily james asked lydia and lara whom were both sitting at a table pouring over their homework oh hey james lydia said lily no i dontthink i have sorry me neither why what happened lara asked concernedly james sighed she mad at me for something that all well what did you do lara prompted we were in defense class and malfoy and his two blubbering gits were spewing the usual about lily and i except that now with the new angle they have to go off of you know including our parents and brothers it was worse than usual so she made a comment as to how we could get back at them and so i ran with it i guess she wasntserious when she said it she just kept saying that she had to finish her notes the two girls chorused there no doubt you re in trouble lara said worriedly yeah once she brings the notes into the picture it quite near impossible to talk to her for awhile lydia said you really must have ticked her off lara added the best thing to do is to just let her cool off for a bit james groaned in protest at lydia words i know that the last thing you want to do but you ve got to give lily her space she needs to think it out for herself trying to talk to her will get you nowhere lara interjected trust us they chorused again thanks james then went up the boys staircase to seek out the other marauders about that night adventures so the marauders planned for the next few hours until their stomachs were growling signaling dinnertime together they walked to the great hall where remus split ways with them to go to the hospital wing the remaining three ate and talked about how much harder it was going to be without the map but james was a bit preoccupied he hadnt seen lily since she had stormed off and she still hadntshown up he thought that maybe she ate dinner earlier but he doubted it after dinner james said goodbye to sirius and peter and went to the head dormitory once again and just like before there was no sign of lily at a loss for what to do until sunset james sat in the common room and did some homework it wasntlong before sirius was calling james through the mirror hey james wake up groggily james wiped the drool from his face and parchment and turned to the mirror yeah well where are you you were supposed to meet us 10 minutes ago sirius shouted through the mirror damn sorry mate i fell asleep transfiguration homework bloody i dontcare just get your arse over here and hurry and with that sirius face vanished from the mirror grasping the mirror james ran up the stairs threw the mirror and his unfinished homework on his bed grabbed his invisibility cloak and headed straight for the gryffindor common room he was in such a hurry he didntsee lily on her way to the portrait hole from the opposite direction james lily shouted james skidded to a halt lily there you are james we need to talk about lily i sorry i really would love to stay and talk but i ve got to go any other night would be fine but tonight sorry lils and with that he was off at a run again leaving lily alone in the corridor at a loss for words lily made her way still baffled into the common room where she threw her bag on the floor and fell back onto the couch but she lay there only a few moments before she decided she needed to get outside in the cool air to think bringing only her cloak she headed for the gryffindor common room to gather lydia and lara she found them sitting at the same table james had seen them before hey girls want to go for a walk lily asked sure lily we could use a break what up lydia asked as she rose from her homework i just need to get some fresh air let us just go grab our cloaks and we ll be right back down lara said five minutes later the girls were breathing the fresh cold air and watching their breath rise up from their mouths towards the moon as they made their way towards the lake trudging through the snow and the slush lily explained about defense against the dark arts class he thought i was serious and he just left me assuming that i was going to distract her he never listens to me now lily i think you re going a bit far now dontyou lara asked i think so too i mean you ve never really complained about him not listening since the two of you got together lydia added and from what i ve seen you ve got that boy hanging on every word that comes out of your mouth lara said he loves you you know that we know that he knows that everyone knows that i think you two just had a misunderstanding nothing that cantbe fixed lydia finished lily thought for a while while the three of them kept walking i guess you re right i just what that it looks like an animal of some type lydia suggested either way stop trying to change the subject lily we know it seems to be coming this way lara put out your wand maybe we should go back lily said yeah i think so too agreed lydia who was becoming a bit more alarmed what lara asked not realizing what they were talking about would you put out your wand lily shouted what do you mean i donteven have my wand in my hand lara replied then what is so lily stopped speaking at the sight of the moon a full moon she whispered to herself yeah so lara said it a full moon and quite beautiful tonight if you ask me we need to get back into the school now lily shouted but we now lily screamed frantically as she pushed both girls back towards the way they had come the three of them started a mad dash for the school but the snow made everything slippery and as lily glanced back she knew they were not going to make it she only wished she hadntbeen so mad at james faster she panted were not going to make it lara shrieked i going to hex it but you two keep going lily surprised even herself no lily we ll do it together lydia pleaded no go lily stopped in her tracks and turned to face the animal coming at her she was pretty sure she knew what or rather who it was thinking of all the spells she knew lily had a little time to think of the one that would work the best in the end she decided on the stunning spell but she wasntsure if it worked on werewolves her mind was too preoccupied with the situation to think clearly here goes nothing she thought to herself one two thr but just then a beautiful deer jumped in front of her lily was so surprised she almost fell over but she kept her balance and stared at the stag she could almost swear that the deer was looking back at her there was something in his eyes something familiar but she couldntquite place it it didntmake sense yet she knew those eyes they looked like but lily thoughts were interrupted again as the deer almost fell on top of her then she remembered about the werewolf and she ran she only looked back once she saw the deer still trying to stop the werewolf only now joined by a big black dog she couldnttell and she didnthave enough time to keep looking for she was almost at the doors once she was safely inside she tuned to both panting girls beside her unable to speak from both tiredness and shock she simply started off for the gryffindor common room when the trio had almost reached the fat lady lydia asked what happened how did you get away and what was that thing lily wasntsure of what she should say that remus was really a werewolf that a deer had just saved her from being bitten by him and that she thought james was trapped in the deer body because the deer eyes reminded her of him lily didntthink that any of these things would make any sense or help lily in any way except for maybe confirming her friends suspicions of her insanity finally once they were back in the common room lily spoke i think it was a wolf of some sort i stunned it and then ran back to the school then why were you so worried lydia asked yeah and why did it matter that it was a full moon tonight lara added uh i ve got to go get some sleep good night girls and thanks for the advice lily smiled as she left the common room but once out in the corridor her smile dropped as she made her way back to the head dormitory she put her freezing hands up to her rosy cheeks and tried to convince herself that the deer had not been staring at her and that it did not remind her of james but then where is he piped up a small voice in her head the sensible one that she tried so hard to ignore when she wanted to be irrational before she knew it she was in front of sir and lady zanath he just inside the portrait hole in the common room she told herself but he wasn t he in his room of course probably sleeping she thought and smiled to herself once up the stairs lily knocked on james door but no answer greeted her she knocked again and even a third time but still no answer so she tried the doorknob and let herself in only he wasntin his bed then he obviously in the bathroom she thought but she looked and he wasntthere either that when she saw an odd reflection bouncing off of james bed she walked over and saw the small mirror she often saw james talking into he had explained how they worked once to her if memory served her right she just had to speak the name of the person who had the other mirror and who but sirius black would know better where james was sirius black lily told the mirror and the mirror showed something that looked like a white sheet with the corner of something brown it looked so real that had lily known better she would have thought she could reach out and touch whatever it was on the other side that not sirius lily thought it took her a little while to figure out what it was it was a ceiling most likely of the boys room and the corner of one of their bedside tables well you re no help lily told the mirror as she tossed it back on the bed once back in her own room lily took a nice relaxing shower trying to convince herself that it was silly to worry when that failed she gave up and slipped into her nightclothes and went back downstairs to do her homework a few hours later lily had finished all of her homework including all of her usual extra effort and then some she sat on the couch under a few blankets and waited her stomach was growling but she was determined to ignore it she wanted to be there and awake when james came in but she waited and waited and james didntshow up finally the need for sleep was so strong that she could no longer fight it so lily shut her eyes obliging her tired mind and body after what seemed like a few moments to lily she awoke to the sounds of someone undoubtedly coming through the portrait hole the light shining in from the nearest window told lily that it was dawn we need to get him on the couch lily on the couch quiet or you ll wake her i already awake lily yawned what going on lily stood up and turned around to see sirius limp form hanging between james and peter so cliffhanger i know sorry but i couldntresist but now that the computer and internet work i shouldntbe so long in posting i ve learned my lesson in making promises though because it seems whenever i make a promise on this site it comes back to bite me in the butt sorry so the traditional questions what were your exact thoughts the moment you finished the chapter did you like the chapter what do you think of peter what did

was really upset with how dumbledore was he would never touch harry or any student like that i also agree that they played the harry hermione thing up too much but about the stuff missing i heard that originally the movie was going to be almost four hours long with an intermission but then they decided against it i ve heard that they had originally filmed all that extra stuff as well which makes me

review i really appreciate it thank you again well off to the races chapter 29 ghosts of the past lily fought herself to stifle a scream somehow she knew that dumbledore twinkle wouldntsurvive this scene what what happened i cantexplain now but i promise i will james grunted as he struggled with most of sirius weight we need to put him down of course lily jumped to the side to clear the way to the couch i ll go get some i ll go get some stuff thanks lily james saw her run up the stairs and then turned his attention back to peter struggling with sirius here put him on the couch together they got sirius on the couch but from there they werentquite sure what to do james checked to make sure sirius was still breathing then he stood back to take tally of sirius injuries a black eye a wide cut on his forehead not too bad cuts and bruises on his arms but the one that worried james the most was where he had seen remus pick sirius up by the side of his body and throw him against a tree of course sirius had been in his animagus form at the time so there wouldntbe any risk of becoming a werewolf but that didntmean that no damage had been done sirius blood had trailed them all the way from the hogwarts grounds james saw the blood on sirius shirt and wanted to check to see that it wasnttoo bad he lifted sirius shirt up just a bit to take a peek at the wound but even that small movement caused sirius to groan in his semi unconscious state here lily said as she reached james side she handed him a few damp towels as she went to sirius feet she removed his shoes then came back and took a towel from james swiftly and surely she cleaned sirius cut face james could only watch in shock and awe his forehead should be ok but unless he wants a nasty scar we should get him to madame pomfrey lily then started on his arms she gently wiped the cuts with the damp towels and put some antibiotic cream on them she kept it with her from home for little cuts that she felt she didnt need to go to the hospital wing for but when she reached his side lily gasped she peeled back sirius shirt to reveal deep teeth punctures if lily hadntknown any better she would have sworn that there were sharks in the lake and sirius had gotten on the wrong side of them lily counted three sets of marks but two of them put together did not match the magnitude of the last set the last set was deep was so deep lily could barely tell where one tooth ended and the next began and where an animal canines had been the skin was torn even worse lily could tell that the wounds were trying to heal themselves but it wasntdoing much james lily began nearly breathless i can t there nothing i cantdo anything for this it too she trailed off staring at the injury lily you have to try we canttake him to madame pomfrey not until everyone wakes up it would be too suspicious james pleaded with his eyes lily could tell that james was worried about getting caught but she knew that he was even more worried about sirius james i afraid we ve waited long enough as it is his face is getting paler by the second if he starts shaking we ll be in even bigger trouble but no james i sorry but i dontcare what it was you were doing or how much trouble you ll be in if someone finds out but if we dontget sirius to the hospital wing he might very well loose too much blood and lily voice caught in her throat as her eyes welled with tears yeah sirius was cocky and full of himself but he was sirius and he was her friend she was not going to lose another friend lily could see james weighing everything in his mind but thank merlin sirius chose that time to groan again lily saw the hurt and fear in james eyes and she knew that bringing her shoes down with her would have been a good idea she whisked out her wand and began levitating sirius off the couch before the boys could jump in to carry him together the four of them made it to the hospital wing lily in bare feet in a record time the quartet burst through the infirmary doors gasping for air and struggling to yell for madame pomfrey the next morning or rather a couple hours later lily awoke in her room absolutely exhausted she had changed into her nightclothes but she had been too tired to take a shower and thus still had sirius blood on her hands lily dragged herself out of bed and into the shower she was awake enough to turn the water just a little too cold so that she would wake up she remembered madame pomfrey emerging from her quarters in her nightclothes and robe she hadntwasted a minute asking what had happened immediately she began tending to sirius it was only until she had him stable that she turned to speak with james and peter but before lily could listen to the conversation james had told her that she should probably get some sleep and she didnt have to wait for him that was when lily noticed that another bed in the hospital wing was occupied with another familiar face checking the time lily dressed dried and pulled her hair back into a loose ponytail grabbed her bag and headed for breakfast on her way she began thinking of what to tell lydia and lara when they asked her where their boyfriends were but before she had come up with even a single reasonable answer she was sitting beside them at the breakfast table morning lily lydia cheerily greeted m m m morning lils lara yawned wow you look like you didntget any sleep last night hey girls lily answered pointedly ignoring lara last comment thanks a lot lara she smiled trying to hide the fact that lara was almost 100 percent correct in her thinking no really did you go to sleep last night lara pressed looking worried for her friend lily however decided on not saying more than she needed to and just hoped that it would be enough umm a little bit i had a lot of defense homework alas she should have known better have you seen sirius or remus this morning lydia asked because we havent seen them since yesterday afternoon uh no come to think of it i haven t lily prayed that she was convincing enough they re probably off just pulling a prank or something you know them lara said as she helped herself to some scrambled eggs i guess lydia answered looking thoroughly unconvinced so we ve only got a half a year left of hogwarts and then we re done lily attempted to change the subject yeah dont remind me lydia cringed but just fink we wonthaffta do anymo homewerk efer lara exclaimed through a mouthful of her eggs lydia and lily laughed it felt so good to laugh with her friends after everything they had been through together lily felt it all melt away when she was laughing she didntcare if other people thought it was cheesy to lily it was the truth and she loved it come on wilbur lets get to class before charlotte starts spinning the words punctual and prompt in her web lydia smiled poking fun at lara piggish ness lily managed to dodge the subject of the marauders by vaguely nodding and making noncommittal noises when asked questions that is until lunch when lydia and lara really started to worry unfortunately for lily all three of them had a free period after lunch after the topic had been discussed about all through lunch lily needed to escape she wanted to find james and ask him if her thoughts and ideas about the night before were correct girls i think i just going to head to my room and try to get some sleep since lara thinks i look like i ve been run over by a truck lily added sarcastically sorry but i d want to know if i looked like death lara joked lily stuck her tongue out at her friend and the three of them laughed again lily gave a half fake half real yawn and stood up from the table well i ll see you two later bye lily yep see you later trying to keep her head from reeling with worry and fear which was very hard on so little sleep lily walked out of the great hall and headed directly for the hospital wing and almost just like before when she was trying to think of things to say to lydia and lara lily was trying to come up with how to ask james about her suspicions without sounding too crazy in case she was wrong well well well look what the dog dragged in our very own head mudblood sneered the cold and all too familiar voice of lucis malfoy lily only rolled her eyes and kept walking determined to ignore him what too good for us now evans think you re above us because you can play the sympathy card on account of your parents were just exterminated by the dark lord the word exterminated sliced through lily like an ice dagger but she willed herself to keep walking she would not give malfoy the pleasure of knowing how upset he was making her dontworry he ll get you soon enough malfoy called as lily rounded a corner to put him out of earshot now shaking with rage frustration sadness and worry lily focused on breathing in for four steps then breathing out for four steps breathing in for four steps and breathing out for four steps finally she met her destination she pushed through the doors and saw james sitting by sirius asleep however as the doors shut behind her he started lily what is it she watched james rub his eyes and check his watch i was wondering if i could talk to you about about something sure he smiled making lily feel a thousand times better but let go out in the corridor i dontwant to wake sirius lily nodded and headed for the door sorry i woke you up no dontworry about it i needed to get up anyways james yawned covering his mouth with one hand and holding the door open with his other lily smiled and thanked him and absolutely grinned on the inside at his sweetness the couple took a seat on a padded bench just outside the hospital wing doors lily began james what hap but lily trailed off seeing the look on james face he looked scared but he wasntlooking at her he was looking over her shoulder lily turned around to see lydia and lara heading for them i thought you were going to take a nap lydia said the look on her face froze lily like a deer in headlights and what happened to i dont know where he is lydia almost mocked lily lily was taken aback by lydia callousness but then reminded herself that she had lied to them lydia i sorry it just no i ve had enough lily she screamed still making her way down the corridor towards where lily and james sat you say you re our friend but you never tell us anything you re always saying it not my secret to tell or i sorry but i just can t lydia mocked her friend well i ve had enough of your lying how do you expect us to trust you if you canteven tell us the truth speechless lily searched for words to explain herself she opened her mouth several times but she couldntcome up with the words she wanted to say instead she took in the flustered face of lydia and the worried and hurt look on lara how could she have done this to them she loved them like sisters how could she have hurt them so badly i sorry she finally whispered as tears filled her eyes but then madame pomfrey burst through the hospital wing doors excuse me but this is the hospital wing and there are patients in here recovering they need rest and not even a giant could sleep through your bickering take it somewhere else please madame pomfrey hissed then she turned and headed back where she had just come from expecting lydia to speak again lily looked up at her friend instead she saw lydia and lara staring through the window of the door madame pomfrey had just exited through lily didnthave to think twice about it she jumped up ready to take her friends somewhere else but they were too quick lily felt the wind of the closing doors on her face and she watched through the window as the tears spilled over the rims of her eyes soaking into her black school robes helplessly lily watched as lydia ran to sirius side she saw lara walk to remus and touch his arm lydia touched sirius face and he stirred to look at her he now had the look lily had when lydia had first shown up he looked guilty and scared which didnthelp lydia temper she seemed to question sirius with her eyes and when sirius looked away lily too had to look away lifting his tired body from the bench james walked to lily and protectively wrapped his arms around her resting his chin on the top of her head lara had been holding remus hand crying freely she was scared lily could tell and lily knew that if she were in lara position she would probably be doing the same thing with all of the death surrounding their world seeing a person you cared for so deeply lying unconscious in a hospital bed is enough to scare anyone especially if you had no idea why the person was there lily watched in shame as lydia forced herself not to cry and lara cried without restraint suddenly lydia turned from sirius and was heading for the door lily and james were standing at but it seemed as though lydia could not or would not want to look at them she kept her eyes averted once again cutting lily deep with another wave of tears lily stepped out of lydia way without so much as a glance lydia pushed through the hospital wing doors turned the opposite direction of lily and began briskly walking away lily knew she had begun crying she watched frozen as her friend shoulders shook with each step knowing she couldnt let almost seven years of friendship go to waste lily ran after her lydia wait lily continued after her friend even though lydia did not slow or answer but as they ran lily noticed lydia sobs increasing and slowing her speed lydia talk to me lily pleaded as they slowed to a walking speed faster than she had run before lydia whipped around what what do you want staring at her friend lily took in lydia red and tearstained face lydia lily began softly then she went to her friend and encircled her in a hug as lydia began crying again it ok lydia it going to be alright lily soothed her friend as they sank to the ground no lily it not going to be all right cantyou see we re all falling apart lily we used to never keep anything from each other and lara now we barely get the truth from you about how much you slept last night it like all of a sudden we re not good enough like we ve already parted and gone to different school with different lives it not supposed to be like this our last year is supposed to be spent laughing together and doing all the things we ve wanted to do since our first year it just feels like we re falling apart oh lydia i could never ever be apart from you you are my best friend i wouldnt be here if it wasntfor you lily assured as lydia sobbed in her arms i wouldntbe me if you werentwith me lydia you know that dontyou i guess i guess so she said between sobs it just hard with everything that going on in our world people dying finding their families dead friends dying people being attacked the dark mark showing up everywhere i scared and i just afraid that you re slowly pulling away from us lydia voice had become a whisper by the end of her thought and she was now hugging herself lydia you know i d tell you everything if i could and i do i tell you everything i know that wontdamage anyone else if you know i just dontwant to divulge someone else secrets you know how that is lily hoped that lydia would understand yeah but it still hurts lydia admitted i sorry lily said truly wishing she could tell lydia everything she thought about it for a moment but then she realized that she didnt even know everything herself so she kept her mouth shut lydia stood up wiped her eyes and held out her hand to help up lily lily took it with a smile are you going to be alright yes lydia replied i ll be fine so the two girls walked back to the hospital wing doors and lily squeezed lydia hand before she let her go into the infirmary is she alright james came over to lily and wrapped her in a hug i think so lily said truthfully i hope so she just wants to know what is going on with her boyfriend and her friends she knows that i know but it hurts her that i wonttell her i want to tell her so much lily buried her face in james chest i know james said rubbing her back but i know i can t and she right we are falling apart and it because we donttrust each other but then again how can we we dontknow where we ll be in ten fifteen years if the wrong people get their hands on these secrets who knows what would happen lily paused and let the thought sink in it was frightening there more i need to tell you though if you want to wait i understand but no it ok i want to know you ve been carrying it much longer than i have it not right of me to ask you to wait lily gently pulled out of james embrace and began leading him to their head dormitory after a few minutes of silence each lost in his and her own thoughts lily spoke i think i may know what you are going to tell me but i ll still be amazed to know that it true james just took a deep breath and recited the password he led lily to the couch and took another deep breath before he began his explanation ok well dontfreak out but well let me start at the beginning we figured out remus secret in our third year and he told us how he would sneak into the shrieking shack every full moon well we decided that that was no fun so we set to work thinking of how we could be with remus every full moon so he wouldntbe alone but also a way that would be safe we researched for days and days about werewolves and their bites but in the end the only things we found that were virtually invincible to werewolf bites were animals at this point lily gasped you didnt yes we did james said with a huge grin we worked for almost a year on becoming animagi donttell anyone please james lily whispered do you know what that means james nodded but lily explained anyways you are breaking the law you re an unregistered animagus i know i know but it was all we could do to help remus so that means that means i did see you last night i not losing my mind after all james chuckled with relief at what lily had said you are not losing your mind i change into a stag sirius changes into a dog and peter turns into a rat that amazing how did you ever manage i guess we just all helped each other james trailed off lily let her amazement float away from her at james silence why cantit just be how it was it was so easy then the worst thing we had to deal with was peter unhappiness about turning into a rat i guess they say that just life but i guess nobody really knows where they might end up we change every day and we have to make sure we adapt to others changes too it just part of living you know yeah but it just seems so unfair this voldemort is putting fear into all of us people are petrified to do everyday things why should we let this person these people force us to live our lives in ways we dontwant to what gives them that power lily knew the answer fear it not right i know but that why we ve got to stick together we have to fight if we want to be free we ve got to win for max and mikey lily said she kneeled at james bedside with just a trace of fear in her voice masked by determination we ve just got to she added more desperately james stifled a yawn brought on by the fact that the sun was still rising come here james motioned to lily this snapped her out of her trance and she hopped up on the bed james pulled the covers back and lily got underneath them with her back against james chest as his arms encircled her in theirs safety and warmth sometimes i wish he was here i dontcare if he would be screaming that he hates me just to see him again lily shivered i know what you mean james said and after a few moments of silence where all they could hear were each other heartbeats and breathing james said i guess we just have to know that they are still with us just because we cannot see them doesntmean they leave us but it feels like it a tear slid its way out of the corner of lily eye do you think that maybe that maybe they really are still here what do you mean you know how sir nicholas and the bloody baron and professor binns are still here do you think oh lily i dont think that max and mikey are ghosts they would have chosen to go on they were great people smart kind funny they wouldnt have hung on lily stayed silent thinking about how she knew this was true but how she had selfishly wished that they had stayed behind even if it was only for a second one last goodbye it like she could hear her brother and even see him at times but every time she turned around he was no longer there it was a cruel trick her mind played on her dontworry we ll win the cup just for max and mikey james hugged her a bit tighter both lily and james fell asleep for another couple of hours until it was time to grab breakfast before the final match they walked and ate in silence each too involved with his or her thoughts to be too aware of the outside world their friends noticed their determined demeanors and left them alone at the breakfast table lily thought about the past couple of weeks how sirius and remus had both healed physically but how lydia and lara were still feeling betrayed their relationships were rocky and lily was afraid for them it even made her worry about her future with james but she knew that whatever would happen she d still have lydia and lara they were after all best friends forever lily couldntthink of a time since she d met them that they werentthere to help her as they walked to the locker room with the whole team gathered james began the usual speech this is it the one we ve all been waiting for even those who are not physically here with us today he paused thinking about everyone he knew that had left this world not only his family and lily s but also the people mentioned in the prophet who had all fallen under cruelty all of those people are with us today they are cheering us on and wanting us to do the best we can we ve got to play as a team the team we are there is no other way and i know we can do it james then smiled so let go out there and kick some slytherin arse sirius added dramatically and the entire team whooped and hollered their way onto the pitch from the beginning handshake all the way to the first goal lily eyebrows had been dropped and tensed in determination but with that first goal she smiled and shouted that one for you max since the deaths of max and mikey things on the team had obviously changed james because the third chaser to assist frank and lily a muscular sixth year named nigel harris joined sirius at beater and krista williamson a sharp and quick fifth year took the post of seeker leaving asher still at the post of keeper of course the team was not the same as it had been when both evans and both potters had played but they werentbad either sirius and nigel made a strong team and it was amazing how together james lily and frank played the three chasers whipped around the field so fast you d swear they were apparating they made the crowd dizzy they scored goal after goal after goal passing the quaffle as if it weighed half the weight of a feather if james dropped it frank was right there to catch it if james made a blind lob pass lily was there to catch it and when krista snatched the snitch right from beneath malfoy hand the crowd went crazy almost everyone was on his or her feet the team collapsed together in victory patting each other backs yelling even crying and lily knew that they could not have won without max and mikey there thank you she whispered so what do you think i know the final match came a bit early but i felt that it fit with how the story was moving everyone worked together to achieve their goal and they won yay lol but i didntspend a lot of time on the match itself since i had a match earlier in the story questions questions questions let see 1 initial response 2 favorite part 3 what do you think is going to happen between lydia and sirius and lara and remus 4 were you satisfied with lily response to learning about the marauders being animagi 5 rating 1 5 stars 6 anything else thank you so much for reviewing it really helps me to find out what my readers think and what i need to change your input helps so much thank you so much everyone your truly liane please read and review i would love to know you re honest opinion i know the real plot asntreally started but just hang on we re almost there chapter 3 rescues and realizations the train stopped and everyone began piling out firs yers this way shouted the familiar voice of hagrid the keeper of keys and grounds at hogwarts every year the first years would follow hagrid and ride in little boats across the lake no matter the weather rain sun snow sleet nothing would prevent hagrid from making that trip lily lydia and lara all grabbed their things and headed for one of the horseless carriages but just as lily was about to open the door someone grabbed the handle what do you think you re doing mudblood snarled the all too familiar voice of lucis malfoy dontmake me take points malfoy lily spit back oooo i shaking in my robes malfoy mocked do it and i ll kill you right here malfoy hissed quietly in her ear you know i could try me malfoy lily challenged you think you re such a tough guy because your daddy is a death eater well i not scared tell him that tell him that you failed to frighten a poor little muggle born girl i sure he d be very happy with you lily continued just as softly as malfoy had why you malfoy had begun with a look of disgust come on girls this carriage is being occupied by half witted blood thirsty voldemort worshipping pricks lily threw in malfoy direction just loud enough for him to hear suddenly lily screamed in pain as malfoy grabbed a fistful of her raving red hair how dare you speak his name you filthy good for nothing mudblood malfoy threatened you say you re not afraid well then you are foolish you will see when all those you love are gone and you are the only one left then you will see what afraid is lily was honestly scared not knowing what malfoy would do she could feel her eyes watering from the pain but lily being who she was tried to remain strong not letting something so small as a death threat stand in her way what be afraid of who oooh you mean be afraid of your murdering gutless so called leader voldemort lily pushed why you insolent big mouthed brat lily gasped as malfoy pulled even harder on her hair i ll just have to teach you to be afraid malfoy then raised his wand to her throat and muttered cru expelliarmus yelled a voice lily felt malfoy wand fly away from her face and took the opportunity to wrench her head out of malfoy grasp ahhh potter nice of you to join the mudblood and me for a little chat malfoy sneered call her that again and you will no longer have the ability to speak much less choose your own foul words james dared as he slammed malfoy up against the side of the carriage malfoy could see that he could do nothing without his wand so he shrugged james off and muttered mudblood lover just loud enough for james to hear incorrect james yelled vox extr expelliarmus lily yelled james just forget it you are head boy and scum like him is just not worth you time or effort just let it go it doesntbother me lily james pleaded outraged as he went to retrieve his wand he called you a a i know what he called me drop it with that lily turned on heel and walked away leaving james astounded and her friends mouths still open from the moment malfoy had grabbed lily seeing this lily grabbed her friends and walked to a carriage as far away from malfoy as possible aaahhh lily exclaimed once they were in the carriage i cant stand him walking around like he such a big shot look at me look at me lily mocked uhh it just totally disgusting dontworry about it hun no one can stand malfoy lara said ya except for slytherins lydia added you know of course they all run in the same crew all their daddies are friends you work your way up by killing it disgusting if you ask me what lily asked confused no i cantstand potter james both lara and lydia exclaimed simultaneously yes potter lily repeated but but lydia stuttered he just saved your life lara exclaimed i mean i dontknow of very many guys who would just step in there like he did you should be thanking him lily ya whatever malfoy didnteven have his wand potter only did it to look cool to look like he can live up to his title wow what a great guy lily continued sarcastically i could have handled it plus with the spell he threw at malfoy for all he knew he could have hit me i mean come on lily i dontknow how you dontsee it lydia began james potter one of the hottest guys in school and possibly on the face of the planet is completely smitten with you and you canteven see it hello is anybody home lydia continued knocking playfully on lily head geez girl wake up and smell the pepper up potion ya lily lara added can you honestly say that you hate him i mean for your sake i hope not considering you d have to spend the entire year dealing with someone you hate he really not that bad just give him a chance but i lily tried no lara exclaimed no buts what are you scared you like him are you scared he likes you whether you see it or not james potter is at your service james exclaimed as he entered the carriage talking about me again wow evans this must be a record i ve honestly never been so flattered what do you think you re doing potter lily scoffed we re all joining you there nowhere else to sit james exclaimed gleefully sitting almost on top of lily isntthis wonderful i haventseen you in like forever like what up james asked with a school girl attitude ugh you are so difficult lily shouted disgustedly as she moved herself all the way against the side of the carriage but then she saw the look on james face and felt bad ugh why does he have to look at me like that he should be the one feeling bad for me with everything he put me through ugh whatever i suppose it wouldnthurt to give in a little but only a little hey there girlies sirius shouted announcing his presence did you miss me i think you did sirius said to a giggling lydia do you mind if we sit with you remus politely asked before setting foot in the carriage remus was of course the only marauder who was ever polite ya no problem answered lara while receiving a malicious glare from lily who now sat completely squished between the wall and an extremely bouncy and loud head boy what was i thinking lily thought to herself so what everyone taking this year lara asked attempting to strike up conversation among the chaos in the small carriage lara you canthonestly be asking this question lydia pleaded you know we are all in the same classes did you go swimming over the summer and hit your head one too many times on the bottom of the pool causing you to completely lose your memory because you ve obviously lost it lydia directed at lara teasing her friend now now girls lets not have to break out the smart ass patrol let keep it calm and clean sirius scolded while motioning to keep the level down with his hands sorry black i was born a smart ass and a smart ass i shall be until bullfrogs have wings lydia shot back at him through a smirk well well what do we have here a little competition between dweedle dee and dweedle dum peter asked who can say the craziest thing before we get to hogwarts we have ms lydia savadee to my left and mr sirius black on my right it is a battle of wits ladies and gentlemen who will win nice one wormtail james congratulated his friend on his humor with a high five and after that the ride was pretty uneventful except of course for sirius and lydia revenge on peter they both acted like he had really hurt them and when he went to apologize they scared him by screaming boo as simple as it may seem it sure fooled peter and even lara but that wasntsaying much it was of course all in good fun and everyone laughed as they pulled up to the school james opened the door and motioned for lily to go through after you sweetums james cooed while batting his eyelashes at lily stuff it potter lily warned come on prongsie why did you have to start that right away the poor girl canthave a moment rest without you making some ridiculous comment sirius scolded besides dontuse sweetums you have to use things like beautiful or lovely instead of making her sound like food girls hate that but i cantfor the life of me figure out why i would want to be called a food it would be an honor i d want to be hmmm ok padfoot you keep thinking about that and the rest of us will step away from you so you can dig deep into that terrifying pit you call a brain so we dontget hurt when it explodes from being over worked james taunted alright alright sirius accepted welcoming the challenge so if my brain is a terrifying pit then yours must be a sirius thought see see what i mean lily beautiful we better get away from that guy he a ticking time bomb i tell you james continued the joke as he shielded lily from sirius honestly potter if you keep this up i swear on my life i will you ll do what ms evans lily slowly looked up to see professor dumbledore staring inquisitively at her with a slight smile dumbledore was a tall lanky man with a silvery beard which touched his mid stomach he had radiant crystal blue eyes that held a certain authority to them but yet a certain constant joy dumbledore often reminded lily of a little boy stuck in an older man body for dumbledore was amused by the small joys in life but then again being their headmaster maybe that was a really good thing or you ll do what exactly ms evans dumbledore repeated this time with a slightly larger smile on his face oh uh nothing professor lily replied extremely embarrassed in fact she was so embarrassed that she could feel her face heating up alright then ms evans mr potter i shall need to see you immediately after the feast in my office do not go to your common room but come straight to my office the password is dumbledore leaned in close so only the two of them could hear pepper imps mr potter i trust you know where the entrance is now go on to dinner and hand these out to the prefects dumbledore handed both lily and james a small stack of mini parchments they stood there afraid to move off to dinner we shall go the feast of course will be well worth the wait i really looking forward to the steak and kidney bean pie let move then dumbledore exclaimed as he turned on his heel for the great hall calling hup two three four hup two three four all the way down the corridor hey everyone i know it been honestly forever since i ve posted but i ve been more busy with school work rehearsal homework and practice than i could possibly tell you i apologize profusely from the bottom of my heart for keeping you all waiting i really honestly do appreciate all of the reviews and readers you all make me so happy i not kidding so i apologize sincerely to each and every one of you for leaving you hanging i finally got some time over my spring break to write and i recently found some music that i had used to write to in summer that has helped immensly so i hope you all like this chapter i think it a good length not as long as my longest but definitely not as short as my shortest you all are amazing and i really hope you like this next chapter dontforget in the last chapter remus had gotten a bit out of control and ended up in the putting sirius in the hospital wing beside him lydia got mad at lily for not telling her but they fixed it and apologized to one another lydia and lara never found out what it was that put their boyfriends in the infirmary also the gryffindors won the quidditch cup beating out the slytherins of course and dontforget this is the story with keri lily cousin who died when they were younger as a result of a failed prank now please sit back and enjoy nitwit blubber oddment tweak albus dumbledore chapter 30 is love enough with the excitement of winning the quidditch cup neither lily nor james had much time to think about their parents even a whole week later fellow gryffindors would congratulate them with pats on their backs smiles and frequent praises of way to show the slytherins their place though this was a great distraction in ways it was also very dangerous lily lara tapped lily on the shoulder the two were doing their homework in the noisy gryffindor common room as lydia was off with sirius when lara could not hold it in any longer lily she said a bit more desperately yeah sorry what is it lara lily turned away from the group of small first year girls who had been asking her for the tenth time that hour about the match i need some advice lara twisted her hands nervously unsure of what to say alright i listening lily gave her attention to her troubled friend it about remus lara whispered lily tried not to let her own nervousness show what is it well it about something he said to me you know how he been keeping secrets from me you know i can t i know i not asking you to tell me anything lara glanced around to make sure no one was listening actually he told me what it was last night lily gasped in surprise with her eyebrows raised she asked so you know that he a werewolf yes lara whispered so i dontknow lara looked as if she might cry her bright blue eyes sparkled with tears it ok lily wrapped her arms around her friend protectively lara took a deep breath as she let lily hug her he told me and i just i lily i ran like i was afraid of him lara spoke lightly but with so much disgust in herself that lily felt her eyes moisten it ok to be afraid this isnta normal or an easy thing to deal with lily tried to comfort her but i ran lara whispered i couldnteven look at him today shhh it going to be all right it ok to be afraid lily i love him i dontwant to be afraid it all just happened so fast and i was running before i even had thought about it i just heard the word and dontworry you ll work through it remus is a great guy lily offered i know but i wouldntforgive me for that remus is very understanding i sure if you talk to him about it the two of you will be able to work it out you re two of the kindest and most thoughtful people i know lily released lara from her protective hold and faced her as she wiped a tear from lara eye she said i dontknow two better people to be together than the two of you if you two dontdeserve it no one does lily offered a smile thank you lily you re such a great friend lara hugged lily then went in search of remus lily gathered her things as well as lara s and after putting lara things in her room lily set off to find james as she walked to the head dormitory she heard a faintly familiar voice saying are you sure you dontwant to i mean the two of us together could lily just the person i ve been looking for well i ll see you later umm ruth is it it rachel the girl said lily recognized her now rachel peters a not so nice hufflepuff who happened to have been pursuing sirius since their first year right er sorry good bye roseanne sirius waved to the wall as he was already on his way toward lily flicking her hair and giving lily a glare rachel peters disappeared around a corner that girl follows me and corners me more than any other it getting to the point where i frightened sirius shivered lily laughed oh sirius you re off your trolley now what that supposed to mean well i mean i know what it means but why would you say such an absurd comment as that because it true she laughed again where are you headed i was going to your place to see if james was there well you re in luck that just where i was headed lily smiled and they began walking i have a question for you sirius said alright what is it lily smiled as sirius seemed more nervous than his trademark cool calm collected self how do you get lydia to stop freaking out about small things lily almost laughed but she realized quickly that it took a lot for sirius to ask her something this personal i dontthink there really is a way i mean i ve tried to get her to see that she being irrational about a lot of things but it just her temperament and i ve just learned to deal with it but you ve been able to calm her down before sirius prompted well i guess i just honest with her sometimes i have to be a bit more in her face but only if she being particularly stubborn lily gave him a reassuring smile dontworry about it i sure she is just stressed with school and such yeah sirius trailed off hum dingers lily greeted sir and lady zanath i thought it was sweet tarts it used to be but our password changes like everyone else for class after winter holiday oh yeah that right sirius said he seemed absent minded and off in his own world to lily she silently hoped that he would be all right especially with all that had happened lately remus attack quarrelling with lydia and quidditch she was unsure about more things in her life now than she ever had been hey james lily waved and smiled hello james said as he looked up from some parchment on the table lily is it alright if i talk to james alone for a moment of course she smiled i just going to be up in my room she noted james confused look before she ascended the stairs throwing her bag upon her bed lily thought it was time it had been a while since it happened and her she had gotten to the point where she could think about it without crying with her mind set a quill and a hair tie that she had transfigured into a bottle of ink she retrieved her diary from the depths of her bedside table taking a deep breath she laid on her bed and began writing dear diary i know it has been a while but so much has happened as you probably know since you re not real my parents and max were killed by voldemort at first i couldntbelieve it it just seemed too extreme to possibly be true but it is i all right now but i just dread the day when i have to go back into our house i know it didnthappen there but i dontknow if i can do it it already feels like they are here with me i cantimagine what it going to feel like when i go back where they all where we all actually lived james has it even worse than i do i mean even though petunia hates me she still alive james has no one and it happened in his house because of the damage the ministry cleaned it all up already so he wont have to go through it but i just cantbelieve any of this has happened all i know right now is that for as long as i live i going to do my best to stop this evil it not right that voldemort can make people feel unsafe in their own homes or that he can find and get anything he wants or needs with simple flicks of his wand and the detachment to use the unforgivables as if they were nothing more than first year spells and even using those who are gone as more of his followers inferi they are called it sick and i hate to think that children much younger than i are being left without parents or family of any kind it not right and i going to try to stop it i think i owe it to my family what do you think love lily carefully lily slid her diary back into its drawer changed the ink back into her hair tie and placed her quill on her desk as she was pulling her hair back into a ponytail there was knock on her door come in she shouted as she was in her bathroom hello james how are you alright sirius is worried about lydia i figured it was something like that lily offered a half smile i just dontknow what to tell him james exhaled as he plopped down on her bed lily giggled at the picture james was sideways on the bed flat on his back with his arms out she went to the bed and sat by his head what exactly is going on between them i mean sirius just asked me how i calm her down but he didntsay what the problem was well i guess ever since what happened with remus she been really tense and freaking out at him a lot sounds like lydia lily shook her head yeah james looked unsure but well you know sirius he doesntdo well with that she yells at him and he yells back he tries not to but he canthelp it i guess well what does she yell at him for i guess a bunch of stupid things things like homework being late rachel peters and silly things like that sirius is a great guy but thanks to his family he got a temper i mean he not physical or anything but he does yell sometimes how does she react lily asked concerned i guess she just yells right back at him and they end up leaving each other angry he getting fed up with it i ll have to talk to lydia about it i dontknow where she is though lily thought you know i haventseen her all day huh i dontknow what to tell him me neither but you know what i do know what lily asked i love you he said as he tickled her lara lily asked as she james lara and sirius ate dinner together yeah lara replied absentmindedly have you see lydia at all today lara looked at lily with a scared look on her face yes where has she been sirius asked this time she doesntfeel well i actually supposed to bring her back some soup i need to talk to her lily and sirius replied in unison lara looked unsure of what to say dontworry about it lara i ll just talk to her later lily said sensing her friend uncertainty but i have any of you seen remus lara cut sirius off lily gave lara a prompting look signaling that she should know where remus was he in the infirmary oh that right lara sighed i really wanted to talk to him about it james and sirius realized that this was none of their business so they began their own conversation dontworry you ll be able to talk to him about it in a few days lily said i really want him to know that i dontcare though he going to have to transform thinking that i dontlove him because of what he is tears slid down lara face he knows you really love him i sure he does i need to see him though i want to be there when he transforms so that i can show him that i love him so that i can no lily cut in firmly lara i know it important to you for him to know that you love him but it is extremely dangerous anything could happen it wontbe but a few days before he completely himself again lily lara smiled you dontget it he ll know it me i know he will i love him i want to show him that lara you re not going lily stated finally yes i am you re not my mother lily lara stood up and left the table for her room lily sat there hopeless if she had to knock lara out she would lara was not going to see remus and that was that what was that all about james asked as he and sirius faced her again lara wants to be there when it happens lily replied absolutely not james said are you kidding sirius asked i told her that she couldn t but she insists that he ll know it her lily replied solemnly after assuring james that she wouldntlet lara get the chance to even go after them lily grabbed a blanket a pillow and the essentials for a girl night make up and food she knocked on the door and heard a come in she wasntsure what she was expecting but whatever it was it wasntwhat she saw lydia or the lump she assumed was lydia lie still in her bed lara was sitting on her bed doing homework neither looked up as she entered good evening ladies lily greeted trying to hide her uncertainty lara looked up what are you doing here well dontact so happy lily tried to laugh it off i thought we could have a girl night she responded as she held up her gear or you thought you d come check on me to make sure i wasntdoing anything i shouldntbe doing lara replied haughtily gosh lara i sorry you feel that way lily replied honest hurt in her voice just leave alright lara you cant do this you dontknow what could happen lily pleaded i know what it feels like to no you don t lily you have no idea what i going through or what it feels like your relationship with james is perfect lara said with angry tears running down her face head boy and head girl smart good looking healthy you have no idea what it like to know that the one you love is forced to endure excruciating pain every month that he has this whole other side that could very well kill you to know that while you ve been living in a fairytale he been scared to share his real self with you then when he finally does you get scared and prove his thought that he can never be accepted be normal be loved lara trailed off lara i sorry i just dontwant you to get hurt either and besides she thought we re healthy yeah but we both just lost our families isntthat important but she didntsay it she didntwant lara to think she didntcare well it too late to change my mind lara grabbed her cloak and flew out the door lily had no other choice but to follow her she flung her things onto lara bed and took off at a run after one of her closest and best friends lara stop lily yelled as she ran through the common room but lara didnt even look back lily followed her through the corridors trying to keep from looking suspicious to others passing by lara came to the entrance hall and went right through the main doors without breaking her stride the last fading rays of sun set lara hair on fire as it swished behind her lily looked ahead dash it she thought as she saw three animals ahead going through what looked like a hole in the huge whomping willow lara followed the trio right through the tree into a tunnel lara lily pleaded please dontdo this it will be fine lara shouted over her back dontworry about me go back lily her cries echoed bouncing eerily in the tunnel haunting and chilling lily no lara lily ran faster as lara disappeared through the ceiling where are we lara lily continued following the path blindly a small incline came ahead and suddenly she found herself in the room of what looked like a very rundown and old house lara lily called though this time with less anger and more uncertainty she took a moment to take in her surroundings the place looked like it had endured a massive hostility what furniture adored the room was broken slashed torn and strewn about to resemble a wrecked ship suddenly she heard the clunk of a closing door off to her left and she was back to the chase to keep one of her best friends from making a dangerous and terrible mistake for lily was afraid that not only might lara get physically injured but emotionally as well lily knew enough about werewolf transformation to know that when the person transforms their mind can take on an even more dramatic change than their body remus would not know lara he would not even know himself as she got closer to the door lily saw a figure through the window and sped up knowing she was on the right track a swish of blonde hair in the bright moonlight sent lily sprinting through trees she didntwant to yell just in case the boys were close by there was no use in attracting att remus i need to talk to you lara screamed lara lily whispered frantically what are you doing stop yelling i told you to go back lily i need to talk to but a chilling howl passed through the trees drowning out lara last words remus is that you lily grabbed lara and put her hand over her friend mouth lara struggled against lily hold but the fiery redhead kept her hold until a pain shot through lily arm as sharp as electricity ow lily gasped remus lara now sobbed she readied to yell again when a large black dog looking amazingly like a grim bounded at her knocking her over it licked her face lily thought to keep lara from yelling anymore a sharp yip drew lily attention from lara to a clearing in the woods not too far from where they were where she could see two large forms locked in some sort of battle james and remus lily help me lara muffled cry come from beneath the large black furry mass that lily recognized as sirius lara lily began quietly and cautiously we need to leave right now alright sirius suddenly leapt off lara and headed back to where james and remus were fighting why i not leaving without talking to remus i not going until i see him lara picked herself up from the ground ignoring lily outstretched hand lily pursued she grabbed lara arm tight dontmake me use magic on you i dontwant to hurt you lara lily replied with sorrow riddling her voice expeliarmus lara acted before lily even had time to process what was happening but the force of the spell sent lily wand soaring from her hand and sent her body into the nearest tree lara ran ahead a deer paused at the sound just long enough to let a wolf charge past him lily tried to yell but the force of hitting the tree had knocked the wind from her she could only slowly pick herself up and watch as lara and remus ran to each other wishing with all her might lily tried to will lara to stop she tried to make her see that it wasntremus that the wolf coming straight at her felt nothing for her aside from the fact that she may make a great midnight snack and just when lily thought the worst the most amazing thing happened both lara and remus stopped they studied each other for several moments the moonlight making lara beautiful hair sparkle in the night lily breathed a sigh of relief all was peaceful for those several moments then a snarl broke through the sheet of silence like a knife it sent lara running for her life away from the animal before her lara lily screamed to her friend her eyes watering with pain but lara didnt hear her so lily chased after them she knew it was stupid but if she could just hit someone with a spell her mind raced as fast as her legs lily heard remus running in front of her and lara gasping for breath in front of him and now behind her she heard the sounds of two forms racing behind her then it all happened so quickly lily mind had no time to process it remus was gaining on lara lara looked back to see how close remus was and then all of a sudden she wasntthere remus stopped lily stopped but james and sirius kept going and tackled remus lily ran forward to see where lara had gone as she came upon the place she had seen lara disappear she found herself at the top of a steep hill she hadnt even known was there had she not stopped she would have rolled right down it lara lily shouted for her friend to reveal herself and that it was all right to come out now la lily eye had caught a glint of gold her eyes were drawn to the bottom of the hill lara lara running down the hill wasnteasy but somehow lily managed to stay back on her heels enough to get down the hill through stumbles shouts and tears lara lily knelt beside her friend the tears came more freely as lily saw the blood beginning to soak the ground where her friend body lay like scarlet rain puddles after a relentless storm lily salty tears added to the storm lara lily gently shook her friend shoulders lara wake up lara head slumped to the other side in response lily cradled lara head in her arms stroking her crimson stained hair you cantleave me too i need you you cantleave me lily collapsed resting her forehead on lara s trying to pull herself together lily did her best to quiet herself and listen for lara breathing she couldnthear it the sickening crack and thud of keri body looped in lily mind as she thought the worst no lara you cantleave me too she sobbed i need you she whispered i know i know but please tell me anyways i dontfeel this was my best chapter as i haventwritten in a long time but i hope it satisfies you all i pretty happy with it i promise though that

hall in dumbledore wake what going on i cantget in trouble first day back to school and potter already gets me in trouble ooooh i feel sick lily thought to herself james could tell that lily was afraid so he didntsay anything to her he was afraid to be on the wrong side of her malice yet another time today so they walked in silence to the great hall until the buzzing of excited students reached their ears and grew louder with each step without a word to each other lily and james began passing out the pieces of parchment dumbledore had just handed them to each prefect the parchment contained the password of the house the prefect belonged to lily and james wanted to hand them out while everyone was still getting settled so that not everyone would be staring at them as soon as they were finished dumbledore voice arose above the noise welcome welcome he began welcome to yet another year at hogwarts please stay seated as the sorting takes place then i promise we will eat as i know all of you are as anxious as i am at the very end of his sentence the first years made their first voyage into the great hall accompanied by hagrid all of them looked very scared little girls were nervously chatting with their friends and little boys were trying to look confident but failing come come dontbe shy dumbledore encouraged we dontbite well hard anyway dumbledore joked but as soon as he saw the horrified looks that had just come across the first years faces dumbledore hurriedly covered it was a joke only joking i promise he stated with a chuckle after about half an hour of sorting the first years dumbledore stood up and finally announced i have two words for you tuck in with that countless platters of hogwarts fine cooking appeared on the house tables there was just about everything one could think of the marauders ate so much that the plates which were unfortunately right in front of them and within their arms length had to keep refilling themselves every few minutes between just sirius and james anyone could have seen every single entr e ever served at hogwarts chicken steak soup pasta grilled cheese pies puddings potatoes and every other thing ever served those two could supply a small third world country with all the food they ate finally after about five minutes of the marauders being the only ones left still eating dumbledore called for silence again i would just like to make a few announcements before we adjourn for the night first years and a couple of our older students dumbledore eyes flashed in the direction of the marauders please note that the forbidden forest is out of bounds unless of course one is looking for trouble dumbledore allowed for a little chatter to break out about the forest but then motioned for quiet again prefects you now have your passwords please guide the younger students safely to your house dormitories remember your patrolling duties as well dumbledore reminded and now let us all stand and join in the traditional school song dumbledore flicked his wand and a thin ribbon flew out and twisted itself to reveal the lyrics to the song everyone join in with your favorite tune and sing at the top of your lungs hogwarts hogwarts hoggy warty hogwarts teach us something please whether we be old and bald or young with scabby knees our heads could do with filling with some interesting stuff for they ve bare and full of air dead flies and bits of fluff so teach us things worth knowing bring back what we ve forgot just do your best we ll do the rest and learn until our brains all rot a n song from harry potter and the sorcerer stone not one person in the whole hall finished at the same time dumbledore gleefully conducted until the marauders finished their singing to the death day tune dragging the tempo slower and slower shouting the words as loud and as long as they could as soon as they had finished and everyone stopped laughing including the headmaster himself dumbledore concluded now let all have one last big sleep before we must begin our studies check the board in your common rooms daily for important announcements have fun and sleep tight dontlet the bed bugs bite yelled the marauders causing everyone but the slytherins to laugh one last time before following their house prefects to their rooms lily should we go now james asked huh lily was momentarily confused oh oh yeah one second lily turned to lara and lydia not knowing if she d see them later tonight or if they d be asleep already my fellow l adies lily started with a giggle i have to go meet with professor dumbledore so dontwait up for me i not sure how long it will take and i ve also got patrolling duty lily sighed ok well go get em lily lydia exclaimed to her friend with a big hug ya i guess we ll see you tomorrow have fun with lara pointed over to james who had been also saying good bye to his friends riiiiiight lily said sarcastically good night girls night lily they both exclaimed as they turned and left lily there to wait for james james said his final goodbyes to his fellow marauders and walked over to lily ready to go m lady james asked offering her his arm lily then went for his arm as if to take it but elbowed him in the ribs and whispered in your dreams which to james surprise she said with a smile oh he loved how her eyes lit up every time she smiled and he was thankful for every single time he got to see her smile considering when he was usually around her she would yell at him you are so beautiful lily evans james whispered to himself but unfortunately for him he didntwhisper it quite as quietly as he intended and lily heard him as lily wheeled around at him he thought oh shit here it comes ya whatever potter you are such a ham lily chortled shaking her head and rolling her eyes at him wow i was expecting her to scream at me james thought to himself as he followed his love james had loved lily evans since the very first time he saw her on platform nine and three quarters she had looked very scared and like she didntknow what to do so james being the daring person he was began walking up to her as he approached her malfoy had walked past and deliberately run into her knocking everything out of her hands but when she looked up she saw james standing there he ll never forget that face she looked so lost so alone james helped lily pick up her things and then without a word he turned and walked away james always thought that if he had just said something that things would be different but he had been too shy too scared and in complete awe of her lily also looked back on that day she had a tendency to look back at their first encounter every time she felt herself beginning to feel anything less than complete dislike for james potter lily had been a first year and she was completely overwhelmed with the whole magic thing as she looked up at the train that was to take her to her new school someone knocked into her and made everything she had been carrying fly out of her hands when lily looked up she saw that it was a boy with messy brown hair and glasses surprisingly he helped her pick her things up but then he walked away without even saying sorry lily was brought up to always be polite and he was the rudest boy she had ever met she then had a horrible attitude towards him from then on before either of them realized where they were james motioned for lily to stop pepper imps james shouted at a stone gargoyle to lily complete surprise the gargoyle came to life and jumped sideways along the wall to reveal a hidden staircase james motioned her ahead and lily walked up the spiraling stair case at the top there was a beautiful oak door with a gold plaque in the center with headmaster albus dumbledore engraved in loopy script lily reached for the doorknob but the door opened slightly before she even touched the handle as if it knew she was coming james watched and chuckled at her reaction she had obviously never been up here before but james knew this place like he knew lily face he had been up here so many times before from being in trouble yes james had spent countless times in here worrying about being expelled but then of course getting off the hook dontbe shy dumbledore called to them come in come in he encouraged lily pushed the door open the rest of the way and gasped it was the most beautiful place lily had ever seen there was a ceiling arched up like a dome with a circular window in the middle there were tables and shelves with odd looking silver objects there was a stone basin with rune looking symbols on it a phoenix was sitting on a perch close to dumbledore desk there was a fire place and many books scattered around the room but the most striking of all the objects in the room were the pictures on the walls each picture had a name and a date at the bottom of it they were all pictures of past headmasters and headmistresses who all started gossiping excitedly as lily and james entered the room oh look it the potter boy again a particularly proper looking witch said yes first day of school and he already in trouble chuckled the witch friend quite so but who is the girl asked a very old looking wizard ok you can all be quiet now or i shall have to move you next to sir codagan picture dumbledore jokingly threatened all the pictures silenced themselves at once except for the one right behind dumbledore desk you wouldntdo that headmaster the picture sneered oh really phineas dumbledore asked alright fine said the picture the wizard in this picture looked slightly familiar he had jet black hair and he looked evil lily read the words at the bottom of the picture phineas nigellus now ms evans mr potter dumbledore interrupted lily thoughts as he motioned for them to take a seat in front of him i suppose you are wondering why i called you here dumbledore began both lily and james shook their heads yes dumbledore proceeded i have called you here to discuss your living quarters as you know voldemort is rising fast and is becoming very powerful neither lily nor james spoke it is customary for the head boy and girl to help the teachers and myself if any trouble breaks out are you saying there trouble here sir lily asked worriedly no ms evans not yet dumbledore said with a sort of sad smile but because of this threat the staff and i feel that the head boy and girl need to be close enough to contact within seconds if there is ever any trouble we wish we wouldnthave to do this but with the attacks increasing and voldemort rising we feel it is necessary for security therefore in order to increase security yet to provide each of you with your privacy we have decided that beginning this year and ending as soon as voldemort is conquered the head boy and girl will have their own small dorm but but lily stuttered in disbelief while james was trying very hard not to let his excitement show is this for real i seriously going to spend the whole year living with lily evans this is too good to be true james thought to himself i sorry ms evans but the decision is final there will be a small common room for the two of you to share you will each of course have your own bedroom and your own small bathroom in the event of an attack there will be a short passageway from your living quarters to my office it can be used at anytime if there is ever an emergency dumbledore advised professor are you sure about this i mean lily tried again ms evans i trust that you and mr potter are mature enough to handle this situation i promise it is nothing against either of you and it is not intended as a punishment but it is a precaution for the school as a whole dumbledore continued as he rose from his seat the entrance to your dorm is just in fact one story above from my office in the picture of lady and sir zanath lady zanath has curly red hair and is wearing a green ball gown and sir zanath has dark brown hair and is holding his wand i sure you will have no trouble finding it dumbledore said with a look at james professor what is the password james asked oh right i almost forgot the password is sweettarts dumbledore smiled seeing the amused face of lily turn to him yes i know they are a muggle candy which i have grown quite fond of really dumbledore then motioned them to stand up well i trust you both are tired and need your rest first day of classes tomorrow i wouldntwant you to fall asleep off you go then good night professor lily and james said at the same time mr potter ms evans good night dumbledore replied as lily and james exited the room lily in overall horror and james in secret satisfaction it only takes a little time to review please do i really want to hear what you all think of this story thank you to those who have reviewed i luv you all please tell others about my story even if you dontlike it so far i still want to see what you all think thank you all for your time if you want me to read any of your stories i would be glad to as well peace out all and thank you liane chapter 5 understanding the past after a couple of minutes walking in silence with james leading the way lily asked what on earth were they thinking have they completely lost their minds whoa there lils i think they know if it will present more harm than good i mean dumbledore is one of the smartest people alive and one of the best wizards ever to have lived james reasoned i think we can and should trust his judgment dontyou ah i wow james lily finally said i think that the most intelligent thing i ve ever heard you say lily truthfully admitted i suppose we should trust him but it doesntmake me happy with his decision he probably laughed when he knew we would be head girl and boy i mean it not exactly a secret that we cant stand each other lily smirked james sighed wrong again lily it you that cant stand me but i get along with you just fine in fact i think you are intelligent beautiful and great company i cantthink of anyone else that i would rather have as head with me james grinned triumphantly then looked up and was surprised to see lily blushing potter you really need to stop with all the lies it not healthy for a person to constantly be so untruthful lily shot back with a sarcastic air attempting to cover up that she was just a little bit flattered by him really i surprised you haventdropped over dead with all those secrets you keep inside and all of your real feelings you cover up oh lily when will you learn the only stroke of untruthfulness i have in me is whenever i pull a prank james truthfully explained other than that i tell people what i honestly think of them he finished with a smile unless of course the prank is that you pretend to tell someone what you think of them to only make them feel like a fool in the end right lily craftily retorted see what i mean you can never tell if you re telling the truth of just pulling another prank i ah well james stuttered realizing for once where lily was coming from i guess i hadntthought about that but even though you wontbelieve me what i say about you is how i truly feel sweettarts james spoke the password in front of the picture of lady and sir zanath lily rolled her eyes and said ok potter whatever i sorry but i not falling for it but i telling the truth james quietly pleaded with himself as they both walked into their living quarters they saw a sheet of parchment on the small table in the middle of the room there were two small loveseats which were perpendicular to each other one right in front of the fire and one on the left there were also two squashy armchairs on the right there was a table with two chairs behind the couch where the piece of parchment was dumbledore says that the passage to his office is just over there behind that bookcase all you have to do is say james began and then stopped say what lily asked wanting him to just spit it out so she could go take a quick shower before they had to patrol come on spit it out already djibouti james exclaimed in disbelief then he lapsed into uncontrollable laughter ja booty wow i didntthink dumbledore would choose anything that had to do with booty james cried oh goodness you are so immature lily shook her head one it djibouti not ja booty and two it the name of a country and has nothing to do with booty lily shouted over james out of control laughter lily just rolled her eyes and proceeded up to her bedroom as she climbed the stairs she heard james yell you said booty through his fits of laughter lily saw that her door was to the left at the top of the staircase it was a beautiful mahogany door with a silver plaque which resembled the one dumbledore had on his door except that lily said head girl lily evans lily opened the door and was surprised by the room unlike the usual dorm rooms this room looked like it had been personalized just for her lily evans the walls were a soft apple green and the bed was covered in forest green sheets with white embroidered flowers along the edges it was still a four poster canopy bed with hangings around it but it was a full sized bed green was lily favorite color lily saw that her things had been brought up to her room as usual but her owl scarlett was in her cage on a small perch near her nightstand lily went over and let her owl out then went and opened the window with a short affectionate nip scarlett flew out the window to the owlery watcha doin james surprised lily oooooh cool room cool bed james then to lily absolute horror ran and jumped onto lily bed then being careful not to hit his head on the canopy james began jumping on lily bed wow i gonna invite sirius in here just so we can jump on your bed this is loads of fun you should try it james called to lily potter get off my bed lily screamed and what do you think you re doing in my room get out lily ranted james who looked like christmas had been canceled bowed his head hopped off the bed and made his way to his own room then he turned stuck his tongue out at lily and bolted into his room to avoid a pillow being thrown at his head about twenty minutes later lily came down the stairs finally showered and sat on the couch with a book intending to wait for james but finding that he was already there ready to go love james asked who are you talking to lily asked innocently you of course james answered cheerfully who it cantbe me because i not your love lily replied then again there no one else in this room so you must be talking to yourself ouch evans i do not have conversations with myself james announced yes you do no i don t yes you do no i don t james fought with himself lily couldnthelp but giggle at james utter stupidity and began walking out of the room are you both coming lily shouted back at james who was still arguing with himself james looked at her flashed her his million galleon smile and chased her out of the portrait hole into the deserted corridor evans can i ask you a question and you ll answer honestly sure there you go you answered a question and i answered honestly lily replied as she grinned they were now roaming the corridors on the second floor making sure that no students were out of bed and that all was well within the school ha ha very funny james cracked sarcastically seriously will you answer the question i have after this one james inquired her again this time watching the wording of his questions carefully yes of course depending upon the nature of the question lily teased ok james braced himself why have you never given me a chance i mean even since first year it as if you never liked me as if you hated me right away i just wanted to know what it was that i did that caused you to hate me so much james asked truthfully oh i well lily was not expecting this question or anything like it for that matter she couldntthink of a good excuse so she told him her only other option the truth you really want to know the truth potter lily asked and james shook his head yes ok well it was my first day alone in the magic world and i was in the train station when all of a sudden you ran right into me lily was caught up in the moment and didntnotice james face of disbelief sure you came and helped me up but you didnteven say sorry i guess from that day on i just labeled you as selfish which by the way you are by now james was laughing out loud unable to control his reaction you th thought ha ha ha oh james shouted in the midst of his laughter i beg your pardon i did what i know it stupid but i was brought up to be polite and say sorry and please and thank you what is so damn funny lily demanded oh james gasped as he tried to calm his laughter sorry it just that you thought i knocked you over oh man james said with the entrails of his laughter still dying off oh lily i didntknock you over very funny then if you didntwho did lily challenged it was malfoy i saw him do it i saw you and i was wondering how best to approach you when i saw malfoy completely knock you over james began to explain so then i ran over to you and saw you look up and helped you pick your things up oh man i wanted to say something or ask if you were alright but i was too shy and didntknow what to say so i just walked away james admitted at the end lily was completely shell shocked this has got to be a mistake are you sure you re not confusing me with someone else lily asked desperately i mean come on he got to be confusing me with someone else if not i would feel so bad lily thought to herself no i sure there no mistake james concluded so you mean to tell me that the reason you hate me is actually no reason whatsoever james ventured well no i mean you re still mean you you re still an egotistical prat lily screamed completely flustered and trying to convince herself of his guilt it was a good thing that by this time they were back in front of the picture of lady and sir zanath because if lily had to endure potter for one more second she thought she might just explode lily it ok i wonthold it against you james tried to comfort her for she looked like she was sick or terrified sweettarts james said to the portrait look lily it ok it a mistake anyone could make james continued walking over to her it o no potter it not ok lily burst just just leave me alone with that lily ran up the stairs and slammed the door to her bedroom plopped onto her bed and took out her journal leaving a stunned and confused james potter in her wake september 1st do you ever feel like you have your whole life figured out but then someone does or says just one single thing and it turns your whole world completely upside down why do these things always seem to happen to me one moment i am completely happy believing that i hate james potter and the next i feel like i ve done him a terrible injustice by hating him i mean first impressions stick with people for almost eternity so what do you do when you find out that someone first impression was a mistake on your part do you apologize to them do you become their friend what i cantfigure out if i actually think he a jerk or if i just thought that because i began thinking he was a jerk i feel like such an ass for being so unnecessarily cruel to him but then i think of all the times he pulled pranks on others how many times he cursed people even if they did call me names i mean i donteven know what to think anymore i dontthink i can even face him without losing it so do i ignore him what i guess there was always this little part of me that wished he would change that wished he would have just said sorry that day but i always shut it out because i knew i could not go back and change the past but now that the past is changed what do i do do i listen to the part that wants to think he is still a prat or do i listen to the part that tells me he different and that if anyone should be mad he should be mad at me people say to follow your heart but what if you can no longer figure out the difference between what your heart is saying and what your mind is saying what if you canttell the difference what do i do help i dontknow what i should do yours always lily lily then put her journal in the top drawer of her nightstand and began hanging her robes up in the small closet by the door after she had put her things away and placed the picture of her parents on the nightstand lily changed into a pair of comfy black fleece pants and a red cotton tank top and went to brush her teeth lily then heard a knock on her door she quickly finished brushing her teeth and walked over to the door on the other side of the door was james he was holding a toothbrush and was wearing red flannel pajama pants and no shirt wow look at those abs lily thought to herself what the hell am i thinking lily chill out you cantlose it just yet chill out ok ok i good pull your eyes up to his face do it now uh lily james asked looking at her as if she were about to fall over ya sorry i just kinda tired lily lied ok well i was wondering if you had some toothpaste i could borrow i kinda forgot to pack mine james said squinting his face sorry to bother you no no it ok ya i have some in the bathroom come on in lily said motioning for him to follow her james gingerly stepped into her room not knowing if she would turn around and start yelling at him again wow your room is way different than mine i ve got red walls that actually sort of match the color of your hair ah ha that it that where i saw that color before it matches lily hair opps and i just said that out loud to her james thought to himself well here the toothpaste take as much as you need lily said handing james the toothpaste thanks lils you re a lifesaver james exclaimed putting some toothpaste on his toothbrush and giving it back as he walked back towards his room james noticed the picture of lily parents on the nightstand by her bed hey lils are these your parents james couldnthelp asking ya that mom and dad lily responded wow you and your mom look so much alike i ve never seen your parents before you d think that since our brothers are such good friends that i would have seen them james chuckled realizing the irony but lily i think your picture is broken what oh no did the glass break in my trunk lily worried i dontsee anything wrong with it lily concluded well cantyou see your parents they arentmoving or anything it like they re just stuck there james exclaimed as if it were unheard of lily couldnthelp but laugh silly my parents are muggles we donthave pictures that move i sure you learned that in muggles studies dontyou remember umm no eh maybe i fell asleep that day or something no matter james shrugged james was too focused on lily and her smile to actually remember if he had learned that her smile obviously made her feel better but it was nothing to the elation james felt when she smiled when lily smiled it was as if the whole world blinked out and only lily was left just lily evans smiling and james potter totally stunned anyways lily shook her head with an eye roll and smiled come to think of it i dontthink i ve ever seen your parents either lily thought out loud well i think i have a picture of them in my room if you want to see james asked setting down the picture and making sure not to get toothpaste on it sure why not lily ventured wanting to pull james away from where her journal was lily then followed james into his bedroom and had to double take when she saw the color of his walls wow he wasntkidding when he said they were almost the same color as my hair i think they are the exact same color lily thought james bent over his bag and pulled out a small photo album here you go you can look at that i just going to go brush my teeth before my toothpaste falls off lily took the album and sat on james bed turning from one page to the next wow he really looks like his dad the crazy hair must be hereditary lily chuckled to herself oh his mom is so pretty her hair is just like mom except it black just then james sat right next to lily on his bed looking over her shoulder at the pictures that one was taken when my parents went to the ministry of magic in america i was in fifth year at the time ugh they left us with our crazy neighbor james recalled shaking his head lily continued flipping through the pictures and noticed that sirius was in a lot of them you and sirius must be real good friends he in like almost all of the pictures lily giggled she so cute when she giggles i wish she knew huh sorry i was zoned out james said completely embarrassed as he was jerked out of his thoughts with a nudge from lily i said that sirius is in almost as many pictures as you are lily repeated through giggles oh ya he basically lives with us because he hates his family james explained his family is really into dark magic and sirius well sirius obviously isn t when his parents found out he was put in gryffindor it pretty much finalized their disownment of him that awful i never knew that lily said surprised then she continued looking at a particularly funny picture of james dad holding him upside down umm lily james began lily lifted her head to let him know she was listening it almost 2 30am maybe we should get some sleep james informed her though partially resenting that he did wishing that he could just stare at her observing the pictures just watching her face and her reactions really lily exclaimed wow where did all the time go well i guess i ll see you tomorrow lily said as she handed james the album james followed her to the door and when lily reached her own door she turned and said good night james with a genuine smile on her face good night lily james responded sweet dreams james added as he watched her close her door he then whispered see you in my dreams love and gently closed his own door hey there to anyone who reads this keep those review coming and i ll keep

i just wanted to let you know that there about half an hour left in breakfast james informed her what lily jumped out of bed oh geez thanks lily said a little more calmly as she began to shoo him out the door i ve gotta get dressed she then snapped the door shut and put on some pants a shirt and her robes over that grabbed her wand and bag touched up her sparkly green eye shadow thin eyeliner and mascara and sprinted down to breakfast lily spotted lydia and lara near the marauders and plopped down across from them hey girls lily hastily greeted them hey lily lara began why are you so late you ve only got like five minutes before we need to start walking lily slow down before you hurt yourself or someone else lydia exclaimed giggling you do know that you can carry some of that food with you in your hands dontyou lily couldntrespond because the multiple pieces of dried toast were restricting the movement of her mouth lydia laughed at her here your schedule but we have pretty much the same classes anyways lily looked at her schedule classes began at 8 00am as usual and were done by 3 40pm each class was an hour and 15 minutes long with a ten minute passing period today she had 8 00am 9 15am muggle studies 9 25am 10 40am herbology 10 50am 12 05pm transfiguration 12 05pm 12 55pm lunch 1 00pm 2 15pm defense against the dark arts 2 25pm 3 40pm defense against the dark arts wow easy day today lily announced surprised great classes dontyou think lily asked her friends yup said a voice from behind we re in a a a a a all the same classes james informed her james and lily had been in the same classes since their first year james of course being completely infatuated with lily and being a marauder dug around and asked lily friends what classes she was taking so that he could see her all the time lily just looked up at him honestly not knowing what to say so she just smiled and said yup i guess we are james then smiled and walked away praising and saving his good luck lily turned back to her friends only to see two horrified yet pleasantly surprised looks on their faces what why are you looking at me like that do i have a flobberworm in my hair or something lily felt her hair with a worried look lily lydia asked are you feeling alright she continued as she put her hand up to lily forehead ya lara added looking if possible more worried than lydia i think maybe we should get you to the hospital wing what are you guys talking about lily directed at them you two act as if i ve done something horrible lily laughed what on earth are you two goggling at you you re well you lara tried but looked as if she wasntsure how best to state it it just that you were actually like nice to james potter lydia finally exclaimed it almost as if you dontcompletely loathe him lydia observed with her eyes as wide as dinner plates ya lara exclaimed finally finding her voice then her next words were really quiet in fact lily had to strain her ears to hear her it almost like the opposite not that that a problem but it as if you like what lily exclaimed so loud that whatever students were left lagging in the great hall turned their heads to stare at the girl whose voice just echoed across the great hall ok lily chill lara tried to calm her down it was just an observation lara innocently continued oh my gosh we need to go lydia interjected no you tell me right now miss lara eloise kaladim what could possibly drive you to say such a stupid thing and completely untrue thing lily screamed as she chased after her two friends who had begun almost running to their first class it was a good thing the three of them decided to sign up for muggle studies together otherwise lily would have followed her friends right into the wrong class in her fit of rage lily just calm down ok she didn t lydia pleaded lydia just lily began but cut off abruptly as soon as she realized where she was class had not yet begun but seeing as it was the first day students were already sitting in their seats waiting for class to begin everyone stopped talking and waited to hear what lily was going to scream next embarrassed lily took a seat at the back of the room surprising everyone as she was usually almost on top of the teacher as he or she taught ugh this is ridiculous what the hell is she thinking i mean me like him impossible not gonna happen outrageous lily thought to herself lily was so upset with her friends that she did not speak to them through the entire length of the class come on lily lara pleaded you canthonestly be that mad at me i mean and lara debated whether or not to say it but she knew she had to because she knew she was right i mean unless i was right lara will you please just drop it lily screamed fine fine lara gave up but knew that what she had said would cause lily to think herbology went without anymore fights between the l adies today they began learning the magical properties and uses of murtlap the only distraction was a prank from the marauders of course on jason finch fletchy which involved tripping him causing him to fall into a bowl of murtlap roots which made him numb wherever they touched him but even lily had to agree he deserved it after all he did stick a murtlap root in the mug of water frank longbottom had been drinking professor mcgonnagal gave them so much homework for that night in transfiguration to celebrate the beginning of classes that even lily groaned when it was given lily came into lunch feeling pretty good despite the transfiguration homework lily took a seat opposite of her two gossiping friends and began to serve herself some lunch lily then realized how quiet her friends were and when she looked up she saw lydia whispering in lara ear ok you two spill it what juicy gossip did you hear this time lily asked smiling and sighing lydia and lara were always gossiping with each other huh oh nothing lydia said very unconvincingly as she ceased whispering to lara come on guys the l adies never keep anything from each other lily smiled trying to convince them to tell her really it nothing lara agreed nodding her head whatever lily gave up so what classes do you have this afternoon arithmancy and divination lydia answered hey we ll be right back lydia got up grabbed lara from her seat and pulled her over to where the marauders were standing leaving lily sitting by herself looking puzzled to lily surprise and confusion lydia stood on her tip toes and whispered something in sirius ear which must have been rather interesting seeing as a huge mischievous grin spread across his face hey lily a voice spoke behind her oh hey there max how is the first day of you third year so far lily asked her brother she had been so focused on what lydia was doing that she didntrealize him pretty good actually i really like arithmancy it a lot more interesting than i thought it would be max exclaimed ya it pretty cool but you were always good at the math stuff i wasn t lily said as she gave her brother a soft punch in his arm hey max you gonna try out for the quidditch team it was none other than james potter captain and seeker of the gryffindor quidditch team coming to recruit you mean you think i have a chance max asked astonished well sure if you re at all as good a flyer as your sister here you should have no problem james sincerely said with a quick glance at lily who had been eating her lunch but still paying attention as the boys talked wow what spots are open max asked unable to control his excitement lily just had to laugh at him well there are two chaser positions open and one beater spot open as well you look like you would make a fair chaser how do you like flying james continued smiling at max but sneaking glances at lily i love it but i haventridden all summer because well we obviously live right next to muggles max answered while his excitement disappeared with each second of thought well what if i took you out either sometime within the next two weeks and i ll give you a private coaching lesson try outs arentuntil next weekend james offered and smiled seeing the excitement return to max face you mean that max asked making sure he wasntdreaming james nodded his head yes woo whoooo ya that would be awesome how about this weekend ya that fine with me just let me know what time and we ll be set james answered wow you re the best hey lily can we trade petunia for james max asked half serious and half joking ok more like 95 major wishing nice try max lily answered smiling and giggling at the thought once again james got lost in that smile her perfect rose colored lips and how they parted just perfectly to reveal her soft pearly white teeth james could just completely let himself get lost in her smile for eternity and be happy james lily asked now that max was gone and james was zoned out earth to james lily teased tapping his forehead oh sorry james snapped out of his daze blushing well now that you ve rejoined us here on earth lily giggled continuing the joke i just wanted to let you know that you didnthave to do that but thank you he really loves flying but we just can t you know dontworry about it i want to take him out he one of the coolest kids i know james truthfully exclaimed lily giggled well thanks anyways you know maybe you re not so bad after all potter with those words lily got up and headed to her next class james just sat there for a while thinking about what had just happened you alright there prongsie sirius asked coming up behind his best friend and giving him a huge slap on the back you look like like you ve seen a muggle or something sirius laughed at his own joke typical i she just uh james sputtered before giving up i know i saw the whole thing from here man sirius admitted shaking his head of thick black locks you know maybe she just isntthe right one for you sirius tried as he pulled his friend off the bench no it just the opposite james exclaimed snapping out of his state of shock she she said james tried again she said that maybe i wasntthat bad well then what do you look like bloody hell sirius scolded you should be happy sirius grinned and flashed lydia and lara the thumbs up now let go to class sirius then continued to pull his friend along having to stop every once in awhile and slap james face when he slipped back into his trance of shock in the classroom sirius picked two seats so james sat right next to lily but so sirius could still be on james other side unknown to james and lily lydia lara remus and sirius secretly agreed to take every possible chance to push james and lily closer so far it was working double defense against the dark arts was a bit different this year the people in the class all chose to take the class instead of taking it because they were required to most students in the class were studying to become aurors with voldemort on the rise the magic community needed as many as they could get professor trallick was an odd woman she had been teaching for many years though not always at the same schools she had black shoulder length curly hair which had begun to sparkle with threads of silver her eyes were a dark grey blue today she began class by asking the class to take out their books as she did she naturally knocked her own book off the podium just as she gestured her students to open them to page three professor trallick was very clumsy but all of her students found that she was an exceptional teacher the class went smoothly and pretty soon the ten minute break was before them ok class stand up converse use the lue but be back in ten minutes to begin the hands on portion of class professor trallick announced as she knocked over a candle in her arm length wow she a really great teacher lily said as she turned to james only to find that both he and sirius were both drooling on their books where the class had just been reading so finding this both amusing and disgusting all at the same time lily very carefully took out every single book in her bag she piled all of them on top of one another and slammed them as hard as she could onto the table in the space between james head and sirius head whoa honestly woman sirius exclaimed very startled but of course tried to hide it do you always choose to give heart attacks to your fellow students or do you just hate me because i beautiful sirius teased with a girly flip of his hair ha ha lily replied sarcastically amused then she realized james hadntwoken up in fact lily noticed that he wasntmoving at all lily panicked here the next chapter tell me what you think so far i welcome all reviews and all reviewers please read and review if you re taking time to read this fan fic please take one more minute to let me know what you think thank you to all of my reviewers i hope you enjoy this chapter it one of my favorites so far peace liane chapter 7 lily confession james lily shook him james james lily shook him even harder and still no response james wake up lily shouted in panic very near to his face boo james yelled as he jerked up to face lily lily was so frightened that she fell backwards over her chair and landed on her backside james and sirius howled with laughter as james got up and offered his had to help lily up potter donteven lily shouted but ceased at a lack of words to describe her utter embarrassment arg lily screamed as she shoved her hair out of her face potter you are such a prat lily i was only joking around james tried to explain absolutely horrified at lily reaction lily bolted up completely red in the face and ran out of the room without even bothering to pick up her books sirius and james exchanged bewildered looks sirius was the first to break the silence with his usual way of coping with things making a joke wow you really are the ladies man stuff it padfoot james spat as he was definitely not in the mood to joke around the rest of the class they were silent which was of course a very rare occurrence but sirius knew when to let james be and stop pushing him when the lesson ended james headed straight for his dorm without a word to anyone as soon as he got there he saw lily working on their transfiguration homework lily james approached tentatively what do you want now potter lily snarled come to embarrass me a little more perhaps or maybe you want me to get all scared again and worry like a sick maniac or maybe lily james finally shouted over her little pity party james set lily bag next to her and received nothing but a particularly threatening death glare i just wanted to let you know that i sorry i didntmean for you to get upset or hurt james sincerely stated yah lily challenged well i did honestly i was just kidding around james pleaded had i know that any of this would have happened believe me i wouldnthave done it james tried to calm her potter just just leave me alone lily screamed at him as she stormed up to her room and slammed the door james watched after her speechless he decided he d let her cool down a little and try again later he knew it was pointless to try to talk to her when she was this upset in her room lily began writing again dear diary you know for a second i thought he changed he was nice to me and so cute with max but of course not he just a huge prank happy dolt no better yet he is a prank on me here i am thankful he changed and i can let out a huge sigh knowing that my gut feeling wasnta lie and then he turns it upside down again i mean geez that was so embarrassing i was worried about him let me admit i surprised myself by that but then of course he was just fine and what do i get for my thoughtfulness a scream in my face a bruise on my arse and yet another serving of embarrassment caused by the murderous marauders ughh i could just kick him lily exclaimed aloud murderous yup that what they are murderers of peoples images i dontknow why i get so upset i mean a better person would have brushed it off and laughed why canti do that maybe it because potter is a prat or maybe it because he everything i want to be but he just doesntget it why doesnthe get it that was so embarrassing guys just dontunderstand that i gotta do my homework now transfiguration homework to last me a life time maybe i ll ask sirius what we did in the second half of class he wasntthe one who was being a jerk gotta go always lily lily then took a shower got on some comfy clothes and went downstairs she was not surprised to see james gone just like a guy to run away lily thought she grabbed her transfiguration book as well as her bag and went back upstairs to finish her work o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o hey lily lydia greeted her friend as they sat down for dinner how was class we didntsee you at all where were you i dontwant to talk about it lily replied as she violently stabbed a piece of grilled chicken lydia and lara exchanged looks that portrayed oh no and here we go again as good of friends as the three of them were lily was definitely the loaded cannon anything and anyone could set her off but usually it was james potter are you sure you dontwant to talk about it lara pushed ok look i can put it into four words lily said as she counted them on her fingers potter is a prat and though i could fill encyclopedias with insults no i mean truths about potter those four words very nicely sum up the thousands of pages otherwise needed lily said all in one breath just one question lara said and lily glared at her friend um one word lara smirked mocking the flustered lily this was a very brave risk for lara as she attempted to lighten the situation why both lara and lydia found it amusing how flustered and bothered lily got by someone she supposedly loathed gee maybe it because he egotistical maybe it because he a jerk maybe it because he thinks it cool to constantly look like he just got off a broom lily yelled but then continued in an almost whisper or maybe just maybe it because i actually worried about him and he turned it around and made me fall on my arse literally mind you you re ok though right lydia asked trying her hardest not to burst out laughing at lily and her drama ya i sorry i dontmean to yell at you two but he just so rude lily calmed down dontyou think so i guess lara said uncertainly hey are you planning the halloween ball lara quickly changed the subject ummm i haventheard anything about it yet but i pretty sure we will lily answered why you two got any good ideas you guys are really good at that kind of stuff actually we have lara and i were thinking that the theme could be famous witches and wizards lara cut in unable to control her excitement but there a catch lydia began again excitedly you must have a date for couples competitions we could set up games and have the couples participate in the games to find out which famous witch and wizard couple was the best at them isntthat a great idea lara waited until lydia was finished this time yah that sounds awesome lily replied impressed but who will we go with well you know who each of us wants to go with lydia motioned at herself and lara we just need to find you a date ya that the problem lily said now sort of depressed well i have to ask sirius what our homework was lily stated as she stood up what lara asked confused why dontyou know ummm lily started sheepishly after what potter pulled i was so embarrassed that i just went to my room i kind of missed the second half of the lesson lily admitted as her face formed a grimace what lara gasped completely in shock yah lily said nervously as she looked down at her feet i gotta go see you guys later lily got up and walked towards he marauders once lily had turned her back to them lara and lydia looked at each other and at the same time said she totally likes him then they finished the jinx with twin giggles sirius lily tapped him on the back hey what up there lily flower sirius teased but nervously for fear of a sequel to her episode earlier in the classroom i was wondering if we got any homework after i uh after i left lily asked obviously trying to repress the memory ya we have to read the whole book and write a 30 page essay on it sirius replied without a flinch lily jaw dropped ha ha ha only joking no we didnthave any professor trallick decided we d get enough from our other classes since it the first day ok thanks lily replied thankful they didnthave any then she turned around and began walking to her dorm hey lily i just james caught lily off guard of course she had been trying to ignore him and was so successful that she almost forgot he was there you just what lily interrupted him with a hostile tone wanna embarrass me some more potter i just dontfeel like arguing lily then stormed off i mean who does he think he is does he think i just going to forgive and forget everything he ever done sweettarts lily yelled at the painting i mean honestly having nothing better to do lily picked up her favorite blanket and the book she was currently reading peter pan and went down to the common room she pulled one of the squashy chairs up to the fire and sat down in it she had her feet hanging off one arm and her shoulders against the other with her blanket covering her lily then opened her book and lily will you just listen to me james begged she had to hand it to him the boy just simply didntgive up but then again neither did she potter i dontcare anymore i dontcare what you meant or what happened and i dontaccept your apology end of story case closed good night lily ran up the stairs not bothering to pick up her book and blanket which had both flown off her lap as she bolted up james ran after her and shouted but miss smarty pants you forgot it not over till the fat lady sings then i ll take you to her and she ll sing for you lily screamed as she slammed her door i not leaving you alone until you show or grow the decency to accept my apology like a decent human being you might be able to snub everyone you know like this miss lily marie evans but not me james yelled through the door fine bug me to my grave what do i care lily shouted back why is it that whenever one little thing doesntgo your way you freak out at the whole entire world but then expect them to come running back to you you are such a spaz james yelled becoming sick of her attitude just accept that someone is trying to be nice and apologize to you for once in your life why so it can happen again lily bellowed back completely livid just so you know i will no longer be able to hear you so yell as loud as you want lily took her wand and cast a spell to make her door like a muggle sound barrier it worked she couldnthear him anymore what does he know i dontsnub everyone i dontyell at everyone lily thought to herself yes you do you re even yelling at yourself right now said another voice in her head what do you know i can deal with not getting my way i was doing just fine retorted the first voice whatever you say to make yourself sleep at night after another couple of minutes of back and forth between herself and about two hours of finishing the rest of her homework lily wished she had her book if i creep out really quietly he wontknow so lily opened her door as quietly as she could and crept down the stairs she grabbed her book and blanket and headed for the stairs he must be in his room i knew he wouldntlast lily thought to herself as she reached the landing lily had to hold back a gasp of surprise there was the big bad james potter curled up like a baby fast asleep he must have been waiting for me for the second time in her life lily felt bad for the way she treated james it was quite cold on the landing this far away from the fire even though the floor was carpeted lily gently leaned over him and laid her blanket over the sleeping james all of a sudden lily anger suddenly rushed out of her compelling her to come clean to james james lily whispered not wanting him to wake up i just wanted to let you know that i ve been thinking you should not be the one apologizing i should i just thought you ought to know that although it may seem like it i donthate you i mean what life without surprise and embarrassment lily paused as she collected her thoughts this is so much easier when you re sleeping lily sat down next to him and continued i guess i was just so embarrassed when you scared me that i didntknow what to do trust me i get embarrassed really easily and obviously i dontknow how to deal with it very well but you know that but what i said today about you not being so bad i really did mean that no one has ever been very nice to max people find him odd and older kids find him annoying lily then laid down with her head in front of james and her feet pointing in the opposite direction of his do you want to know a secret lily propped her head up on her hand with her elbow easing into the carpet but you have to promise not to tell anyone taking his silence as a promise lily continued fighting back her nerves i admire you i admire your kindness your humor your friendships you are an amazing person and i cannot believe i am telling you this lily felt her eyelids growing heavier but she fought against her fatigue james there this part of me that known since the first day we met that there something different between the two of us i ve never felt that before with anyone i know it sounds stupid but i canthelp thinking about it it like this gut feeling you know you dontknow why or how you know but you do lily felt herself slipping into sleep but she had to get this out she felt like she owed it to james and to herself but every time i see you pull a prank on someone or make fun of someone just because you can it makes me think that my gut feeling is wrong that is the scariest feeling in the world i could never be with someone who constantly made fun of others just to look cool james i want so much for you to change or for me to just live with it i want to know that what i feel is right and worth it but i just dontknow i torn between my instinct mixed with what i believe to be my heart and my stubborn mind lily took a deep breath suddenly realizing the huge burden she had been carrying it felt so right to finally be telling james the truth even though he was sleeping call me crazy lily slipped further and further into sleep with each word but i think i think we are meant to be together her last thought was complete happiness which she thought must have warped her vision because she could have sworn she saw james smile and with those last words and thoughts lily fell asleep right there beside james on the floor in the hall i think so too james sighed with a smile as he opened his eyes to glance at the woman he loved james then flipped himself around so their feet were pointing in the same direction and laid the blanket over the both of them i think so too lily thanks again to

up and went to take a shower since there was about 30 minutes until the beginning of breakfast he decided he d wake lily after his shower hey lily james said softly as he gently shook his sleeping beauty lily wake up it time to get ready at first lily didntrealize where she was and she awoke with a start but then she saw james face those gorgeous warm hazel eyes that she just wanted to be wrapped up in and never let go that smile that lit up her heart when she saw it the glasses that fit him perfectly like windows to his soul lily james asked as lily had just zoned out yah oh sorry i uh then she remembered the night before i must ve fallen asleep last night why is the blanket on me oh man i lily james interrupted her thoughts again i think you need to get ready breakfast just started a few minutes ago you wouldntwant to be late james flashed a grin i sorry this is the second time i ve done this lily apologized as she rose to her feet donteven worry about it i ll wait for you to get ready and then we can go eat james then gently coaxed lily into her room and went to the common room to wait oh my gosh i cantbelieve it i just slept on the floor in the middle of a hallway with james potter lily thought to herself with a half embarrassed half amazed tone as she changed her clothes lily you just need to chill and keep cool ok dontjump the gun just because you talked to him while he was sleeping doesntmean that you two are best friends you cannot assume anything it wouldntbe fair lily coached herself with thoughts in her head that sounded uncannily like lydia as she flicked her wand and refreshed her thin black eyeliner mascara and sparkly light green eye shadow thenshe grabbedher bag andheaded down the stairs hey lily james asked as soon as he saw her i have a question for you yah about yesterday i really sorry i was just really embarrassed and i shouldnthave taken it out on you like that it wasntfair lily resolved so you accept my apology then james questioned hopefully no lily calmly replied as james face dropped you have no reason to be sorry do you forgive me lily asked sincerely if that the way you want it beautiful james teased but my question was going to be and james stuck out his hand can we be friends this took lily by surprise but she thought for a second on one condition if you promise that if you have to prank someone it wontbe around me ok lily was too scared or maybe too embarrassed to tell james why she didntwant to see him pulling pranks on people but her reason was good enough for her she didntwant to get into the story behind it it was too early to go through all the pain of remembering the loss of someone she considered to be almost a sister i would do anything for you lily james grinned deal and lily shook his hand and made it official now let go i starving james cried as lily laughed and freed her mind from her thoughts about the past the day went smoothly lily james and sirius were in all the same classes today they had care for magical creatures ancient runes transfiguration and double charms charms was lily favorite and best subject but just so happened to be james and sirius worst so minus almost being him in the head by the rocks they were truing to control with their wands lily was having a great second day in fact lily had a really good first week even double potions wasntas bad as she thought it would be the only bad thing was the amount of homework they all got all of their teachers seemed to be trying to see how much homework they could give their students before their breaking points they were all trying to prepare their students for their n e w t s but more importantly their jobs and lives after school lily and james were so busy with their homework that they didntreally have time to talk but their friends all noticed a calmer friendlier manner between the two at dinner on friday lydia got the guts to ask about it hey lily what up between you and the infamous potter umm well we decided that we would be friends lily replied then seeing the surprised looks creep onto their faces she asked what you two look as if i hated him or something but lily lara began almost choking on her pumpkin juice you did wow i impressed though i never expected you to listen to us i mean with how much you complained i wait back up what do you mean listen to you lily asked suspiciously lara gasped and clamped her hands on her mouth hold on you didn t what are you two smirking at well lily we hate to say it but lydia began we told you so both lydia and lara exclaimed as they both lapsed into fits of giggles lily couldnthelp but laugh at her friends you two are off your rockers lily shook her head with a smile as long as we re asking you questions i was wondering why we never see you anymore where are you living i mean you dontlive with us anymore lara asked yah we ve barely seen you since this year started and it our last year and we miss you lydia pouted umm now dontflip out ok trust me i did enough of that for all three of us when i found out lily admitted you see dumbledore and the rest of the staff thought it would be a good idea to keep head boy and girl close by in case of any attack though that would be a rare event the increasing threat of voldemort rules nothing out lydia and lara both got the shivers at the mention of the name so in order to increase security the head boy and girl have living quarters very close to dumbledore if there were ever an emergency lily could see that her friends hadntyet put two and two together so she explained it very simply james and i share living quarters each of us has our own bedroom and bathroom but we share a common room when lily finished explaining she looked at her friends they both looked as thought their eyes might have popped right out of their heads if lily had bumped them you you re then the hysterical laughter of both girls was heard you lily evans are living with with with james potter lydia screamed still laughing umm yah i guess you could say that lily replied in an almost inaudible whisper never thought i d ever see the day when that happened lara howled ok are you two done making fun of me now lily pleaded as their giggles began to subside hey what so funny over here sirius came and asked lydia as remus and peter followed him what do i have a bogie or something sirius asked with mock disbelief as he nervously rubbed his nose ewww no we just found out that our good friend lily here and her giggles began again is get this living with her most favorite person in the world your good buddy james lydia screeched with uncontrollable laughter i know we found out just the other day isntthat something remus added as he and the other two present marauders joined in the laughter not wanted to be embarrassed any longer lily snuck away from the group and spotted max talking to james hey guys what up lilymeister james and i were just figuring out when he going to help me with flying max answered but i ll leave you two aloooooone max teased with an eyebrow wiggle at james wait what began a thoroughly confused lily but max had already left what was that all about lily directed at james oh he just heard lydia and lara screeching about us sharing a dorm and he thinks it means something james smiled he thinks we like each other you remember that third year mentality james laughed and to his delight lily did too a couple seats away lydia lara sirius remus and peter all high fived each other in a moment of success then they continued to watch a potentially juicy situation unfold so how about that potions homework it a doozy it just long but the charms is where i need help do you think you could help me sometime with that contrata charm it way more intense than wingardium leviosa james thought he d give it a try the worse thing that could happen would be that she d say no well i dontsee why not as long as you help me catch up in defense kay lily added yah sure no problem james couldntbelieve his good luck ms evans mr potter they both looked up to see professor dumbledore looking down at them i need to have a meeting with you and the prefects tonight if you could please tell all the prefects to meet here in the hall at 10 00pm tonight i would very much appreciate it thank you then he simply walked back up to the staff table to eat dessert lily and james started spreading the word immediately soon all of the prefects were notified that night the headmaster the heads of the houses the head boy and girl and all of the prefects were called to have a meeting as everyone entered the hall others conversed until at last dumbledore rose from his seat and spoke good evening to you all i sure you re all very tired and want to know why you were called here tonight you will be receiving your patrolling duty assignments professor mcgonagall then began handing out pieces of parchment on these slips of parchment the patrolling duties are listed specific nights are reserved by year except for a few special occasions everyone followed along as dumbledore read the schedule out loud fifth year prefects are to patrol on wednesday nights sixth years on tuesday nights seventh years on monday and thursday nights and heads friday saturday and sunday nights the hours you will be patrolling are from 10 00pm to 12 00am of course as exams creep closer your duties will be lightened if you ever have a problem getting to you patrol notify your head of house are there any questions after a few moments of silence dumbledore concluded the meeting alright well go get some sleep or do your homework dumbledore said with a wink good night everyone began picking up their things and heading for their dorms but they all stopped as dumbledore spoke once more ah i almost forgot lily and james if you two could kindly stay a moment longer thank you he said as they took their seats again good night to you all he called to the others now it was just james lily and their headmaster i would like to start with congratulating you on your first week of being head boy and head girl i am very proud of the two of you dumbledore said with the twinkle in his eye a bit more noticeable than usual but down to business he said as he sat back in his chair i need the two of you to come up with a theme for this year halloween ball it is tradition that the head boy and girl choose the theme i will need some ideas in shall we say about a week lily and james nodded ok 9 30pm a week from this coming sunday in my office good luck on your first night of patrolling dumbledore said with a smile he then got up and left lily and james picking up their things wow lily sighed patrol duty all weekend that intense yah james smiled you have to endure two straight hours of me every friday saturday and sunday night think you re up to the challenge evans lily giggled donteven remind me she added playfully hey james exclaimed with a hint of sarcasm that hurts evans it wontbe that bad i mean come on you know we ll have fun riiiiiight lily sarcastically rolled her eyes but she couldnthold it in anymore she just absolutely burst out laughing she laughed so hard and so loud that she started to cry she didnteven really know why she was laughing but something about james made her all giggly inside james loved lily laugh he could listen to it for hours when she was sad he was even sadder but when she was happy he was even happier it was almost as if their emotions were based on each other james the joined lily in her laughter and together their joy echoed across the empty hall finally they began to calm down with tears still in their eyes ok ok we have to go patrol lily finally got out between gasping for air and the last of her giggles alright james responded as he wiped the tears of joy out of his eyes i just have to go grab something from my room and we ll be hot to trot his choice of words sent lily into another lapse of giggles as they walked back to their dorm ten minutes later they were in their common room ready to go lily had her charms notes wit her so that she could quiz james and james had a piece of old parchment hey what that lily asked james pointing to the parchment you really wanna know james asked and lily nodded ok but you canttell anyone james whispered secretively i won t i promise lily whispered back i thought it would help us on out patrols then lily watched as he tapped the parchment with the tip of his wand and muttered i solemnly swear that i am up to no good lily uttered a surprised gasp as she watched the parchment suddenly grow ink out of nowhere it said messrs moony wormtail padfoot and prongs purveyors of aids to magical mischief makers are proud to present the marauders map is that hogwarts james finished yup and everyone in and around it anywhere at anytime arentthose the names you guys have for each other lily asked still not connecting the dots yup james announced with a huge triumphant grin on his face remus is moony peter is wormtail sirius is padfoot and i am prongs james added with a dramatic finish this is really amazing lily exclaimed with admiration you four did all of this i mean this is pretty advanced stuff yup well between the four of us well minus peter so the three of us it wasntthat hard a few tracking and tracing spells an identification spell and of course the usual marauder handiwork put them all together and this is what you get you like james said with a smirk seeing the amazed look on lily beautiful face like james cringed i love lily exclaimed giving james a huge hug this is so awesome you know lily began as she walked towards the portrait hole we could have fun with this malfoy out of bed we could see him then tip off filch lily exclaimed as her excitement grew i didntknow that you were ok with rule breaking little miss perfect prefect james teased ha ha lily shot sarcastically as she playfully punched james arm it perfect head girl to you oh i frightfully sorry miss and james lunged into a very low bow causing lily to start giggling once again and that pretty much how their night went they didntcatch malfoy but they joked and they laughed until they started crying again once they were back in their dorm lily said wow tonight was awesome both then made their way up the stairs we should do this again sometime she joked with a huge smile the smile that made james breathless every time he saw it yah how about james sarcastically tapped his head like he was thinking really really hard tomorrow night yay i ll meet you same place same time lily played along of course tomorrow was saturday and they had to patrol again james and lily both howled with laughter finally james spoke well i ll see you tomorrow beautiful very funny lily stuck her tongue out at him james thought she looked cute even like that i ll see you tomorrow james have a good night lily said sweetly you too and sweet dreams james called to her as she closed her door about me he added softly to himself as he opened the door to his own room another thought occurred to him she called me james to all my reviewers

love comments i hope you all like this chapter yours truly liane chapter 9 payback and the dream team in the next week james and lily grew closer even though they argued at least once a day about stupid things like what trilogy of movies was the best ever made star curses or the maitrhex but nonetheless every patrol night presented a new adventure yes including catching malfoy crabbe and goyle out of bed this resulted in detention for the three of them and 30 points from slytherin each it also made a great story and gloating session for james and lily then of course each night ended in the same sweet good night followed by the same sweet thoughts lily always wished for herself to be able to put her horrible past behind her and accept james for who he was and james always wished he would work up the courage to say more to her slowly classes passed and eventually homework got done james continued helping max with his flying actually it became james and lily project since they both wanted him to be on the team and before they knew it it was september 14th try outs for the gryffindor quidditch team james lily yelled through his door james you need to get up what is he doing in there probably still sleeping hahahaha i ll get him back lily thought to herself lily quietly opened james door and saw that he was in fact still sleeping perfect lily thought to herself then she quietly tiptoed over to his bed and heard james give a particularly loud snore lily fought hard to suppress a giggle but she was successful and did not wake him as slowly as she could lily climbed on top of james bed suddenly she began jumping up and down screaming earthquake what said a very groggy james what going on now more panicked lily began laughing hysterically and could stop realizing what a fool she had made out of him james tackled lily and began tickling her stop lily gasped in between her shouting giggles james didntlet up one bit making lily tear with laughter finally lily was able to get out quidditch and then about another minute later try outs well why didntyou say so james exclaimed as he jumped off the bed man i gonna be late then he tickled lily all the way out of the room then shut the door so he could get ready knowing he wouldntfly well or have any energy if he didnteat lily went down to the hall and filled a plate with some food hey lils whatcha doin her friend lydia asked as she lara sirius remus and peter walked up to her yah where james he not sick is he sirius panicked cause i cantrun try outs without him calm down there sirius lily motioned with the hand that wasntbalancing a plate of food he just woke up late and he freaking out i just thought he d want to eat something before he left lily replied honestly phew sirius sarcastically wiped his forehead you had me there for a second i think i almost had a heart attack oh you are such a drama queen sirius lydia teased with her signature eye roll umm sirius started looking utterly confused i not a girl sirius yelled with that you should have known that tone lily too this opportunity to slip out of the conversation while everyone was laughing hey james lily yelled through his door even though she had one hand fee she didntthink about knocking she was pretty sure her yelling at him would suffice i brought you some breakfast awwww thanks mommy james poked fun as he opened his door you dontwant it lily whisked the food back to her alright lily popped a grape into her mouth with a smirk hey james grabbed at the food but lily was quicker than he thought and james almost tripped head first into the wall he then recovered and acted as nothing had happened and why arentyou dressed little miss why would i be i not the one running try outs oh great sir captain lily smirked as she bowed low to him while holding the plate up as an offering why not you re a great flyer and you re quick we could really use you this year exclaimed the abashed james yah right let me think lily made a face of sarcastic thinking then said nah i dontthink i will thank you lily come on you were really great teaching max plus you know the captains james threw out his chest and gave her a wink but honestly you are really good and we need you if we want any chance at beating slytherin for the quidditch or house cup james put his arm around lily and begged come on ole buddy ole pal for me james then finished the guilt trip with his irresistible puppy dog lip lily couldntresist a man with that look all she knew was whoever had said a picture is worth a thousand words must have seen james at this moment because his look was worth about ten thousand words lily buckled fine i ll tryout and she finished with a smile then out of gratitude before he knew what he was doing james planted a huge kiss on lily cheek then pushed her into her room and scolded get ready lily just stood in her room after james had closed the door with her hand on the cheek james had just kissed and ironically james stood in the hall with his hand to his lips finally realizing he had just kissed the beautiful ms lily evans about fifteen seconds later lily finally began getting ready as james went back in his room to finish getting ready as well half an hour later lily and james met up with sirius in the great hall the look on sirius face was of complete shock you got her to try out yup james replied with a triumphant smile on his face all that was needed was a little potter charm and a guilt trip lily cut in with a tease so i trying out what the big deal i ll bet i wonteven make it there are tons of people trying out yah but no one can pass like you your coordination is impeccable sirius sincerely commented causing lily to blush alright we gotta go or we re going to be late for our own tryout james herded them out the door to the quidditch pitch they were not the first ones there but they certainly were not the last lily you came to watch me max just landed and came running over to his sister leaving mikey to talk to james and sirius i was getting nervous but i do so much better when you re here max was a bit clingy to lily this clinginess was attributed to petunia and her hatred toward the two of them for being magical actually i trying out lily stated giving a weak smile max gave lily a confused look sorry do you not want me to lily asked worried by her brother expression no it not that at all it just that well how am i going to have a chance at making the team if you try out too you re so good aww come on max lily tried to cheer him up he really didnthave anything to worry about it seemed that great flying skills ran in the family lily threw her arm around her little brother i might be good but you and i together are great siblings on the same team are unstoppable it like we re on the same channel you ll be great she then gave her brother a peck on the top of his head then rustled his hair as older sisters often do alright today you boys and girls have come here to try out for the gryffindor quidditch team the amplified voice of james potter was heard through the pitch lily half expected him to creak a joke but she remembered that quidditch was the only thing in the world that james potter was serious about i am james potter and i am sirius black sirius voice also amplified then together they finished with and we are the captains of the team sirius then continued today you are here to tryout for one of two positions beater or chaser if you are trying out for the chaser position please follow me to the north end of the pitch james said waving his arm to let everyone know who he was as if they didntalready know and those of you for beater follow me to the south end of the pitch sirius also waved his arm good luck everyone both james and sirius concluded the group split about three fourths of the group followed james and the other fourth followed sirius james made them do a number of tasks and tests they practiced catching and throwing the quaffle then they played small games of three on three while james and the team current chaser frank longbottom watched of course they had to practice dodging bludgers so they teamed up with the people trying out for the beater position each person trying out for the chaser positions had to get past someone trying out for the beater position they either got a bludger shot at them or they had to dodge someone flying straight at them without dropping the quaffle the current members of the team would often whisper in each others ears resulting in stomachaches of those trying out finally after about three hours the people trying out were able to sit and take a break while the current team members hovered in the air comparing thoughts first of all i would like to thank everyone for coming you all have talent but there are only three spots open james amplified voice echoed across the pitch once again please know that you should all try out again next year if you ll be here because you all were amazing if you are already in your seventh year continue to play even if you dontmake it because you really are great and lily looked around and realized she was the only seventh year not already on the team she knew then that she did not make it once your name has been called please go into the team locker room at the end if your name hasntbeen called you may go back to the school and you wonthave to worry about the grueling practices and aching muscles sirius assured the group for the open position of beater sirius let the suspense rise a little michael potter everyone applauded some politely some louder but the atmosphere was still tense james spoke again and for the first open chaser position max evans lily gave her brother the biggest hug she had ever given him and he was beaming she really was proud of him she only wished that they could have been on the team together so not wanting anyone to see her disappointment she began to pack up for the other chaser position the suspense grew the beautiful ms lily marie evans james reported and lily froze in the middle of shoving a knee pad in her bag come on potter this isntsomething to joke about lily called to him not a very nice prank she thought and it wasntnice to pull on her because pranks always made lily think about keri james could see her blushing from the air he just didntknow that she was blushing from anger rather than embarrassment come on evans locker room now james sarcastically acted like a drill sergeant but it worked lily went on her way to the locker room and was plowed over by her ecstatic brother you made it you made it max sang to his sister you made it i made it mikey made it you all made it congratulations their captains and teammates joined their new team members in the locker room mikey you ve got one hell of an arm kid i ve never seen you at beater where have you been hiding sirius exclaimed as all the old members began congratulating the newcomers that because whenever we play at home you re always beater and you guys make me play keeper mikey shrugged but was still excited about being on the same level as his older brother and best friend and lily and max wow you two kicked arse out there slytherin wontstand a chance against the two of you sirius was so excited he was almost literally bouncing off the walls yah both of you were good separately but together you blew the rest of them out of the pitch james joined after he had congratulated his own brother add longbottom and the three of you will be invincible alright down to business sirius began practice will be tuesday and thursday from 4 30pm until dinner also james added sunday afternoons from 1 30pm to 3 30pm we know it a big commitment but we feel we have a really great chance to win this year longbottom evans and evans as chasers black and potter as beaters asher at keeper and yours truly as seeker we ll be unstoppable alright guys and gal hands in sirius yelled putting his hand in the middle of the huddle on fire ah on three one two three on fire ah the entire team shouted all together for the very first time then left laughing and conversing all together that was so nerve wracking i cantbelieve you talked me into this lily laughed as she and james walked back to their dorm aww come on it wasntthat bad you were amazing honestly i think this will be the best year we ve ever had you and your brother are wicked together you ll really throw malfoy for a loop james exclaimed jumping the stairs two at a time well i glad you had fun lily shook her head as she laughed at him you didnthave fun he gasped in disbelief sweet tarts lily said to sir and lady zanath as they bowed and curtsied respectively no i did have fun but what am i going to do about studying i dontknow if i ll be able to balance studying quidditch and head girl duties lily slumped down on a chair in the common room lily lily my beautiful lily if i can do it so can you james exclaimed trying to make her feel better nice try but i like to actually stay awake during class lily said with a half tease james set his elbows on the back of the chair and put his hands on lily back massaging her tight muscles though she didntwant to admit it to him james hands were like magic they calmed her eased her and made her feel safe after about ten minutes of the soothing quietness lily stood up i need to take a shower i smell lily exclaimed with a giggle well i wasntgoing to say anything james joked as lily punched his arm i need to take one too james said as they walked up the stairs see ya on the other side then both james and lily went to their own bathrooms completely beaming
