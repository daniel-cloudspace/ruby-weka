 seems i need to repost this as the separation between the two povs did not show up i ve always said there black magic in computers a n well my friends here i am again with the first chapter of the sequel to my harry fleur saga i must say i find this new way of writing a bit difficult after the first part please tell me your opinions there is still time to change the fundamental approach and yes please constructive criticism is not only welcome but absolutely necessary you should do this or that and you messed up this one bcause in your place i would do this such things help me a lot more than the stereotypical great work update soon of course this is not to say i dontappreciate the praise too and instead of not reviewing at all keep the laurel wreaths coming by all means thanks for all the interesting comments and ideas especially lt200 you have the most fascinating insight into the nature of writng how come you have not done anything on ffnet yourself i sure it would be great i tried to mail you directly but the address that is given on ffnet is wrong would be nice if you could give me the correct one i starting a yahoo group too where i intend to park fleur diary and some other tidbits of my writings you re welcome to visit and discuss all fleur related stuff the group is called fleur de foudre which means flower of lightning if my french is correct but be patient it will take some time until you can find anything there anyway here is the beginning of the scorpion sting chapter 1 it going to be a cold lonely summer fleur margaux was shaking her friend who had been gazing dreamily out of the window for the last couple of hours or so it seemed fleur we re going to arrive in a few of minutes what the silver blonde girl replied snapping out of her trance oh her face fell and the blue eyes darkened come iphigenie who had moved to her side interjected it wontbe as bad as all that we ve promised to come visit you remember and we ll find a way yes i know and i grateful for that fleur said in a low dull voice but you dontknow my mother and and i missing him so already her voice shook with suppressed tears come it no good and you know it margaux said resolutely if you want to do anything about it the first thing you need is a clear head all that snivelling and crying wontmake things better and who knows perhaps your mother will be nicer to you now you re a triwizard champion after all and she may be glad enough to have you back perhaps what happened to cedric has made her think about what could have happened to you yes sometimes these things take time to sink in iphigenie assisted why dontyou just wait and see how things develop and we ll come to see you in a weeks time let see if she can refuse yes we re beauxbatons graduates now arentwe there was pride in margaux voice ready to start an independent life of our own fleur couldnthelp smiling at her friend eager tone of voice there you go margaux said satisfied that the spirit just dontlet her get you down presently the expres beauxbatons came to a standstill at perron 3 of gare st lazare and the students started leaving the train eagerly happy to start off into their hard earned holidays got to run margaux shouted breathlessly we ve got this new flat together see oh i cantwait and she grabbed her girl friend hand and pulled her out into the corridor fleur remained in her seat until the noise in the train had died down then with a sigh she got up and slowly left the compartment the platform was nearly deserted when she stepped on to it heaving her trunk after her she had not expected anyone to be waiting for her and so she was completely taken by surprise when a small girl rushed towards her she barely had time to react and open her arms before her sister jumped right into them gabie what the fleur couldntbelieve it the last thing she had expected after her mother cool farewell was to be welcomed and almost toppled over by her sister concluding logically that gabrielle was too young to be travelling on her own she looked around and really she saw her mother standing there a couple of feet away a rare smile on her face she put her little sister back on the ground and turned to her mother unable to hide her surprise maman yes cherie isabeau delacour said stepping up towards her and opening her arms i thought it would be a bit hard for you if you had to arrive here all on your own after that terrible experience of yours i ve been thinking i ve perhaps been a bit inconsiderate fleur was speechless for a moment how long ago was it that she had heard her mother talk to her that way but maman no buts her mother said quietly wontyou embrace your mother still surprised but not unpleasantly so fleur complied this is a dream she thought and if i just go along it may be some time until i wake up they left the station together fleur and her mother each holding one of gabrielle hands men kept turning their heads to look at the small group and more often than not someone ran into something because they had not been watching where they were going of course this was nothing surprising isabeau delacour was certainly a stunning appearance in her exquisitely tailored silk trousers and jacket clicking along on her high stilettos her waist long silver blonde mane dancing in the rhythm of her steps i wonder does she still possess the veela charm can she use it at will imbecile isabeau muttered impatiently hurling a devastating look at a uniformed man who was standing in her way the man turned a deep shade of red and slunk away outside the station the silver rolls royce was parked in the tow away zone of course a grim faced policeman was standing next to it is this he could not even finish his sentence when the veela smile hit him full force his eyes turned glassy and his motions became machine like as he saluted and stepped out of the way fleur couldnthelp grinning so that my question answered that charm works all right isabeau got into the car and motioned for fleur to sit next to her gabrielle got in in the back and noiselessly and in an elegant curve the huge car started to move get in boy we haventgot all day vernon dursley grunted when they had finally reached the car he was huffing a good deal in the hot sun as of course there had been no parking space available nearer than twenty minutes walk from king cross moreover they had just reached the vauxhall when a policeman had started writing out a ticket and it had only been with luck the policeman biro refused to write that he had escaped a fine naturally vernon normally less than amenable mood had reached rock bottom dontknow why i take the trouble to fetch you really why cantthose weirdoes look after you in the holidays too and is there any gratitude no sir but what else is there to be expected his grumbling became indistinct as he folded his bulk up into the driver seat how long are you going to take with that bloody trunk of yours he snarled at harry who had been heaving his huge hogwarts trunk along through the streets all by himself and was now using all his strength to stow it away in the boot no i donthave a coin for you to use for the trolley vernon had said nastily why dontyou use some magic of course he knew exactly harry was strictly forbidden to do any magic outside school and he enjoyed it a good deal a last feeling exhausted harry had managed to close the boot and slipped into the back seat he had no wish to sit next to his uncle and vernon did not comment on this the ride passed without any interruption not even by a single word between uncle and nephew the only sounds vernon made were scathing remarks on other drivers abilities of steering a car when they finally pulled up at privet drive number 4 vernon slammed the door and marched up to the house without looking back at harry harry who had not felt like talking to his uncle anyway he usually didn t climbed out got his trunk and dragged it up the front door where his cousin was leaning an unpleasant grin on his face he seemed to have increased if not in height then in width although this had already seemed impossible when harry had seen him last ah so you re back scar face he sneered at harry pity nobody turned you into a slimy slug or something leave me alone will you harry replied quietly pushing past dudley and could not help a slight feeling of satisfaction as he noticed the edge of his trunk grazing dudley shin look where you re going fathead dudley snorted and smacked the back of harry head forcefully harry ignored him and started heaving his trunk up the stairs when he had at last reached his room he collapsed on his bed and closed his eyes elegantly wending its way through the heavy traffic the rolls soon left paris and after a short time shorter than a normal un charmed vehicle would have needed they entered a well groomed park and at last drew up in front of a large empire style mansion still dazed with her mother unusual behaviour she had been chatting to her most of the journey fleur got out of the car and stretched her legs gabrielle jumped out of the car too and presently the two sisters were happily dancing on the gravel path that led up to the front door where the butler had just appeared in a haughty gesture that would have been very familiar to fleur had she been watching it isabeau tossed the car keys to the butler and then approached her daughters welcome home fleur she said with her beautiful smile it so good to have you back you and i we must have a nice long talk some day soon is she trying the veela charm on me no it cantbe i being paranoid my own mother but i must find out what has made her change so completely oui maman she said dutifully i looking forward to it they proceeded into the salon where the house elves had arranged lunch some ten different dishes beautifully presented on silver dishes on the long table i thought you might appreciate some real food after the horrors of british cooking isabeau said with another smile but english breakfast is great gabrielle piped up i loved those baked beans and the bacon and i have a surprise for you isabeau continued completely ignoring her younger daughter look who here and as fleur turned round she gave a delighted gasp grand mere she shouted and rushed over to embrace the tall woman who had just entered nobody would have guessed that vivienne delisle was 150 years old she did not look a day older than forty perhaps and the inexperienced observer could easily have taken her for isabeau only slightly elder sister the family likeness was unmistakable fleur ma petite she exclaimed oh how wonderful to see you again after that long time you ll have to tell your old grandmother everything about your adventures in foggy dark scotland so you didntwin but so what i ve been telling your mother it no disgrace at all to lose against harry potter you must tell me what he is like you must have got to know him a bit i expect was that a secret twinkle in her eyes but she cantpossibly know well so it was her who made mother change her attitude but i hardly know him at all grandma vivienne put a silencing finger on her granddaughter lips and now the twinkle was unmistakable not now cherie we ll have a lot of time later on why dontwe attack this beautiful lunch now you boy vernon voice came barking from downstairs get down here now harry who had dozed off woke with a start from long experience he knew it was wise to follow his uncle invitation with a heavy sigh he heaved himself from his bed why cantthe old fool not just leave me in peace i wonder what bloody stupid ideas he has now nothing pleasant for me so much is for sure i ll make one or two things perfectly clear right at the beginning of these blasted two months vernon was saying as soon as harry had entered the living room i not going to tolerate any funny business from you no visits of your weirdo friends either and you ll have to earn your living too you ll work in the garden and round the house and do whatever we tell you to do it high time you do something to pay back the generous spendings we have been lavishing on you all these years generous spendings harry grinned bitterly and could only barely refrain from a sarcastic remark i just helping them out so they donthave to throw away dudley old rags have i made myself perfectly clear boy yes uncle vernon dudley who had been clearly enjoying this was smirking broadly you might start tomorrow with cleaning up my room he gloated oh please dad make him clean up my room all right dud vernon seemed to enjoy the idea too that room of yours needs a going over anyway or so your mother tells me dudley smirk almost split his face in half by now thanks dad and to harry he said you ll start as soon as i get up for breakfast and take care not to break anything unless you want your ass kicked harry stomach was rumbling by now he had not eaten anything since the handful of chocolate frogs on the train and that had been some time around ten in the morning but he would sooner have starved than asked his uncle for some food can i go to my room now yes and dontforget i want my breakfast at seven sharp tomorrow morning i leaving early to see an important customer yes uncle vernon oh gabie it such a mystery to me fleur said to her sister when they were finally alone in the older girl room how did she change like that it only a week isntit that she left me over in the hospital wing at hogwarts where she barely looked at me and now she so completely different it almost frightening i dontunderstand it myself she was like always for three or four days after i returned with her distant and not paying attention to me not talking of you either most of the time busy somewhere else i hardly ever saw her at all then grandma arrived and i do believe that when she changed became like she is now now i not complaining of course not but i agree there something very strange about it but well let just enjoy it while we can shall we you are clever as always gabie and morgaine knows i can use anything to cheer me up oh yes of course tell me what happened after i left cedric i shouldntbe telling you this it supposed to be a secret but you are my sister so what well cedric isntreally dead wait i said not really didnti it seems the curse missed or was deflected or something and now he is something like petrified only much worse and nobody knows what to do about it but there is hope at any rate that something i believe but what about him ah gabie imagine we kissed you kissed him before didntyou but we really kissed this time and he feels the same as i do but that lovely you ve been waiting for this to happen for months the little girl face that had been beaming with joy suddenly turned serious and now you dontknow how you ll ever live through the summer without seeing him and through next year i ll have to do one more year of school dontyou forget it merde what if something happens to him and i ll not even be near him what fleur voice choked in a sob gabrielle put her arms round her soothingly things will work out she whispered i know this is something special you are having here and that why i sure everything will be all right she jumped down from the sofa they were sitting on do you know she gave me a broom for my ninth birthday so why dontwe go for a spin round the park it will do you good harry rumbling stomach kept him awake for some time he had managed to sneak down to the kitchen to get a sandwich and a glass of milk after the dursleys had gone to bed but it was far from enough to appease his hunger but finally he fell asleep in spite of it he found himself in the dark graveyard that he knew only too well he watched the dark lord rise from the cauldron and he heard wormtail say the curse he had been dreaming the same dream for the last couple of days and had always woken with a scream this time however when the first sound of the curse was uttered there was a powerful swish of wings and a white owl flew straight into his tormentor face who vanished in a bright light suddenly there was no owl any more she was there in front of him her beautiful face those fascinating deep blue eyes the silver aureole of her hair enveloped him her lips were coming nearer he couldnthave said what had woken him up but he sat up in his bed for a moment at a loss where he was and what was going on so typical hedwig he said to his owl that seemed to be watching him from her perch on top of the wardrobe there i seem to be having my first good dream for i dontknow how long and then of course i wake just when it starts getting interesting hedwig gave a low hoot as if listening do you know harry continued she looked exactly like you when she flew at that blighter wormtail in fact i thought it was you before she told me of course weird isntit i wonder will i ever see her again i already feel like i missing something like i not complete she ll be with that awful mother of hers and she ll have another year of school to do merlin knows what can happen in such a long time sounds so far away and long ago somehow was it really only a few days ago fire and water do you think there really something to it are we meant to is this a real prophecy there must be something behind it hedwig i mean why else would a girl like her get involved with a guy like me little boy she called me when she first noticed me how embarrassed i was when she caught me polishing my wand and how i felt sorry for her when she all but panicked before going out to meet that dragon and the first time she kissed me down at the lake i wouldnthave been surprised if there had smoke been coming out my ears i deserved zero she said the fun we had flying the way she hexed flowers on to malfoy head sirius likes her too and he hardly likes anybody and then in that maze she saved my neck there i sure but perhaps if the skrewt had got me cedric would have taken the cup on his own perhaps they d not have hurt him no i cantseriously wish for that we d never have kissed then wonder what she doing now if she thinking of me perhaps i ll dream of her again gradually harry eyes drooped and he drifted off to sleep again his sleep was perfectly dreamless however a n ok friends i back again after an irressponsibly long time but these things cantbe helped no there are vacations soon perhaps i ll find more leisure for writing then yes i can imagine why some of you liked the last chapter least it true that nothing at all happens but i need to lay some foundations especially when i taking different turns than in the book thus also this chapter is not exactly full of action but it has old umbridge in it and what i believe is a nice cliffhanger too chapter 10 making arrangements a couple of days went by in which fleur slowly recovered from the dementor attack she felt exhausted and spent much time sleeping or dozing in a deckchair in the shade of the ancient trees in the chateau gardens watched over and taken care of by vivienne and gabrielle her mother was mostly away on business of her own in paris she would never specify what sort of business it was and fleur for one was feeling too tired to ask she felt contented enough knowing she would be going to hogwarts and meet harry again not just meet him as she kept reminding the part of her that was still frightened everything might turn out to be some misunderstanding but be together with him for a whole school year as for her father she was so used to him being abroad somewhere in asia of africa exploring ancient tombs and other ruins looking for magical artefacts she did not spend more than a fleeting thought on him he had never been too interested in his two daughters anyway and none of the girls had ever missed him he was nice enough on the rare occasions that he visited his family but in a distant and far off sort of way that had never allowed for emotional ties to form between him and his offspring at least maman is interested in us being good at school and becoming successful members of the haute vole fleur used to muse when they came to think about gerard delacour at all i believe it shows some affection for us after all of course this had been in the time of the old mother while now isabeau was still behaving like the new mother she had turned into at fleur arrival from school so she had spent several days in blissful and dreamy idleness when one afternoon while she was having her afternoon coffee with her sister and grandmother iphigenie and margaux apparated onto the lawn behind the chateau how wonderful to see you again fleur shouted jumping up to embrace her friends yes it lovely how are you have you recovered yet margaux inquired and iphigenie added so sorry we haventcome to see you earlier but we were afraid you were not in the mood after all we should have noticed something was going on but we fleur stopped iphigenie laughing forget it i perfectly fine again as you can see and i happy to have you here again and dontblame yourselves there was really nothing you could have done sit down and have some coffee and try the delicious cake the house elves have prepared the two girls looked at each other uneasily and fleur ever observant noticed what the matter is there anything wrong erm you re not going to like this i afraid margaux began and we will of course come and see you whenever we can but it the greatest opportunity we could ever dream of what is it we re going to hogsmeade in september what and so we ll not be able to see you as often as we d like to iphigenie went on but we promise but fleur stopped their babbling hugging them enthusiastically the two girls were speechless you re not mad laughing harder than ever fleur panted but i going to hogwarts you re what yes cherie hogwarts i ll spend the entire school year there and she told her friends what her mother had decided just imagine she finished breathlessly after her eager account i might even be sorted into the same house like him but then you might as well end up in slytherin iphigenie remarked dryly but with a twinkle in her eyes i bet i won t but you re right i probably shouldntget my hopes up too high i sometimes not sure i not dreaming anyway but i sorry i quite forgot what are you going to do over there now it was the girls turn to tell about their new job in the fashion business it a great opportunity margaux stated i d never have expected to get into international haute couture so quickly if we can manage this successfully it may be the starting point of an amazing career you ll manage perfectly fleur assured her not that it very hard to show those guys what fashion really means at which margaux grinned and threw a napkin at her you are aware madame that this is a highly unusual procedure dumbledore said pensively to his visitor may i inquire why you are considering such an extraordinary measure my daughter was attacked by a dementor isabeau said with a rather dramatic air pausing to heighten the effect of this certainly uncommon statement when dumbledore just raised a polite eyebrow but refrained from any comment she went on attacked by a dementor and in the middle of muggle paris at that i need hardly stress headmaster what that means dumbledore inclined his head slightly but still did not say anything if such a thing happens it means she is not safe even in the muggle world then much less so in the magical one and i know for a fact that beauxbatons does not put great store by security at all and i also know that hogwarts is said to be the safest place in the magical world altogether so i thought a dementor you say dumbledore said suddenly as if he had only just now realised what that implied there is no doubt about that i presume of course not there was a trace of anger in the elegant woman voice perhaps an accident or a mistake no i am perfectly sure the foul creature was going exactly for her and nobody else and small wonder to be sure after what happened at the final task of the triwizard tournament ah for the first time in the conversation dumbledore leaned forward with signs of interest so you actually believe what the papers term irresponsible rumour mongering or fantasies of an attention seeking mentally unstable adolescent and sometimes also first signs of incipient senile dementia his eyes twinkled behind the half moon glasses for a moment isabeau delacour seemed put off but she caught herself instantly it doesnt matter i daresay some of the ideas expressed by that boy were perhaps a result of his overstrained emotions or whatever but it obvious that something did happen there was a death after all and it stands to reason that my daughter whether she intended to or not was involved in those events so i would be an irresponsible fool not to come to this conclusion you will agree of course dumbledore nodded his assent so what you propose is to send your daughter to hogwarts for how long i thought this was obvious for the entire school year of course i not going to have her miss anything in her education it her last school year and she ll be taking her finals here in hogwarts then it will perhaps even be good for her magical education too after all hogwarts is considered to be the best magical school in all of europe dumbledore made a deprecating gesture as she went on i would appreciate it very much headmaster if you could grant my request a mother s foremost concern must always be her daughter well being of course dumbledore said again i will have to inform the school board of this naturally but i think i can assure you right now this is just a formality she has been here before and will know her ways already and as far as i am aware her english is also good enough to allow her to follow lessons without any problems now and then there may be some deficits due to differences in the french and british curricula but if she is quick enough on the uptake this should be no problem if needs be i know exactly the person to tutor her if isabeau was not happy about the idea of somebody tutoring her daughter she did at any rate not show it thank you headmaster she said with her most charming smile so i will see to it that she arrives here on september first what time would you require her to be here the feast begins at eight but as she will have to be sorted into one of the houses and this will have to happen together with the first year students i would advise that she arrive no later than six o clock she will be there isabeau said shortly rising from her chair well thank you once again for your cooperation i feel a lot better now she extended her hand which dumbledore who had also risen politely and stepped out from behind his desk put to his lips shortly i am sure madame your daughter will find her time here most enjoyable he said his eyes twinkling more than ever and i look forward to having her with us au revoir madame it was a pleasure talking to you and please give my regards to your esteemed mother well fawkes dumbledore said to the phoenix who during the interview had been sitting on his perch quietly eying the visitor with his unblinking beady eyes this is most interesting indeed he looked at the silver sneakoscope on the shelf behind the desk that was spinning madly on its axis and smiled to himself stop smirking phineas he said to one of the portraits on the wall i am quite aware that she is an attractive woman but you after all are just a memory on canvas the minister of magic was sitting in his chair behind his desk which was littered with important looking papers lesser minds might have had doubts about the importance of such papers as suggestions on new standards regulating import tariffs on flying carpets but the minister cool business like mind as he liked to see himself knew otherwise and anyway they came in rather handy to demonstrate to visitors what a busy and therefore highly important person the occupant of this office was you were asking to see me cornelius dumbledore inquired politely on entering the room yes yes the minister voice took on the tone of a mixture of haughtiness and self consciousness that it always acquired when he was talking to the headmaster the truth was of course that he felt abysmally inferior to dumbledore and therefore loathed him deeply but as he was also frightened of the powerful wizard he was doing his best to hide those feelings not very successfully as dumbledore could have told him but he did not ask to hide his uneasiness he started busily shuffling a stack of papers draft for new limits of pewter alloys in industrial cauldrons on his desk pretending to be engrossed in important tasks patiently dumbledore conjured a comfortable red chintz chair and sat down in front of the minister desk calmly surveying the room of course he had been in fudge office countless times before but the many photographs on the walls all of them showing the fat short man in his ridiculous attire complete with green bowler hat at important occasions initiating the new floo network control system or unveiling the new statue of oberon the oblivious in diagon alley never failed to amuse him basically what followed was a test of nerves and the outcome of course was clear from the beginning some five or six minutes had passed when fudge finally had found a satisfying place for his stack of papers he put them down and stroked them lovingly then turned his attention to the headmaster yes he repeated rather absurdly well albus the thing is erm the new school year is about to start and you still dontseem to have found that new defence against the dark arts teacher that hogwarts needs i fully aware of the fact minister dumbledore admitted in quite a cheerful voice but if i may remind you there is still time the deadline after which the ministry will have the right to suggest its own candidate is on the fifteenth today is already the tenth fudge growled impatiently why do you expect to find someone if you haventbeen able to do so in all the past weeks well let just say that an idea came to me the other day dumbledore said vaguely i ll let you know if it turns out to be successful but do you mean you have found someone it not exactly easy you know people say the job is cursed which does not really seem to encourage applicants yes i have indeed found a person willing to take that blasted job fudge straightened in his chair importantly my congratulations cornelius dumbledore voice betrayed nothing but mild surprise may i inquire as to that brave person identity this seeming compliance had a mitigating effect on the minister but of course albus he almost crowed in satisfaction actually this is exactly what i called you for he rang a small silver bell on his desk and pretty young witch appeared through a side door yes minster ah cheryl will you tell madam umbridge to come in please yes minister with a charming smile perhaps a bit too charming for a secretary the young witch left leaving the door ajar through which presently a woman entered at whose sight dumbledore groaned inwardly short and rather heavily built and in her fifties or so she was quite incongruously dressed in pink robes with a childish pink bow in her short curly her her flat and flabby face with the protruding eyes had a toadlike quality about it without showing any of his emotion dumbledore rose to his feet politely an extended his hand so it is you dolores who would be willing to undertake the strenuous task let me congratulate on your courage thank you ever so much headmaster she replied in a high simpering voice and with a smile that did not reach her cold eyes i just endeavour to please the dear minister here it will be nice though to be back at dear old hogwarts again when do you want me to come i expect it would be a good idea to be there early to make preparations arrangements you know i would be honoured dolores and i appreciate your willingness to leave your fascinating job here at the ministry to help hogwarts out in a difficult situation dumbledore said in his most polite voice however as i was just pointing out to the minister he just narrowly avoided to say dear minister the deadline for the ministry to appoint a dada teacher of their own has not been reached yet there are still a few days left and as i was also saying a little idea of my own has just come up that i want to look into first i am sure you will understand this dolores however should my little idea come to nothing i will be only too happy to inform you immediately as you wish headmaster dolores umbridge said almost gnashing her teeth and altogether making a bad job of pretending not to care would you care to tell me dumbledore the equally disgruntled minister interjected what that mysterious idea of yours is all about you dontactually have a concrete person in mind have you or moreover who would be willing to take that blasted job especially for the pay you can offer he finished with a smirk yes the ministry funding has been a tiny bit less than generous recently dumbledore agreed with a serene smile however to answer your question yes i have indeed a person in mind a person i may add who will be more than competent in this function with a rather comprehensive practical experience in various fields i must admit i haventyet asked whether that person would be interesting in taking the post but i have some reason to believe there will be no problem at any rate should i be mistaken i ll gladly accept your offer there was not much for fudge but to say rather stiffly well i can only wish you luck dumbledore and now if you ll excuse me i have important work to do and he took up the stack of papers again and started leafing through it pretending to be engrossed in pewter alloys thank you minister dumbledore replied in his most pleasant voice he rose and vanished his chair with a careless wave of his wand then he went over to the door and opened it after you dolores he said bowing to her slightly i am sure your talents could be put to much better use with the ministry so let hope you wonthave to sacrifice it for a dull teaching job young people can be quite tiring these days have a very nice day umbridge glaring at him with ill concealed fury swept past him without a word a good day to you too minister dumbledore said cheerfully to fudge who did not glance up from his papers you should not work so hard it isntreally good for your health and now i really have to hurry there a rather urgent letter i have to write a n so what are your bets who going to be the new dada teacher keep your fingers crossed for me that i can update he next piece sooner and dontforget to keep those reviews coming a n finally they arrive at hogwarts another chapter without much action but necessary for the course of the story thank you all for the reviews everpresent sorry if my idea of au annoys you but i not going to weave in the events of book 5 i just using the characters you dontknow what i have got in store for dear dolores do you desert fox thanks for the history lesson i was just too lazy to look up the exact dates of course porthos is from dumas famous novel roman legion sounds like a good idea will you give me technical advice like vocabulary techniques etc japanese jew mademoiselle is miss madame is mrs married woman jollander i must have made a mistake i didntintend him to be really nice to him yes screwtape is from csl own special hell i just borrowed him he seems to be exactly the type that would work in a ministry sorry if the spacing between places of action does not work i always put in between but apparently it does not always show now without further ado here is chapter 12 going to hogwarts and how am i supposed to get to hogwarts with all this stuff fleur asked looking at the accumulated luggage a huge trunk three large bags a bulky cauldron the cat basket and her broomstick i think i could always go in my owl form but not a good idea cherie her grandmother interrupted as far as we know harry is the only one who is aware of this power of yours and it always a good thing to keep the enemy in the dark about yourself as much as possible it would be impossible to hide and would give away a very important secret as it befits a delacour you will travel in style isabeau said and so i have made arrangements for you to go in the family coach the family coach but mother i mean i appreciate it and everything but just imagine it about the most spectacular way of arriving it would make me the centre of attention for the entire school and everybody would talk about me for weeks you ll be the centre of attention anyway her grandmother remarked dryly and they will stare at you and gossip about you no matter what you do even without the uncontrolled veela charm at work no it probably not such a bad idea to fill them with a bit of respect right away i have already given instructions isabeau put an end to the discussion and you are travelling tomorrow morning at ten so you will easily be on time for the sorting ceremony ah the sorting gabrielle interjected eagerly which house do you think the hat will put you in i dontthink it will make much of a difference fleur said trying to sound indifferent as long as it not slytherin of course what wrong with slytherin her mother asked several of the greatest wizards in history came from there but including voldemort fleur retorted causing the others to wince at the name and i dontintend to get caught up with that lot i sure you ll get sorted into gryffindor anyway gabrielle exclaimed i mean well i ll see about that tomorrow and i ll send you an owl first thing in the evening i promise oh i cantwait to see all their faces in due course at ten o clock next morning the delacour family coach drew up in the drive in front of the mansion and even though fleur knew it of course she couldnthelp feeling impressed by the spectacle the coach resembled a smaller version of the beauxbatons carriage huge wheels a gilded body complete with the family crest a red rose on a silver shield adorning the doors and drawn by a pair of dazzlingly white flying horses with golden mane and tail that reminded fleur of the unicorn she had encountered at hogwarts the luggage had already been stowed away by the house elves and so all that remained was for fleur to say good bye to her family which she did tearfully she could not have said herself whether these were tears of joy at going to see harry again or of sadness at leaving all her family behind thank you maman thank you she whispered as she embraced her mother surprised how sincere her feelings toward the formerly cold and distant woman had become during the two summer months oh i so happy then she turned to her grandmother to hug her too and thank you for teaching me she said oh i dontknow what i d have done without you vivienne stroked her hair and held her close you know i d do anything for you cherie she told her just dontforget what i tried to make you understand gabrielle was sobbing when fleur turned and bent down to cup her cheeks in her hands it so unfair she choked now you ll be away for all those months and you ll forget about me and that not true gabie and you know it fleur told her little sister sternly but with a heavy heart nevertheless she knew exactly how she must feel and she felt a little guilty feeling so happy to get away and i promise i ll owl you and visit you as often as i can but you you ll have so many more important things to do the rest was lost in indistinct sounds as she buried her face in fleur chest at a loss for words as she was aware that gabrielle words were probably true fleur continued patting her for a minute but at last isabeau gently extricated gabrielle from her embrace shh cherie she said to her perhaps we can go and visit her in scotland what do you say gabrielle looked up at her incredulously and smiled through her tears oh maman that would be lovely i ll see what we can do cherie at last fleur broke free from her family and went over to the coach whose door opened by itself as she approached she climbed up the two steps and into the carriage and the door silently closed behind her she turned round and leaned out of the window to wave at the three people in the doorway of the mansion au revoir with a jolt but definitely softer than the beauxbatons carriage the flying horses started to pull and presently the coach left the ground and climbed steeply into the clear blue sky in london meanwhile the various book lists had arrived and much to harry chagrin he had not been allowed to join the weasleys in their expedition to diagon alley to get all the school things they needed no harry arthur weasley had told him gently but firmly i do understand how you feel about this but it definitely too dangerous i afraid you ll have to stay home if home you can call it we will make sure to get everything for you even fred and george seemed to agree with their father opinion which harry took as a sign of the seriousness of his situation so there was nothing for him but to wait for them to come back in the evening before their departure they were all busy packing their things together and it took several shrinking charms to get the lot into their trunks it high time we go back to school harry told ron as they were both jumping on top of their trunks in attempt to close them i dontthink i could put up with this place much longer yeah mate ron grunted in agreement straining to close the buckle of the leather strap on his trunk these have been some rather boring days to be sure lucky we got that old french bloke to teach us fencing that was some fun at least i d never have thought it possible but yes i clearly looking forward to getting back to the old monkey house just think of it quidditch again that alone will make up for those boring history of magic lessons wontit right you are mate but perhaps not for old greasy git not quite i afraid yeah said harry with a sigh i guess you have a point here at the diner table there was a distinct air of cheerfulness except for sirius who kept scowling at the others thoroughly frustrated at not being allowed to leave the house the next day no sirius dumbledore had told him in his strictest voice we can expect the enemy to keep a close look out for harry and they ll notice the slightest detail around him at least as soon as he arrives at the platform but most likely very soon after we leave the house and you can be perfectly sure that seeing a large black dog around harry will tell voldemort a good deal so i really must insist that you stay here sirius had said nothing but he was in a sour mood all evening naturally the one most excited about getting back to hogwarts was hermione she kept chatting away about the coming subjects telling everyone how much she had already been reading about them i cantunderstand how bridget wenlock could overlook this aspect of the number seven she would say ignoring the boys exasperated sighs it so obvious and she would look things up in her books and scribble calculations on slips of parchment which she then would lose and start looking for frantically in such a mood it was best to keep away from her however one thing made harry feel uneasy i do hope fleur is all right he used to say more to himself than to anybody in particular i haventheard from her ever since that dementor attack i understand about all these security schemes but i d really like to know how she is and she ll go back to her school and then there ll be no way for us to meet for merlin knows how long and all ron could do was nod and make sympathetic noises rather unexpectedly harry spent an almost undisturbed night he woke only once with the feeling of something unpleasant but he could not remember the slightest bit of his dream and he had certainly not screamed as ron continuing snoring told him and woke in the early morning feeling full of energy eager to get things going something he had not felt for weeks they assembled in the kitchen for a quick breakfast and then it was time to go sirius be careful please harry said to his godfather hugging him awkwardly they are all looking for you and i dontwant anything to happen to you sirius made indistinct noises in his throat and returned his hug energetically be sure to tell me whenever there is a problem harry i always there for you you know the party that had assembled in the hall was fairly large besides the six hogwarts students there were arthur and molly weasley remus lupin alastor moody and tonks what on earth said ron surprised i mean i can understand you mum and dad but what about the rest we ll be your escort moody said gruffly canttake any risks can we constant vigilance now i understand what dumbledore was talking about hermione remarked there no way you know who could ever not notice this crowd are you sure this is a good idea it the only way i afraid arthur said and hermione had to agree after putting levitation spells on their trunks they left the house and it was only now that harry could see its surroundings the area must have been quite wealthy some hundred years or so ago but now it was a neglected and derelict neighbourhood many of the houses were deserted their windows boarded up or broken the small park in the centre of the square was barren and full of litter after leaving the house harry turned round and was surprised to see that it had vanished there was only an empty patch of ground between two other houses we ve put a charm on it of course tonks who saw his surprise told him only selected people can see it and enter it they had no way of knowing if their party had already been detected by voldemort that there was no way to avoid the curious stares of muggles was very obvious however not surprisingly so too six teenagers lugging huge heavy looking old fashioned trunks along the streets would be extraordinary enough in themselves but as said teenagers were accompanied by a group of adults in what to the muggle eye seemed fancy dress to say nothing of moody scarred face and tonks lime green waist long hair they attracted quite a lot of attention and the fact that arthur carried hedwig in her cage did not exactly make them less conspicuous they had to walk for a couple of minutes until they reached the underground station although arthur had been travelling in the underground before he was still fascinated and could only barely be restrained from uttering his admiration of course in the narrow spaces of the underground coaches the attention they attracted was even greater and finally moody had to mutter an obliviate charm because it simply got too much at last they got off at king cross and in due course ended up on platform 9 where the hogwarts express was already under steam as soon as they had arrived fred and george disappeared in the crowds looking for their friends and leaving the others to look after themselves from the beginning harry could not help but notice that his fellow students seemed to be divided into two groups there were those who were looking at him with a good deal of respect sometimes mixed with fear and then there were others regarding him with disdain even contempt sometimes snickering when they believed he would not notice he was just going to ask ron about this when angelina johnson approached them grinning at them widely hi harry she said cheerfully good to see you back no she added turning suddenly serious i not going to ask you if you had a nice holiday but it great to have you here with us we ll have to find us a new captain now that wood has left how about you harry me no way but why not yourself and although she made deprecating noises it was clear that she felt highly pleased with harry suggestion they found themselves an empty compartment and settled down comfortably while the train started on its journey north it did not take long until harry was to find out why some of his schoolmates were looking at him so strangely well well well came a familiar drawling voice as the compartment door was opened if it not the nutcase himself had any more hallucinations recently potty any more dark lords climbing out of cauldrons i always knew you had more imagination than was good for you shut up malfoy harry said automatically not even bothering to look up from the book he was reading ah high and mighty arentwe you ll get smaller still mudbloods and mudblood lovers will be first four combined curses hit him full in the face and chest hurling him backwards into the wall where he collapsed in a heap while two huge elephant like ears were sprouting from his head why canthe keep his big fat mouth shut ron remarked quietly care for a game of chess harry fleur journey was uneventful if somewhat boring and she passed the hours daydreaming about being back with harry darkness fell slowly and then she felt the coach slowly descending until she could make out the many turreted silhouette of hogwarts how different this second arrival was from the first she remembered how she had felt lonely a bit frightened and very unhappy and now was it really a year she was happy happy like she did not remember being ever before she was going back to be with the one person in the world that meant most to her more even she had to admit than her beloved little sister soon the coach came to a halt in front of the massive oaken gate and fleur got up from her seat to step out onto the gravel path leading up to them the timing could not have been more exact at the very same moment that the winged horses touched the ground the first of the horseless carriages that were bringing the students from the train station arrived and of course everybody in them gaped and stared without at the moment having any idea who it was that had just made such a spectacular appearance in something almost like panic fleur hurried towards the door hat led into the castle noiselessly they opened in front of her she was at a complete loss what do to or where to go now but seemingly out of nowhere dumbledore appeared by her side bon soir mademoiselle delacour he said smiling at her kindly i have been expecting you will you please accompany me your luggage will be looked after you know you have to be sorted first yes good the students will take their seats presently and then we will proceed he took her arm and led her into a side chamber just as the huge doors opened again and the crowds of students streamed into the hall who do you think was in that awesome carriage ron asked no idea mate harry told him and even know it all hermione could only shake her head there was a silver crest with a red rose on the door she mused but i ve never come across anything like it must be an important person at any rate it isntmany people that can afford to travel like that could it be the new dada teacher perhaps ginny suggested cool said ron if they are as impressive in their lessons as in their travelling we re in for a treat this year but appearances can be very misleading hermione remarked critically going red as she remembered her secret crush on the impostor gilderoy lockhart just think of professor lupin finally they had reached the long gryffindor table and settled down the high table at the head of the room was already occupied by the familiar teachers there was no new face among them but they noted that there was one free seat dumbledore high chair was also still empty no surprise yet ron said sounding disappointed you dontthink we ll have snape teach us dada too do you they say he been after the job for years nobody in their right mind would be after that job hermione replied not after what been happening to them the last four years there an empty chair see that must be the one i wonder where dumbledore is no matter grumbled ron i hope they get it over with quickly i hungry this earned him a reproachful look from hermione but before she could say anything a door opened and the headmaster entered silence fell as dumbledore went over to his seat raised his arms in greeting and sat down now mcgonagall entered from the back of the room a long line of tiny looking first years trailing after her she went briskly up to the dais where the sorting stool had already been placed carrying the old battered sorting hat which she placed on the stool as usual the hat sang its welcoming song and as usual hardly any of the students listened they got a vague impression that it was about friendship and loyalty and smoothing out differences among yourselves in short more or less what the old hat sang every year then the sorting started and the small first years most of them frightened and insecure were sent to their respective houses after the last one zoroaster zephyra a tiny arabic looking girl had been sorted into gryffindor she doesntlook very brave does she muttered ginny dumbledore rose again before we can let the fest begin my friends even though i am sure you have been waiting eagerly for it here he seemed to glance directly at ron there is one more sorting to be taken there was a general murmur nothing like this had ever happened before most unusual i know dumbledore went on after the murmur had died down but as you may remember me telling you not so long ago these are unusual times yes we have one more student to be sorted whom all of you i trust will accept with due friendliness and hospitality my friends he waved his hand towards the door behind him which opened slowly harry could no believe his eyes fleur he shouted a n of course this is exactly the place to stop what do you think which house is fleur going to be sorted into wait until the next chapter a n so here i am again after great holidays in mexico and a rather disappointing reading of hbp but as this is neot of much importence concerning fleur adventures let just continue with the story chapter 15 fleur second class in the morning was ancient runes a subject she had always liked in particular and she found she was well ahead of her class mates thankfully roger davis was not among them generally it was not a subject that seemed to be popular with the hogwarts students there were only five others besides herself and aurora who were the only ravenclaws in the lunch break fleur who had been wondering during most of the runes lesson whether it would not have been wise to overcome her prejudice against english breakfasts went to the great hall her stomach rumbling together with aurora cho was already at the ravenclaw table when she saw fleur she rose and went over to her there is something i want to ask you she began you ll be surprised perhaps it being your first day and everything but would you want to play in the quidditch team what of all things this was the one fleur had least expected yes quidditch quaffle bludgers snitch quidditch but you dontlike competitive sports i know but we need at least one new player and i know you are a very skilful flyer with an excellent broom and you ve been practising with harry potter a smile flitted across her face fleur felt herself blush well said fleur hesitantly do it for me please all right i will but i not going to slam bludgers all over the place thank you fleur you are a great friend tryouts are friday afternoon ah well perhaps i ll not be good enough anyway oh but you will be fleur you will i ve seen you and with this she walked away only now fleur realised that as a member of the ravenclaw quidditch team she would have to play against harry potter after lunch which turned out to be a far more informal affair than at beauxbatons everybody just wandering or rushing as the case might be in and out the great hall to grab a bite of food or to sit down at length fleur felt the need to be on her own before the next class dada was starting so she made her excuses to aurora and the others and walked out of the castle towards the lake and the stone bench where she had kissed harry for the first time it was in a turmoil of feelings that she went down the familiar path things turned out to be more complicated than she had imagined she was not sure what she had expected herself when it had become certain she was going to spend a year at hogwarts somehow the vague thought that she would be near harry had been dominating her rational thinking and she believed she had taken it for granted she was going to be in the same house with him and could more or less be together with him for most of the time as it had turned out as she reproached herself for being too na ve being in a different house meant that there was a rather strict set of rules and obligations that made just meeting him subject to chance more than anything being two years apart there was not even a chance of being in the same classes together so it was not in a very cheerful mood that she finally approached the place that had somehow burned itself into her memory and she could hardly believe her eyes when she saw someone already sitting there not just someone of course but harry she yelled and dashed towards him flinging her arms around him and seeking his mouth with hers eagerly fleur he gasped when he found enough air to breathe again how how i come to be here you mean i i just felt me too i couldntreally say why i i just wanted to get some fresh air and somehow i landed here oh harry do you do you think this could be some link between us again like like the dementor i still dontunderstand it merlin i donteven really know what was going on so fleur had to tell him about her experiences in the park of sacre coeur which she did still shuddering at the recollection for a short time harry said nothing just put his arms around her holding her close yes they are about the most horrible things he said after a while i know donti and you really believe it was me my grandmother said so she said quietly and i admit i like the idea with a weak smile she raised her head to gaze into his deep green eyes dumbledore seems to think something similar but he didntsay much about it and now it may have happened again only a lot more nicely so you dontknow how no i ve absolutely no idea it just seems to happen you mean if we could control it make it happen exactly oh harry it would be so lovely perhaps we should try to find out more about what did dumbledore call it empathy that what my grandmother said yes it may be well worth researching maybe i should set hermione on to hat task researching is her lifeblood if there is anything to be found i bet she will find it dontlook like that he added seeing the shadow that crossed fleur face at the mentioning of hermione name i aware that you are still not quite at ease with her being with me most at the time but i can tell you she is only interested in ron indeed for a moment the memory of the boggart in the maze during the third task of the tournament had flitted through fleur mind i know i being stupid she said embarrassed and blushing most prettily i dontmean to be jealous it just dontsay anything more harry told her softly she is my best friend just like ron and that all there is to it and ever will be he broke off for a tender kiss and then continued you however are so much more the next couple of minutes were dedicated o more kissing but at last harry rose reluctantly pulling fleur with him it time to go i afraid it would not do to be in trouble for being late in the very first potions lesson of the school year would it not with snape being the teacher at that snape fleur asked what the matter with him everybody seems to be frightened of him just you wait harry said darkly you ll find out soon enough fortunately for fleur who had no idea where her afternoon lesson dada was taking place and would not have found the classroom even if she had had she ran into lyra on the corridor the inevitable parrot on her shoulder i was just wondering where you had got to lyra remarked didntquite expect you to know your ways around already you re right are you also going to dada now good then i not lost what a piece of luck it a very important subject isntit who is teaching it lyra looked at her in surprise for a moment of course you wontknow she replied dada has always had some mystery around it in all the six years i ve been at this school not a single dada teacher lasted longer than a year some people say there is a curse on the job which i personally think is silly but it is true that we have had the oddest assortment of people teaching it even a werewolf can you imagine a werewolf and they allowed him to teach here they didntknow until the end of the year that is i sure dumbledore did know but the ministry didnt and then he had to resign of course but he was a nice person and a good teacher at least last year we had a death eater in disguise but you may already know that you were here werentyou and nobody knows who it going to be this year perhaps a vampire fleur joked or a veela lyra retorted looking at her pointedly well we ll find out in a few moments here is the classroom and while fleur was still debating with herself how to react to this remark she opened the door and walked in so fleur had no choice but follow her if lyra had expected to find the new teacher already in the classroom she was disappointed the fairly large room was filled with students however it was the largest of the classes fleur had been to so far dada was definitely one of the more important subjects cal and aurora were already there seated a desk with two empty seats and so lyra and fleur made their way towards them and sat down too an eager chatter filled the room obviously everybody curiosity about the new teacher was at boiling point and lyra entered into a discussion of the topic with the two other girls fleur who lacked the background knowledge and feelings of the hogwarts students and to whom each of the teachers was equally new did not share the general excitement and found leisure to look around and take stock of the other students in the class she noticed that ravenclaw was the house strongest represented seven of them including roger of course she thought and another boy she had not noticed before six gryffindors among them katie bell whom she remembered from charms and two other girls then there were three hufflepuffs celia reed among them and four slytherins whoever it is aurora was just saying to nobody in particular they are taking their time lesson started ten minutes ago i beginning to wonder if there is a teacher at all rubbish sensible cal interrupted her they would have told us if the lesson had been cancelled wouldntthey i say put in katie who had sat down next to them isntit rather cold in here and indeed somehow the room temperature seemed to have gone slowly down without them realising it by now most of the students were rubbing their hands to get warm and fleur noticed how her breath was forming small white clouds in front of her face an uneasy feeling was creeping up on her and when she shivered it was not just from the cold in the others faces she could see fear creeping up slowly at least it isntgetting dark the thought but even as she did it seemed to her the lights were fading too dontbe silly she scolded herself this is hogwarts the safest place in europe but her uneasiness grew and in the back of her mind she felt panic stirring celia reed was the first to crack let me out of here she screamed suddenly her outburst was like a signal screams suddenly filled the classroom and a mad dash towards the door started with what remained of her will power fleur held on to the desk in front of her to stop herself from following the urge to join the stampede impedimenta there wash a flash of lightning a loud voice cut through the air and the mad rush for the door changed into something from a slow motion film her terror suddenly gone fleur could muster her strength and take her surrounding in again the first thing she noticed were her white knuckled hands gripping the desk as if her life depended on it when she lifted her gaze from her hands she saw that besides her only lyra and roger davies had not joined the others in her panic even cool rational calliope was among the crowd heading for the door lifting her head further she finally found the cause of the sudden change of events a tall woman in the black teachers robes had appeared seemingly out of thin air in front of the teacher desk from under her high pointed hat stone grey hair was flowing halfway down to her waist and steel blue eyes shone in a face that seemed ageless as the sea finite incantatem with a careless wave of her wand the woman lifted the spell it was as if the students were waking from a dream a nightmare more exactly they blinked shook themselves like wet dogs looked at the newcomer bewildered then embarrassed and after a moment or two slowly found their seats at the desks everyone gaped at the apparition nobody spoke good afternoon class the woman addressed them when the last of the students had sat down when nobody answered she went on and there was an amused tone in her voice this class is called defence against the dark arts you know and i thought it might be a good idea to give you just a very subtle taste of what you could find yourselves up against when dealing with this branch of magic i see it worked well much too well i must say and i afraid there will be a year very hard work in front of all of us just a simple panicking curse and most of you threw all reason to the winds her stern features softened and a smile played round her lips as she added in case you wonder about that flash this was just for effect it doesntmean anything but now to business she put her wand away in the sleeve of her robes and sat down on the teacher desk surveying the class as you probably have guessed by now i am your defence teacher this year and please dontlet me hear this absurd expression dada that students seem so fond of using it a much too serious affair to call it like a rather stupid branch of muggle arts just say defence if you must be short so i am professor vivian woods and i ll be teaching you this year now to begin with i think it will be useful for you to introduce yourselves so i can remember your names and houses in due course each student rose and gave their name and the professor nodded and repeated it when she reached fleur desk lyra stood up lyra parry she said briefly looking the professor straight in the eyes lyra parry indeed the professor repeated something she had not done before her gaze came to rest on the parrot that was still perched on lyra shoulder how interesting and i noticed you were among the few who could resist my little experiment well done miss parry you seem to have more than average talents quite unusual for her lyra blushed thank you professor she said quietly i know who you are miss delacour the professor said before fleur had time to stand up and give her name and i am especially pleased to have you in my class please be so kind as to stay behind after class i have to talk to you to roger davies she said after he had introduced himself i must commend you on your ability to resist the curse too mr davies you also seem to have special talents and i hope you will use them wisely at last she returned to the teacher desk to address the class again as you all know without doubt the field of the dark arts is wide and varied indeed you could say that the term itself is not exact darkness magical darkness is rather a set of the mind that a system of curses or noxious potions basically all magic can be turned into a dark art if the caster of the spell uses it with a dark mind on the other hand of course there is a wide area of magic that has been developed with the purpose of causing harm and it is this filed that concerns us in the defence class now i expect you will have dealt with dark creatures how to recognise them and how to defend yourselves against them an affirmative murmur ran through the class this was second and third year stuff and i am sure you dealt with protection against the physical curses like blasting or reducto they had done so in years four to six good so this final year as those who also attend charms will already have heard you are dealing with protection against the most advanced and most dangerous sort of curses those that deal with the mind and the beginning of this lesson was already an example of what i am talking about here tell me miss clearwater what did you feel and how did you react calliope rose turning slightly pink i i not sure professor there was this weird creepy feeling as if cold was seeping slowly into my every nerve and then when there was that scream something broke i believe i could not think clearly anymore there was just that overpowering need to get out i she broke off embarrassed and sat down heavily professor woods smiled there is really no need to be ashamed of your reaction miss clearwater it is just what is to be expected under the circumstances it needs a good deal of training or a strongly developed natural talent to resist the panicking curse especially when taken unawares i am sure if i put that curse on you again now and warned you of it too more of you would b able to resist it but she added seeing some of the students expressions there will be time enough for this sort of practice for now i think we can consider this lesson closed for homework or rather for preparation of next lesson please revise what you have learned about warding of curses during your past years class dismissed miss delacour a word with you if you please i wonder what she wants with you lyra said to fleur as they rose from their seats i have no idea fleur replied slightly uneasily i ll see you at dinner then and she went over to the teacher desk while the rest of the students left the classroom talking excitedly among themselves fifou thanks for the advice it always good to have experts helping you why dontyou give me your mail address then i can ask you when something comes up and no your english is definitely not poor at all as someone has said it may be time for a disclaimer again so here it is i do not and never have nor ever will own harry potter if did i d certainly have written hbp differently a n so here the mystery of the new dada teacher is finally lifted thanks for all the great reviews and special thanks to maxime labelle who helped me out with the piece of french conversation also let me apologize for an error in the story though perhaps i shouldn t as nobody seems to have noticed it so far does anybody now that i have mentioned it chapter 16 the new teacher the professor busied herself with some papers on her desk obviously waiting fort the last students to leave the classroom only when fleur was the only one left she turned to her smiling widely je suis tres heureuse de toi voir enfin cherie comment va tu fleur looked at her completely dumbfounded ne reconnais tu pas ta propre grand m re c est impossible est ce vraiment toi she could not believe it there was so absolutely no similarity between this elderly grey haired female and her fair gorgeous grandmother look at my eyes cherie you ll see it here and indeed this convinced fleur deep down there was the familiar spark that she knew so well with a sound that was part laugh and part sob she threw herself into the woman outstretched arms oh grandma why how just sit down dear and let me tell you briefly what you need to know you know that your mother talked to dumbledore about your transfer here apparently she reminded him of me and he wrote me a letter asking me if i would be willing to take the vacant post as defence teacher at hogwarts now i had already been wondering how i could arrange it so that i would be able to keep an eye on you dontlook so annoyed dear i know how you hate what you call being controlled but i thought what with the dark lord back and everything and you seemingly a target it would be a good idea anyway you will understand that nothing could have been more welcome to me than that letter so i accepted dumbledore offer and well here i am but grandma why i mean your erm appearance yes i quite proud of my disguise it a good one isntit you mean why but isntit obvious just think about it for a minute imagine i d walked into this classroom looking like i normally do what would have happened well everybody would have seen you re a veela and and then they of course they d have assumed you were favouring me and not only that you know how many people look at non or part human persons dontyou now is it so hard to imagine all the conspiracy theories that would have cropped up no it would have been a very bad idea so i brewed myself this clever potion that gives me a distinguished professor like appearance and nobody will get any stupid ideas ingenuous does dumbledore know of course he does what do you think but he is the only one not even the staff have been told let alone the ministry and it is most important that nobody finds out can i at least tell harry well i expect that eventually you will but why not play a little game and give him small hints so that he can find out himself and if that friend of his that girl what her name is as clever as you say she is she will not have much trouble either somehow the idea of giving hermione a nut to crack appealed to fleur and so she agreed but grandma will you ever let the school know hmm i might or i might not i not sure really certainly not before your graduation cherie at any rate and i dontknow perhaps they ll let me keep the job too it would be a first you know the last five years no dada sorry defence teacher lasted longer than a year they say there is a curse on the job yes dumbledore fair as ever told me about that but then looking at the sort of teachers during the last couple of years it no wonder and anyway i told him i was not afraid so who knows i might actually like it here although i must say the place is a bit damp and i expect i ll have to use some huge heating charms to survive in winter and will you stay like this all the school year dontyou donti miss looking good vivienne said with a smile indeed a bit of vanity is one of the veela characteristics but i ll do my best not to think of it the potion lasts for a month and i have to take it at least every 28 days to make sure there is not interruption in the effects yes there is no way i can be myself during the school year but i do hope you dontlove me for my looks at which fleur could only giggle and hug her grandmother energetically but to more serious matters vivienne continued i noticed that three of you managed to resist my little experiment now you as my relation should have found it easiest i believe as to the other two there was that boy roger davies fleur said bitterly i told you about him remember yes the one who managed if not to resist the veela charm to at least twist it and use it for his own purpose obviously he is gifted in this particular area and then there was that girl with the parrot lyra she strikes me as a very unusual person dontyou think so oh yes most unusual indeed i ve been wondering about that parrot too there doesntseem to be a place she goes without it him i should say he called orest and i not sure yet but i believe he can talk that what parrots tend to do cherie no i mean really talk understand and give meaningful answers well you just may be mistaken you have not been with this lyra for a very long time actually and there are quite strange things when it comes to magical creatures fleur thought of crookshanks and agreed now this girl lyra her grandmother continued is someone i need to keep my eye on just as on you and our friend roger davies actually i believe i ll invite the three of you to private tutoring lessons to work on your talent of resistance against curses but grandma fleur complained you know what sort of person he is i dontwant to even be in the same room with him and you want me to work together with him i understand dear but when it comes to fighting the dark lord such feelings must be put aside besides she added with a sly grin who knows perhaps you ll get a chance or two to pay him back well i dontthink i d be interested but if you say so fleur replied doubtfully then a thought struck her you want to work with us because we could resist that curse right so i guess it would be an idea to find more students who can do that yes i think so why are you asking harry grandma they say he could even resist the imperius curse last year really has he told you so no not him he d be afraid of seeming to show off but cho told me that most interesting if he really could then it might indeed be a good idea to have him in our study group even if he is two years younger go and check with him as soon as possible if it true tell me and i ll arrange the necessary formalities with dumbledore it seems these british are such suckers for rules and deadlines and whatnot that it will probably require a minor miracle to allow a fifth year student to study with seventh years i d like to have him in this group to be sure he must be an absolutely extraordinary boy and i dying to get to know him anyway oh grandma don t you re making me jealous about half an hour later harry and the other gryffindors entered the same classroom just as fleur classmates they were all eager to find out about the new defence teacher xxx i bet it some other incompetent freak ron said with a wide grin perhaps another lockhart what do you think and he nudged hermione who went instantly red and muttered something incomprehensible her crush on gilderoy lockhart was still something she preferred not to be reminded of i heard dumbledore himself is going to teach us neville piped up he could not find a new teacher so he going to do it himself that would be great lavender said there nobody better than dumbledore not that all of them were impossible harry interjected i wouldntmind to have lupin back for example eee a werewolf parvati rolled her eyes he may have been a good teacher i admit but still i d never feel quite comfortable near him this just shows hermione turned to her angrily but she never got to say what it showed the classroom went suddenly completely dark and there was a collective shriek as nobody could see anything but blackness nobody move came a loud booming voice out of the blackness and everybody froze at the same time there was a blinding flash double blinding as everybody eyes were just getting accustomed to the darkness when the students opened their eyes again the professor was standing right in the middle of the classroom her arms folded and her cool eyes surveying the class with a stern expression for a moment there was complete silence but then the students began to chatter among themselves excitedly wow that something for a start ron said in his usual loud whisper which most of the class could her perfectly well to hermione good enough i d say lavender whispered to parvati but this need not mean much and look at her hair parvati whispered back with a smirk she could really use her energy for more important things than trying to frighten her students the professor looked at the excited students quietly for a minute or two then she clapped her hands and silence fell again this was after all an unknown entity and it was wise to wait and watch her before deciding how to behave i happy to see that my little performance seems to have impressed you i am professor vivian woods and i ll be teaching you the important subject of defence against the dark arts now first of all i d like you to introduce yourselves so i can begin to remember your names as in fleur class before the students rose and said their names thank you for your compliment mr weasley she told ron after hearing his name i d advise you though to practise speaking in a low voice you might be saying less polite things some time or other ron went a deep colour of crimson as he sat down again ah miss granger the professor said to hermione i have heard so much about you already i really looking forward to see proof of your celebrated talents blushing even deeper than ron hermione muttered something incomprehensible and sat and you are mr potter she said before harry could even open his mouth i am not sure whether you will be able to learn very much in these lessons considering the things i have already heard about you but i believe you will be a valuable assistant when we do practical tasks there was a surprised murmur in the class as harry sat down somewhat bewildered you miss patil the professor addressed parvati and her voice seemed slightly sharper will i hope learn in the course of this year that looks may be deceiving and that first impressions sometimes dontgo such a very long way as the proverb claims thunderstruck parvati stood in front of the grey haired woman not daring to look at her the professor voice softened as she went on on the other hand maybe you will also learn how to make sensible use of your own looks this can be a very useful tool in more than one respect and you miss brown she said turning to lavender who was looking at her rather scared are perfectly right in not letting yourself be overly impressed by a little marketplace trickery keep your critical mind and put it to good use gosh said ron to harry clearly more impressed than y her dramatic appearance she doesntmiss a single thing this one we d better watch out when the introductions were over and each of the students had got a concise comment on their behaviour the professor returned to her desk now this year in preparation for your owls we will deal with the following subject matter xxx what was the name again dolores umbridge asked angrily she was sitting in one of the leather armchairs in fudge office that he kept for informal meetings sipping at a glass of firewhisky woods vivian woods the minister who was perched on the edge of another arm chair replied he waved a piece of parchment in the air with an equally annoyed expression never heard of her me neither the plump woman retorted and i believe i know most of the wizarding families names i checked it the moment i got this letter there is a woods family somewhere in the moors of cumberland but there is and never has been a person called vivian woods so unless she is from abroad american or something she is using a false name umbridge exclaimed grimly i am sure we could check with the american ministry in salem whether they know of any person of that name exactly my dear dolores said fudge looking very smug and i have already made sure that there is to the best of their information no such person in the entire united states or canada for that matter he finished triumphantly so there is clearly something fishy about this woods woman dolores umbridge stated sounded very satisfied with this disturbing revelation now the next question is of course whether dumbledore is being deceived by that woman which is highly unlikely considering his abilities so that it is a lot more plausible that he is deliberately misleading the ministry now it was fudge turn to sound triumphant and he did not tell you anything in this letter absolutely nothing in its shortness this letter is an impudence in itself he just says that he has taken up madam vivian woods as defence teacher for this year and that he is sure she will do her task admirably and he hopes this finds me in good health as if this sort of thing could do anything to improve it awful i have always suspected dear minister that albus dumbledore does not exactly respect you or your position but this absolutely impossible what do you intend to do about it unfortunately the ministry has no direct authority over hogwarts staff policy i could try to alert the school board but they are always reluctant to interfere especially as long as they do not see any concrete danger or any other reason they would certainly not care whether a teacher is teaching under an assumed name yes if we could prove it another werewolf or a banshee or some creature like that it would be another thing oh minister why dontyou send me there for an investigation you know i always happy to do everything in my humble powers to assist you i know dolores i know and indeed this apart from enjoying your delightful company of course is the main reason i have asked you to visit me here screwtape this invaluable goblin has finally come up with a piece of legal labyrinth that will enable you to travel to hogwarts as high inquisitor for educational affairs i already on my way minister the toadlike woman said eagerly but without attempting to get off her chair when do i start i appreciate your eagerness dolores i suggest that you take your time getting ready for the journey and let say arrange for you to arrive monday evening you will travel over the floo network to the mayor house of hogsmeade where a carriage will be provided for you to get to the castle what will be my powers the eager tone in her voice was obvious you will have authority to inspect each and every class and teacher without advance notice you will choose individual students to interview privately about their lessons and teachers and you will inspect the students living conditions the food their dormitories and so on why i thought i was to find out about that defence teacher that woods woman come dolores dumbledore may be getting strange in his old age but he is no fool so i want him to believe that this inspection is primarily about the well being of the students that the ministry wants to improve their situation you should also hint that there may be money to spend on these improvements oh minister i really must say it again you are a genius well i ll admit i a bit proud of this idea of mine and i sure you can pull this off dolores i cantimagine anyone better a n i getting tired of having to say sorry for the long time between updates but what can i do just be patient will you it sometimes amazes me how this story seems to develop a life of its own if it goes on like this it going to be one awfully long story indeed but i dontthink this is a bad thing is it thanks to the helpful spirits that assisted me with getting my french right it is a hell of a hard language to use now enjoy another appearance of our second least favourite character making a fool of herself chapter 17 a hogsmeade afternoon are you going to hogsmeade today belladonna asked fleur when they had got up on saturday morning and were getting ready for breakfast but it isnta hogsmeade weekend is it it the very first weekend this term actually fleur said remembering that hogsmeade weekends had been a rather complicated thing for harry and his friends last year dontyou need all sorts of written documents to be allowed to go not if you are seventh year belladonna replied with a wide smile that one of the benefits of having made it so high up so are you going i believe i will said fleur there are two friends of mine in the village and it will be great to meet them again and she dutifully told her room mates all about margaux and iphigenie and their job at the fashion shop wow i ve always wanted to find out about french cuisine aurora exclaimed enthusiastically couture fleur corrected her gently trying not to giggle cuisine is the cooking which i wouldntmind getting to know too aurora retorted good naturedly the great hall was only sparsely populated at the time fleur and her room mates came down for breakfast and she noted with some disappointment that harry was nowhere to be seen remembering how hungry she had become after a very short time yesterday fleur decided to give some of the less nasty products of the house elves cooking a chance and she found that the grilled tomatoes and the baked beans on toast were not as horrible as she had imagined and she even had to admit if only silently to herself that there was something to be said for a crisp slice of bacon or two she could not however bring herself to taste the pale sausages that reminded her of fat plump maggots after breakfast she told the others she would be going for a spin on her broom and she agreed to take aurora to meet margaux and iphigenie at the fashion shop in the afternoon do you want to come too she asked the other three girls but they declined lyra shook her head emphatically and made a scornful face fashion is for airheads and bimbos she snorted i ll never understand why a woman with any self respect needs to make herself look attractive for men ha and she stomped out of the hall shaking her head fleur who was well aware that she was not completely wrong in her opinion made a silent resolve to pick up the discussion later on she ought to understand that one can do it for oneself not for someone else she thought the air was fresh and crisp and the sky a pale autumn blue with a trace of mist on the ground and dewdrops still on the grass when fleur was walking down towards the quidditch pitch with her broom her mind full of memories when she had last seen the place it had been the dark forbidding maze of the third task of the triwizard tournament that had taken such a disastrous turn and it was with a feeling of uneasiness that she approached it however there was nothing left to remind her of those unfortunate events the ground was a normal quidditch pitch again with the two sets of hoops and the spectators galleries everything was quiet and deserted as she mounted her broom and kicked off the ground again as always when she was flying the exhilarating feeling of freedom and power filled her complete being flying was like a drug to her lifting her away from the troubles and sorrows of everyday life making her forget yesterday and tomorrow and just live for the moment as she was happily cruising along with the occasional dive and spin just for fun she noticed a dark dot in the distance that was gradually growing larger hovering she strained her eyes but as she had to gaze directly against the sun to watch the object she could not for quite some time see what it was only when it had come rather near she recognised it as a large winged animal with an eagle head and the body of a horse a hippogriff she said to herself utterly surprised knowing that they were quite rare and were hardly ever seen near human habitations but then she reminded herself the forest was probably full of all sorts of creatures hippogriffs not necessarily the most unusual but then as the creature was only a couple of yards away she noticed that there was a human figure straddling the hippogriff neck holding on to its head feathers with both hands apparently a man although she could not see much of his features against the glaring sunlight in her surprise she went into a sudden dive and when she regained control of her broom the strange rider had already passed her and was swiftly disappearing towards the village i wonder what he was up to it certainly not something that you see every day she mused but then she realised it was time for lunch and she returned to the castle when she entered the great hall belladonna was already waiting for her at the ravenclaw table her eyes shining with anticipation lyra into studying she told fleur morgaine only knows what she can be studying it the first weekend of the school year for crying out loud and i have no idea where the others have disappeared to i cantunderstand how one cannot be interested in fashionable outfits it so important to look the best you can dontyou agree and she went on to babble about clothes and fashions fleur who had her own ideas concerning looks and remembered that there had been several occasions where she would have given anything not to look the way she did listened to her indulgently and had soon forgotten all about the strange encounter in the morning they had almost finished their lunch and belladonna was starting to fidget impatient to be off when harry and the others appeared and sat down at the gryffindor table wait a moment fleur told belladonna rising i ll be with you in a minute she went over to the gryffindors and sat down on the bench next to harry i missed you she whispered in his ear and was pleased to see him shiver slightly as her breath tickled his skin harry like all boys his age not the most eloquent of persons mumbled something indistinct but returned the squeeze of her hand she noticed how ron shot hermione a meaningful look who blushed and averted her eyes i going to hogsmeade fleur announced but you can t ron contradicted it not one of the weekends today honestly ron hermione said rolling her eyes dontyou still know the most basic school rules seventh year students dontneed special permission if they feel like it they can go to hogsmeade every single weekend of the school year that bloody unfair ron grumbled and fleur had to grin at the face he pulled so i wanted to ask you if you want anything from one of the shops fleur continued at which ron brightened considerably but before he could open his mouth hermione spoke up what he means is that he doesntcare as long as it sticky and sweet and destroys his teeth she said wickedly am i right the shop is called honeydukes harry put in and of course hermione is right as always it a shame i cantgo with you he went on caressing fleur fingers with his own but we ll do that on the first occasion i promise i cantwait fleur replied rising from the bench see you in the evening there did not seem to be too many students making use of the opportunity for an afternoon in the village as fleur and belladonna walked out through the large oaken doors they were quite on their own are we really the only ones fleur asked oh i guess it because it the first weekend and only a couple of days since school started anyway everything is still rather new so people will be more interested in renewing their friendships and other contacts belladonna said surprising fleur with this piece of insight into the human mind she led fleur towards the three horseless carriages that were apparently waiting for passengers obviously whoever organised them had not expected large numbers but fleur stopped her why dontwe walk to the village she asked it such a wonderful day and it isntfar as i remember she did not want to admit that for some reason inexplicable to herself those carriages gave her the feeling of something sinister if you know a good healing charm for the blisters my poor feet will certainly explode in belladonna joked all right let walk they say it good for your health we can always take a carriage back to the castle if i feel too tired briskly they walked along the path by the lakeshore the sun glittered on the slightly rippled surface and now and then an arm of the giant squid broke the surface lazily as if waving to them fleur felt peaceful and contented and barely listened to her companion continuous chatter after the short walk along the lake they presently reached the station a small building just big enough to offer shelter for five or six people but with a large sign saying hogsmeade on top it was quite deserted how many trains are there each day fleur inquired oh i dontthink there are any during the year belladonna replied i believe the hogwarts express is the only train ever to run on this line and it just carries the students but isntit an awful waste i mean all those rails and signals and whatnot just for a train that runs how often four times a year it a muggle line actually belladonna said smugly and the hogwarts express just uses it without the muggles noticing it very clever of them dontyou think fleur who correctly assumed that belladonna them did not refer to the muggles agreed they crossed the tracks and turned left into the road that led into the village shall we go in belladonna asked as the three broomsticks came into sight but fleur declined on the way back perhaps she said why dontwe just go and meet my friends first so they went on up the main street past the post office and the sweet shop where fleur made a mental not to stop on their return and at last next to zonko joke shop they found the place they were looking for fleur who remembered quite clearly what the place had looked like when she had last seen it a black carved wooden front with narrow windows and badly lit was impressed at the change the fa ade was now glittering and sparkling in all the colours of the rainbow the windows although still narrow emitted a radiant light and above them a sign proclaimed in huge dancing bright green letters bellefringues haute couture francaise i dontbelieve it belladonna exclaimed clearly impressed if i remember the boring old shop from last year do let go inside if the shop had been gaudy outside it was nothing compared to the interior the whole place was brightly lit and scores of the most colourful garments were draped on dummies hung from pegs or stacked in the high shelves along the walls on their entrance a melodious bell started to chime out of nowhere and a split second later from behind a lime green curtain margaux appeared yes can i help she began but then noticed fleur and with a scream of delight hurried up to her to envelop her in her arms look who here she shouted and a moment later iphigenie entered only to throw herself upon fleur too but this wonderful both girls exclaimed when they finally let go of her and then they started bombarding her with questions now how have you been doing and how is hogwarts the lessons any problems with the language which house are you in and what about harry laughing fleur covered her ears with her hands wait she managed to put in i ll tell you everything just let me breathe again and why dontwe go some place where we can sit down and talk with a pang of guilt she noticed belladonna who was standing nearby looking rather forlorn she went over to her to pull her towards her two friends this is belladonna one of my room mates she introduced her she eager to get a taste of the french haute couture and she rather needs it margaux eyes seemed to say but she took hold of bella hands and shook them heartily welcome she said sorry if we neglected you and all we ll gladly show you around our humble place and she steered her off towards the shelves while fleur and iphigenie were grinning at each other a minute later the bell chimed again signalling the arrival of a new customer business iphigenie hissed and she and margaux turned her attention to the newcomer fleur first reaction was one of amusement at the absurd appearance of the woman well past her prime and of stocky build almost broader than high she was wearing robes in rosy pink a colour fleur reminded of an overgrown baby to which impression the dough like appearance of the face contributed a good deal to top off the ridiculous picture there was a huge pink bow in the short cropped yellow hair when however fleur looked at the woman eyes the ridiculous pathetic impression changed to a creepy feeling those eyes were cold like a reptile s and fleur shivered involuntarily at the malevolent gleam she thought she found in them but margaux apparently had not noticed anything of the sort she shot fleur a quick glance that very clearly expressed her opinion of the woman and her taste in clothes before she turned to her to inquire after her wishes iphigenie went over to fleur and belladonna and pulled them aside she ll sell her the complete outfit and it going to cost her a fortune she whispered to them in an amused tone she a genius in the business believe me not that it will be any use of course that person will look impossible in whatever she wears but it will provide a couple of galleons to be sure and indeed margaux was laying out several robes in front of the customer all the while promising how great she would look in them i never knew she was such an accomplished liar fleur whispered her initial uneasiness had gone and she found the scene greatly entertaining indeed iphigenie answered suppressing a giggle that emerald green is a marvellous colour no doubt but with that hair and skin like that ugh after some twenty minutes the customer had made her decisions and the emerald green robes together with a cloak in shocking pink were magically wrapped up in a parcel a remarkable pile of gold coins changed hands and the woman marched out of the shop triumphantly margaux came over to them jingling the gold in its leather pouch they ll be satisfied with us back in paris she said grinning widely we could really use such customers more often morgaine veil no you d lose all of your good taste in fashion iphigenie retorted dramatically as far as it goes she added teasingly well i dontexpect we ll see her again soon anyway and she seemed to have some money to spend after all business is business isntit margaux said even if it hurts me to see beautiful clothes wasted like that but why dontyou pick something now she asked turning to belladonna it wontbe wasted on you i sure blushing deeply belladonna turned towards the shelves again seemingly at loss what to choose from the abundance of different styles and colours with the gentle assistance of margaux however she finally settled for some deep orange blouse and olive scarf and fleur had to admit to herself that these colours contrasted nicely with her mousy hair and even seemed to accentuate a hidden prettiness in the rather plain face oh bella she said to her giving her hand a friendly squeeze you do look great they ll be ever so surprised at which bella blushed again but with a happy smile after she had paid for her purchase margaux suggested now why dontwe go close this place down for today after successful business like this and go over to the three broomsticks to celebrate they all agreed and a couple of minutes later they were sitting in the pub their mugs of butterbeer in front of them in the meantime bella had stopped feeling awkward among the three close friends and was obviously enjoying herself as it was not a general hogsmeade weekend there were only a very few students in the pub fleur noted two or three of her classmates from the defence lesson they nodded at her shortly looked curiously at margaux and iphigenie in their stylish and colourful robes but presently returned to their conversations for which fleur was silently grateful they were chatting away happily fleur telling her friends about her first experiences with her new life as a hogwarts student when it came to the description of the first defence lesson she had a hard time not to give away her grandmother secret but she managed to keep that part to herself even without that detail margaux and iphigenie were duly impressed seems she knows what she doing iphigenie said appreciatively especially thinking of the other teachers we had in the last years belladonna piped up it almost makes me feel sorry i not doing dada any more but i was really quite hopeless at it she added with a deprecating smile barely managed to get an a in my owls i do hope this one doesntturn out to be some monster in disguise again a banshee or something you dontknow how right you are fleur thought suppressing a smile oh i think she ok she said aloud what that her brown eyes very wide bella was pointing at a large deep red rose that had suddenly appeared out of thin air and was slowly floating towards their table all four girls gasped in surprise as the rose descended gracefully and landed in front of fleur at the same moment fleur felt a hand softly touching her shoulder and the whispered words care to come outside for a minute it was harry voice an yes i hate myself for updating so slowly but that just how things go thanks for being patient and keeping on reviewing petites sorcieres unortunately my french isntsuficient to understand exactly what you re talking about can you translate for me rubber duckies thanks plump and fat is really more or less the same priestesslenoue yes that exactly what i thought about fleur in the movie and there is absolutely nothing veela lke about her too chapter 18enjoyable meeting blushing furiously and not exactly looking too intelligent fleur slowly rose from her chair unable to say anything dontbother iphigenie told her with a wide smile i know it him i have no idea how he does it but it him all right yes him whom belladonna stammered her expression even slightly less intelligent than fleur s fleur however finally managed to get something like a grip on herself and nodded sheepishly at iphigenie before she followed the gentle tug of the invisible hand in her own and left the room from the corner of her eye she saw how margaux was leaning towards bella apparently satisfying her curiosity outside the pub fleur who had never before seen harry emerge from the invisibility cloak watched fascinated how first his head then his arms and finally the rest of him appeared seemingly out of thin air there was a broad mischievous grin on his face at last she found her speech if only to exclaim oh harry and throw her arms around him seeking his lips with hers for some time they stood there in a tight embrace oblivious to everything around them but presently harry gently broke the kiss it so good to have you with me again he whispered to her taking both her hands in his and holding her at arm length to look straight in her eyes harry she stammered feeling her knees quite weak how why because i wanted to be with you of course he interrupted planting a quick kiss on her lips i knew the village would be more or less deserted so we could be alone together nobody here to stare at us throw you dirty looks but if they catch you you ll get into no end of trouble but they won t he replied his eyes glittering with pride they never have and anyway even if they did it would well be worth the risk a statement that entailed another enthusiastic kiss from her after a time they parted for air this is getting addictive harry gasped and his eyes shone with delight behind his glasses i hope it is fleur replied smiling at him warmly their hands intertwined they slowly started walking down the street going nowhere in particular content in each other company they never noticed the toad like woman who had just rounded the corner and was now standing there looking after them after some time they reached the side road that led to the shrieking shack and on an impulse harry steered fleur up the hill towards it what are we doing here she asked unimpressed by the shabby building i know it supposed to be the most haunted place in britain but it just an ordinary derelict cabin really there a bit more to it than that harry corrected cheerfully why dontwe sit down on that bench over there and i tell you all about it but he had hardly started when there was a loud bark and the huge black dog that fleur remembered from last year appeared out of nowhere and hurled himself at harry quite bowling him over trying to lick his face sirius she heard harry scream but there was no distress in his voice only laughter serious she repeated you dontexactly sound serious still laughing harry picked himself up from the ground oh sorry he panted fleur meet my godfather your godfather this dog of course not harry said between bouts of laughter show her sirius he said to the dog who was sitting by his feet his red tongue lolling out of his mouth she needs to know and to fleur utter surprise the large dog changed and presently a tall black haired man was standing in his place grinning widely ah so we meet at last he said to her harry has been talking about you all summer and i must say he hardly did you justice so it was you last year fleur exclaimed i did think there was something strange about that dog you really could have told me harry unsure what to say she offered her hand which sirius drew to his lips in an elegant if exaggerated gesture an ancient french ancestor of mine taught me this he told her his eyes sparkling i really must introduce him to you some day he just a portrait but he ll be enchantee d he turned to harry enveloping him in a strong hug it good to see you harry he said how did you get here harry managed to ask at last and why had to take poor buckbeak for a flight sirius replied poor thing he was getting depressed cooped up in that attic for weeks and i just wanted to see you are all right harry which i can see you are from the look of things this of course made harry blush furiously buckbeak fleur inquired still very confused the hippogriff sirius told her the one that was instrumental in saving me from the ministry dementors but i saw a hippogriff this morning fleur said excitedly when i was taking my broom for a ride round the quidditch pitch so it was you oh sirius harry said in a reproachful tone what were you thinking flying by broad daylight fleur seen you and there no telling who else has what if the ministry find out forget them sirius replied and his boyish grin made him look years younger they ll never catch me and who d ever look twice at a shaggy old dog but buckbeak he back in that cave i kept him last year well hidden and he perfectly happy fleur could not help thinking that a hippogriff wasntexactly the kind of creature that could be hidden easily but she didntexpress this idea instead she asked but why is it so important that you are not seen ah my dear that a long story i a convicted mass murderer you see the next minutes were filled with sirius tale interrupted sometimes by harry additions and finally fleur was familiar with the events that had culminated in the dementors attack and harry patronus and sirius rescue and although her mind boggled at the paradox of the time turner she was awed by harry achievements amazing was all she could say harry never one for compliments blushed but it was nothing he said i mean of course it was unusual and all but but then i could do it because i had already done it you see i had to do it i couldnthave done otherwise he broke off completely bewildered with his own train of thought nobody will ever really understand time travelling sirius told him so donteven begin to try it worked that what important not how or why but just imagine harry went on again what a coincidence that time turner i mean if hermione had not got it from mcgonagall and the one questions to be avoided at all cost is what if sirius continued cheerfully you ll never know an answer to that one time travel or no time travel so why cantyou just be satisfied that everything turned out exactly the way it did i for my part certainly am they remained sitting together in companionable silence until fleur said i really need to go poor bella will think i ve forgotten her and we need to get back to the castle anyway and you better do the same harry i d hate you to get caught just because of me right harry agree getting to his feet and pulling her with him when will i see you again sirius we ll see about that his godfather replied there always owl post though you d perhaps not send hedwig too often she too easy to track and i might talk to you from the fireplace once in a while so good bye and take good care of yourself after an energetic hug he transformed into the huge black dog again barked joyfully and dashed off in long bounds so now you ve got to know sirius harry said taking fleur hand in his and beginning to walk down the hill what do you think of him he means a lot to you doesnthe she replied softly he does he paused to clear his throat before he continued he my only link to my parents the only person that i can somehow think of as my family oh harry she leaned against him unable to say anything more i hope i can be as important to you some day she thought keeping back her tears with an effort dusk was already falling when they approached the main street and the pub we d better part here fleur said stopping harry you really should not be seen around here how do you get back come to think of it like this he grinned taking the marauder map out of his pocket i solemnly swear i am up to no good what look fascinated fleur watched as the contours of the map appeared on the formerly blank parchment it a special map he explained and it shows not only the castle and its environs as well as some very useful secret passages it also shows every person around look this is us and he pointed at two tiny dots that were shown on the main street of hogsmeade dontworry he reassured her once more this map will warn me in time so they ll never catch me with a dramatic gesture he threw the invisibility cloak over his head and vanished from sight see you at dinner when fleur entered the three broomsticks she saw that the three girls were still sitting at the table where she had left them ah here you are exclaimed margaux we were just wondering yes i was beginning to think you d forgotten me belladonna said a little petulantly and i was just trying to make up my mind if i should go back on my own i sorry fleur replied smiling at her ruefully to make up for it you ll have to tell me everything about harry belladonna told her mock sternly your friends have already mentioned a thing or two oh well i will fleur complied but we d really better get going now right you are and this time i insist on taking one of the coaches after a short detour to honeydukes where they bought a solid supply of assorted sweets they made their way along the now rather dusky main street towards the station where there were still two carriages waiting for passengers it was lovely seeing you again fleur told her two friends hugging them so it was margaux said and with a wide grin she added be sure to introduce us to harry next time yes it a shame we ve never really met him iphigenie agreed indeed if i didnthave you she leaned into her girlfriend affectionately i do believe i could be interested only joking she added rather hastily seeing fleur expression hey i have an idea margaux suddenly exclaimed why dontwe arrange a fashion show for the hogwarts students it seems a shame to let such business potential lie waste do you think we d get permission to show our collection up at the castle her eyes were glittering eagerly i have no idea fleur said dubiously what do you think bella you have known the school for six years now it very unusual but there never any harm in asking is there so why dontyou send an owl to dumbledore the worst thing that can happen is that he says no it would certainly be something new and everyone would simply go crazy and i have seen some students that could really do with some new rags fleur went on to say nothing of the teachers well i guess we must get going if we want to be in time for dinner i do hope harry made it back alright i sure he has margaux assured her if only half the things are true that they say about him this must be a piece of cake to him so have a good trip back and tell him we said hello belladonna and fleur climbed into the foremost carriage and noiselessly the horseless vehicle started to move along the road into the twilight what a great afternoon bella said happily caressing the parcel of her purchase and i really like your friends they have such great taste her eyes suddenly went wide are they really i mean do they she stopped looking embarrassed you mean are they together as in a relationship yes i suppose that what i mean that right they are a couple do you have a problem with this sort of thing no i mean it i not familiar bella stammered rather helplessly what do their parents say she finally blurted out i have no idea honestly but i believe they d have told me about it if there was any problem or of course they haventtold them yet but i dontthink so they are not the cheating type also back in france this kind of relationship isntsuch a big deal at all actually if it hadntbeen for harry but she did not finish this thought why are you asking she said instead they look so cute so happy together bella voice trailed off and fleur did not pursue the topic visitor to see you headmaster dumbledore looked up from his papers and shortly touched the crystal globe on the desk in front of him the globe lit up and showed the place directly in front of the gargoyle watching the entrance to his office oh well he sighed recognising the plump toad like woman well i suppose you ll have to let her pass he said to the globe and the gargoyle obediently stepped aside to give access to the moving staircase upon which dolores umbridge presently ascended to knock on the office door a couple of moments later thus giving the headmaster some time to rearrange his features to an expression of non committal friendliness ah dolores he said in the pleasantest voice he could muster i ve been expecting you did you have a nice journey with an indistinct noise that sounded very much like a croak she plopped down in the visitor chair in front of the desk and what can i do for you dolores after rummaging in her bag for some time she produced an official looking piece of paper to which a large red seal was attached on a ribbon which she handed to dubledore across the desk who took it with an expression of mild interest decree of appointment he read high inquisitor i see old screwtape has been at work again good work really so what can i do to be of assistance i would appreciate it headmaster she replied in her simpering voice if you could supply an office for me where i can conduct the interviews i have in mind and you will have to make it clear to the teachers that i have authority to summon any student i want during any of their lessons and of course that they are to expect me drop in on those lessons any time without previous arrangement naturally i that is the ministry expect full cooperation but you should emphasise that we have only the best interests of hogwarts in mind and that the result of this evaluation which i have no doubt will absolutely flawless will greatly influence the ministry future funding policy certainly dolores i will make the ministry policy absolutely clear to everyone concerned the sarcasm in dumbledore voice was completely lost on umbridge which was probably just as well shall i summon a house elf to show you to your quarters now you will be tired from your journey he didntwait for a reply but snapped his fingers at which there was a loud crack and the elf appeared behind umbridge chair before i forget there is one more thing i think you should know dumbledore she said without turning round this has not been a general hogsmeade weekend am i right not the very first weekend of the school year of course not why are you asking well after i arrived at hogsmeade i went for a stroll in the village and i saw a student in hogwarts uniform two students actually kissing in the middle of the road actually there are no school rules against kissing dumbledore said sounding amused indeed they say there is nothing like what do the youngsters call it these days like a good snog to keep up one spirits no if this is all there nothing wrong about it it not all umbridge continued i am quite aware that the school rules show deplorable neglect in this respect but i would not have expected an attitude that actually encourages such flighty behaviour but as i said this is not all you said yourself it not been a hogsmeade weekend seventh year students are allowed i know she interrupted impatiently the simpering tone now quite gone from her voice now the girl may have been anything between fourteen and twenty i couldntreally tell but you will certainly be able to find out if she had a right to be in the village today i ll recognise her again anywhere i did not know you accepted veela students she finished her face now quite flushed quarter veela dumbledore corrected mildly miss delacour from france is spending this school year with us her seventh year so she had a perfect right to be where she was the boy however and there was a note of triumph in her voice now was most certainly not allowed to be there to my knowledge harry potter is not in seventh year and dontask me if i am sure it was him i have seen his face often enough on the front pages during the last couple of weeks i demand that he be punished severely she did not notice the house elf pricking up his ears at harry name ah well dumbledore sighed of course we cannot ignore rule breaking like this i will talk to his head of house this very evening and you can rely on minerva mcgonagall to take appropriate measures i ll see you at dinner then dolores good now he said addressing himself to the patiently waiting house elf will you be so good to show madam umbridge to her quarters dobby a n so here is a new chapter let me say thank you to all you patient readers out there that put up with my long updating intervals i d love to do this faster but anyway enjoy chapter 19 detention harry turned sharply at the loud crack that signalled the appearance of a house elf in the gryffindor common room several other heads turned too as it was definitely not usual for house elves to appear there at this time of day or rather late afternoon when the room was full of students and most of those faces assumed a puzzled expression when they saw the elf was not wearing the hogwarts house elves uniform but a very colourful if ill matching ensemble of various children clothing clothes on a house elf was a very unusual thing it was not so unusual for harry of course dobby he exclaimed walking over to him and squatting down to be at face level with the elf what are you doing here not that i not always glad to see you he added hurriedly trouble harry potter sir squeaked dobby his huge eyes looking even bigger than usual harry potter is in trouble sir what ministry lady see harry potter in the village sir harry potter will get detention dobby wanted to tell harry potter perhaps harry potter can find a way ministry lady harry repeated bewildered yes harry potter sir madam umbridge from the ministry umbrage what a fitting name hermione had heard the elf last sentence and looked at harry worriedly i told you you d be caught some day but you never listened well i expect they cantdo too much can they a couple of days detention and it been absolutely worth any number of detentions harry told her with a wide grin had a good snog at least ron inquired slyly which earned him a reproachful look from hermione more than that no not what you think ron pull your mind out of the gutter again just imagine we met si i mean snuffles at the shrieking shack and he duly proceeded to tell his friends about the afternoon xxx the silly boy minerva mcgonagall fumed why canthe wait until he is allowed to go and if he does why must he be stupid enough to get caught i suppose there is no way we can just ignore this albus i afraid not minerva it would not be a good idea to antagonize the what does she call herself high inquisitor really i must say screwtape has been doing a great job here to antagonize her on her very first day she hates me anyway and would jump at any occasion to exercise her new authority no harry will have to be given detention and i d ask you to make it as obvious as you can oh well she sighed i suppose there is always the trophy room but minerva now dumbledore voice sounded amused and his eyes were twinkling quite merrily i surprised at your lack of imagination the trophy room really arentthere more demanding tasks for a wizard of harry potter calibre actually madam woods has been telling me she is quite interested in his abilities having heard such a lot about them so why dontyou assign him to do his detention with her not that i want to impose anything on you you are his head of house after all so if you prefer him to polish the trophies all right albus i understand you perfectly well her face assumed a thoughtful expression madam woods you ve never told me anything about her where did you find her i trust your opinion of course if you say she good at her stuff then i sure she is but still there is something strange about her am i right i knew i could not fool you minerva and i sorry i have to do this but i believe it is for the best if you know as little about this as possible so if you ll forgive me i d rather not tell you i not sure i can forgive you but i ll try my best i will announce potter detention at dinner how long do you feel will be adequate well as we must make it look serious i d say a week worth from monday to friday however i dontthink a public announcement would be a good idea more publicity is the last thing he needs right now xxx i dontbelieve it fleur said to belladonna at the dinner table it the woman from the shop what she doing here but her question was soon to be answered when dumbledore rose from his seat and the hall fell silent we have a guest tonight he announced to the assembled students madam dolores umbridge newly appointed high inquisitor for educational affairs what that a ripple of surprise went through the ranks of the students dumbledore waited a moment for it to calm down and continued who is coming straight from the ministry what her task is well who better to explain it to you than herself with a gesture that looked ironically exaggerated to more than one in the audience he resumed his seat while the toad like woman rose look she wearing that robe she bought bella whispered to fleur yes what a waste of a beautiful piece of clothing let hear what she got to say they watched as the plump woman rose from her seat which didntmake much difference actually she looked even smaller standing and began in what sounded a well rehearsed tone well it is lovely to be back at hogwarts i must say and to see such happy little faces looking up at me good for her she up at the high table cho remarked with a grin or the looking up might be difficult who does she think she talking to nursery school kids the talk went on and soon even those most willing to follow it lapsed into some kind of stupor incapable of taking in what those longwinded elaborate sentences actually meant nobody could have said how much time had passed until some subtle change of tone announced the end of the speech the ministry pledge to further and enhance the time honoured excellence of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry she sat down with a deep breath and dumbledore rose once again clapping his hands politely though not in an enthusiastic way therefore my friends i entreat all of you to assist madam umbridge in her task as it will really be in all our best interest to convince the ministry that their funding will be put to excellent use hogwarts needs all the support it can get especially at times like these now that you know who is back as he sat down a loud murmur went through the ranks of the students and dolores umbridge face went an interesting shade of red however she said nothing a week detention hermione said looking at the piece of parchment that had just materialised next to harry plate and with woods yes doesntsound too bad does it harry told her better than scrubbing chamber pots in the hospital wing dontyou agree wonder what she ll make me do oh harry hermione sighed exasperated you almost sound as if you enjoyed this to tell you the truth i have a feeling i actually will xxx on monday afternoon punctually at five o clock harry knocked on the door that bore the inscription professor woods in plain letters on a copper plate upon which the door opened to admit him harry entered and the door closed noiselessly behind him he had not had a clear picture in mind of what to expect in the teacher office but whatever he might have been thinking of was certainly not what he found in fact the room did not look like a teacher office at all there was no writing desk there were no bookshelves no filing cabinets and no magical instruments instead there was a set of comfortable looking sky blue leather armchairs round a small prettily carved table with several candles on it there was a cosy fire crackling in the grate and there was a huge window through which the last rays of the setting sun fell with a red and golden light madam woods was standing next to the window in her severe looking teacher robes although the soft carpet swallowed any sound his entry may have made she turned round as soon as the door had closed ah here you are mr potter she said to him good afternoon your head of house has seen fit to give you detention well harry muttered uncomfortably you see you couldntwait to go to the village she interrupted him it was a statement not a question and unfortunately for you you were seen i hope if nothing else it will teach you to be more careful with your rule breaking in future it was difficult to tell but there seemed to be the trace of a smile on her face whatever you were up to was it at least worth the trouble you got yourself into doing it harry felt his face starting to glow and thought it was better not to answer this question he found the professor behaviour quite strange it almost seemed as if she approved of what he had done after a short pause in which he hoped his face had assumed its natural colour again he said instead what am i supposed to do professor that the attitude she said approvingly always eager to get things done well i afraid this evening at least there will not be much for you to do more to speak speak about yourself now i know how you hate being the centre of attention or talking about the things you have done and i hope you ll forgive me it not stupid curiosity as if i was a reporter or something i am supposed to teach defence against the dark arts and if there is anybody with first hand experience of it it you harry potter i need to know as much as possible about voldemort and his return and i ask you to do me the favour of telling me as much as you can but why dontyou sit down she indicated the blue leather armchairs and harry completely astonished obeyed in all his experiences with detention nothing like this had ever happened to him there was not the least hint of punishment about this situation and the professor was treating him with respect almost like an equal with a flick of her hand without using a wand as harry noticed in spite of his astonishment the professor conjured a tray of food in front of him there will be no need for you to miss dinner because of a silly detention she said now smiling at him widely now please help yourself while i ll ask you a couple of questions if i may in the following minutes harry found himself telling this woman whom he had only seen once before in his first defence lesson everything about his past four hogwarts years in a frankness that he would have felt surprised at if he had found the time to think about it xxx seeing harry place empty at dinner fleur walked over to the gryffindor table where harry she asked hasnthe told you ron said sounding surprised he doing his first detention and i think it unfair you were with him and you haventgot any hermione voice was severe but her eyes gave her away lured him to his doom no doubt she continued with a grin fleur though could not help feeling a bit guilty how many has he got monday to friday and the incorrigible prat seemed to enjoy it yeah ron confirmed said it was worth any number of detentions if you know what i mean fleur blushed tell him i said hello and tell him i love him when she returned to her seat at the ravenclaw table she found a small piece of parchment there please see me in my office after dinner vivian woods what is it calliope who had seen her read the note asked professor woods wants to see me fleur answered trying to keep her voice neutral isntit unusual for teachers to have students see them after lessons yes it is unless you re in trouble for something but you are not are you you cantpossibly be not after these few days of course not well i guess i ll just have to go and see what it all about so after dinner fleur dutifully went to her grandmother office the parchment with the note must have been enchanted to show her the way as it seemed to twitch and pull in her hand she was glad about that otherwise she would probably have been searching most of the castle for the office but thus only after a few minutes she found herself in front of the carved door and knocked like harry before her she was surprised at the decidedly un office like appearance of the room although as she told herself later on it was clearly furnished in her grandmother taste blue being her favourite colour in one of the armchairs facing her the professor was sitting but in the one opposite fleur saw the back of a head of black unruly hair that she would have recognised everywhere harry she just could not help herself saying his name out loud at which harry jumped and turned round fleur he shouted but then remembering where he was glanced at the professor stopped confused professor woods had risen from the armchair and was coming over to fleur with a big smile good evening miss delacour she said with a wink that made it hard for fleur not to giggle i have just been having this most fascinating talk with naughty mr potter here she made a gesture towards harry who has told me a number of extraordinary things concerning both of you so i thought it best to ask you to come too there are several things i want to discuss with you but sit down please obediently fleur sat down in the armchair next to harry meekly pulling her skirt down over her knees which earned her another amused glance from her grandmother now from what mr potter has told me and i see no reason to doubt it amazing as it may be it seems that there is quite an unusually strong connection between you that makes it possible for you to reach out to each other in situations of danger this remarkable ability deserves closer investigation i need hardly say that in times like these it can be extremely helpful to make good use of mr potter detentions i suggest that we conduct some research in the course of the week to try to understand and perhaps channel this ability now if you ll excuse me for a minute while i prepare some utensils for our first experiment with these words she disappeared through a door to the right leaving a dumbfounded harry and an only slightly less bewildered fleur alone in the room this is the weirdest detention i ve ever had harry said still dazed and i have some experience with them believe me i cantimagine what she up to but it certainly does not look like punishment not when it means being with you he added taking hold of her hand and giving it a squeeze she thinks we share an ability she said so you ve told her about the dementor haventyou how you saved me and about you in the graveyard how you saved me it seems so long ago unreal oh it real enough in my dreams he said in a tone that made fleur shiver you re still having those dreams why didntyou tell me about them what would have been the use it would only have worried you and i d still not be able to sleep any better to which fleur could not find an answer however she told herself to do some research about anti nightmare potions as soon as she got a chance so instead of answering she leaned over for a kiss which for some reason became longer and more intense than she had originally intended well well well came the professor voice causing them to pull apart quickly this is not quite the sort of connection i was talking about embarrassed harry tried to look fixedly at an imaginary spot on the wall unable to say anything fleur although also blushing furiously saw the sparkle of hidden laughter in her grandmother eyes and had a hard time to suppress a giggle at his awkwardness as i was saying before the professor went on this connection between you needs some exploring and perhaps you can learn to control it so that you can also make good use of it without having to be in mortal danger now mr potter as you are under detention i am afraid i cannot let you out of my sight it would not do for the high inquisitor her voice was heavy with sarcasm at the words to run into you outside this office so you will have to remain here you miss delacour on the other hand are free from such obligation so i want to ask you to get outside preferably up on the astronomy tower i understand from mr potter that you have certain animagus qualities which incidentally are of some interest to me too so i d suggest you use these for this purpose i never knew she was such an accomplished actress nobody would ever suspect she has known me all my life and what am i supposed to do when i am there fleur asked trying to look innocent i want you to concentrate as hard as you can on this room here and on harry to help you focus your mind this should be helpful she handed fleur a shining silvery ornament in the shape of the figure eight on a thin chain harry here will have the same one vivienne continued both of you are to think of a message to the other and if we are lucky you will be able to hear it in your minds now i know hear is not the right word but there is no other of course we should not be too optimistic it may well be that it does not work at the first try so if you cannot hear harry up there on the tower you will come back here after ten minutes is everything clear yes fleur and harry agreed fine so miss delacour if you ll kindly show me your transformation obediently fleur stood up from her chair and transformed into her owl form harry who still needed to get used to that watched her fascinated fleur the owl hopped onto his shoulder and nipped his ear playfully hooting softly perfect the professor said then she walked over to open the window now if you please a n well my friends here is the next chapter and i have tried to put some space in between the two povs hope it works let me say right away that those who want action will be a bit disappointed and those who complained about there being way too much sap will probably find more to criticise here merlin just look at the title thank you all for your wonderful reviews i cantbegin to tell you how much i appreciate them there are a few very interesting ideas too but of course i not telling you which ones i going to use it would spoil all the fun magic crystal rose wickerb yes i definitely planning to have the dursleys meet fleur it just too good fun to miss korifi and all others who wonder about mme delacour sudden change of heart of course there something behind it just wait and you ll find out jon3776 naturally it has to be more or less a u but i going to follow some of the main ideas of oop silvermoonset yes my computer always asks me about that spelling too bearableness what a word desert fox i may be dense but i just have no idea what you are talking about most of the time and if there way too much sap how come it still a fantastic story karlabob thanks an awful lot for pointing all this out i imagine vernon when he feels especially spiteful will use the m word to annoy harry knowing full well he cantdo anything but i see your point about dudley who is basically a coward and i agree with the bitch slapping too it something petunia would do rather also i ll try to stay away from parentheses j panuru4u yes i sure am excited about writing this this has a way of getting addictive lt2000 thank you very much for all the ideas and for clearing up the email thingy i ll mail you some time soon enough rambling on with the story chapter 2 twinkle twinkle little star a couple of days had passed uneventfully although her mother was still nice to her in that unusual way weird she called it to herself when she lay awake in the evenings thinking of harry and she loved being with gabrielle and enjoyed the company of her grandmother fleur mood was not a happy one it was true the first black depression and loneliness had dissipated but the numb feeling of emptiness was still there so it was with some mixed emotions that she looked forward to the visit of margaux and iphigenie they ll cheer me up of course but seeing them so happy together how will i bear it she had of course told her mother about the impending visit of her friends and quite in keeping with her new treatment of fleur she had been delighted i do understand cherie she said to her daughter who still not used to this looked at her in surprise you will want the company of your peers and friends so tell them they can stay as long as they like when are you expecting them merci maman fleur was almost speechless what day is it today thursday they said they d come friday noon i ll order the house elves to have everything ready isabeau said and left the room on friday when the delacour women were all assembled at the luncheon table there was a sudden plop and then a second one and margaux and iphigenie apparated bon jour they said cheerfully and then curtsied gracefully to isabeau but then they dropped the formalities and rushed over to fleur who had stood up from her chair in surprise wrapping her in a great hug but i thought you were travelling by floo powder not any more margaux said in a mock haughty voice we got our apparating licence yesterday so no more dirty chimneys for us but when did you learn all the stuff they offer it as an option during seventh year in school oh i forget of course you didnthave it in sixth but you are already old enough arentyou and you ve got time now too so why not study and take the test as soon as possible we ll help you studying iphigenie ever practical suggested oh yes what a great idea can i maman i dontsee why not there will surely be a way for you take the test down in the village how neglectful of madame maxime she did know you were seventeen why did she not as you so they agreed that fleur would start studying and take the test it not so hard really margaux said just a couple of spells and wandwork most is theory i have no idea why they expect you to know about molecular teleportation graphs and things it no practical use whatsoever you ll see apparating is much better than floo powder and it doesntmake your robes dirty too isabeau added xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx you boy vernon barked at supper three or four days after harry return from hogwarts this stupid storehouse worker of mine fell from a ladder today and twisted his ruddy ankle he ll be off work for some three weeks as i not going to hire some help and pay them an outrageous sum you will take that job for as long as it necessary you will go with me to the site in the car tomorrow morning so i can show you the ropes but dontthink i ll give you a ride every day you can take dud old bike understand me yes uncle vernon and dontexpect me to pay you anything vernon added with a vicious grin i have to pay that idiot wages as it is no uncle vernon after harry had cleaned up the supper table and taken out the rubbish bin he could finally go to his room you know he said to hedwig to whom he had started to talk more and more frequently since his return he thinks he is annoying me with that job but he wrong it a lot better than having to do their stupid household chores which i sometimes believe they invent just to make me angry i mean who else would have their one inch lawn mowed every bloody single day so this job of his at least gets me out of the house and away from my charming relatives it will certainly take my mind off all those things and i might even meet a couple of interesting people as usual hedwig was sitting on his shoulder nibbling at his ear affectionately and with a bit of imagination she almost looked as if she was listening next morning after breakfast which had been made by harry of course vernon took him to his factory in the car as usual there was a lot of commuter traffic and vernon temper was quite high when they finally reached the site the foreman of the storehouse was a short fat balding man with a jolly grin and a surprisingly firm handshake i ll show him around boss he said to vernon after he had told him what harry was supposed to be doing come along son and while vernon looking slightly disappointed stomped up the stairs to his office the foreman turned to harry tough customer your uncle son dontworry this isntgoing to be too hard a job although he likes to thin it is and why should we disillusion him i anthony figg by the way you can call me tony figg we have a neighbour of that name arabella figg she used to babysit for me when i was little right son she my sister told me about you actually so i know all about you it might have been harry imagination but he thought that tony had put some stress on the word all but he did not say anything ok so let me show you this place and what you ll have to do now ma petite vivienne said to her granddaughter when she ran across her in the hall after she had been studying for the apparating test which was due in two days why dontyou and i not go for a nice walk in the park and you tell me everything about your time at hogwarts and the tournament and harry potter before fleur could say anything she hooked her arm in hers and pulled her out of the house into the sunlit park oh i knew she d want to know about everything what will i tell her now but if i canttrust her then who is there to trust it a relief in a way to be able to tell someone so she told her grandmother who was listening intently well done she exclaimed when she heard about the dragon and when fleur told her of the yule ball and roger betrayal of her trust she muttered something unintelligible and pressed her hand he doesntknow how lucky he is and he certainly doesntdeserve it she said anger in her voice what do you mean grandma i ll tell you later she replied evasively just continue your story so fleur went on when it came to harry saving the egg for fleur vivienne interrupted again i can hardly believe it how can anyone be so fast i telling you gran harry isntanyone fleur eyes were sparkling as she said it and her grandmother couldntmiss how her whole face lit up i d not believe it either if it hadnthappened to myself she proceeded to the second task of course it was silly and she wasntin any danger ever but i was so happy he had pulled her out of that horrible lake i kissed him you kissed him vivienne tone was suddenly fully alert tell me exactly how it happened fleur looked at her in surprise but complied nothing much to tell i took his head in both my hands and kissed each of his cheeks twice then i kissed ron too the same way but only once he hadntreally done anything of course but i got carried away see she finished somewhat embarrassed by her grandmother inquisitive look why are you asking you sound as if it was important too true it is vivienne said gravely tell me did you notice any changes after those kisses no wait yes there didntseem to be any charm about me any more you know that annoying way all the boys got turned into dithering idiots when they looked at me it was suddenly gone do you think it certainly seems so i cantthink of any other explanation you know the basic facts about veela and the importance of their kisses i believe yes well you re only quarter and it very hard to tell exactly but if i guess correctly you can consider yourself lucky you didntkiss that other boy first fleur paled you mean i d have been magically linked to him ron the moron her grandmother grinned at her i not saying it would have been inevitable but who knows however veela have a very sensitive feeling for this kind of thing no i dontthink there was ever any danger but pray continue your report again vivienne listened attentively without any interruptions through gabie adventures in the forbidden forest and the mysterious event of the botched april fool joke and do you have any idea what it might mean she asked looking at her granddaughter shrewdly i mean it clear you re the scorpion but what is your idea about fire and water she d look right through me if i lied to her and anyway why should i i think it means harry and me fleur said her voice slightly shaking she watched her grandmother intently he is a fire sign and i water she finished suddenly unsure of her self good thinking her grandmother said smiling at her warmly of course we cantever be quite sure with prophecies but it would certainly suggest itself i sense you are not exactly averse to the idea are you fleur blushed profusely dontanswer cherie i can see it for myself well who knows perhaps you ll meet again sooner than you imagine but please continue he used cruciatus on you she asked in a shocked tone when fleur told her about the third task what happened i not sure how it worked i left my body and suddenly i was an owl and in that horrible churchyard oh grandma do you think i can learn to be an owl on purpose i sure you will it seems it was your way of escape which is a very rare ability in witches of course what with your veela blood it only natural you become a bird grandma you can turn into a bird cantyou teach me i dontknow if i ll be able to but i ll try after all you have done it once so why shouldntyou do it again but tell me what happened after that unfortunate task fleur blushed again even deeper than before i can imagine dear you kissed in earnest didntyou and now you miss him horribly yes something of the old magic is probably still at work dontgive up hope i ll see if i can help you harry had come to rather like his work at his uncle factory there were some days of course when a lorry or two had to be loaded or unloaded and then there were quite a lot of crates and boxes to be lifted and stacked and then his arms and back ached but then tony who he had quickly come to like a lot gave him a bottle of strong smelling stuff to rub on and the pains were gone next morning it something my sister mixes for me tony told him grinning i dontbelieve in the modern chemical rubbish they sell you in the pharmacies for loads of money give me good old home made witch balm any day harry breath caught witch balm yes that what she calls it you know all those herbs and things a recipe that been in the family four ages and that works miracles especially as long as you believe in it he finished with a smirk why are you looking at me so strangely nothing harry said hurriedly silly of me of course that what any muggle would say about a mysterious ointment of herbs true to his word vernon had never taken harry to the plant in his car again so he had gone there on dudley old rusty bike and back again he quite enjoyed the ride especially in the evening when the air was still warm and most of the traffic had disappeared and the best thing was that he could take his time and get to the dursleys house he never called it home to himself a lot later than would have been necessary sorry uncle vernon he would say smiling innocently when his uncle remonstrated with him about being late again but the old bike had another breakdown what can i do of course it you bought me a new one at which vernon usually went purple muttered something and dropped the topic it never entered his head to wonder why the bike never broke down during harry morning rides harry nights were usually less pleasant his dreams kept revolving around cedric being hit by the curse or voldemort rising from the cauldron and to his disappointment fleur had not appeared in any of them again i shouldntwonder if she forgotten about me already he said to hedwig after having woken from a particularly nasty nightmare those prophecies are often plain rubbish just think of old trelawney so why not this one too but then i can still feel her kissing me and the smell of her hair no i cantbelieve it was just pity it felt like so much more feeling he wouldntbe able to go to sleep anyway and a glance at his clock telling him it was still some three hours until breakfast he quietly got dressed and sneaked out of his room past the door behind which he heard the rough snores of his uncle down the stairs and silently out of the house into the street where the first faint morning dawn was already starting more to be sensed than actually seen he wandered along the deserted street until he reached the tiny park in the centre of the roundabout at its end where he sat down on the only bench that an uncaring city planner had put there with a heavy sigh he leaned back stretched his legs and looked up at the sky which was still velvety black with the first tinges of blue and turquoise over the row of houses slowly the stars faded until there was only one bright light up in the ever brightening blue and his eyes locked on that lonely star a faint smell of lilacs was in the air his vision went foggy and then there were two deep blue eyes drawing him towards them a flurry of silver and then the sensation of sweet soft lips on his own arms around his neck fingers in his hair a tongue touching his lips with a shock harry came to himself he was on the park bench alone no person in sight as far as he could see what was that it it must have been a dream but it felt so so real silly of course must have kind of hypnotized myself looking at that star where is it anyway gone of course morning too bright already wonder what star it was should have paid more attention in astrology really it didntfeel like a dream at all reluctantly he got up from the bench to go back and prepare breakfast all fleur family except her mother who had urgent business in paris and her two friends were eagerly waiting outside the apparation test office at last the door opened and fleur came out they all leapt from their seats excitedly and margaux began but a look at her friend face told her that she had passed wonderful she shouted and together they almost crushed her in their hugs only gabrielle looked a bit sad as she was the only one who still had to wait several years until she would also get her licence dontworry ma petite said fleur bending down to her i promise to take you with me now and then where do we all want to go now i need to practise my new freedom they decided to have a picnic in the park of versailles as it was another beautiful day the house elves produced a wonderful basket of the most delicious food in no time and presently they appeared with a series of low plops at the far end of the spacious baroque gardens a group of japanese tourists looked in astonishment at the four women and the little girl that had suddenly appeared in front of them and started chatting excitedly oops fleur was taken aback she had not expected to materialise right in front of a number of muggles and was at a loss what to do now luckily iphigenie had enough presence of mind obliviate she said quickly and the excited chatter stopped immediately a blank expression floated across the tourists faces and then they turned away taking their photos and talking among themselves as they had before good work vivienne said appreciatively this is one of the drawbacks of apparating you never know who sees you materialising and then you have to be quick with your forgetting spell do they teach you that in the course at school clever of them i ll remember it fleur muttered but let find a place for our picnic soon they were seated on a blanket in the lawn near a large fountain examining the basket ahh what a change from english cooking margaux said helping herself to pate au canard that was what i missed most over in foggy old scotland it wasntas foggy as all that fleur corrected gently but i agree about the food still there something missing i understand vivienne said sympathetically but i ll see what i can do to help i promise you in spite of fleur feeling still miserable they passed an enjoyable afternoon in the park once an elderly american couple even insisted of taking a picture of fleur and her two relatives in front of the palace as they were so cute and old fashioned european oh please let do it gabrielle said giggling i ve never been photographed by muggles before do their pictures really not move let just hope they dontunderstand french margaux said in a whisper but she had to grin widely in spite of herself dontworry vivienne who was equally enjoying herself told them americans dontspeak languages even hardly their own quite often and even if they did they d just think muggles was one of those weird european things not worth bothering and to the two tourists she said in perfect english queen english actually you are very welcome i do hope you find your stay in france enjoyable she must have switched on the veela charm without knowing it the poor guy is completely speechless and his eyes are almost popping out but it does look quite funny the american woman after a look at her husband seemed to regret asking and took her pictures only rather perfunctorily then she grabbed his arm and dragged him away from the scene looking grim oh grandma gabrielle was beside herself with laughter did you i mean the charm she couldntfinish her sentence shrieking with delight vivienne looked smug i may perhaps have given him a tiny little look just wanted to see if i could still do it let me assure you madame you can iphigenie herself somewhat glassy eyed told her at which vivienne suddenly turned serious i so sorry cherie i completely forgot i really didntwant it to affect you honestly you see she turned to fleur this is just a tiny little example of what the veela charm can do you need to be extremely careful with it dontyou worry grandma it vanished oh yes you told me about it but i am not so sure it gone for good perhaps it is just hidden and you can find it again but grandma i not sure i want it back it just made me unhappy and i quite glad it gone dontspeak so lightly of nature gift the thing with charms is to learn to control them not getting rid of them come to terms with who you are instead of fighting it dontworry we ll find out about that together i see there quite a lot of work for me when dusk began to gather margaux and iphigenie who had been keeping even closer together after the taste of the veela charm apparated back to their montmartre flat and the others also returned home we ll work on your problem first thing tomorrow morning vivienne told fleur before the three vanished with the typical plopping noise fleur was dreaming she was back in the lake at hogwarts and time was running short she knew she was looking for something but she couldntremember what she only knew she had to find it and find it soon or something dreadful would happen and suddenly she wasntin the lake any more but in the graveyard and horrible red eyes were staring at her and she saw a huge black shadow bending over harry potter prostrate form with a scream she woke after she had found her bearings she got out of bed still shaking and stumbled over to the open window outside the park was still dark although the first tinges of dawn were already colouring the sky above the black trees feeling certain she would not be able to go to sleep again any time soon she walked over to the door but then checked herself silly me she chided herself and apparated down onto the lawn the dewy grass was cool against her bare feet but the air was mild with a faint scent of roses and she did not feel cold in her night dress as she slowly walked across the lawn to sit down on a wooden bench under a rose bus the sky was slowly turning from dark blue to turquoise and the first pink streaks appeared on the horizon the stars faded one by one until finally only one was there shining dreamily she gazed up to it her vision went foggy and then there were deep emerald eyes drawing her towards them the sensation of slightly rough dry lips on her own a hand caressing her back and another in her hair a tongue touching her lips with a shock fleur came to to find herself sitting on the bench in parc delacour on her own again with no hint of what had just happened unable to think clearly she just looked up at the sky again where the last star was finally fading in the rosy morning light oh my she said softly to herself as she realised what star it was reluctantly she rose to return to the mansion xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx a q uestion so which star was it well kind of a filler chapter nothing exciting hapening here hope you enjoy nevertheless thanks to all my patient reviewers i truly sorry for the delays but there nothin i can do about that hope you enjoy nevertheless chapter 21 an enjoyable week dear minister this is just a very short note to let you know i have arrived and am feeling well i have only been here for a day so far and have just begun to settle in everybody is very helpful and friendly and my rooms are very comfortable i will begin my interviews and inspections of lessons as soon as i have made myself familiar with the schedule of the school i have not talked to the new professor yet but i have the impression that she is a very interesting person in spite of my short stay i have already found out something very remarkable however i will not send this information by owl but will floo to the ministry to talk to you personally in due course i expect to be able to come up with more detailed information by the end of next week i assure you of my very best efforts in the interests of the ministry dolores umbridge ps headmaster dumbledore told me to say he hopes this finds you in good health the high inquisitor re read her letter with a concentrated frown well this should be pretty harmless in case they watch my mail she muttered with a grim smile she sealed the parchment and tied it to the leg of a brown school owl that was patiently waiting on her desk yes there is definitely something rotten in the school of hogwarts she said to herself as she watched the owl fly out of the window but i must be patient and i can certainly not show my suspicions i need proof xxx inter curricular period calliope wondered looking at the slip of parchment the seventh year ravenclaws had been handed at breakfast wonder what it supposed to mean it in the charms classroom i sure we ll find out soon enough lyra said cheerfully helping herself to some bacon and eggs the others followed her example even fleur had begun to appreciate some aspects of the english breakfast after going hungry for a couple of mornings when the students had assembled in the charms classroom nobody had an idea what that unfamiliar expression meant but when together with flitwick professor woods entered they understood good morning good morning the tiny professor said happily as he climbed up on his book stack and surveyed the class you may remember me announcing that there would be close cooperation with da he checked himself as he saw woods stern look defence i mean so today will be the first of a series of joint projects that will help you to profit as much as you can and to be as well prepared as it is possible for the dangerous times ahead of us i know woods spoke up glaring at a couple of students mainly slytherins who had been snickering at flitwick words that some of you are not entirely convinced that what headmaster dumbledore told you is true and we are not going to argue the point however if there is even a very slight chance that it might be true everyone needs to get all the training they can get she was interrupted when the door opened and the bulky form of umbridge appeared in the classroom i was wondering she said more to herself without bothering with a greeting brandishing a clipboard and quill she plopped down ungraciously on an empty chair in the front of the classroom and a very good morning to you too madam umbridge professor woods said rather pointedly before addressing the class again as i was saying even if there is the slightest chance of voldemort return she looked at the inquisitor as she was saying the name and seemed satisfied with the latter involuntary flinch and i may say that i believe that chance is a lot greater so if there is a chance of voldemort return i must protest umbridge interjected her face a deep shade of purple the ministry attitude in this matter is very clear whatever unfortunate accident happened during the tournament has nothing whatsoever to do with him who must not be named all rumours to the contrary are irresponsible attention seeking panic mongering she seemed to be searching for a climactic expression and finished rather lamely well rumours be that as it may professor woods continued with a shrug it is never wrong to acquire certain abilities or to enhance inherent powers by methodical training which is exactly the aim of this joint project flitwick finished with a benevolent smile and i am sure the ministry will be pleased to see innovative ways of teaching at work umbridge muttered something incomprehensible and started scribbling furiously on her clipboard as we were discussing the other day flitwick continued obviously unimpressed by the inquisitor evident anger basically any spell or charm if used with a negative intention can be used as a hex jinx or even curse on the other hand most hexes or jinxes can come in very useful as means of defence hence the term counter jinx yes miss reed but sir the hufflepuff girl said hesitantly wouldntit be enough to simply use a hex deflection or shielding charm isntthere the danger of counter jinxes causing damage that what they are there for professor woods remarked somewhat dryly causing fleur to smile in spite of herself a simple shielding charm as i hope you all know is very draining and cannot be kept up for a longer time you ll have to drop it sooner or later and then where are you no there is no such thing as passive defence not in the long run of course a shielding or deflection charm will be your first choice if taken unawares but then you ll have to retaliate there no way out of that but slinkhart says in his book umbridge began that you can solve all your problems by negotiation and non retaliation woods cut her short i quite aware of it that why it called defensive magical theory i would really like to see slinkhart negotiating with a dementor most of the students grinned and umbridge complexion turned another shade redder now to come to the subject matter of this class flitwick said bowing to professor woods from his bookstack if you please professor and before the students had quite realised what was happening woods had whipped out her wand pointed it at flitwick and said confundus her voice in no way louder than usual but somehow clearer and filled with an energy that was almost visible the tiny professor staggered on the pile of books he was standing on and for a moment it seemed he was going to fall but presently he steadied himself his wand appeared seemingly from nowhere and he bellowed reduplicare no the energy rebounding from him was visible a jet of light shot towards woods enveloping her in a pale yellow aura and causing her to stumble as if blinded against the wall but before she hit it flitwick finite incantatem restored her control of her movements and she caught herself in the last second the class speechless for a moment broke into applause while flitwick hurried over to his colleague you are alright are you he inquired anxiously of course came the answer but let me commend you on your reaction it did surprise me indeed well she turned to address the students what did you notice about this little performance confundus usually does not have such violent effects one of the gryffindor girls said it must have been that counter spell indeed it was flitwick nodded a very useful tool but not as easy as it may look the usual swish and flick is certainly not enough here now if you will be so kind as to pair up with partners we are going to practise this the rest of the lesson passed with the students practising the new spell and it soon became obvious that it was certainly a tricky business fleur who was paired with lyra suffered a couple of nasty collisions with various pieces of furniture or an occasional student when she failed to repel lyra spells but to her secret satisfaction lyra did not fare any better when the defence was her turn towards the end of the lesson however both of them managed if not to completely to throw the spell back with redoubled force so at least to deflect it and return it to its source i feel like i black and blue all over calliope groaned as they left the classroom but i ll say this the woman certainly knows her stuff the other girls agreed and fleur felt a strong feeling of pride for her grandmother when the students had left the classroom umbridge who had kept to the background during the lesson got up from her chair and marched over to professor woods a word with you she said to her brusquely yes woods tone was perfectly neutral and devoid of emotion i trust you are satisfied with the lesson who are you umbridge growled ignoring the question the records of the ministry donthave any information about you and what are your credentials as far as i know woods replied her voice nearing freezing point regulations say that it is the headmaster sole responsibility to hire staff for his school applicants for positions here have to answer to him alone and the ministry has no call to interfere with the headmaster choice correct me if i wrong so unless you have to make some comments on the lesson you will excuse me umbridge ugly toad like mouth opened and closed without a sound a couple of times woods gave her a radiant smile and left the room the next couple of day passed uneventfully at least as far as the average students were concerned the high inquisitor could frequently be seen talking to students and dropping in on various classes and the general impression was that she became moodier and her expression as far as that was possible for someone with a face like hers even more sour and malevolent than it had already been harry detention continued and his mental connection with fleur improved a good deal so that by the end of the week they were able to communicate wordlessly from one room to another needless to say that those detentions were not only satisfying insofar as they developed their magical abilities she is a very unusual professor hermione remarked when harry returned from his last detention looking extremely content and pleased with himself why harry asked innocently hermione rolled her eyes why can you imagine a teacher any teacher assigning you snogging detentions somehow it had never occurred to harry to look at it that way but but we have been practising he began turning a deep red practising what hermione interrupted scathingly so you ve improved some sort of link between the two of you that already been there big deal i guess you d have got the hang of that sooner or later anyway why she is encouraging you like this it simply beyond me i d never have expected a teacher to disregard school rules like that there is something strange about that woman take my word for it and i ll find out well i believe if there is anything to find out there nobody better to do it than you harry told her smiling though i cantimagine what that might be come on hermy ron interjected give him a break why one could almost think you were jealous i not jealous of anybody ronald weasley there was a note of danger in her voice and how often have i told you not to call me hermy oops said ron retreating from her hastily i just he stopped when he saw her look and disappeared hastily up the stairs honestly growled hermione when will he ever learn it quidditch tryouts tomorrow cho told fleur when they sat down to dinner on friday evening you haventforgotten have you of course not fleur who had completely forgotten everything about it during the last week said trying to sound truthful when right after lunch cho said and i am so glad you are giving it a try her voice was full of eagerness and she looked livelier to fleur than she had ever since the start of term fleur glad that her friend had finally found something to keep her from brooding put her hand on her arm i still not sure they will even want me on the team rubbish they d be crazy i watched you last year you are good have you given it any thought yet i mean what position you want to play i ve told you already nothing where i have to hit those bludgers and i dontcare too much about getting hit with them either so perhaps i could try for seeker what do you think same like harry eh cho grinned nudging her why not i guess i can always take up chasing as well oh i forgot you are the seeker no problem i ve always believed in diversification so how about some warming up tomorrow morning after breakfast on saturday morning they walked over to the quiditch pitch it was one of the typical if rare scottish autumn days with a pale blue sky a few hazy whitish clouds lazily swimming across it the sun was not strong enough yet to dry the dewy meadows and to fleur who was used to a softer climate the air felt chill erm there is something i ought to tell you cho began sounding embarrassed what is it well dontbe mad at me please but it about about roger fleur stopped in her tracks roger roger davies yes he he asked me if i he wants to to talk to you and he thinks if you ask me prettily enough i will ye es now you are mad arentyou fleur was silent for a moment trying to analyse her feelings and it was with some surprise that she realised she felt nothing all her anger her humiliation and embarrassment had somehow just drained away believe it or not she told her friend who was watching her anxiously no i not mad not at you and not even at him any more it all seems so long ago somehow and so unimportant no she repeated giving cho a quick hug i couldntcare less the walked on in a companionable silence then fleur asked what does he want he didntsay exactly apologize most likely i guess he realised you d be playing quidditch together and thought it would be good for the team spirit or something if you get along anyway she added as they approached the pitch you ll hear for yourself there he is and indeed a figure in the blue and bronze ravenclaw quidditch robes that had been standing beneath the hoops was turning and walking towards them slowly a n dear friends here i am again with the next little piece where good old dolores plays an important if transient part i do hope you ll enjoy this and say the same about it as the chapter title chapter 23 a job well done their research in the library proved to be slow and tedious but fleur knew hermione well enough by now to realise quite quickly that she was rather enjoying the challenge you do like things not to be easy dontyou she told her as she was lugging another fat and heavy tome onto their desk hermione did not bother to reply but the sparkle in her eye was answer enough give it a break herms i mean mione ron groaned from his chair in which he had slumped so as almost to disappear below the desk who cares whether the old bat is a spider or a cockroach or something she not worth all this drudgery anyway and there that potions essay we have to do for the greasy git remember honestly ron hermione rolled her eyes but did not continue the sentence now let just see what gideon gargantua has to say about this but gideon gargantua although very eloquent about the subtleties of the animagus transformation from the animagus point of view did not offer anything in the way of information they were looking for nor did esmeralda everglade or yorick ysopius and apart from hermione s everybody enthusiasm was rapidly approaching zero just one more hermione said regarding the drooping heads scornfully checking on cheaters by athena anagramma was the latest in the row of books to be put down on their desk and again except for hermione nobody looked at it with anything else but boredom i hungry ron observed but quickly subsided at the glare hermione gave him as she was running down her finger along the table of contents 587 she muttered to herself and started flipping the pages uncovering disguises she read aloud is an essential skill in the defence against the dark arts i think we have something here thank merlin a low mutter came from ron aloud he said look so we ve found it can we go for dinner now i starving one minute hermione sighed then she took a piece of parchment from her book bag and put it on top of the open page facsimulacrum she said waving her wand nonchalantly what a nice little copying spell she said trying rather unsuccessfully not to look smug it would be too much bother to do it all by hand wouldntit she stuffed the parchment into her bag and slammed the book shut and no i wontlet you do that with our homework she added glaring at the two boys now let go before we have some fatal cases of food deprivation here xxx the next couple of days under hermione relentless command they practised soon it became quite clear that ron talent at the more complicated sort of spell was less than limited and after three rather fruitless evenings of practise he was excused from further attempts harry though more willing to try also found it quite difficult to remember the precise combination of the words and the required complicated wand movements formam obscuram he started once again only for hermione to interrupt him f rm obsc ram she corrected sounding somewhat exasperated and you got the stress wrong again it supposed to be dactylic with ellipses and ah forget it harry said irritably putting his wand away in his pocket what the point anyway it not as if i d walk up to some death eater and ask them politely to please keep still until i have finished give me some good straightforward duelling all the time i ll gladly leave the subtle approach to you girls i ll be off for a game of chess with ron you just go ahead with it well this leaves the two of us doesntit hermione said to fleur boys no patience always rushing straight for it and immediately frustrated when things dontgo their way so where did we leave of give it another try fleur will you xxx towards the end of the week hermione was satisfied with fleur and her own achievement but how to try it out she said friday evening when the four of them were sitting together in the great hall again we cannot just march up to her and shout the spell into her face can we ron said remarkably reasonably not in the castle either we donteven know if it will work do we fleur added the book doesnteven say what exactly happens when you say the spell there only one way to find out i guess harry said dryly now unless you want to try it on mcgonagall hermione shuddered i thought so he grinned and as you cantwalk up to random people whom you suspect of being animagi this leaves you right where we started this discussion so how do we do it well you can keep an eye on that magic map fleur suggested it will at least show us where to find her and then you ll sneak up behind her and cast the spell ron exclaimed excitedly and get us in detention for the rest of the school year hermione voice was shrill ron and me we could distract her harry said slowly and get you in detention for the rest of the year fleur smiled no i d miss you too much we need some disguise you re all daft harry interrupted regarding hermione with some satisfaction you ll take the cloak of course saturday morning found the four of them gathered in the great hall again studying the marauder map as usually on saturday mornings the hall was more or less deserted as it was rather early for a free day and so fleur was sitting at the gryffindor table with the others the invisibility cloak was on the bench between her and hermione neatly folded and looking quite inconspicuous she still in her office harry said pointing at the tiny dot probably still snoring ron added stifling a yawn which caused hermione to roll her eyes they started on their breakfast now and then checking the map she left her room ron said suddenly now where is she ah she heading outside towards the lake hermione looked at fleur who nodded and grabbed the cloak what are we waiting for quick before she disappears the two girls rose and quickly walked out the door ron gaped after them well there still some of that bacon when fleur and hermione stormed out of the gates they could just see the bulky form of their prey disappear behind a couple of bushes along the path towards the forest shall we take the cloak hermione asked but fleur shook her head too difficult we need to hurry so they sped along the path as fast as they could and when they rounded the bushes they saw umbridge all right and only a couple of yards ahead now fleur whispered and they pulled the cloak over their heads and crept on silently the object of their desire stopped and looked around in a suspicious secretive manner let see what she up to hermione suggested the plump woman looked around once again then pulled a piece of parchment out of her robes she reached into them again and produced green bottle with a rather wide neck they saw her touch it with her wand and mutter obviously a spell then she put the parchment in the bottle and deposited it in a thick tuft of grass i sure this is nothing good said fleur let stop her right hermione responded grimly together they levelled their wands and intoned the spell there was a flash of white and a rather large greyish toad was sitting next to the bottle its huge bulging eyes bearing a distinctly bewildered look as far as such a thing is possible for a toad stupefy fleur shouted just as the toad was trying to disappear in the grass would not be a good thing if she turned back too soon she added good thinking hermione said appreciatively and we d better keep under the cloak too let see about that bottle careful it might be anything accio parchment the scroll sailed dutifully into her outstretched hand and she opened it dear minister i have finally thought of a safe way to communicate with you this reversed portkey should work well enough reversed portkey hermione said thoughtfully i ll have to look that up much as i regret to say it i have not been successful in my main task the woods woman identity is still a mystery so that what she after fleur whispered earning a strange look from hermione none of the staff can or will give me any information about her however i can already say that her teaching is certainly not in accordance with the ministry ideas of education and a very good thing it isn t hermione said hotly she good as good as lupin perhaps even better fleur smiled but said nothing in direct contradiction to guidelines she not only spends most of her lessons on practical training of spellwork disregarding theory almost completely but she also actually encourages an aggressive trend among students that will sooner or later lead to dangerous situations putting students lives and health in peril she has together with flitwick revived the duelling practice that the ministry has frequently disapproved of and even more irresponsibly introduced something she calls intercurricular teaching where she and flitwick demonstrate hexing and counter hexing by duelling themselves i am quite sure the ministry will heavily disapprove of this sort of thing and expect your orders how to proceed in this matter i could imagine this grave disregard of the ministry educational policy might be sufficient reason to consider her removal from office and i dontneed to stress again that i am still prepared to take over the position should the ministry need my services ah you d like that wouldntyou hermione growled just wait all this notwithstanding i will still do what i can to uncover the woman identity apart from this my main task i can report something else that will i am sure be of interest to you dear minister you know we share this deep mistrust of crossbreeds here fleur stiffened with anger and i have to report that the headmaster for reasons i cannot imagine and that he wontdivulge to me has accepted into the school that french veela girl that was the beauxbatons champion at the tournament i believe you had an encounter with her last term now i am aware of the fact that unfortunately the wizengamot refuses to pass according laws but i really dontsee why we should put up with this sort of thing what next half banshees in addition that girl seems to be in a relationship with potter and both of them having been in the tournament together constantly claim that the rumour about you know who is true thus permanently undermining the ministry authority something i may add the staff not only tolerate but actually encourage however by lucky chance i have been able to make an important discovery about the veela she is an animagus here hermione looked at fleur with surprise now i cannot at the moment say what french legislation concerning animagi is but i am sure they have to be registered somehow i have a suspicion that that girl is not registered which could be a convenient tool for getting rid of her and her annoying presence i have noticed how she distracts the male students from their work which she most certainly enjoys so i advise the ministry to look into this and take the appropriate measures and eventually get rid of this annoying person and her detrimental influence it would be expedient to securing an atmosphere of stability and reliability which at the moment i am afraid is not noticeable in this school i am awaiting your instructions eagerly dear minister and remain assuring you once again of my thorough devotion to the ministry service d u yuk said hermione when she had finished how anyone can read this without being sick is beyond me but dear dolores she added addressing the still stupefied toad i afraid that through some unfortunate circumstances this letter will never reach its recipient and very carefully and deliberately she tore up the parchment into very small piece that she scattered in the grass but what shall we do fleur rather sensibly asked when she gets back to her normal form what to stop her from just writing the letter again well hermione began and stopped realising that she had not for once given the matter sufficient thought i suppose you you cantmodify her memory can you unfortunately no it auror stuff or so gra i mean professor woods says strictly forbidden to be taught in school and even if i had an idea how to do it i believe it wouldntlast then i afraid we ll but she never came to finish her sentence there was a sudden flurry of white wings a shriek and a croak that broke off quite abruptly and the toad was carried away in the talons of a large white owl what was that the two girls looked at each other stunned i suppose that was the last we ll ever see of the high inquisitor fleur said when she had recovered from her shock not that i ll miss her much to be honest she added with some satisfaction but isntit unusual for owls to be flying about at this time of day mused hermione it looked like hmm very much like hedwig right probably but dontmost owls look more or less the same and everything went so fast i dontthink we can really be sure well not that it will matter much i believe xxx brr professor woods collapsed in the chair in dumbledore office shaking herself tastes as evil as her personality was do you mind and she helped herself to the large crystal decanter on the table in front of her and poured herself a glass cheers she said grinning widely to a job well done you know that officially speaking i could never approve of all this of course dumbledore said trying to look severe but the twinkle in his eyes giving him away but unfortunately it seems that some unknown danger lurks somewhere in the castle grounds just think of poor mr crouch who so mysteriously disappeared not such a long time ago i expect there will have to be an inquiry but tell me one thing with that remarkable ability of yours why didntyou just do it on your own why involve the students she was too careful mcgonagall said none of us teachers could have come near her without her noticing she didnttrust any of us and kept herself protected quite well of course she was too sure of herself to include students in her protective charms and i must say i quite enjoyed watching their academic endeavours to find out about that revealing charm athena anagramma a nice pen name minerva even gives the attentive reader a hint at the author real name and an impressive piece of magic how you got them monitored through this crystal ball he tapped the object on the table with a long finger the only sensible use of crystal balls if you ask me minerva muttered trying to look modest but sounding distinctly pleased with the headmaster praise well good riddance is what i say even if i would not have minded to find out about your identity professor she added towards woods call me vivian please the latter replied sweetly a n i do have the feeling dumbledore and minerva are slightly ooc here but i just was so annoyed with the toad i wanted to get rid of her as fast as possible tell me what you think of it also here are two questions for you what is the hint in minerva pen name and where do we find a character called anagramma in all aspects very different from minerva of course an ok friends and neighbours time for a little fluff hope you enjoy it chapter 26 a birthday present at one of fleur next training sessions with the ravenclaw quidditch team a pretty indian girl with long midnight black plaits came up to her i i wonder she began haltingly and went on in a rush can i join the team please fleur who had seen the girl at the ravenclaw table naturally but never spoken to her before was surprised she seemed to remember her vaguely from last year yule ball too but could at the moment not think of anything more substantial we started training some time ago you know she replied her tone reproachful why didntyou take part in the tryouts and why do you want to join now the girl dark face seemed to take on additional colour and she looked down embarrassed well erm you see she stammered it because because of ron weasley ron weasley and in a flash fleur remembered now i know you went to the ball with him last year didntyou but what does it have to do with your sudden wish to play quidditch you ve never played before i take it the girl shook her head then why the sudden interest ah i know you want to impress him make him interested in you romance in the air the girl dark eyes suddenly flashed with anger romance and with ron weasley not if him and me were stranded on a lonely island for ever and ever i hate his guts no i want to get him back get him back why get him back if you hate him fleur asked once again bewildered by the finer points of the english language no the girl almost shrieked get him back pay him back see for the abominable way he treated me at that stupid ball they have taken him into the gryffindor team as keeper and i thought i see fleur said with a smile let me guess and now you d love to become a beater exactly the girl said grimly well there is no harm giving you a chance you have already missed a couple of sessions but if you train hard and have some talent there is no reason why you should not become a player so welcome in the team er padma padma patil alright padma grab a broom and let me see what you can do padma patil wants to be a quidditch player cho was surprised when fleur told her about it at dinner i always thought she was only interested in clothes and that getting her hair ruffled was her prime fear and concern what the big idea when fleur told her cho eyes dimmed with tears at the memory of cedric and the ball but she smiled bravely of all the reasons for taking up a sport this is probably the craziest but i expect as motivations go it rather powerful and we can really do with some motivated players and from what i ve seen i think she also has some flying talent so she might turn out a valuable asset to the team fleur added in due course september became october the days shorter and chillier and the piles of homework higher and higher in the gryffindor common room hermione could be frequently seen with her nose deep in the book harry had given her for her birthday she also could be smelled from afar as she applied ron perfume so lavishly that alas it was clear the vial would soon be empty i ll get you some more ron would offer happy that she so obviously liked his choice oh no hermione would protest hurriedly shivering slightly there is really no need you must have spent a fortune on this anyway you really need to think of yourself for once and harry would turn away to hide his grin fleur and her room mates got along perfectly amiably helping each other out with the occasional homework and practising spells with and on each other once a week cho would be allowed to see cedric and when she returned she would always appear unnaturally cheerful because she had to put a cheering charm on herself to keep from crying luna would sometimes come up to fleur and chat to her and fleur had come to like the strange girl a lot the lessons in defence and charms were frequently combined and everyone thought it was an immense improvement they learned about applying and repelling various spells like the giggling curse the tearjerker or the brooding charm and it was impressive to see that unnatural hilarity could be just as detrimental to someone state of mind and therefore their actions as depression and melancholy with all the activities going on fleur quite forgot that her birthday was coming up and she never thought of it until on the thirtieth of october a beautiful multicoloured bird arrived during morning post distribution setting down a parcel on the table in front of her it must be from my family she said seeing the curious looks of the others it my birthday tomorrow you see open it already belladonna told her eagerly i sure it something wonderful smiling at the girl fleur complied and caused the parcel unfolds with a few words it contained a silk scarf in the beauxbatons colours and a small black box curious fleur said opening the box it contained what looked like ordinary spectacles there was a label attached to it ever clear spectacles forget about fog and rain always see clearly and below it in the handwriting of her mother it said i still believe your choice of sports is anything but becoming for a lady but delacours always do their best whatever they do so use these to be the best seeker hogwarts has ever seen amazing fleur said strangely touched as she handed the note to cho somehow she seems to return to her old self but then she still very different there was another note from gabrielle with the scarf saying that she had found it in a small shop in paris and had charmed it herself to repel bludgers aimed at her to my big sister who will show everybody that looks are not everything the animated photograph of gabrielle said i wonder how she got the idea fleur said to herself wiping at her eyes sometimes she is so much wiser than her age it a pity she cantcome visit us here cho said i used to like her a lot well i can always ask mother i suppose fleur responded these days she never ceases to amaze me what about harry though cho continued what will he have got you oh i bet he has forgotten just like ron did fleur said lightly although there was a strange feeling inside her harry had certainly not shown any sign of thinking about her birthday at all you know what boys are like and unlike hermione i didntdrop a timely reminder cedric would have remembered cho replied her eyes darkening next day though harry was waiting in front of the transfiguration classroom at the end of her afternoon lessons let go somewhere quiet where we can talk he said to her taking her hand what just wait now where yes why not go up a couple of stairs it usually not so crowded there together they walked up and presently found themselves on the top floor sorry force of habit harry said as they passed the portrait of the fat lady we dontwant to go in there so they turned the other way and walked away from the gryffindor tower entrance the corridor they entered was completely deserted and apart from some pieces of tapestry and the occasional suit of armour was empty there didnteven seem to be any doors in the walls in a muggle building this would have been strange in hogwarts of course this was perfectly normal and also could change any moment just like the arrangement of the staircases there was an almost tangible silence and the afternoon light that came in through the one window at the end of the corridor was rapidly fading steeping their surroundings in dusky twilight the enchanted torches on the walls lit themselves look said harry taking both her hands awkwardly and blushing i he didntfinish his sentence as in that exact moment a richly carved door suddenly appeared in the formerly bare wall what this fleur whispered in surprise dunno said harry in an automatic reflex he had released her hands and whipped out his wand but we ll find out the sudden change from his awkwardness to fully alert inquisitiveness impressed fleur she also took out her wand together they approached the door carefully when they were just in front of it it opened noiselessly by itself the warm glow of candlelight shone out doesntlook particularly dangerous fleur said under her breath no it doesn t but we d better be careful still after all this is me you are with involuntarily fleur shivered as the meaning of this sank in and she took his hand without noticing no need to whisper like that though harry told her whatever it is is clearly expecting us wands at the ready they stepped through the door the room they found themselves in was not big a soft carpet silenced their every step heavy curtains were drawn against whatever windows there were in the opposite wall a nice fire was burning in the marble fireplace to their left with a huge mirror in a gilt frame above it to their right more curtains hid the entire wall in the centre of the room a small table had been set for a meal apparently for two the white tablecloth was beautifully laid out with various plates and cutlery warmly lit by a silver candle holder in the middle with an arrangement of flowers to complete the picture there was no sign of any person in the room they lowered their wands and stood there side by side at a loss for words they did not notice the door close silently exactly like i must be dreaming harry finally managed to say pinch me will you fleur though put her arms round him and kissed him tenderly better than pinching isntit she said with a smile what do you mean exactly like what she could not see it in the shine of the candles but she felt him blush again like i imagined like i would have wanted he stammered your birthday he finally blurted out it exactly how i would have arranged everything for you i even pictured the flowers exactly like this and i was so frustrated i could not do this for you and now it has just well materialised i dontunderstand it oh harry fleur sighed drawing him closer you know these things are not important to me but still you did not arrange all this you say of course not oh i would have if i knew how but there was a loud crack and dobby materialised in front of them he was wearing what looked like a child version of a waiter attire complete with black tailcoat and bowtie he looked almost dignified in it welcome harry potter sir and harry potter flower he said his squeaky voice somewhat spoiling the dignified impression of his outfit he bowed low and motioned for them to sit down at the table dobby yes harry potter sir the elf said eagerly dobby is looking after harry potter and his flower and dobby hopes it is being an enjoyable evening but how the come and go room sir dobby said as if that explained everything what the room of requirement the wizards is calling it sir this room is appearing and it is giving you what you have been wanting harry potter must be having strong magic that the come and go room is obeying him heck i didnteven know it existed harry said feeling embarrassed at dobby praise but it seems to be alright i always knew you were a great wizard fleur said affectionately this is the most wonderful birthday present anyone has ever given me but i didntdo anything harry protested weakly it was just in my imagination shh she said putting a finger to his lips it proves how much you care shall we sit down and see what other extraordinary things happen yes let s she said but but what oh nothing really and it cantbe helped anyway what do you mean it just it seems a shame to be in these drab and boring school uniforms in this gorgeous room now you ll think me awfully vain and superficial wontyou as if whatever you wear would ever make any difference but you re right it is a bit of a contrast harry potter and his flower are wanting new robes dobby piped in dobby is knowing where to find them he led them over to the curtain which moved aside at a click of his fingers revealing a rack hung with robes in various shapes and colours the come and go room is always knowing what you is wanting dobby said proudly with a small sound of delight fleur rushed over to the rack and started to sort through the robes an assortment of the most marvellous dresses was there at her fingertips all her dreams of beauty seemed literally to have come true i suppose this is what the room does making your very dreams come true she said to herself as she let her hands glide along the shining row of fabrics at last a silken garment in a deep emerald green caught her attention just the colour of harry eyes she said as she took it off the hook there was a rustle of silk and a whirl of colours which gave her some shock as it came so suddenly but before she had time to think about it she realised that the dress had somehow replaced her uniform and she was now wearing it as if she had never worn anything else in the meantime harry had remained standing there looking at the choice of robes helplessly until dobby had presented a white jacket to him saying harry potter should try this dobby is thinking it is looking ok oh well harry replied i expect it doesntmatter he took the jacket from dobby and it fitted itself on to him at once which surprised him just like it had fleur only now did he look over at her and what he saw quite literally took his breath away an apparition in emerald green was standing there the tight fitting bodice of the dress accentuated her graceful figure in all the right places and he had to tear his eyes away from the low cut neckline with an effort at the waist the skirt billowed out to end some inches above the knees thus presenting her long slender legs to much advantage her wonderful silver blond hair sparkled in the light of the chandelier glittering against the deep green fabric of the dress feeling strangely shy she stepped towards him harry what er tenderly she took his face in both her hands gently forcing him to look into her eyes harry it me just me he shook himself as if awakening from a trance i sorry he said at last dontknow what come over me it just you never looked that unbelievably gorgeous before her face clouded here you go again she said tonelessly i d better change back into that uniform no please don t he took her hands quickly i so sorry i know how you feel about his sort of thing but i just just canthelp it it it something inside me that i dontseem to be able to control some some kind of monster but i just love you and i ll love you no matter what shape or form you are you know that dontyou he finished desperately oh harry fleur sighed of course i know and i can imagine about that monster you said too you are a teenage boy after all and i suppose there are some things that simply come naturally the slightly awkward silence was interrupted by dobby will harry potter and his flower come to dinner now when they were seated at the table dobby clicking his fingers in various rhythms served their meal and for some time they were eating silently the atmosphere between them again relaxed and amiable to fleur secret delight the house elves had with a heroic effort no doubt conjured a series of dishes that would have found the approval of the most critical french chef she wondered silently how that had been possible but decided not to ask it was probably better just to enjoy what the crazy room would provide and not to destroy the charm with useless questions after dessert harry started searching in his pockets until he fished out a small parcel wrapped in blue paper here he said rather sheepishly this is what i wanted to give to you before all this happened i do hope you like it if you ll accept a present from a stupid gaping idiot like me that is fleur unwrapped the present and gasped in delight when she saw the ring oh harry it beautiful not as beautiful he stopped mentally kicking himself it reminded me of your eyes he finished a bit lamely oh come here you silly boy she got up from her chair went over and sat down in his lap throwing her arms round his neck and seeking his lips with hers i love you she muttered between kisses you too harry managed to reply rather breathlessly holding her tight there was a soft bump and when they looked up they saw that the dinner table had vanished and instead of harry chair they found themselves on a huge soft sofa next to the fireplace i dontthink i ll ever get used to this room fleur giggled and snuggled closer to harry but i think i like it the next few minutes passed with pleasurable snogging during which harry experienced a range of conflicting sensations and emotions of course the feeling of her firm warm body pressed against his was easily the most pleasant he had ever experienced on the other hand though he was rather embarrassed by his physical reaction to her closeness which he was sure she couldntpossibly miss and also somewhat frightened by the heat he felt rising inside him er fleur he said hoarsely when they had to come up for air again yes er why dontyou put on that ring see if it fits your finger fleur who even though her own feelings were in some turmoil as well had a reasonably clear idea of his present condition of body and mind suppressed a giggle a good idea really she said as she climbed off harry lap an action not exactly soothing to him but where do you think it gone now the table vanished the room must have understood her question because there was a sudden gleam of silver light from the mantelpiece and indeed she found the ring there now she looked at it more closely for the first time this is amazing she said to harry as to his secret disappointment she plopped down next to him on the sofa remember that ornament gabie found in the forest the one we experimented it and that disappeared somehow or other the one luna said was morgaine s now this one looks exactly like it can this be a coincidence bewildered harry took the ring from her to look at it again well he said slowly i not one to remember this sort of thing too well but now you re saying it i do believe it looks at least similar what of it but dontyou see harry it not just similar it exactly like it why it even feels exactly like it down to the warm feeling in my hand if this is a coincidence then i ll believe anything where did you get it oh nothing special just that tiny shop full of junk down in hogsmeade hmm perhaps i ll have a look into it some time or other anyway it adorable and i happy you found it she started to put the ring on her finger but harry gently took it from her allow me he said and even in the light from the fireplace she could see he was blushing furiously he rose from the sofa and went down on one knee in front of her a ring has no beginning and no end he said his voice solemn just like my love for you i fell complete when i with you and i miss something when i not so will you accept this ring as sign and token of my love and devotion he took her hand gently and put the ring on her finger then he stood i not good at this sort of thing i afraid he said haltingly looking at the floor i sure this sounded pathetic and clich like in a trashy novel but it what i really and truly feel and it not hormones talking either he finished a defiant note in his voice there were tears in fleur eyes as she jumped up and folded him in her arms passionately oh harry she whispered between sobs you cantknow how happy all this makes me it the first time she broke off and buried her head in his shoulder while he stroked her shiny hair gently do you know he said after a while this is the very first time that halloween has a pleasant surprise for me chapter 27 november after dutifully escorting fleur back to ravenclaw tower under the invisibility cloak a physical proximity both enjoyed greatly it was well beyond ten o clock when harry climbed through the portrait hole and into the gryffindor common room most of the gryffindors were still up engaged in various activities ranging from studying to playing chess to less exerting pastimes like exploding snap ron and hermione were sitting well more lounging in ron case on the sofa busily working on some sort of homework or other that is as harry said to himself with a smile hermione was doing the working while ron part mostly consisted of the occasional non committal grunt and the absent minded stroking of her back given this not very high level of concentration it was only natural that ron should look up at harry entrance probably happy enough about this interruption he unfolded his lanky figure from the sofa harry mate he said we missed you at dinner where ah donttell me i know that goofy grin you ve been with her haventyou harry tried hard to suppress the surging blush yeah he said rather sheepishly it it her birthday today see but what have you been up to hermione after putting a neat full stop on her parchment enquired i mean you ve been away for some four hours well it was like this harry started and told them about the room of requirement hermione was fascinated of course i ve read about it in hogwarts a history ron sighed theatrically rolling his eyes but i never expected it seemed only for special well important occasions it was important enough for me harry said stubbornly so what did you get her ron stopped himself the ring of course she must have loved it as hermione didntknow what he was talking about harry had to tell her about that too we ll have to look at that ring of course she said when he had finished it may just be a coincidence but if there is the slightest chance it is not we ll just have to make sure somehow this looks a bit fishy to me to be honest but mate ron said returning to a topic he felt a lot more interested in than a stupid ring what did the two of you actually do all that time he was looking at harry so he missed the glare from hermione ah wouldntyou like to know harry told him smugly do you really think i ll tell but i can assure you we had a most wonderful time together you re no friend you aren t ron grumbled now i ll have all sorts of weird dreams at which hermione huffed disdainfully well i ll leave you to your immature fantasies then she said giving them a haughty look good night dontknow what got into her now ron muttered and harry although he imagined he had some pretty accurate idea about that didntbother to enlighten him presently both went up to their dormitory as well happy and pleasantly tired though he was harry found it difficult to fall asleep the image of fleur in the emerald green dress was too vivid in his mind his inner eye found it just as hard if not harder to tear itself away from certain physical aspects of hers as his real eyes had what can a girl like her possibly see in me the thought unbidden was suddenly there looming like a dark cloud too beautiful to be real and i a little boy how very right she was when was that a year ago i remember it like yesterday i dare say i look ridiculous next to her why me she could have any celebrity she wants why does she bother with a skinny kid with messy hair who number one on voldemort list too pity most likely but then he recalled the feeling of her warm body against his her kisses and whispered words the cloud receded and at last he drifted into sleep and this time his dreams were no nightmares in the ravenclaw common room most people were also still about their various businesses when fleur entered most of the students had become used to her well enough by now so her entrance went largely unnoticed fleur still elated by the evening events was just heading towards the staircase quietly intending to relive said events in private when luna accosted her happy birthday fleur she said taking her completely by surprise and before fleur could even wonder how she knew about her birthday she went on i wonder where he found it even though she had grown accustomed to luna habit of changing topics abruptly fleur was bewildered once again what the stone harry gave you of course luna said pointing at fleur hand it come back to you hasntit back yes you lost it last year remember you mean it the same one how can you be sure well i just i just know it feels familiar to you doesntit fleur noticed how luna had said feel rather than look actually it does she admitted but how on earth luna shrugged as if the question was of no importance it shouldntbe in a setting though she said her voice dreamy again it likes to be free speechless fleur watched her as she turned and sauntered off could it really be the same stone and who then had set it into the ring and why and that weird phrase it likes to be free unable to think of any sensible explanations she decided to get to bed similar to harry in the privacy of the bed hangings the images of the evening appeared in her mind again he so sweet when he gets all awkward shy and gentle a pleasant difference when i think of no i wontthink of those still is it really me or my looks i hate those looks how can i know for certain girls like hermione they dontappreciate what they ve got i wish i was like her then i could be sure similar to harry the dark cloud of these thoughts enveloped her and similar to harry again she remembered how his words had touched her when he had handed her the ring and when she fell asleep her dreams were no nightmares either xxx the first weekend of november was at hand and with it the beginning of the quidditch season starting as always with gryffindor playing slytherin early saturday morning ron who couldntsleep any more and had only slept rather fitfully as it was scrambled out of his bed of course he was trying to be as silent as possible so as not to wake his roommates but equally of course be banged into things and swore in a manner that could have roused the petrified stuff it ron came harry indistinct voice what the heck are you up to at this time of night gotta practise ron replied struggling into his quidditch gear oh merlin seamus groaned the bloody match starts at two what do you think you re doing now now i know it your first game harry said sticking his head out between his bed hangings and i know slytherin are not exactly an easy start too but you did well enough in the training sessions you know that dontyou and anyway it too late now dean could be heard or too early whatever you do get lost and let a guy sleep seamus summed up what everybody felt and ron who had at last succeeded in getting ready left the dormitory good thing we arentfirst to play cho told fleur at breakfast the game against hufflepuff will be hard enough with our inexperienced youngsters playing slytherin would be plain murder are they that good ah if it was only for that actually they arent that good in the purely technical sense of the word but they are absolute champions when it comes to foul play but surely there is a referee to see to it as if poor madam hooch could see everything no just wait and see and take your lesson you ll be up against them too after lunch the audience slowly assembled in the stands of the quidditch pitch from what fleur heard it seemed everybody was eager not so much for gryffindor to win but for slytherin to lose hardly a fair attitude she remarked to bella who was sitting next to her best team to win or something like that isntit just wait till you ve seen them play bella replied darkly of course as soon as the two teams appeared fleur best team to win attitude evaporated at the sight of harry once again she was overwhelmed to see how small and vulnerable he looked especially if seen next to the slytherin team that seemed more or less to consist of squarely built thuggish looking part giants and whose features only too clearly expressed their wish to bear down on their opponents and crush them to pulp sports fairness and rules be damned harry almost unconsciously her thoughts went out to him conveying all her anxiety i fine his answer came back and her heart jumped at the light and joyful tone it brought with it forget these clowns the whistle went and it only took a minute or two for fleur to realise what cho and the others had meant when they talked about slytherin way of playing when a bludger hit alicia spinnet forcefully in the back and sent her dangerously tumbling down with her broom before she could catch herself and regain control of it and she not even been anywhere near the quaffle fleur said shocked by the unfairness of it why isntthe referee doing something told you so didnti bella said with grim satisfaction it no use either you cant prove it was done on purpose can you anyone can miss their aim now and then can they the game went on and it soon became painfully clear that ron keeping abilities were considerably less than satisfactory only ten minutes into the game slytherin were already leading forty to a miserable zero points for gryffindor seemingly elated by this they stepped up their violent and unfair play and still the snitch was nowhere to be seen the state of affairs got worse during the following one and a half hours even though the snitch put in a couple of appearances it was never long enough for any of the seekers to get reasonably near to it in the meantime the slytherin chasers effectively aided by clever strokes from the beaters were rather literally slaughtering the gryffindors so that the score was now at 160 to 10 most gryffindor team members bruised and battered ron close to tears and the slytherin spectators bloodthirstily roaring for more it was therefore without any hesitation that fleur on seeing the golden twinkle a couple of feet to her left sent out her silent call to harry forcing his broom around in an incredible manoeuvre harry tore off towards the snitch that he had now seen unfortunately there was no way draco malfoy could not notice this and so he sped towards that spot as well at neck breaking speed fleur gasped when the disastrous collision seemed inevitable but miraculously harry managed to change course in the very last second it was not enough though and just as his fingers closed around the struggling golden ball malfoy boots caught him in the head for a frightening split second fleur had the sensation of everything around her going black and it was only with a huge effort that she could fight it horrified she saw harry tumbling down seemingly unconscious just before he hit the ground though he straightened up and managed to land smoothly on the grass the audience broke into a deafening roar when he raised his arm to present the snitch that the game finished lee jordan shouted excitedly and the score is 160 to 160 drat why couldnthe have caught the bloody thing earlier none of the two teams was too happy with the result of course harry had been successful with the snitch yet the score was just a draw and not the victory all the gryffindors had hoped for and the slytherins needless to say were perfectly fed up seeing their huge lead come to nothing like that ron of course was absolutely devastated and refused to speak to anyone he didnteven come down to dinner an unprecedented behaviour that alarmed hermione so much she left the table to go in search of him after dinner fleur went over to the gryffindor table and sat down next to harry are you all right she asked eyeing the black and blue lump where malfoy boots had collided with his forehead with concern oh it nothing he said lightly and his cheerful grin made her heart jump needs more than a dirty malfoy boot to knock me off thanks for that hint he finished squeezing her hand i just had to she said returning gesture it may not have been fair but then anything is fair compared to slytherins harry said matter of factly besides it was the best thing we could have done if they d just scored one more goal it would have been too late hey you ll be next wontyou again he gave her that grin and again she felt her insides doing somersaults she nodded silently so how about some practise tomorrow oh harry you know there nothing i like better than flying with you well almost nothing she added blushing furiously xxx when ron had calmed down sufficiently for hermione to turn her mind to other issues again she insisted they take a closer look at fleur ring even if it is and i expect it will be only a coincidence and a striking similarity she told fleur one evening it will be good to know for sure and if it not it will be especially important because there are no end of good uses you can put it to there e can be no harm in making sure anyway therefore one afternoon after lessons when the feeble november sun was already going down behind the mountain range they met on the lakeshore it used to protect you from spells hermione said the stone you had last year did that is so if i fling this expelliarmus at you the spell hit the unsuspecting fleur right in the stomach even before hermione had finished her sentence blasted her off her feet and sent her sprawling to the ground a couple of feet away while her wand sailed into hermione outstretched hand in an elegant arc oof said fleur trying to catch her breath and well said hermione trying not to look too smug and satisfied with herself so that one question answered said fleur struggling to her feet and suspecting hermione might have put slightly more force into her spell than altogether necessary so it seems luna was wrong for once and a good thing too harry who had rushed towards her and was now busy dusting the dirt off her robes added i mean it would have been quite weird if it was the same stone dontyou think and they all had to agree xxx inexorably the end of november and with it the quidditch match against hufflepuff drew nearer and roger davies was getting more distraught each day fleur could not blame him the team progress was slow to put it favourably and it would need a major miracle for ravenclaw to win the game the dark outlook was confirmed when one afternoon fleur went to watch the hufflepuff team at practice it was true that their chasers seemed to be having some difficulties coordinating their movements and compared to roger their keeper was rather inadequate but peter summerby the hufflepuff captain who had succeeded cedric as seeker was extremely good very nearly as good as harry fleur had to admit to herself he been their seeker for years cho told her tying to reassure her so he bound to know what he doing just keep a clear head and your eyes open then you can certainly beat him well if you say so fleur replied doubtfully not for the first time reflecting on the unfairness of the quidditch rules that made catching one golden snitch worth the long and wearisome toil of scoring fifteen goals it just the way it is cho shrugged when fleur mentioned these ideas to her there absolutely no use thinking about it all i didntmake those rules did i and it not that you actually hate this one particular rule as long as you are the one that catches the snitch am i right i suppose you are fleur agreed she was always surprised how seriously cho took anything quidditch but she was glad to see that it was a topic that meant a lot to her and could even take her mind off cedric she did not though say that it was all a game because she was sure her friend would not understand her an well another chapter from yours truly which hopefully finds your approval i no good at writing quidditch games which is awful because i need to write the hufflepuf ravenclaw game in the next chapter if anybody out there would like to assist me inthis you re welcome just drop me aline a n welcome to the next chapter again thanks for all the great reviews and the interesting ideas i canttell you how much i appreciate them this chapter does not have too much action but there some information about the veela powers that is perhaps of interest the next chapter will be more of everything fluff and action i promise my compliment to those who guessed that they were both looking at venus the morning star of course technically it a planet but it looks like a star doesntit chapter 3 my baby sent me a letter now ma petite vivienne delisle said to her granddaughter i think it time to look after your education your mother seems to have neglected it rather sadly if you ask me what do you mean grandma your veela heritage of course i afraid she somewhat embarrassed by not being pure blood and has been trying to ignore her ancestry which is quite the wrong attitude naturally you know i ve always told you to accept who and what you are it the only way well whatever as i see it there are two things at issue for you you need to learn how to transform into your bird it wontdo if it just happens accidentally and we ought to look into that vanished veela charm of yours too but grandma i told you i dontwant it back nonsense child her grandmother told her sternly it would be quite foolish to reject something that is after all part of your nature besides she added with a sly grin it can come in quite handy on occasion if you know how to use it that is but anyway we must find out if it still there well if you say so fleur said doubtfully indeed i do now let me see the original veela ability that is the natural animagus capacity is not limited to a specific species of bird full veela like me can transform into any kind of bird they wish it just depends on their mood and state of mind so if i am happy and content i may choose to be a phoenix she demonstrated it to fleur who had never seen her do this before and gaped at her open mouthed or when i particularly furious her grandmother continued having turned back to her human form i might become harpy or some other similarly unpleasant creature as i am not furious at the moment you ll just have to believe me without seeing me actually do it it not a nice sight anyway or so i have been told also if the feeling is especially strong i may even transform without intending to i can tell you there have been some narrow escapes oh grandma i never knew all these things why have you never told me before there was no point in it earlier part veela part human characteristics are usually different for each individual sometimes one or the other part has the upper hand and anyway as long as you had not reached a certain basis in your personality development there was no way to tell anything definite now it seems this stage has finally been reached your inborn veela charm that used to annoy you so much seems to have gone and this is as i think a sign that you are ready to start taking control of your inherited powers transforming is one the deliberate control and use of the charm is the other and i believe they are both there and just need to be re discovered now which one do you want to go looking for first transforming fleur said without hesitation fine you ve told me you have already tried this before apparently your bird is the white owl now we cannot be sure at this stage if this will remain the only bird form you can change to there may be other choices when you have grasped the essentials however as the owls seems to suit you best we ll start with it you say you ve been trying this using a toy model yes but it was not any use not surprisingly it was rather a small model wasntit this may be more help look here and she turned into a full size snowy white owl and perched on the back of the chair she had been sitting in fleur stared at the bird trying her best not to blink for as long as she could manage until she thought the image was secure in her mind then she closed her eyes tightly and tried to imagine herself in the same form she thought she felt some sort of tingling in her arms but this might just as well have come from the cramped posture she was sitting in otherwise she did not notice any change annoyed she opened her eyes again her grandmother had changed to her normal form again and was sitting in the chair facing her smiling what happened nothing i thought there was some prickling in my arms but i not even sure of that oh why donti have that necklace any more i sure it would have helped anything you believe in helps vivienne stated dryly but no the real veela powers work without any instrument no stones no wands just the strength of your mind why use crutches if you can fly oh grandma it all very well for you to talk but how will i ever there only one way try and try again and again about one hour later fleur threw up her hands exasperated it doesntwork i feel as if i was full of feathers already but look at me no change at all patience child this is hard work for you i know and i know too that you are tired so let stop this for now and work on it again in the afternoon you see i dontbelieve you are motivated well enough for this in this melancholy mood of yours perhaps you can think about this find some reason why you would really really want to learn this you ll manage at last i guarantee and with these words she changed into a colourful bird of paradise and flew out the window frustrated fleur banged her head against the back of her chair what the matter son tony figg asked harry when he found him sitting on the rickety old chair in front of the storehouse gazing into space absentmindedly harry started and went a deep shade of red nothing no nothing he stammered come on son dontyou tell me it nothing everybody can see it not true he looked at harry inquiringly then smiled broadly girl trouble if possible harry went still redder than he was already umph he said thought so tony replied putting a calming hand on harry shoulder experienced a thing or two in my time believe me still remember the signs though you d not think it looking at me i d say you ve got it bad son want to tell me about her dontthink your uncle would be willing to listen would he what can i tell him i cantgo around telling muggles about the tournament can i but i so want to talk to someone wrong tony he said grimly the point is i d sooner die than tell him but he paused uncertainly come on tony repeated reassuringly what harm could there be in telling me it will make you feel better if nothing else perhaps i can even give you some advice you never know harry took a deep breath all right there that girl i met at my school a a foreign exchange student see they have foreign exchange programmes at st brutus are you having me on oh dear i forgot whatever must you think of me more embarrassed than ever harry voice rose i not at a school for young criminals if that what you mean it a lie my uncle tells dontask me why because he hates me i guess no my school is a boarding school in scotland eh i dontthink you ll know it it a very small school my parents left me some money to pay for it you do believe me do you he ended almost desperately he had come to like and respect tony during the last couple of days and his opinion meant a lot to him a lot more than that of all the dursleys together calm down son of course i do tony said quietly just so like your uncle isntit well go on so there is this girl where is she from by the way harry heaved a great sigh of relief thank you tony it great you trust me she from france the prettiest girl you can imagine but but she almost three years older than me i could hardly believe it when she when we kissed yes and now i back i ve started thinking i mean a girl like her what does she see in me there must be millions of guys good looking rich smart they must be queuing for a date with her and well look at me it seems so absurd now and indeed he looked quite pathetic in his baggy jeans held in place by a shabby belt round his waist and the shapeless washed out t shirt hand me downs of dudley s tony didntsay a word just looked at him encouragingly and this morning i couldntsleep and was up early i had a a dream i felt her presence and i imagined that she was kissing me which is nonsense of course well that my story sorry for bothering you with it you re welcome harry i dontknow if it will help but it the normal story happens millions of times first teenage crush and so on but it didntfeel like a simple crush anyway tony went on i expect you ve written her a letter harry blushed once again this time with anger at himself you haven t you ve just been moping around all these days when they say love blurs your reason they dontmean it like that now i want you to promise me that you ll write that girl a long nice letter first thing when you get home this evening and if your uncle gives you any trouble about posting it give it to me and i ll see to it and now get out of that blue funk of yours and help me with these crates thanks tony you are a great friend dontmention it fleur had been staring out of her window watching the last colours of the day fade into the velvety darkness of the southern french night seeing the first star light in the sky her thoughts wandering the soft hoot of an owl brought her back from her reverie focusing she saw oh it you she exclaimed happily after she had overcome her first shock helen was it the owl hooted angrily sorry something with h oh hedwig you have a letter from him the owl offered her leg and fleur untied the scroll of parchment starting to open it eagerly hedwig gave another impatient hoot oh i suppose you want your treat dontyou let me see i afraid there not much i ve got can you wait a moment i ll yes dang it all i keep forgetting i can do this now she apparated down to the kitchen and was back almost immediately with a plate of assorted meats here you are bon appetit you will be hungry after your long journey and while hedwig was attacking her supper she turned again to harry letter dear fleur i really dontknow how to begin this and to be honest i dontknow how to go on and i dontknow how to finish either this doesntmake sense you say no i expect it doesn t but i in a state of mind where i afraid i unable to think clearly do you know i didnteven think of writing to you a friend of mine had to tell me i should a friend yes i ve found a friend my first friend in the muggle world but let me begin at the beginning the dursleys are as nasty as ever as you can imagine and made me do the most stupid chores all over the house just out of spite but then that worker at my uncle factory broke his leg or something and he made me take his job while he away he not paying me anything of course but at the job i got to know tony the foreman and he has been very nice to me all these days he a muggle of course so i canttell him much about myself but he the only one who will listen to anything i say so today i told him about you and here is why just imagine what happened this morning i was sitting in that small park i couldntsleep you see and was looking at that star and suddenly i had the strangest feeling i saw your eyes your beautiful eyes and i felt you kissing me it was so real i dontknow how it happened and it lasted for a few seconds only but i almost believe it was no dream something seems to have been going on but what oh fleur are you still thinking of me at all that prophecy sounds so far away and absurd now fire and water is absurd isntit sometimes i just cantimagine why a girl like you should even look at me twice perhaps what you felt for me was just pity i could understand if it was i just a little boy you said so yourself remember and i not altogether safe to have as a friend either so if you are a sensible girl you ll pretend you never met me but whatever you do i want you to know that it was great and i wouldntmiss it for anything even if we should never ever see each other again i know this is quite a depressive piece of ranting but i think there no use at all pretending i in a happy go lucky mood i trusted you when we were in those tasks and i not going to stop now love i told you i didntknow how to finish this harry ps my dreams are just as bad as ever only a lot more so oh harry fleur whispered tears were streaming down her face as she dropped the letter we looked at the same star if you only knew we looked at venus at the same time and we had the same experience and you have doubts about the prophecy if i could only go and see you after another moment hesitation she told hedwig to wait and not to go back to her master right away and then apparated to her grandmother room in the other wing of the mansion grandma she began without any preliminaries i believe i motivated enough now as you said i ought to be so can we please take up practising now what happened vivienne asked surprised and slightly amused at fleur impatience why the hurry so fleur had to tell her about harry letter and i cantwait to go and tell him how blind he is being i sure when he hears about this morning he ll have not doubts anymore and i want him to stop being so miserable that the spirit vivienne said approvingly so let begin a n a slightly quicker update thanks for reviewing especially to bagge who keeps on giving me ideas enjoy chapter 30 the delacour mansion during the next couple of days most of the teachers relented somewhat and reduced the amount of homework with regard to the upcoming holiday not so snape naturally it not as if we could waste time he would tell the class there are still several items of subject matter that need to be done you have some newts to keep in mind even if for some it may look like ages they are closer than you seem to think judging from the sluggish sort of work you have been doing lately he glared at his students and it seemed to fleur especially at her she was sure she had done reasonably well at potions during the last couple of weeks but she knew the professor well enough by now to know that he did not need any particular reasons to be nasty he hates you because he hasntbeen able to take points off you lyra suggested apart from these less than pleasant lessons though the last two weeks before the christmas holidays passed quietly enough will you come home for the holidays too fleur asked her grandmother one day after the defence lesson i afraid not cherie i dontthink it a good idea if harry sees me there in my present form and i not sure i can work it out to return to my normal appearance at he right moment also there is rather a lot to prepare here for the next term but she went on when she saw fleur disappointment perhaps i can make it for a short visit on new year eve i cantpromise anything though especially as albus has asked me to help him with a couple of things albus grandma all the teachers here call him albus there nothing at all to it oh grandma i never knew you were such a miserable liar but it good to hear you are getting along well with him stop smirking you naughty child yes it right we are getting along fine but that just it nothing else well if you say so after all it took me some time too to find out about harry and myself or rather to admit it to myself ow why are you hitting me laughing fleur fled to meet up with harry how are we going to travel to france harry asked one afternoon you cantapparate across such distances can you no certainly not i dontsuppose mother will send the family coach again she just did it to show off you know so we ll probably have to use the international floo network well i expect she ll send me an owl about it soon and indeed next morning the delacour mail bird delivered silver goblet together with a short note that explained it was a portkey that was to transport them to the delacours mansion on the friday before the holidays at four o clock in the afternoon you are so quiet harry fleur said in the evening is there something wrong erm well i ve been wondering i should get some kind of present for your mother shouldnti what no you really donthave to what on earth would you get her anyway well see i ve been thinking about the way you always describe her i believe she likes to show off doesntshe what are you trying to get at well yes yes of course she does but what i i was thinking oh this sounds so stupid but do you believe she d like a photo with with my autograph as fleur seemed speechless he added quickly i know it nothing just tell me if you think it he couldntfinish because fleur threw herself into his arms and kissed him fervently oh harry she gasped you d really do that i know how much you hate being famous and everything and you d do a thing like that just for my mother she ll never be able to appreciate what doing it means to you she ll put that picture somewhere very conspicuous and she ll make every visitor admire it are you really sure you want that harry shuddered of course i dontwant it but i mean she has everything she could possibly want right and after all i doing it for you this remark understandably earned him another passionate bout of kissing the nearer the holidays came the darker ron mood seemed to become and it was only when hermione told him her parents had allowed her to spend tem with him at the burrow that he cheered up somewhat if you are quite sure you can put up with all those brothers of mine he said trying unsuccessfully to sound casual i suppose it might brighten up things a bit but in spite of it all there was some distinct jealousy in his voice whenever the topic of harry going to france came up the last friday of school was finally there the last lessons were finished and most students were getting ready to go home most of them were to take the hogwarts express to london where they would be picked up by their families cho although she had remonstrated with dumbledore that she wanted to be near cedric had to leave as well it would have caused curiosity if she had stayed for no apparent reason only a very few were staying behind among them as fleur had already heard lyra and luna luna father was going on an expedition to remote parts of canada to look for some exotic creature or other fleur had forgotten the name lyra had been rather vague about her own father doings during the week between christmas and new year she had only said that he would not be able to spend the holidays with her but she had not given the impression of minding it much luna and i can keep each other company she had said lightly when fleur had said something to try and cheer her up everything will be nice and quiet for a change and it had been very obvious to fleur that she did not want to discuss the matter any further after saying their good byes to hermione ron and the others fleur and harry sat down in the deserted great hall with their portkey and waited for the clock to strike four at the last strike there was the familiar sensation and after a somewhat prolonged feeling of dizziness due as harry supposed to the long distance they had travelled they found themselves in the salon of the delacour mansion even before harry had time to look at his new surroundings there was a shriek of delight and gabrielle hurled herself at him almost knocking him off his feet harry the little girl exclaimed happily harry is it really you and only after this outburst she turned to her sister to give her an enthusiastic hug why didntyou tell me she scolded i d have put on my most beautiful dress for him hello gabrielle harry said recovering from her assault let me have a look at you you really have grown a lot since i saw you last and you are getting as pretty as your big sister really harry you shouldntspoil her like that fleur told him and i ll be getting jealous too if you say such things but nevertheless she proceeded to translate his words faithfully for her sister who blushed happily at the compliment gently disentangling herself from gabrielle arms fleur took harry hand and went to introduce him to her mother like everybody else who met isabeau delacour for the first time harry was overwhelmed with her magnificent appearance while fleur usually wore her hair open her mother had set it in an elaborate style piled high up on her head so that she looked even taller than she was she was wearing a midnight blue sleeveless dress with a daringly low neckline that set off the creamy whiteness of her skin it was perhaps just because of all the things fleur had told him about her mother but harry had the distinct feeling that there was a certain coldness in those deep blue eyes that were so similar to fleur s he felt small and insignificant his throat seemed to be suddenly dry as he tried to say something before he could though isabeau reached out and took both his hands in hers bienvenue harry she said with a dazzling smile i am so glad to meet you at last he noted with surprise that there was no trace of a foreign accent in her english i was very angry with this silly girl for not introducing us over at hogwarts before the third task of the tournament welcome again and i hope you will have a lovely time with us with these words she kissed both his cheeks when she let go of his hands harry had to try hard not to shake himself like a wet dog silently he thanked his stars for having fleur by his side when he looked into her eyes it felt as if waking from a trance i have ordered the house elves to have dinner ready at eight isabeau went on in a completely different businesslike tone which leaves you some four hours why dontyou show harry everything cherie she turned to fleur i ll come along too gabrielle shouted jumping up and down how often have i told you this is no ladylike behaviour isabeau reproached her younger daughter but why not run along i ll see you at dinner harry when harry and the two girls were alone he took a deep breath your mother does have an overwhelming personality he said and his tone was only half joking i felt like i was drowning for a moment yes she does have that effect on most people fleur said a note of anger in her voice she does it on purpose i believe it her version of the veela charm dontyou think she just canthelp it isntit in her nature or something i d have laughed at the idea half a year ago fleur replied thoughtfully but if i think how different she has been these last months i not so sure to say the truth perhaps she really has to behave like that it doesntmatter i guess as long as you dontfall under that spell that is no way harry said with much emphasis pulling her towards him and kissing her now i know what she like there is no danger of anything like that gabrielle was impatiently shoving them and so fleur turned to her and shortly summed up what they had been talking about ah not to worry fleur she said dismissively harry is strong enough to resist that he resisted imperius remember so mama charm should be a piece of cake dontyou think once again fleur had to agree with her sister come harry she said let me show you around our home and together the three of them set off harry one arm around fleur waist and gabrielle tugging at his other hand it a very old house fleur told him it been in my father family for several centuries the delacours as mother never tires mentioning are one of the oldest wizarding families in france actually they used to be purebloods until my father to the horror and disgust of the family went and married a half veela and half muggle at that they d have disinherited him gladly but unfortunately for them he is the only son and even worse than having the precious pure blood diluted was the idea of the family estate going to strangers where is your father by the way harry asked isnthe here for christmas too i have no idea if we ll see him he likes to keep in the background rather and he does a lot of travelling actually i ve often wondered how he ever plucked up the courage to defy all his family when marrying mother i suspect she used the charm on him well perhaps there is more to him than meets the eye harry said slowly thinking of neville perhaps he only shows his courage on occasions that really matter to him perhaps he really loves her fleur looked at him surprised why i think it may be possible but it still wontexplain why he is away so often well i guess it isntexactly important at the moment is it you are here that important again at gabrielle insistence she had to tell her what they had been talking about this is getting tedious she said to harry we need to put the translatio spell on her soon translatio the translating spell so she can understand and speak english they used it on me before i went to hogwarts it has several levels according to your age and capacity of mind so that why your mother english is so perfect without any trace of accent yes that would be the proficiency level i got it during the holidays too for gabie at her age i suppose elementary ii will be a possibility can you do that spell i not sure it very complicated better to ask mother to do it she interpreted this conversation to gabrielle and the little girl was all excited about the idea but i sure i good enough for advanced i she said eagerly we ll see about that fleur told her fondly and we ll ask mama right after dinner harry was amazed at the sheer vastness of the delacours mansion but while the burrow small and cramped as it was emanated an atmosphere of warmth and cosiness the mansion with all its grandeur gave a cold and haughty impression the impression of a place where strict rules and a sense of propriety prevailed i sure i ll get lost ever so often he said as they walked up the stairs to the second or third floor he had lost count it a mercy your staircases dontkeep moving as they do in hogwarts just never walk around without me fleur told him with a warm smile as if i ever would the delacour house elves had surpassed themselves and harry found he had never eaten anything even remotely like this dinner even if he had no idea what most of the dishes were isabeau went out of her way to be particularly nice to him so much so in fact that fleur was beginning to get worried harry however showed no signs of reacting to her charms in any but the must polite and neutral way and so her anxiety subsided again when after the last course gabrielle insisted for harry to come and play exploding snap with her fleur addressed her mother i most grateful you invited harry to stay and everything i am sure she began hesitantly but i i dontknow what are you playing at using that charm on him all the time these last words came out in a hurry and she stopped surprised at herself what charm cherie isabeau replied sweetly you know exactly what i mean fleur retorted angrily calm yourself dear her mother said with a superior smile i am certainly not going to try and steal your boyfriend from you it wouldntbe appropriate would it but yes i was testing him i ll admit and you may have seen yourself that after the first shock he could ward me off easily enough i have to express my respect it not usual for a fifteen year old boy to resist that charm and i must congratulate you too dear he must really love you it may have been her imagination but fleur thought she had heard a note of envy in her mother voice her anger melted away and when her mother embraced her she let it happen willingly after the translatio spell had been performed on gabrielle to everybody surprise the advanced level really worked on her i told you so she said triumphantly fleur showed harry to his room on the third floor this is gabie s she pointed out and here is yours and mine is next to it tomorrow i ll show you the park and everything and you ll have to teach me some flying too gabrielle piped in relishing in her new language abilities fleur shouldntalways get to do the good things only her accent was still pretty strong but she found no problem in either speaking or understanding the foreign language i will if your mother allows me harry smiled at the little girl then he proceeded to hug fleur and kiss her good night a feat that lasted a couple of minutes until gabrielle started to become impatient good night to you too she said very loudly oh sorry harry said you do look sweet when you re pouting like that do you know that and he bent down to kiss her cheek good night she doing it on purpose fleur said when her sister had disappeared in her room skipping happily along almost like mama i ll have to talk to her about that ah she just a kid dontbe so hard on her well so it really good night now isntit reluctantly he tore himself away from her and entered his room although it was spacious with a large window and elegantly furnished the room like the rest of the mansion conveyed none of the cosy feeling that ron tiny cubicle had moreover there was the distinct impression that this room was normally unused he went over to the huge four poster bed noticed that his pyjamas had already been laid out for him and only now realising that he was dead tired got into them and then into bed he closed his eyes sleep well he heard fleur voice in his mind and he could have sworn her lips were on his for a short moment but of course when he opened his eyes he was quite alone a n here you ll find out a few bits about fleur mother at last tell me what you think chapter 37 awakening a very strange case n est ce pas gal n rougecroix said to dumbledore when vivienne and the others had gone dumbledore silently nodded he bent over the motionless figure on the bed put his hand on her forehead and concentrated it might be a good idea to get a therapeutical pensieve he said after a time it may help if we analysed her memory we would need her consent for that the healer replied it unethical to invade someone memory without it i am quite aware of the fact dumbledore retorted a note of impatience in his voice however i believe it will be somewhat difficult to obtain that consent and as we both believe that it has something to do with voldemort we should not waste time on a mere formality after all nobody ever needs to know about this except you and me the healer hesitated very well he said at last it is probably just like you say i still feel uncomfortable about it but it is most likely the best approach to the case with a small gesture he summoned a miniature silver basin that he handed to dumbledore voila monsieur i would indeed feel better if you applied it harry and the girls had been quite nervous and restless all evening and refused to go to bed so vivienne put her foot down you are not helping anybody by staying up all night she said all you will reach by that is complete exhaustion by tomorrow morning when perhaps you will get a chance to be useful she conjured up a large sofa in the middle of the salon lie down she ordered in a voice that clearly brooked no protest somnium with a satisfied smile she watched the three youngsters cuddle up together on the sofa already fast asleep with a click of her fingers she summoned a house elf watch over them maisy she said i am going to the clinic if anything out of the ordinary happens let me know at once bien sure madame the elf said bowing low and vivienne disapparated at the clinic she found dumbledore busy setting the pensieve up to work he stopped when he saw her ah vivienne good you have come back i suppose it will be alright if she gives her permission to use this he continued turning to gal n correct the nearest blood relatives certainly have authority to do that but i dontexpect you will need this thing anyway vivienne said looking at it disdainfully let me try it my way your way yes albus there are some things about veela that i believe even you are not aware of the mental bond between a mother and her daughter is one of them i am confident that i will have no problem entering her mind now that she is unconscious of course in her waking state i could only do so with her permission and i would never try without it anyway but as this is clearly an emergency kindly get me a comfortable chair gal n it may take some time and i dontwant cramps and stiff joints when i come back when the chair was duly supplied she sat down put a hand on her daughter forehead closed her eyes and concentrated well i believe we are quite superfluous here dumbledore said with a shrug why dontwe go wherever you go when you are off duty for a cup of your excellent french coffee the healer could only agree and the two men quietly left the room it did not take vivienne long to find the image of wormtail in her daughter memory she watched as the short balding man walked swiftly up to isabeau who was sitting by herself in the garden pavilion you will arrange for your daughter fleur to go to hogwarts in autumn vivienne heard wormtail say seemingly without any preliminaries fleur will go to hogwarts isabeau repeated in a dull voice and so that she does not suspect anything you will treat her with the utmost care and accept and fulfil her every wish with the utmost care and accept and fulfil her every wish and you will not remember that we have ever met there was a rush of shapes and colour and suddenly wormtail was there again again the scene was in the garden pavilion but the time was clearly spring now again isabeau was sitting on the bench just when the image had become clear vivienne saw the man point his wand at her imperio perennis at once isabeau posture stiffened and her face assumed the blank expression so typical of the imperius curse where is the amulet wormtail was saying isabeau looked at him blankly amulet she repeated in a toneless voice the amulet your daughter found in the forest where is it i do not know about any amulet there is no amulet in my daughter room an angry shadow flashed across the man face then it will still be in england he said to himself you may go again the image blurred but vivienne had seen enough imperio perennis she said to herself when she had returned from her journey into her daughter memory dumbledore will know more about that perennis you say dumbldore said thoughtfully when she had told him and the healer what she had found out the constant imperius curse a very difficult curse indeed i am surprised someone like pettigrew should be able to perform it most likely voldemort taught him how to do it probably lent him some of his power for the purpose what the difference to the normal curse this special form of the imperius curse dumbledore continued just like the one you know about changes the cursed person into a kind of automaton obeying the wishes of the caster however the perennis variant keeps up this influence over a much longer period of time and also does not require the constant presence of the caster according to the power of the magic involved the effects can last up to four months without having to be renewed the normal imperius curse needs to be re applied once a week or so and also the people involved cannot be far apart for longer than perhaps a day or two as for the mental and physical effects i expect you are the expert here monsieur this is correct luckily this special variant of the curse does not occur often so knowledge about it is sparse but we do know a few things the spell creates a very strong connection between the people concerned and therefore some reports say that when the caster of the curse is hurt the victim experiences similar sensations now i cannot recall any case where the caster actually died but it only seems logical that like here a very strong reaction of the victim would happen this certainly would explain the state of unconsciousness great but what can you do to get her out of it again patience madame now that we know what happened to her it should not be too difficult in fact i believe she will perfectly fine by tomorrow morning strands of hair tickling his face woke harry he blinked when in an automatic gesture that he had used every morning during the past years he wanted to reach for his glasses he found it difficult to move his arms harry came a sleepy voice from his right and it took him a second or two to recognise it as gabrielle s her head was buried in his shoulder and her right arm was thrown across his chest while fleur warm body was snuggled up to him on the other side another moment later fleur stirred now he remembered the events of the last evening and only now he realised that he must have fallen asleep with his glasses on mother fleur voice sounded shocked as she too remembered we must your mother is well again cherie vivienne who must have apparated that very moment said and she wants to see you right away both girls jumped up excitedly at the news how when patience vivienne told them she will tell you everything you want to know herself now just brush your hair out of your eyes you look quite dishevelled and then let go yes harry she added seeing his doubtful look of course you ll come too in fact she expressly asked for you after only a minute or two they apparated to the clinic where they found isabeau sitting upright in her bed she was still deadly pale but there was a determined expression in her eyes she smiled weakly at her daughters and opened her arms mama gabrielle and fleur rushed over and threw themselves at her bowling her over on the bed the next minutes were taken up by indistinct mutterings mixed with sobs at last the three sat up again and isabeau stretched out her hand towards harry who had been standing aside watching the scene with a subtle feeling of envy harry she said and gestured for him to come over i am so grateful but i i didn t no she whispered touching his cheek with a cold hand without you her voice trailed off after a pause she said in a much firmer tone painful as it is i will now tell you everything sit down harry this is more about you than you can know after vivienne had conjured chairs for herself and harry the girls remained sitting on the bed to each side of their mother isabeau began i dontexpect any of you have ever been under the imperius curse i have harry muttered under his breath but nobody seemed to hear him so you will not find it easy to imagine well it must have been some time in spring when that that man first appeared at the mansion here fleur and gabrielle exchanged glances isabeau continued i cannot remember exactly under what pretext he got admitted but i does not matter does it he put me under the imperius curse and wanted me to find some amulet or other for him he was under the impression you had it in your room gabrielle morgaine necklace fleur gasped what it a complicated story mama please finish yours first all right he was very angry when i could not find anything but he seemed to accept it and i did not see him for several months however two days before fleur return home from school he appeared again and this time he he made me be nice to you he he said i had to arrange for you to go to hogwarts to say you would be safe there he did but but then the dementor attack was just a a trick it certainly seems so mother but why would voldemort want me in hogwarts for merlin sake i have no idea vivienne said but you should certainly be on your guard please go on you cannot imagine isabeau continued and her voice was shaking what it feels like doing things and all the while knowing they are wrong but being unable to stop but then while i was following the orders of the curse deep inside of me i became aware how happy it all made you and it made me start thinking you have a lot of time to think inside yourself while under imperius in fact i believe it what kept me sane one will appreciate the things one has lost a lot better you know and i i realised what a horrible mother i had been to my children all these years and i vowed if i ever got out of that curse i would make amends as best as i can can you forgive me i cannot promise i will be perfect but with tears in her eyes fleur threw her arms around her mother yes she sobbed harry also felt something sting in his eyes never believed there might be something he did one could be grateful for he said to himself ends and means vivienne mused normally evil means are claimed to be justified by desirable ends but of course they corrupt the ends as well as the person using them perhaps this is what happens when good means are applied for evil ends the dynamics of good and evil are unfathomable and of course someone like wormtail could never understand about good altogether harry remarked but did he ever mention anything about voldemort plans he went on after a pause i mean he did mention something when he was talking to me about spys and hidden portkeys but that not really a lot to go by he did not say who the spy was for example isabeau shook her head he used to keep boasting about it all and how ingenuous the plan was but that is it i do not think he knew very much about the plan himself he did know about the spy though he seemed very proud of it as if he had some hand in it all himself sometimes he said things like they ll never find out who it is or nobody ll ever suspect that but he never mentioned any names i have a feeling he said all that just to make me feel bad indeed he had a taste for that sort of thing harry said grimly gabrielle shuddered at the memory and then when was it yesterday i could not say suddenly a feeling of emptiness overcame me no not emptiness disorientation perhaps depression there is no word for it i afraid like like looking out to the sky from a deep dark hole and frightened never to get out and then i dontknow when i came to i was here in this bed well vivienne said briskly why dontwe all go home now after all have you forgotten what day it is what harry looked at her blankly before realisation dawned on him of course christmas eve but shouldntwe tell dumbledore about it all fleur who hade finally found her voice asked this can wait cherie i do not expect voldemort will be up to something that plan of his is about hogwarts remember so i believe we ll all be quite safe here so why dontwe invite dumbledore over for christmas grandma why not indeed as it is the house will be full of aurors anyway i ll just go and tell him about all this and then we can go back home i wontbe a minute when they returned to the delacours mansion they found kingsley shacklebolt and the other aurors waiting for them just as vivienne had predicted we made a thorough search of the place the black auror reported but it was completely deserted it does not look as if it had been lived in for years we found a fully equipped torture chamber on the first floor he shook himself disgusting but there was no living soul anywhere in that place whoever was there must have left in a hurry he paused good to see everybody is fine that what matters i d say well we d better be off he turned to address the other aurors perhaps we can still get something out of christmas if we hurry after the aurors had disapparated vivienne took charge of everything you ll go and lie down and rest she said to her daughter no dontargue you are still tired out even if you dontknow it yourself yes fleur can keep you company i can imagine you will have a lot to talk about even if i believe you d better sleep it all off first and you harry and gabrielle you can help me with the christmas decorations there is rather a lot to do a n thanks to all the reviewers you can look forward to some more fluff in the next chapter if there is anybody out there familiar with french christmas customs i d appreciate your help a n special thanks to all who reviewed an especially to quentin grey and or regine regise fort he information about french christmas customs about giving harry more balls he is just fifteen and a half isnthe and he comes from a muggle background there still lots he has to learn about the most trivial aspects of the wizarding world trivial for wizards that is i ve always thought that the da affair where he just super harry was somewhat off the point well my friends enjoy this chapter kind of transitory and without any action chapter 38 christmas preparations of course harry thought a private household could never be expected to be a match for the magnificent hogwarts decorations but he could not help feeling impressed nevertheless also he had to admit that vivienne delisle hade a far more elegant way of putting said decorations up where hagrid used to drag in the enormous christmas trees into the great hall with pure physical strength which he had to put upright with a good deal of huffing and puffing a flick of her wand was enough to cause a room high tree to materialise in the middle of the salon voila she said in a casual tone putting her wand away harry who after that first display had expected that the decorating of the tree itself would also be done by magic and would therefore hardly take up any time at all was surprised to see that all the decorations have to be put up by the family vivienne told him when she saw his surprise it is very bad luck if you are too lazy to do it yourself and yes harry you are a member of the family so no shirking harry felt a warm feeling stealing over him at her words and he gladly opened one of the cardboard boxes that someone most likely the house elves had deposited on the large table soon they were busy with the tree vivienne kept a careful eye on them to make sure none of them used any magic even if gabrielle kept complaining about it oh this is stupid she would say stretching high to put a glass ornament or a twinkling star on a branch i do know just the right spell but her grandmother would have none of it you know the rules she said sternly even if harry thought he could detect secret amusement in her voice no magic to put anything on the tree here harry had an idea no magic to put anything on the tree he repeated thoughtfully wait a mo accio firebolt with a swoosh the broom soared into his hands it doesntsay no magic to move around does it he enquired of vivienne with a cheeky grin you are a tricky devil she replied with a smile but i guess you are right funny it never occurred to me before but it never too late to learn and promptly she changed into a colourful tropical bird picked up a glittering silvery star with a small twirling fairy in it in her beak and flew up to the tip of the tree where she deposited the ornament thanks for the hint harry she said after transforming again i ve always thought ladders and things were stupid muggle stuff harry had been watching this performance with some surprise and somehow felt deprived of credit for his idea but gabrielle shining eyes more than made up for it hop on he told her grabbing his broom and with a squeal of delight the little girl snatched up another ornament and did as she was told harry kicked off and together they circled the tree until gabrielle had found a place that she considered suitable for it oh harry she shouted when after a crazy loop they had landed again this is the best christmas i ve ever had meanwhile fleur told her mother about all the things that she had up to now kept to herself in particular about the amulet that gabrielle had found in the forbidden forest morgaine necklace isabeau said doubtfully that what luna called it luna a fourth year ravenclaw she is strange or rather extraordinary in many ways it seems she can see things nobody else can see many other students just think she is a bit crazy but i sure there is a lot more to her than that the strange thing was that she seemed to recognise it at once there is no way she could have known about it before she first saw me with it however it gone wormtail must have stolen it in his rat form there no knowing where it may be now voldemort has it most likely not that it makes much of a difference this luna tell me more about her well there not too much to tell after all there was that thing about the necklace and once i saw her behave in a very weird way fleur proceeded to tell her mother about the incident with the sandwich in front of the horseless carriage what happened to that sandwich it looked as if something had eaten it can it be that she can see things that are invisible why not i can think of several ways how that may be possible tell me how does she look slim not very tall but then she still only fourteen extremely pale skin long sandy hair not unlike mine actually only darker but the most striking thing about her are her eyes i have never seen such a shade of silvery blue before sometimes almost pure silver sometimes a very pale watery blue and slightly protuberant so she often has that surprised look about her elvish what she most likely has elvish blood this would explain most of the things you say about her no wonder she can see things nobody else can do you know anything about her family i have heard her mother died when she was very young but she doesntspeak about her she often talks about her father though he is the editor of a magazine that is apparently not considered to be of very high quality hermione keeps saying it full of made up impossible stories about strange creatures that nobody has ever seen for example but i not sure she doesntsound as if she oh never mind i like her anyway at any rate if she really has some elvish talents she will turn out to be a useful help isabeau suddenly stopped herself here i go again she said ruefully talking about people being useful when it about friendship i still have a lot to learn i am afraid but you are willing to learn fleur told her tears coming to her eyes again that what really matters before you d never even have got the idea to mention something like that you did categorize people according to usefulness after all well there hardly anything i can say except to ask your forgiveness again she shuddered and fleur put an arm round her it felt strange to be comforting her mother something she would never have dreamed of being possible only a day ago there something else i never told you she said after a pause luna was not the only one to come up with morgaine there were two more occasions and they were even weirder in some way and she told isabeau about the prank her friends had tried to pull on her as well as her experience on mayday eve hermione will say it all been a dream she finished doubtfully do you think there could be anything in it stranger things have happened i expect you have figured out the meaning of that prophecy yes fleur said proudly it must be about harry and me fire and water oh mama do you think it could be our destiny to defeat voldemort all by ourselves it seems a likely explanation to say the least on the other hand prophecies have a tendency to come true exactly because people believe them they are not written in stone so there may be a pretty good chance to just ignore it and and run hide no harry most certainly would never do that and i i ll stay by him whatever it costs fleur delacours does not run i am so proud of you her mother said looking at her with shining eyes and i promise i ll do whatever i can to help you oh i feel so much stronger now let join the others perhaps we can still do our share of the decorations i ve never enjoyed any christmas like this harry panted when he had finally unloaded a flushed and radiant gabrielle from his firebolt after the last decorations had been put on the tree in fact he added as an afterthought i dontthink i ever really enjoyed it at all before this only to feel guilty thinking of what ron or hermione might have to say to that it used to be kind of lonely fleur who had just entered with her mother had heard that and she rushed over to him to hug him never again harry she whispered in his ear holding him tight never again i promise vivienne smiled at them indulgently i hate to disturb you she said but you still need to put up the mistletoe decorations then she turned to her daughter we ought to see to the dinner preparations i want everything to be perfect after all it not everyday that you have albus dumbledore for dinner what the matter harry who sensed a feeling of merriment in fleur mind and saw a mischievous grin spread in her face enquired nothing she said innocently batting her eyelashes at him why who do you think you re fooling harry retorted laughing you re up to something doesntneed any legilimency i know that expression well if you wonttell me i ll just have to wait and see i guess cantbe anything worse than fred and george tricks after all it nothing to do with you anyway fleur told him no need to worry about that but no i certainly wonttell you you d most likely give everything away without knowing so i sorry about that she turned to gabrielle put a hand on her shoulder and steered her into the farthest corner of the room where harry could see them talking and giggling excitedly well at least it nothing to do with me he told himself although watching them with some uneasiness when fleur refused to let harry help with the mistletoe his suspicions grew especially as gabrielle almost choked on her giggles when fleur gave her instructions you are doing something about the mistletoe right he said with raised eyebrows which caused another giggling fit of the little girl s not that you need to he told fleur it not as if i hated kissing you actually i know harry fleur replied softly but with a sparkle in her eyes but i told you it was nothing to do with you didnti but but then he turned pale as the idea suddenly hit him no you are not how can you imagine it would ever work oh fleur you ll be in so much trouble ah harry it christmas time what better time for an innocent prank and how do you know mistletoe works the same way in france as it does in britain it might be some completely different spell so you have enchanted them harry cried triumphantly that a confession yes fleur smirked but you dontknow with what spell and i so not telling you come on gabie we have to do some more and just you wait harry until i catch you under one of them the little girl shouted gleefully and grinned at him cheekily harry hid his face in his hands whatever have i done to deserve this he groaned in mock desperation it was already getting dark and the youngsters were downstairs in the kitchen with the house elves having a small snack or what in the eyes of the eager house elves was considered a small snack and for anybody else would have been a complete five course dinner suddenly with the usual pop iphigenie and margaux apparated in the kitchen delighted fleur jumped to her feet and rushed over to hug her friends how absolutely wonderful she exclaimed i never expected how little you know your friends margaux scolded but with a twinkle in her eyes of course we were coming to see you and give you your present we ll be off again right away iphigenie began seemingly somewhat intimidated by the vast kitchen full of bustling house elves you will want to have a family celebration nonsense fleur said decisively of course you ll stay for dinner at the very least do you know who coming you ll never guess albus dumbledore margaux was clearly impressed but iphigenie now seemed positively frightened but how can we intrude the greatest wizard your mother not invited i hereby formally invite you to our christmas dinner fleur said interrupting her if you wish i can make it a written invitation with rsvp on it too just stop being silly now we all love having you here i ll have the house elves make a room ready for you so you can relax and have some refreshments i ll fetch you when dinner is about to start but what shall we wear iphigenie asked we didntcount on here you are being silly again fleur said just look at you are you fashion experts or not now just let me talk to that elf with a click of her fingers she summoned an elf and gave her instructions your room will be ready for you in half an hour she told her friends so why dontyou just sit down here grab some butterbeer and listen to our latest adventures there quite a lot to tell fleur gabrielle and harry got so lost in the report of their recent exploits that nobody noticed how time passed and it was considerably more than half an hour later when a magical gong sounded a reverberating boom through the cavernous kitchen sending the house elves into a veritable frenzy of activity which caused harry to wonder how they managed not to constantly fall over each other with their stacks of plates and dishes they had all jumped at the sound of the gong oh dear we have completely forgotten the time fleur said time to go up for dinner but i haventeven done my hair iphigenie wailed and was only slowly calmed down by her girl friend too late for that now margaux told her and anyway you look pretty enough for me cherie it does not matter believe me fleur said reassuringly it not as if this was a format ball or something with a hundred guests that would be a different thing naturally but as i ve been telling you it a family affair but dumbledore iphigenie said weakly i sure he wonteat you fleur replied he an old friend of my grandmothers you ll see she glanced over to gabrielle who fell into a fit of giggles oh he ok dumbledore harry contributed his share to iphigenie reassurance a bit secretive about things perhaps but ok nothing to be afraid of only half persuaded iphigenie allowed herself to be led upstairs and to the dining room compared to the dinner at the ball the christmas dinner table was indeed a relatively humble affair true there was the same or an identical white tablecloth the porcelain and silver cutlery the crystal glasses and the floating candles above the table but the table itself was a lot smaller and laid out for eight people only obviously the house elves had already taken iphigenie and margaux arrival into account the tree was glittering in all its splendour with fairy lights flitting all over it how do you get these fairies to do that harry asked they have been living in the manor grounds for ages fleur explained long before the land was owned by anybody in fact they find the whole idea of land belonging to anyone impossible to understand to them the land is just there has always been and always will while so called owners come and go fairies are immortal you know she added so if land can belong to anyone at all harry said thoughtfully it will be them it belongs to he felt he had still a lot to learn about magical creatures clever of you to understand it so quickly fleur told him many wizarding families find it much more difficult but i guess it is an uncomfortable idea to think those fairies will still be there as young and fresh as ever when all of us are long gone she shivered slightly but you wanted to know why they are doing that for us she went on after a short pause i not quite sure myself but as far as i know it some kind of favour there is no way you can force fairies to do things whatever they do they do it because they want to do it my grandmother says they do it for the land rather than for the family there may be some ancient kind of magic connected with it some fertility charm for the land most likely but even she doesntunderstand it completely which is no small thing what with her being a spirit of nature herself and all like the decorating of the tree by the family members the fairy dance in it is supposed to bring good luck but arentthey supposed to live in flowers harry asked remembering of some books that long ago he had found in the rubbish bin at the dursleys because dudley had thrown them away in disgust as they were not about alien monsters or robots wherever did you get that idea from they are spirits of nature much like veela so much is true but they are just there i not sure how to explain it yes it true that they are connected with nature but on a much larger scale not just flowers at any rate woods rivers the like can they do anything besides dancing and glittering like that i afraid not and it only magical people who can see even that muggles would not see anything at all that why fairy tales have such a bad name among muggles harry mused seeing is believing after all but they certainly look nice at this moment one of the doors opened and vivienne and isabeau entered a n any guesses at fleur and gabie schemes a n here is the new chapter in which you are introduced to yet another character chapter 39 mistletoe and tiger eye ah mes enfants vivienne beamed at them i see your friends have also come to see you fleur that lovely if we may be so bold madame iphigenie said hesitantly nonsense any friends of fleur are always welcome here just make yourselves at home and now let sit down for dinner isabeau told them i must say i starved it the first time since i dontknow when that i ll be fully able to enjoy dinner or enjoy anything for that matter she ended wistfully but where dumbledore gabrielle inquired looking or so harry thought disappointed he has a few things to look to vivienne said he said we shouldntwait for him he will be here as soon as he can make it when they moved over towards the table there was a small interruption as they were passing under an especially large branch of mistletoe decorated with a sparkling gold ribbon margaux suddenly stopped after looking around for a short moment with a slightly dazed expression she suddenly grabbed iphigenie round her waist to pull her into a passionate kiss just when it seemed about impossible that any human being could survive so long without breathing the two girls separated panting heavily they seemed to take another minute or so to come back from wherever they had been and when they finally did both of them blushed deep red while fleur smiled at them happily and gabrielle was breathless with suppressed giggles it works she squealed wiping tears from her eyes harry felt his worst suspicions confirmed but he did not say anything i i sorry iphigenie stammered still out of breath and very embarrassed i dontknow dontbe sorry vivienne reassured her kindly you must never be sorry for loving somebody and it was not even your fault not that it would be any fault at all mind you it seems the delacours mistletoes are particularly violent today it seemed to harry that she looked at fleur in a rather shrewd way she knows about your little sche me he told fleur in his mind i sure you cannot fool her just wait and see she retorted and again he felt her merriment bubbling happily it is a pretty strong spell just as they were all taking their seats the door opened again and dumbledore appeared he looked splendid in robes of yellow orange and red colours that reminded harry of fawkes the phoenix it seemed to him that dumbledore looked a lot more energetic and confident than he had seen him ever before during the school year presently they all took heir seats at the table with dumbledore in the place of honour between vivienne and isabeau as soon as they were seated an immense variety of dishes appeared and during the next half hour or so everyone was enjoying the wonders of french cuisine even though harry had already had some opportunity to compare it to the english way of cooking a comparison that had not been very favourable for the english side he was again surprised another thing that amazed him was the relaxed informal atmosphere something that he would never have expected and although he was quite aware of the reasons isabeau behaviour never ceased to amaze him she quite a different person he said to fleur almost human she did not reply but the wave of emotions that she let him share with her almost overwhelmed him it had taken gabrielle only a few seconds to overcome her shyness and very soon she was chatting away happily at dumbledore harry felt the headmaster showed an amazing amount of patience answering all her questions what in the lake she would inquire for example i mean i was in there i know but it not as if i really noticed anything and dumbledore would patiently explain about the mer people the grindylows and the giant squid it must be very interesting gabrielle said it a real shame i was asleep all the time will i ever get back to hogwarts some day but you will be going to beauxbatons wontyou but i d much rather go to hogwarts she replied with a pout harry will just have graduated before you start fleur reminded her oh and anyway it still two more years until you can go to any school at all her mother said gently one and a half unfortunately times being what they are at the moment dumbledore said in a more serious tone there is no way to predict what going to happen in two years time or one and a half for that matter his sombre mood had gone again but i think i can promise you at least that i will be able to arrange for you to spend a year at hogwarts should your mother agree gabrielle beamed at him happily is vous savez quis as bad as grindelwald she demanded a few minutes later dumbledore put his knife and fork down slowly wiped his mouth with a napkin and looked at her for some time before he began this is a difficult question and i afraid i cannot really answer it of course times are very different it seems muggles at least have become slightly less easy to manipulate a full fledged muggle war as grindelwald caused it seems rather unlikely today even if fighting and killing is happening in several places all over the planet all the time no in that respect grindelwald time was certainly worse but it not for voldemort lack of trying to be sure so compared as one dark wizard to another no i dontthink they are any different in fact i even believe that the evil essence in both of them is exactly the same some impersonal evil force that now and then succeeds in materialising yes in a way i suppose you could say tom riddle is a victim i am not saying he is innocent he added seeing harry expression it true he had an unhappy childhood as an orphan and an outsider but he did make a choice and he did know the choice he was making was wrong even if i dontthink he really knew what he was letting himself in for and anyway he is long past any human reasoning you do not reason whether a flood or an earthquake are evil you just do your best to protect yourself from them he paused looked thoughtfully at the little girl and added you understand what i want to say gabrielle nodded eagerly her eyes wide good said dumbledore then you are already a lot wiser than several grown up wizards that i could name the twinkle was back in his eyes and he turned to isabeau allow me to compliment you on this excellent dinner madame it is not often that i have enjoyed anything comparable to it and i think i may say i have had the opportunity to sample some of the more famous kitchens of europe thank you she said beaming at him i have always been aiming at the very best she thought for a moment and then continued of course it mostly due to the house elves i dontbelieve it fleur told harry and he could sense her surprise very clearly i dontthink she ever so much as mentioned house elves and now hermione would love that harry agreed they were in the middle of the third course venison with chestnuts and assorted greens when with a loud crack another person apparated into the room the newcomer was a man of about forty or forty five of rather unkempt general appearance there were deep lines in his sunburnt face his long dark blond hair needed a good wash and he obviously hadntshaved for several days his travelling cloak was covered in dust and looked altogether the worse for wear he was carrying a large jute sack on his shoulder after a moment of surprise it was curiously enough dumbledore who spoke up first monsieur delacour i presume only now isabeau and the girls rose from their seats to welcome the man this is indeed a surprise gerard his wife said and in a warm voice she continued i am so glad you have been able to make it today of all times she kissed his scruffy face and all his posture expressed his own surprise at this welcome after introductions had duly been made he did not seem particularly surprised to find harry potter in his house on christmas eve and a place had been found for him at the table everybody settled down again the general interest in the food however had more or less died down now as everybody was more or less talking at the same time to fill the master of the house in about the turbulent events of the last few days he said nothing during this barrage of female voices only helped himself to some food like a man who has clearly not eaten nearly enough for some time let me just get this straight he said after most of the hubbub had calmed down my eldest daughter tried her best to seduce harry potter no fleur interrupted heatedly i was bewitched tried but did not succeed her father went on unperturbed but with a hint of amusement in his voice thanks to a restraint and presence of mind of said harry potter that are indeed exceptional especially in the circumstances give my respect mr potter anybody would have reacted like me harry said feeling himself blushing with embarrassment and call me harry please if you insist harry but it certainly not nothing extremely few people can resist the veela charm believe me he glanced affectionately at his wife who reached for his hand across the table be that as it may gerard continued after that my second daughter gets abducted by evil wizards and is taken to some secret chamber of torture or something where my esteemed mother in law with the help of said harry potter and my eldest daughter rescue her almost single handedly destroying vous savez quis most faithful servant in the process have i got that part correct perfectly vivienne assured him and as if that was not enough my wife is found to have been under some curse for the better part of the year that has only now been lifted right again everybody agreed and in addition to all that it seems that said wife has made good use of that time when she was imprisoned in her own mind and has reached some conclusions and resolutions indeed i have isabeau said quietly squeezing his hand well if that not the greatest christmas present ever i dontknow what is i must confess cherie i used to be somewhat less than happy with he stopped himself and went on however it never too late for a new start is it and what better time for a new start than christmas time you wontregret it isabeau said trust me are there really tears in her eyes fleur said to harry i ve never seen her cry not before yesterday at any rate yes harry replied let just hope the lesson she learned is a lasting one but now papa fleur addressed her father why dontyou tell us where you have been and what you ve been up to indeed monsieur dumbledore spoke up for the first time again i expect you had an interesting journey interesting is rather a mild expression gerard began well i had heard of some ancient magical artefacts that were supposed to be in one of the more obscure monasteries in tibet now of course it always suspicious when you hear this sort of thing more often than not it just talk and in my experience it very often a waste of time and money as well as risking your health or your life searching for things according to such rumours what sort of artefacts gabrielle inquired impatiently just get to the point already papa now now is that a way to speak to your father he reproached her but his voice was kind i am perhaps not one to follow the voice of reason as the foremost guideline of my life here he glanced at his wife for a moment and so you can guess that i went to tibet as soon as i was able to get away now tibet in itself is a fabulous country even by muggle standards but the wizarding traditions are quite amazing but it would certainly take far too long to relate all my experiences and adventures there well it took me a couple of months search of a number of monasteries high up in the himalayas yetis are perfectly friendly and highly intelligent creatures by the way until i could at last persuade an old monk to let me have a look into a cave that as he told me contained some strange artefacts that had been in the monastery possession for so many centuries that with some of them nobody remembered where they had come from or what if any special magical qualities they possessed let alone how to use them and what did you find dumbledore asked politely well various items that looked like pensieves of a kind some rings and other ornaments goblets and several lockets the usual stuff more or less i used the basic magic detection test on them and it seemed that they were all quite ordinary the average shielding charm or memory enhancement or something of the sort however in the darkest corner of that cave i found this he reached into the pocket of his jacket and produced a rough hewn wooden box black and clearly ancient and put it on the table what is it gabrielle asked sounding bored with a grand gesture gerard opened the box voila inside the box on deep blue velvet was a dagger six or seven inches long the thin silvery blade and the golden hilt shimmered in the light of the candles if gerard had expected his audience to register stunned surprise or some other sort of enthusiasm he was disappointed so it some old dagger gabrielle said dismissively what so grand about some old knife it not some old knife cherie her father told her look he took the dagger out of the box and turned the hilt towards the chandelier a flash of yellow golden light shot from the weapon like a bolt of lightning only now they saw the large round yellow jewel that was set in the hilt it beautiful gabrielle exclaimed eagerly yes isntit her father said proudly putting it back into its box it an extraordinarily large and bright specimen of tiger eye and it would be lovely just because of that alone however i suppose you tested it for its magical qualities dumbledore said and i daresay you found it remarkable in that respect too naturally it an item of exceptionally strong magic but until now i have not been able to find out what that magic is about in fact monsieur i was thinking of asking you to examine it for me with pleasure dumbledore replied if you ll allow me to take it to hogwarts with me i confident we will be able to find out more may i carefully he picked up the instrument and looked at it more closely you noticed of course the one strange thing right away he said thoughtfully considering you found this in tibet yes its shape and decorations are certainly not oriental in fact the patterns on the hilt remind me of early britannic wizarding culture exactly i wouldntbe surprised though if this went back even earlier you know atlantis that what i had in mind yes i certainly can feel the magic in it it will be an interesting research task i sure but how did it come to be in tibet fleur spoke up who knows if it really atlantean some survivors who reached that part of the world after the deluge may have taken it with them actually this is why the old monk let me take it with me he knew it was alien to him and his people he told me it wanted to go home go home harry said in surprise how can it want to do something want to do anything i mean it not alive is it it just a thing magical objects are often very strange harry dumbledore told him earnestly some of them do seem to develop a life of their own like the sorting hat harry asked but he knew already what the headmaster was talking about exactly dontask me to explain it harry i have known that old hat for a long time but i still have no idea how it works but i am convinced it knows exactly what it wants just think of its songs each year i see said harry feeling slightly guilty for not listening to those songs more carefully somehow he had always taken the sorting hat for granted and had never asked himself how it might be performing its tasks but it at least it can talk he said lamely there are other ways of communication as you surely know dumbledore said with a smile moreover who got to say this dagger here wontburst into song too once someone finds out how to make it he paused and helped himself to a piece of the chocolate and chestnut cake ah the fine old yule log he said at last leaning back in his chair it always good to see the ancient traditions upheld especially in troubled times like these now ladies he bowed slightly to vivienne and isabeau it been a most enjoyable evening thank you so much for your kind hospitality i ll take good care of your treasure monsieur here he addressed gerard an will keep you up to date with the course of our investigations of course you are always welcome at hogwarts should your time permit and now i am afraid i have to leave he rose from his chair pocketing the box with the dagger in his robes of course you are not leaving albus vivienne who had also got up from her seat said in her strictest no nonsense voice there is a room ready for you and we just will not hear anything about you leaving now but i do not wish to trespass any longer watch out harry fleur thoughts bubbling merrily again were in his mind looking up he noticed that during this last exchange vivienne and dumbledore had somehow ended up under the mistletoe before anybody could say or do anything the veela and the headmaster were in each other arms and even if it could not be seen clearly through the curtain of silver blond and pure white hair there was little doubt that what was happening was not very different from margaux and iphigenie activities earlier that evening everybody was staring at the scene speechless until the pair broke apart i did tell you the delacour mistletoes were particularly violent today albus didnti vivienne sounding only very slightly breathless said cheerfully so i noticed vivienne the headmaster replied with a smile straightening his white beard i do hope the experience was not completely disagreeable to you his eyes behind his glasses were twinkling more merrily than harry had ever seen is this particular sort of mistletoe specific of the delacour estate mademoiselle dumbledore addressed fleur after a short pause he knows if thoughts could gasp then fleur were definitely gasping er well i she stammered blushing furiously of course they are professor gabrielle piped up they are our most famous speciality she added with a cheeky grin ah i thought it must be something of the kind dumbledore said chuckling to himself well madame he turned to vivienne again addressing her in exaggerated formality offering his arm why dontyou show me to my quarters that you so generously insisted i stay at i suppose there are a few things we have to discuss during these words he shot fleur a penetrating glance that was however mollified by his smile of course professor vivienne replied imitating his demeanour there certainly are some er pedagogical matters we ought to consider with these words the two of them left the room now we re in for it fleur said her voice trembling they know everything oh there nothing to worry about gabrielle chirped happily i sure they take it the right way it just a joke isntit and i can always say it was my idea she added when she saw fleur doubtful expression and now harry watch out i ll get you under that mistletoe yet no you won t you minx harry laughed grabbing fleur hand and pulling her towards the shrubbery in question and for the third time that evening the magical herb performed its duty a n i not sure mistletoe is a herb but i couldntthink of a better word at the moment hello here i am again for those who found the last chapter a bit lacking in action here is some at last more on the humorous side to be sure and no de or anything but i do hope you like it nevertheless although the fluffy side of things is developing a bit thanks for all the lovely reviews and keep them coming they are a writer food and nourishment chapter 4 one summer sunday morning crucio the cold voice hissed and the hooded figure of the death eater crumpled screaming and writhing in pain at the feet of his master a mirthless laugh and voldemort turned his horrible red eyes on harry he raised his wand and harry woke with a scream like so many of the nights before like so many nights before he was soaked in cold sweat and glanced around him wildly for a second or two until he realised that he was like so many nights before in his small bare room in the dursleys house he didntbother to check the time on his watch it was still dark and the window outlined in a pale orange square due to the street lamp directly in front of the house hedwig he asked into the darkness and then remembered he had sent her off with the letter to fleur she cantpossibly be back yet he muttered to himself owls just cantfly that fast nevertheless he got up from his bed after putting on his glasses stretched and walked over to the open window to look out at the deserted street which looked a lot more peaceful than it actually was what with all the quarrelling lying and fighting going on behind the spotless facades a hooting sound drew his attention and he raised his glance to the night sky hedwig he said surprised how come you he stopped rubbing his eyes in surprise what in merlin s he began indeed it was no trick of the light or anything there were definitely two snowy white owls approaching his window hedwig re said again taking a step backwards to allow the birds to alight on the window sill what the matter how can you be back already and what who have you brought with you in fact he looked from one bird to the other in amazement which of you is hedwig the owl that had landed first ruffled her feathers in that familiar way that as harry knew from experience indicated she was irritated or annoyed with something you are hedwig he said triumphantly i d now that expression everywhere but then who your friend hedwig if it was indeed her clicked her beak angrily and flew over to her cage to perch on top of it now harry had the chance to look at the second owl more closely and now he realised that although the two birds looked exactly alike this one did not have hedwig yellow eyes even in the darkness of his room he could see that these eyes were of a deep blue almost black the colour of a clear night sky far away from the city eyes to get lost in the thought flashed through his mind out of nowhere as he gazed at the owl fascinated and then realisation where he had seen these eyes before dawned on him fleur he could not have put into words how it happened how the bird started to change how it grew in size how the white feathers became a silver blonde mane of hair how there was suddenly a slender body in white robes how the sharp beak turned into the beautiful lips he remembered only too well only her amazing eyes never changed there were tears shining in them harry stared at her transfixed unable to move or to utter a sound with a small birdlike sound something between a sob and a gasp she threw her arms around him he woke from his trance and responded holding her awkwardly wondering if he was dreaming her hair cascaded around them as she leaned her head on his shoulder oh harry now her voice was really a sob how could you doubt do you know how that letter made me feel do you still not know you are not a little boy to me and will never be that was a cruel thing to say in your letter pity dontyou know it so much more oh there were days when i thought i d never see you again i so sorry he managed to say hoarsely i didntmean to it just i dontknow i just feel feel so small and unimportant i can hardly believe anybody cares for me and then just look at you she lifted her head from his shoulder her lovely blue eyes looking deep into his shh she said not a word more harry when will you learn not to take yourself down all the time dontyou realise you are special special to the world she felt him recoil and added quickly but most of all special to me you are unique to me harry and i dontever want to hear you doubt this her words came hurriedly desperately and her embrace tightened he felt tears stinging in his eyes and he buried his face in her magnificent mane of silver inhaling her faint smell of lilacs the feeling of her warm body so close led to inevitable reactions just to be expected from a teenage boy and his bed clothes only consisting of boxers and a t shirt did not help to hide the fact embarrassed he drew back i sorry he stammered i didntmean to she released him from her embrace and put her soft hand on his cheek which felt hot to her touch she was careful not to smile i know harry she said quietly it only natural and i believe i ought to feel flattered now she could not hold back her smile any longer but the awkward moment had passed and he could smile at her too i still not quite sure if i not dreaming he said after a while sitting down on the bed without taking his eyes off her face you know what tells me it probably not a dream after all i ve not had a happy dream for ages but but tell me how come you are here i thought your mother wouldntlet you out of her sight once you were back home and how when did you learn to be an owl fleur sat down beside him put an arm around him and rested his head on her shoulder he let it happen willingly i got your letter and it made me want to be with you so much it hurt and grandma the full veela you know taught me how to transform and because i missed you so much i could suddenly do it and then i bullied hedwig so that she d lead me to you she didntlike it at all i afraid she jealous of me she giggled softly your grandmother the one whose hair is in your wand yes you should really get to know her some day she a wonderful person i dontknow what i d do without her but i only sent hedwig off this evening it canthave been more than seven or eight hours and it must be a couple of thousands of miles to your place owls dontfly that fast do they magical owls can dontask me how it works something to do with interdimensional levels and things i believe anyway once i got the hang of this transformation business it was simple my grandmother will be so happy and your mother is she still behaving horribly to you no it absolutely strange but since my return she has changed completely the prototype of the loving mother i cant imagine what brought it about grandma talked to her i suppose but can that talk have been so effective i sometimes wonder if there might be some sinister purpose behind it all shall i tell him about her and wormtail no what the use it would just darken his mood i probably just being paranoid she continued instead why canti just enjoy a good thing while i have it like being with you well i daresay you are right but i sure i d get suspicious if the dursleys suddenly behaved like loving relatives the dursleys oh yes those awful muggles are they still giving you a hard time well they ve done worse look at this he pointed around the shabby room it a spacious suite compared to the place i spent the first ten years of my life in i ought to be content i guess and i do get food down in the kitchen not through the cat flap that they installed especially for that purpose so yes it not all that bad i do wish i could do something to help you i dontthink there is anything wait a grin spread over his face do you think you could just casually walk up to the door ring the bell and ask to speak to me today sunday so i donthave to go to the factory it would be great fun to see their faces especially dudley s if it not too much bother for you of course and i have to warn you they are not exactly the nicest people on earth fleur giggled quietly this sounds good indeed let have a bit of fun with them i am allowed to do magic in the holidays you know during their conversation dawn had started out in the streets with the first nuances of blue and turquoise beginning to appear fleur got up from the bed pulling harry with her let look at our star she said softly our star oh i forgot remember what you say in your letter what happened that morning when you looked at the star well the same thing happened to me too in exactly the same way and it must have been at exactly the same time too can you still doubt we are meant to be special harry could not speak as all kinds of feelings threatened to overwhelm him he just nodded hand in hand they moved over to the open window and above the treetops there it was again the bright glittering star venus fleur whispered in harry ear but i like the other name better phosphorus the bringer of light together they looked on until the star had disappeared in the growing morning sunlight xxx hurry up with that bacon boy vernon grunted his mouth full and while you re at it i can do with some more tea too yes uncle vernon secretly harry glanced at the kitchen clock any minute now fleur would ring the bell what are you grinning at watch out and dont burn the bacon no aunt petunia ring harry heart leapt but he managed to remain outwardly calm now what the devil huffing and puffing full of breakfast as he was vernon heaved himself out of his chair not even on sunday morning he grumbled as he went out into the hall and towards the door dudley who was more interested in his breakfast than in any boring people who might be calling on his father remained sitting at the table and helped himself to the slices of bacon on his father plate where food was concerned dudley dursley was a very conscientious person grateful for his cousin greediness harry slipped out behind his uncle who was quite successfully blocking the narrow hallway if dudley had also been there the space would have been completely filled up harry positioned himself two steps up the stairs so that he could see the door past his uncle head what do you vernon was starting to say as he opened the door but his voice trailed off into an indistinct murmur and even from his position harry could see how something like a jolt went through his massive bulk in the bright sunlight that came streaming in through the open door fleur was a dark silhouette her hair forming a shimmering halo around her fleur first impression of vernon dursley was not a favourable one to put it mildly the massive freckled face jaws still munching with bits of baked beans clinging to the thick moustache was not an altogether enjoyable sight and the stained napkin that was still stuck into vernon shirt collar did not really help to improve his appearance quite subconsciously fleur veela ancestry took command the look of her suddenly ice blue eyes would have frozen a volcano as she said bon jour je desire de parle a arry potter s il vous plait all vernon could do was gape at her open mouthed emitting a faint gurgling sound which did not exactly make him appear more intelligent pardon fleur who started to enjoy herself a good deal said sweetly ees it posseeble to speak to arry potter she was putting on a highly artificial french accent and harry who knew her english was a lot better than that grinned to himself zees ees is ouse ees it not normally vernon would have had something to say about the preposterous idea of this being harry house but somehow he didntseem to be able to think clearly finally managing to close his mouth he stepped aside and fleur entered harry noticed that the dazzling smile she gave his uncle was very different from those she normally had for him there was something uncanny almost sinister in that smile gosh i hope she ll never smile at me like that at that moment dudley who had obviously found nothing eatable on the kitchen table any more appeared in the kitchen door his mouth still full of food wiping his hands on the seat of his trousers when he saw fleur standing in the hallway he stopped dead in his tracks his mouth fell open like his father had before presenting an interesting mixture of egg yolk baked beans and crushed toast for inspection fleur shot him another dose of her veela smile and then turned to harry he noticed that her eyes were the usual deep blue of the night sky again oh arry ere you are she said hugged him and made quite a show of kissing him squarely on the lips the kiss seemed to break the spell on the two dursleys true dudley continued gaping stupidly at the apparition of the stunning girl although he at least closed his mouth but vernon woke from his trance for good he wasntsure what had just happened and this annoyed him a good deal purple in the face but apparently afraid of addressing fleur directly he bellowed at harry you boy who is this impudent person another of those freakish friends of yours obviously what she doing in my house tell her to get out at once the shouting caused petunia to appear on the scene too she froze as she set eyes on fleur her female instincts told her that there was something about that girl something unnatural as she used to term it and that the sooner that indecently beautiful creature left her house the better it would simply not do to have her husband in the same room with her any longer than could be helped wisely though she decided to keep in the background for the moment of course vernon was making a fool of himself what with shouting like that and goggling fish eyed but she expected she would be able to use it for her own advantage later on after all there was that rather nice but expensive dress she had seen at marksspencer the other day oh so sorry uncle vernon harry said with mock seriousness meet my friend mademoiselle fleur delacour tri wizard tournament champion and i proud and happy to say my girl friend and now if you ll excuse us we d like to go out for a walk the weather is too beautiful to stay indoors dontexpect me back before evening and have a nice day and he took fleur arm gentleman like and escorted her past his uncle out into the glorious sunshine at once dudley started throwing one of his famous tantrums that his parents knew only too well and dreaded accordingly his girlfriend he screamed his voice rising to a considerable level i want a girl like that why does he get to have everything dad do something even dudley dim witted as he was sensed vaguely that this was one of the things his father had no power to change and this made him even more frustrated and furious vernon who had probably been thinking about fleur in a similar way although he had sense enough not to express any of those wishes loudly in the presence of his wife grumbled something indistinct and returned into the kitchen petunia though rushed forward to comfort her son dudders sweetheart she said trying to pull him into her arms from which he recoiled he just hated his mother protestations of affection it just one of those freaks you know you dontwant to have anything to do with them do you i wouldntbe surprised if she turned into a a toad or something nothing for my duddy boy really you deserve better much better dudley did not bother to reply but his entire attitude indicated very clearly that he was not interested in anything better at all xxx privet drive and the other suburban streets were already alive with people and lots of heads turned to watch as harry and fleur were ambling by holding hands most of the neighbours knew that the potter boy was weird and spent most of the year at some mysterious institution for youthful troublemakers the men used to nod wisely when vernon stressed that in st brutus they still upheld the time honoured tradition of the cane and the women sympathised with petunia when she told them how she worked her fingers to the bone for that ungrateful brat never so much as a thank you she used to whine and they would pat her arm and make commiserating noises most people used to take the dursleys stories about harry for granted and the fact that when they saw him at all he was wearing old shabby clothes ill fitting and with badly mended holes and tears in them just proved to them that they must be true it hardly ever occurred to anyone to ask themselves why the boy never wore anything new now today harry was again wearing old things of dudley s faded jeans four sizes too wide a horrible pink t shirt and a green blazer with patched up elbows that was reaching down almost to his knees no nothing remarkable about the potter boy but the girl men who were mowing their lawns ran into trees and some who were washing their cars both very popular sunday morning activities in privet drive and environs fell over buckets when they twisted their necks to get a better look at her something like her had never entered the narrow world of little whinging surrey her gorgeous hair alone shimmering in waves down to her waist its unearthly silver glittering in the sunlight was enough to increase heart rates and the slender perfectly proportioned figure in the extravagant flowing white dress the term robe does not occur to muggles easily triggered quite a number of fantasies as well from kitchen or living room windows women were watching the pair too and their feelings for the girl were not the friendliest how on earth did that potter boy get to know a girl like that it was unbelievable look at them fleur giggled as another lawn mowing gentleman fell over his own feet staring at her and was almost run over by the machine i dontwant to imagine how they d behave if the veela charm was still intact i suppose it because they are muggles they are more susceptible dontyou think i have no idea harry replied squeezing her hand happily and i dontcare it just so good to be with you again i haventfelt so good in weeks now what can we do on this beautiful day i dontknow it your town isntit but how about going somewhere with not so many people staring at us you he corrected smiling staring at you thank you was that a compliment no it the truth but i guess you re right there nothing wrong with a little less publicity it quite some walk however till we are out of town for good and i haventgot any money for the bus too he never gives me any you know and i have a feeling a surrey bus driver wontaccept any sickles though i think his face would make an interesting study i not familiar with the surroundings of course and i only got my licence a couple of days ago fleur said hesitatingly but there shouldntbe any harm in trying trying what apparating you can oh of course i forgot but i can t the ministry would come down on me like a ton of bricks not that i could do it anyway i can apparate with you as long as we hold on tightly to each other it much like portkey transportation you know now just give me an idea of the place you d like to go xxx the narrow river was gliding noiselessly past tiny ripples glittering in the sunlight the sun was high up in the slightly hazy summer sky in which a few blinding white clouds slowly formed and vanished again the air was still and warm filled with the low droning of insects now and then interrupted by the sleepy warbling of a small bird fleur and harry were lying side by side in the lush green meadow near the river bank both gazing dreamily up at the sky now and then their hands touched and their fingers intertwined if this is a dream then i only wish i ll never wake up harry murmured giving fleur hand another caress everything seems so far away so unimportant hogwarts even voldemort it as if oh i dontknow how to say it it only you that matters fleur rolled over to her side supported herself on an elbow and looked into his emerald eyes no she said softly stroking his hair with her free hand it us that matter and she leaned over him for another feather light kiss the roar of a motor bike tore through the silence fleur and harry sat up and turned round to look at the intruder a shining black machine was just coming to a stop on the path a few yards away two stocky figures in black leather dismounted oh no said harry as the riders removed their helmets dudley and pierce polkiss my oh my they could hear dudley say gleefully when he had recognised them what have we got here he and his friend walked slowly towards fleur and harry who stood up to face them harry recognised the look on his cousin face only too well he going to make trouble he told fleur in a whisper and he knows i cantdo magic she shot him a reassuring and amused smile but i can she whispered back and he doesntknow that she felt for her wand inside her robe aw sweetie dudley addressed fleur when he had reached the two of them in a manner he had seen in various action films and that he thought was irresistible now what a girl like you doing with a loser like that you can do so much better with you i suppose the ice in fleur voice was almost tangible and her smile was frightening at least this was what harry felt dudley too obtuse to sense it failed to notice the former altogether and took the latter at face value yeah honey he drawled on why donti kick that he nodded his head at harry into the river and show you what a really good time is like take care of him pierce he said to his friend and he grabbed fleur round her waist with both hands grinning broadly come baby just be a little bit nice to old dudley like lightning fleur whipped out her wand and slammed the tip against dudley chest which caused him to loosen his grip and stagger backwards a foot or two stupefy with all her fury her voice remained cold like ice and was barely more than a whisper but the effect of the spell perhaps because of her anger or perhaps in combination of some residue of the veela magic was the most stunning harry had ever witnessed like a cannonball dudley shot off his feet and forcefully backwards straight into the motor bike which fell over with a crash dudley on top of it fleur was standing there eyes sparkling her wand arm extended straight towards dudley her magnificent hair streaming behind her in a sudden gust of wind that had appeared from nowhere she was indeed a marvellous and at the same time frightening sight pierce polkiss not the fastest thinker at the best of times was still gaping stupidly when fleur turned to him he had not even time to blanch before she said in the same dangerously quiet voice petrificus totalis he had no idea what was happening as he felt his arms and legs snap together as if being forced to stand at attention and presently he fell forward stiff as a log calmly fleur put away her wand turned round and looked at harry grinning widely c est ca harry although he had seen magic being performed countless times was quite impressed nevertheless now i know why the goblet chose you for champion he said taking both her hands in his my i would so hate to have you as an enemy not to worry mr potter she replied kissing him briefly no danger of that ever now let take this she indicated pierce over to the first big goof they both grabbed pierce by the legs and dragged him over to where dudley was still lying in a heap what shall we do with them harry mused it would be a good thing if they didntremember what happened uncle vernon wouldntlike it one bit no problem fleur said lightly then she turned towards the two figures pointed her wand at them and muttered obliviate they ll think they had an accident she told harry and if i judge them correctly each will blame the other for it their machine will also not run by itself any more they ll have to push it to town it will take them quite some time i believe fleur you re marvellous what have i done to deserve shh harry i ve told you before i dontwant to hear it now just kiss me as i ll have to go back home soon to which harry readily complied chapter 40 real holidays for a change there one thing i dontunderstand harry told fleur thoughtfully when they walked up the stairs towards their rooms what fleur thoughts had obviously been somewhere else that spell you put on that mistletoe i mean dumbledore isntjust some wizard he well he dumbledore he should have been able to deal with a schoolgirl prank without so much as blinking and then your grandmother merlin she is practically that sort of spell incarnate she would he stopped bewildered looking at fleur complacent expression and an idea dawned on him you you dontmean to tell me they yes you do mean exactly that but how let just say our family have a feeling for that kind of thing fleur told him smugly i knew my grandmother had had a soft spot for him for quite some time i only wasntsure about him but he did not really kick up a row did he gabrielle piped up so i dontthink he was completely horrified by it all was he or he would as harry says have had no trouble countering that spell she grinned at harry that cheeky grin that he found so adorable in the small girl girls he said but nobody seemed to quite believe the note of exasperation he tried so hard to put into this single word when they arrived at their various doors iphigenie and margaux had been given their room next to fleur another thought struck harry how how do you arrange for the presents what presents christmas presents i d hate to do something wrong i mean i dontwant to miss giving them to you the right traditional way fleur gave him an affectionate hug of course you d worry about a thing like that just make sure you have the names on them the house elves will deposit them under the tree in the night but i really dontneed any present from you harry you have already given me the greatest present she pulled gabrielle towards her tightly the second time she added softly harry who knew from experience that it was no use arguing with her that gabrielle had been perfectly safe during the second task blushed in spite of himself but did not respond well i guess we d better say good night now he said instead it been a long day after a remarkably pleasant sleep he vaguely remembered dreaming but could not have said what about exactly harry woke up with bright sunshine streaming through his window when the recent events came back into his mind he could scarcely believe them but before he could start thinking again about everything fleur was suddenly perched on his bedside bending down to kiss him softly he withdrew without thinking dontworry cherie she said quietly it really me this time and when he reached out to her mind he realised soon enough that she was not under any imperius curse what a relief he said smiling at her and giving in to the kiss he was not going to forget that frightening experience in a hurry time to get up sweetheart she told him after some time it gift getting time now and gabie is right here came the little girl voice she plopped down on the bed and started tickling him giggling happily ahh gerroff me he gasped jumping out of bed and fumbling for his glasses let a guy get ready when they all came down into the salon fleur parents as well as vivienne and dumbledore were already at the breakfast table it the first time in i dontknow how long they are sitting together at the same table fleur told harry silently yes they look quite happy with themselves dontthey harry replied and look at dumbledore and indeed the headmaster seemed to be wearing a rather smug expression and appeared to be sitting unnecessarily close to fleur grandmother considering the enormous size of the breakfast table i told you so didnti again the exuberant merriment in fleur thoughts that harry enjoyed so much was there there nothing like a well charmed mistletoe to help people realise things breakfast passed in a happy and light hearted mood without anybody bringing up the topic of mistletoe at all when finally the table had been cleared isabeau announced time for presents indicating the neatly sorted stacks of parcels under the tree the next few minutes were filled with rustling paper now and then accentuated by exclamations of surprise and thanks great harry fleur said unwrapping a pair of quidditch gloves just the right thing for the upcoming match if i hadnthad those freezing fingers last time a great relief surged through harry who had not been certain at all if his present was a good choice in fact he had contemplated getting her perfume but when he remembered ron gift to hermione he had quickly abandoned the idea glad you like them he said rather sheepishly i just wanted to give you something practical it fantastic he said a few moments later looking at the lion shaped clasp in fleur parcel and so much better than those stupid gloves he said to himself silently fleur however was not to be fooled stop that at once harry potter she told him sternly i love your present especially as it not the normal sort of thing anyone might give a girl it supposed to have belonged to gryffindor himself she said aloud that what the shopkeeper told me but it a lot of rubbish of course she even let me have it one third cheaper than she said at first so it cantbe true obviously so no need for any inferiority complex see gabrielle squealed with delight when she unwrapped harry gift oh harry she exclaimed hugging him a simquid how did you know i ve wanted one for ages a what oh papa you are behind a simquid look it like a broomstick but it charmed in a way that when you sit on it you can perform all the important quidditch manoeuvres without ever leaving the ground the charm gives you the feelings of flying but you can stay indoors all the time you can set it for seeker beater or chaser and you can even programme weather conditions it the perfect way of practising the things they dream up these days gerard delacour said with a smile actually dumbledore spoke up i hear there are plans to put on the market a simulation game based on the recent triwizard tournament there supposed to be big money in a thing like that lovely gabrielle shouted eagerly with a model of everyone in the tournament of the dragons and harry and me this i am told seems to be the general idea but they ll cut out the part about voldemort i expect harry said rather grimly that i am reasonably convinced will indeed be the case harry the rest of the day they took advantage of the mild mediterranean weather and spent long hours on their brooms on which occasion gabrielle proved herself to be an equally talented flyer as her elder sister isabeau even though she did not pretend to be overjoyed with both her daughters unladylike pastimes watched them occasionally and seemed to be happy enough to see them having such a good time i happy when you are she said and hugged the two girls i only sorry it took me so long to realise dumbledore returned to hogwarts in the afternoon and vivienne announced she would have to leave the day after much to the dismay of her granddaughters i have to go back cherie she told fleur privately there are lessons to prepare and other things to do like what erm staff meetings and things oh stop smirking you naughty brat let do something new today gabrielle said at breakfast next morning as long as the two of you are here fleur mused for a moment how this she asked at last why dontwe go up into the alps i could do with the feeling of winter for a change how about it harry whatever you say it you who knows things around here isntit thus after an hour or so fleur apparated them all to the place she had chosen for their outing when harry got his bearings again his first impression was of cold and he was grateful for the fur lined cloak fleur had made him put on they were standing in knee deep snow thigh deep in gabrielle case in front of a little chalet of dark brown wood apparently high up in the mountains voila fleur said proudly far away from any muggles and unplottable by any ministry spells she had hardly finished when gabrielle threw the first snowball at her a second later a vicious snowball battle was raging and soon harry felt hot enough in spite of the frosty air when after some time flushed and soaked they collapsed laughing in the snow fleur suggested to get some hot drinks and put some drying spells on their clothes so they sat down at the table in the sun in front of the cabin and out of nowhere steaming mugs of hot chocolate appeared which they happily drained after that at gabrielle request they built a large model of hogwarts and then following fleur descriptions another of beauxbatons it more beautiful harry admitted grudgingly i can understand you were not too happy with it when you arrived at hogwarts but now it different fleur told him because there something at hogwarts that beauxbatons sorely misses you she leaned in to kiss him and they only broke apart when gabrielle became impatient another exceptionally bright winter day when gabrielle was off visiting a friend from her preparatory school fleur took harry to see paris of course paris in the snow would be even better she said when they arrived in the perfectly dry champs elysees but at least we donthave the awful dirt and slush that even the most beautiful snow turns into within a few hours they went up the hill to sacre coeur where fleur showed him the place of the dementor attack it feels strange she whispered and snuggled up to him shivering at the memory at a loss for words harry put his arms around her and held her close burying his face in her hair i cantpromise it will be any use he said at last but i promise i ll not let anything like that happen to you ever later they met with margaux and iphigenie at the chaudron decoulant and spent the afternoon chatting away amicably about the newest fashion trends and quidditch taking care not to mention voldemort or the recent dramatic events it was already dark a clear starry sky when fleur and harry among a large number of muggles queued up at the lift to the platform of the eiffel tower it beautiful harry said in awe looking across the sea of lights below yes isntit fleur replied happily i so glad you like it just like i do hand in hand they stood there in silence for a while until fleur spoke again whatever the new year has in store for us we will face it together their lips met and time seemed to stop water and fire sooner than harry could have wished new year day and with it the time for their departure for school was there this time the portkey was of all things a box of chocolates chocolates harry said surprised not just any chocolates isabeau told him lady godiva best belgian pralines not very magical except for the taste and of course for the self replenishing charm that guaranteed to last for at least three weeks gabrielle was devastated to say good bye apparently the time with harry made it even harder for her dontcry ma petite isabeau said gently you and me we are going to watch fleur playing her next match at hogwarts shall we at which gabrielle sobs changed to a scream of happiness and she flung herself into her mother arms now i ll believe anything fleur told harry silently just as the portkey was activated and transported them both back to the great hall at hogwarts chapter 41 back at school their arrival went quite unnoticed the hogwarts express must have arrived shortly before and there were large numbers of students streaming in through the front doors their travelling cloaks covered in snow and their faces red with cold welcome back to the scottish winter harry said ruefully to fleur no problem she replied happily i ve quite come to like this musty old castle and i really looking forward to normal everyday school life for a change if you must know hermione will be proud of you harry told her with a grin well see you at dinner hi harry ron voice greeted him when he entered the gryffindor common room and harry noted with a smile that both he and hermione were wearing identical weasley jumpers with a large h on hermione s had fine holidays ron went on you ll have to tell us everything i ll certainly not tell you exactly everything harry replied but nevertheless there is quite a lot that still remains just listen to this both of his friends listened eagerly and ron delighted scream the rat gone surprised a considerable number of the other students in the room after the long tale it was hermione who spoke first so if i ve understood that correctly fleur is here because voldemort wants her to be so much seems to be certain but why why should he even think she might be important enough and if he wants to harm her why get her to hogwarts where it is harder for him to get at her i wish i had an idea but not even dumbledore has come up with a theory it a complete mystery we ll just have to be extra careful and what that about a hidden portkey ron asked no idea again but if i remember the triwizard cup so you d better not touch anything strange ron hermione said reproachfully they could make anything into a portkey couldntthey no there must be some spells to check an object for portkey enchantments we d better start researching that first thing tomorrow no ron groaned not the library again it not even school yet and you re talking about research well harry said we dontknow if wormtail was even speaking the truth perhaps he was just boasting and even if he was who says that portkey will operate from hogwarts in fact wouldntit be pretty difficult to get it into the castle at all no i believe if there is any funny business they ll try it outside hogwarts hogsmeade perhaps or something but of course it will be a good idea to find that spell he added somewhat hastily on seeing hermione look well i dontexpect they ll enchant the plates or cups ron said i hungry at the ravenclaw table fleur found lyra and luna deep in conversation remembering her mother ideas about luna ancestry she felt strangely shy when she sat down next to them hello luna said brightly apparently unaware of all that so you did have a good time after all fleur wondered vaguely at the strange wording of so conventional a question when lyra put in how could she not sounding amused and winking at fleur causing her to blush you remember who she was with dontyou i dontmean that luna replied i mean the other thing other thing of course the grave danger was resolved and wrong put right wasntit fleur fleur completely dumbfounded nodded how the crystal ball the images were not clear but i could see you in a dungeon and you vanquished the dark lord servant didntyou yes but and a great wrong was put right too but i could not see what it was my mother and the curse luna how can you i dontunderstand anything lyra put in will somebody please tell me what you two are talking about so for the next half hour or so fleur had to tell her friends what had happened during her holidays accompanied by gasps of surprise from lyra and the calm nodding of luna now and then and you are telling me you saw all that in that crystal ball of yours lyra said incredulously yes fleur added and if you could see it why didntyou tell me it not so easy luna said her tone much like that of a mother explaining a simply thing to a not very bright child first of all i couldntsee it before it happened my mum could you know but not me not yet anyway secondly the images were very indistinct i could see it was about you and harry but i had no idea where it was and the rest of it about your mother was absolutely mysterious as i ve told you before a great wrong put right but i could not have said anything more have you have you ever thought of becoming a seer no i dontthink seeing is any use at all luna voice was unusually decisive what but everybody wants to know about their future of course they do lyra luna replied in the same patient tone as before but it no use is it when there something good in store for you you wontenjoy it half as much if you know it coming dontyou think and if it something bad she did not finish the sentence and looked at her two friends i see what you mean fleur said quite impressed by the fourth year logic you cannot change the past but you cannot change the future either right more than that luna answered earnestly how can you be sure that as soon as you know a prediction and believe it of course you dontdo exactly what is needed to make it come true so that a prediction is fulfilled because it has been made not the other way round you quite make my head spin said lyra but i think i understand it called a self fulfilling prophecy isntit something like that yes mind you i not saying prophecies are always useless the atlanteans for example they knew for a century that their continent would be destroyed so they could prepare themselves and their race survived fleur remembered hermione reaction when she heard atlantis mentioned last year and smiled to herself luna and hermione really were different and you she asked i hope your time here at hogwarts was not too boring not much luna answered serenely we talked a lot yes we found we have a lot in common lyra continued we both lost our mother for one luna went on well not exactly at least that what my dad says lyra said he still hopes he will find her again some day but he never tells me exactly what happened she paused then went on cantyou consult that crystal ball of yours but i dontneed a crystal ball for that luna replied calmly we all meet our loved ones again some day dontwe after that she devoted her further attention to the dishes that had appeared on the table and was silent classes started on the following day and if the owl and the newt students had thought their homework couldntget any tougher it took them only a day or two to realise how wrong hey had been even professor flitwick who had hitherto put the main emphasis of his teaching on the practical side set them long essays on the qualities and dangers of water and fire charms completed by a similar task on the most effective ways to block them from professor woods there is also a written exam in your newts he told the seventh years and much as i would prefer to deal with the practical aspects only we just canttake the chance that you lose valuable points in that area things were not very different for harry and the other owl students so he and fleur could only rarely find some time to spend together on top of the mountains of homework roger davies called the ravenclaw team for quidditch practice pretty much every evening slytherin are a tough task he would tell them in his customary pep talk before each session but we can beat them and beat them we must if we want to have any chance to still win the house cup in addition to normal practice roger had asked fleur to keep up her special tutoring of the newcomers and she had to admit that their chances were improving the formally abysmal youngsters were now simply mediocre and padma patil had actually developed into a pretty good flyer with remarkably powerful handling of her bat and as if all that was not enough fleur practised privately with harry who often teased her about her eagerness to win she was surprised at all the spectacular tricks she learned that she would never have dreamed about only a few months ago until even the famous wronski feint seemed like an everyday manoeuvre to her if you just see those bludgers coming you ll have no problems harry told her one evening just remember playing slytherin means a bludger can come from any direction at any time no matter where the quaffle is fairness is not in the slytherin vocabulary never forget that donti know it fleur said grimly but that just one more reason to squash them isntit that my girl harry said with a happy grin and kissed her and none of them is even close to your abilities thanks to you fleur whispered returning the kiss oh dear the gryffindor team are going to kill me ha i d like to see them try vivienne was back to her former persona and it took fleur a lot of self restraint not to tell harry who the severe middle aged greying teacher really was sometimes she could not believe he had not yet found out a couple of days after start of term professor woods told the fifth years the confundus charm as you will already have heard in a previous year is a very powerful and useful spell indeed why is that hermione hand was in the air before the professor had even finished the question it befuddles the senses and thus renders the subject unable to perform sensible actions it great advantage is that it doesntcause physical injury and does not leave any lasting mental damage either very good which variants of the confundus charm have you already studied disorientation giddiness blindfolding temporary deafness i see all very clever and useful charms and i trust you already learned how to block these spells of course neville said and did you find that difficult mr finnegan well it depends if your reaction is quick enough it not much of a problem is it understandably enough and that because you can see the spell coming towards you and can duck or put up a shielding charm and if you have a very good eye you can tell the form of it by the colour now what if there is a variant of confundus that you do not see the class was silent even hermione had no answer to this suddenly harry remembered moody putting the imperius curse on him last year you can only notice it as soon as it starts to take effect and only then you will be able to do something against it good mr potter harry thought he noticed an amused twinkle in the professor eyes but was sure he must be mistaken this of course is the difficult part and i do not expect all of you to mange it right away but with some perseverance you should master it until the end of term now i am not going to teach you the charm itself it is nothing a fifth year should learn even if you could which i doubt with one exception or two she said after a pause looking or so it seemed to harry surprise not at hermione but at padma patil now i want you to get together in groups of three and then i ll put that charm on one of each group for a start it will be your task to recognise the symptoms of the spell by watching each other and yourself ready during the next couple of minutes some people started to behave very strangely parvati for example started to comb her long ink black hair singing seamus was somersaulting across the room and ron began telling nobody in particular how he was the greatest quidditch keeper gryffindor had ever had and had already got three offers to play for famous professional teams i going to leave this lousy old school and be a millionaire he said loudly while harry and hermione exchanged looks of amusement finite incanatem came the professor voice everybody desisted from their behaviour and some people turned red with embarrassment i have made an utter fool of myself haventi ron muttered under his breath avoiding his friends eyes harry did not have the heart to tell him just how short of his recent ranting his current keeper abilities actually were and kept quiet hermione however said in a soothing tone no more than several others in this classroom and it not your fault you were enchanted after all now if you have all calmed down the professor said sounding amused let us revise what you have just experienced i suppose it was not so difficult for those unaffected by the spell to recognise those that were hard not to seamus mumbled still looking embarrassed my question though woods continued is this what did the targets of the spell feel and think what made you do these things i i suddenly had the feeling i had to impress everybody parvati said slowly like my life depended on everybody in the classroom appreciating how wonderful i was the other targets nodded obviously glad someone had answered the question for them a very good description the professor said approvingly this is what the spell does it forces the victims to do and say the most absurd things in order to show off to nobody in particular even if it may be funny sometimes in some situations it can be dangerous my next question now is this did you notice at all that you were being enchanted and if you did how did you realise it try to describe it as well as you can all the students that had been under the spell gave a description of their experiences most of them had only noticed something was wrong when they were well in their performances it like watching yourself from a distance neville summed it up as if you were imprisoned in your own mind and helpless to do anything to stop that strange person doing all sorts of mad things excellent the professor said this is exactly what all these curses do even though what you were exposed to is a far cry from imperius and of course no teacher would ever use it on a student not even for demonstration basically the method and effect are similar now for the difficult part resisting the spell once you realise it is working on you the crucial thing for you is to reassure yourself you have to mentally shout at yourself not to be stupid and at the same time tell yourself that you are a strong and independent person capable to make your own decisions a paradoxical behaviour now let try again the rest of the lesson passed with more weird activities of most of the students but more than half of them were able to fight the spell even if they could not keep up their resistance for more than a minute or so when it was harry turn to be bewitched however he was able to shake off the spell within a few seconds which earned gryffindor an extra ten points it not such a big deal he said to ron and hermione when they left the classroom remember moody and the imperius curse last year now this one whatever it was was a lot less aggressive i sure you ll learn to block it pretty soon i wonder hermione said thoughtfully what that spell she wouldnttell us what it was but i sure it reminds me of something well it doesntmatter does it she not going to teach it to us is she let go i hungry a sudden inspiration hit her yes how can i have been so blind remember the quidditch world cup what that got to do with it oh ron dontyou remember doing something erm similar to what most of us did just now when she enchanted us crazy things to show off of course the veela harry saw the parallels first and he blushed when he remembered his own foolish behaviour but you cant you arentsaying i not saying anything i just pointing out similarities of course she cantbe or can she a n another little chapter before the big bang or rather the opposite as it will mean an end of things the good thing about a u is it need not bother about canon so this tale will go on i hope you ll find the time to review even if you re busy reading dh a n well after the desaster called dh there is nothing like writing fanfic to take your mind off the unpleasant reality so here is a new chapter i hope you ll like even if some of you may think quidditch a bit boring after the excitement of past event i want to show how fleur and everybody else return to normal again and of course it an important event for her moreover you ll realise later that quidditch is more important than it seems at the moment chapter 42 unusual behaviour of a snitch you do realise that we play slytherin next week dontyou cho said to fleur one morning at breakfast how could i not the way roger keeps going on it will be up to me wontit and it not going to be simple fleur said remembering how she had watched harry play the first game this school year brute force yes that their strength but tactics not much there believe me but their seeker that malfoy guy is pretty good i ve seen him at practice and he has a very good broom all of them have his father bought them for all of the team but most of them dontreally know what they can do with them and as for malfoy you ve made a fool of him before haventyou indeed fleur grinned at the memory an additional reason for him to have it in for me though dontyou think two days later michael cornfoot one of the ravenclaw beaters came down with an especially nasty bout of magical flu and reluctantly roger davies decided to put padma patil on the team instead fantastic padma screamed when fleur told her the news at last i was so hoping i d get to play in earnest before the gryffindor match you wontregret it i promise that the spirit just hit those bludgers as hard as you can and dontmiss it may help to think of ron weasley too i sure it will padma said grimly there something i have to tell you harry told fleur after dinner on friday evening what is it the way you look it must be something bad yes me and my big mouth i i had a little erm disagreement with snape today and lost some house points so what new you keep doing that dontyou if it was only that no he he gave me detention and fleur face fell and so you ll be in detention with snape during the match tomorrow i afraid so i i tried to argue with him but he wouldntset another day of course not he could see it bothered you a lot so he enjoyed it even more i sure naturally so i cantcheer you on i sorry dontworry i ll be alright she tried to sound more confident than she really felt somehow the idea of harry watching her play had strengthened her spirits a lot during the last couple of days i sure we can beat them harry of course was not to be fooled i sorry he said again and his sheepish expression caused fleur to smile and kiss him in reassurance the saturday of the match was a cold but bright and clear winter day well equipped with her new quidditch gloves that she had reinforced with a strong warming charm fleur set out for the pitch with her team mates after lunch shut up roger she said irritably when he started into one of his lectures we know we can beat them and we will and that it the stands around the pitch were already crowded but even among the sea of spectators it was impossible to miss the silver blonde mane of isabeau delacour it gave fleur heart quite a jolt to see that her mother had indeed remembered her promise to gabrielle and had turned up to watch her play an idea that would have seemed preposterous only a few weeks ago in the times of the old mother she would only have felt additional pressure knowing her mother was watching her but now she felt strangely elated and more confident than she had ever been since friday evening of course she could not rush over much as she would have wanted to but stopping for a moment she waved and was delighted to see gabrielle waving back hopping up and down next to her mother the ritual of shaking hands was familiar to fleur by now and she noticed in passing how roger tried hard not to flinch when urquhart the slytherin captain was doing his best to break his fingers the whistle went and the players soared into the air right away she found herself closely tailed by malfoy who kept hovering next to her at arm length oi half breed he sneered at her going to eat mud once more are you fleur ignored him and urged her broom into a couple of loopings in the hope of shaking him off but even though it took him a moment or two he was by her side again fast enough needs more than that to get rid of draco malfoy he said but he sounded somewhat out of breath at least seeing a slight widening of his eyes fleur reacted instinctively and swerved her broom aside in a sharp tug not a second too soon either the bludger that had come racing towards her from behind missed her head so narrowly that the air rushing past roared in her ears oops malfoy said gleefully what a near miss well you canthave everything i guess a roar from the crowds indicated the first goal and to fleur dismay there was no doubt it had been scored by slytherin well my beauty draco drawled i afraid i must leave i ve got a snitch to catch you now fleur was not sorry when he dived down towards the slytherin hoops the game was moving fast and it was not long before cho scored a beautiful goal after elegantly foiling two bludgers that were threatening to crush her head between them also it seemed that padma was rising marvellously to the challenge of her first game her well aimed bludgers gave the slytherin chasers quite a run for their money suddenly fleur saw the fluttering golden ball a couple of feet below the centre slytherin hoop without hesitation she went into the steep dive that she had perfected with harry help and flattening herself to the handle raced downwards of course there was no way draco could miss her manoeuvre and immediately he was racing towards the same point but not only that the two huge slytherin beaters as if following a plan changed course and started to converge towards her at great speed they might not have been the most elegant of flyers but the speed of their brooms certainly was a match for fleur s she realised at once what they were intending to do non mes garcons she said to herself grimly and when the two flyers were only an inch away from her right and left side and could not have changed their collision course any more she slipped off her broom holding on to the handle with both hands only with a sickening crunch the two heavy figures crashed into each other lost control of their brooms and tumbled down towards the ground amid the roar of the audience fleur swung herself up onto the broom again while below her bole and derrick picked themselves up slowly she looked around anxiously and was relieved to see the snitch had apparently disappeared before draco had been able to catch it abominable and cowardly behaviour of the slytherins she heard lee shout sorry professor anybody could lose control of their brooms like that and almost squash an opponent i sure but foiled in a spectacular way by fleur delacour who d have thought a stunning girl like that was also such an incredible flyer for perhaps the first time fleur felt not annoyed by this comment on her physical appearance but grinned to herself the game moved on and fleur was pleased to see that her team mates were well up to the tricks and the brutality of their opponents bole and derrick had returned into the game but they were keeping a respectful distance from her now even though they sent bludgers in her direction rather frequently if to no avail at least they leave our chasers alone she smiled to herself dodging another bludger with a careless flip of her broom while below edith chambers scored another goal for ravenclaw setting the score to 50 50 the snitch however still refused to put in another appearance as the game wore on into the third hour though the ravenclaw team began to show first signs of fatigue thus allowing the slytherins to put their superior physical strength to good use and score three goals in quick succession but the ravenclaw team was not giving up and that bradley with the quaffle lee was shouting passing to chang she passing it back mind the bludger cho no expertly deflected by padma patil a great new talent that girl who d have expected it of her quaffle passed back to bradley he throwing at the goal no jeff that not what that a bludger from patil it hits the quaffle redirects it yes it in the centre hoop it unbelievable never seen anything like that that going to get down in history sixty to eighty fleur was distracted for a moment by this remarkable feat of padma s and it was with a shock that she suddenly noticed draco malfoy zooming purposefully towards the stands no forcing the broom to utmost speed she rushed after him and indeed she saw or thought she saw the golden glitter of the snitch fluttering not very high above the heads of the spectators in spite of all the warming spells and the everclear glasses the icy air clawed at her face bringing tears to her eyes but she ignored the stinging pain and desperately willed her broom to go even faster the roars of the crowds only reached her as if from a very long distance and the sea of upturned faces was blurred as she slowly painfully slowly caught up with malfoy too late he reached out for the golden ball inches from his fingertips she had not made it suddenly the snitch jumped or rather disappeared just to re appear about a foot to his left taken completely by surprise and unable to change course or react in any other way malfoy continued on his trajectory for a yard or two before he could turn round but by that time fleur although equally flabbergasted by the snitch strange behaviour had made good use of her unexpected advantage and caught the struggling ball securely in her hand only now did she realise that she had come to a halt just a couple of feet above her mother and gabrielle who were loking up at her there was a huge smile on isabeau face something fleur had never seen before from her mother next to her gabrielle was jumping up and down evidently screaming her head off even if the general din from the audience made it impossible to hear her but she had no time to do or say anything at all the ravenclaw team were surrounding her shouting and trying to hug her in mid air it was actually becoming quite dangerous and it was only with difficulty that she could steer them all back to the safe ground of the pitch we beat them we beat them cho chanted tearfully her arms round fleur and padma as the team were finally on their way to the castle again amidst the cheers and singing of their supporters you were fantastic padma she kept saying i ve never seen a goal scored like that and that close save she went on to fleur i d never have thought you d catch it yet absolutely amazing but dontyou think that snitch was acting strange i mean does a snitch normally do that it was almost as if it was apparating i know it sounds stupid but snitches do have their peculiar ways of behaving cho replied not sounding too interested there no way to predict when or where they might appear or disappear for that matter that why they are so difficult to catch there are some people who say a snitch has a mind of its own which is rubbish if you ask me but still she shrugged what does it matter anyway we ve won that what counts isntit when they entered the great hall and marched towards the ravenclaw table with a scream of delight gabrielle came dashing towards fleur out of nowhere almost toppling her over as she flung herself into her sister arms you were marvellous she panted torn between sobs and laughter oh fleur i so happy to be with you again dinner was generally a noisy affair as everyone kept commenting on the game gabrielle who had taken her place at the ravenclaw table again just like she had during the tournament was bubbling with excitement she described how she had almost suffocated from holding her breath during fleur acrobatics to escape from bole and derrick and fell into one giggling fit after another remembering malfoy face when the snitch suddenly slipped out of his grasp isabeau was sitting at the teachers table and fleur could not help grinning to herself when she watched her polite and distant conversation with the defence professor her mother and grandmother were really accomplished actresses in the middle of dinner harry came rushing into the hall he immediately ran over to fleur and plopped down on the bench next to her panting that bastard he said after a quick kiss wouldntlet me go until he was quite sure the game was over so you did it i hear yes she did piped up gabrielle eager to be noticed by her hero and i could see everything and for the umpteenth time she plunged into her narrative of her big sister victory strange harry said thoughtfully i ve never heard of a snitch doing that sort of thing but then i guess there are loads of things i dontknow about quidditch yet you ve made malfoy look an idiot that what counts isntit so you re in the lead for the cup now arentyou i think so not that it matters there are three more games coming and you are in two of them so it not much use talking of leads yet is there but i must say i loved malfoys face after dinner fleur and gabrielle went over to isabeau who was waiting for them at the now empty teachers table i never knew you were so good isabeau said hugging fleur warmly i could not believe my eyes when you were dangling from that broomstick while those thugs crashed into each other how did you learn a thing like that but mama isntit obvious harry ah yes how silly of me but still he may have shown you the trick but you have to do it yourself dontyou well i still cannot understand what you see in this kind of sport but nevertheless i am very proud of you it was the very first time that fleur heard this kind of praise from her mother there were tears in her eyes as she kissed her cheeks thank you you dontknow how much this means to me i do cherie i do i know i haven t and i can only ask you again to forgive me for it but i will i promise chapter 44 special classes a n this is actually an editing of the original chapter 44 thanks to rejeimha for pointing out a major blunder what can i say thank you all for your patience i really appreciate it that you can still put up with my more than erratic updating i can only promise to do as best as i can oh and before i forget i dontown these characters otherwise the dreadful humbug would never have been written on monday right after the lesson fleur went up to professor woods to show her the copy of the strange signs they had found in sirius cave what do you make of it vivienne looked at the parchment carefully i not sure she said slowly it does look atlantean can you read it grandma i afraid i can t but there no harm in asking professor babbling is there but isntshe sure to ask questions and sirius is still a wanted criminal i dontthink it a good idea good thinking well albus might know what to do about it just leave it here and i ll ask him this evening in a similar way hermione approached the ancient runes professor excuse me professor can you tell me where i might find something about atlantean runes the professor looked up from her notes atlantean she inquired surprised how i found this reference the other day hermione who had been prepared for this question replied smugly where it says that paleo elvish runes are supposed to be derived from an older source going back to the atlantean era now i not sure what to believe is there really some evidence of atlantean writing most authors seem to think it just a myth actually she had just made up this explanation but the professor used to her best student voracious reading did not question it one simply could not keep track of all the books there were and if hermione granger mentioned reading something you might just as well take it for granted you might try ogden ogham alphabet etymology she said therefore it supposed to be a fundamental work on the origin of writing and if you cannot find anything there this question is pretty dubious you know it may give you cross references for further research thank you professor hermione said politely and dashed off to the library unlike the girls harry and ron were more concerned with the upcoming quidditch match against hufflepuff and what with homework and practice did not give the matter much thought we can and we will beat them harry would tell ron at least five times a day and indeed ron keeping techniques together with his reaction speed and catching skills had been steadily improving since their last game naturally this gave his self confidence the necessary boost so that in turn his skills were further reinforced and when two days before the game fleur watched the gryffindor team practising she was inclined to agree with harry there should be no problem as far as the keeping part is concerned she said to the boys but of course you never know about the snitch you ll come and watch will you it makes me feel so much better of course harry not that you need any assistance but it always a pleasure to see you flying after the defence lesson on friday afternoon however fleur found a note on her desk professor woods requests your presence in her office tomorrow at three o clock but it the game i cant she stopped abruptly seeing lyra looking at another slip of parchment have you got one too lyra asked puzzled what let me see indeed the text was exactly the same as was the parchment itself what can that be about i dontknow and i dontcare fleur said heatedly there the quidditch game and i have to i dontthink you can ignore a professor request just like that lyra told her besides i expect harry will be perfectly capable of whatever it is you quidditch freaks do she added with a smile even without your moral support moreover wouldntyou like to know and fleur had to admit that she was certainly curious when padma patil came over to her at dinner with another identical piece of parchment her curiosity rose even more and so it was not with too much regret that she told harry she would not be able to be present at the game if he was disappointed he did not show it at any rate perhaps it all for the best he said with a grin we might not be able to control our mental link in a stressful situation and we both know we canthave that in a game against hufflepuff and fleur remembering how she had alerted harry to catch the snitch in the slytherin game in autumn agreed much as she would have loved to talk to her grandmother in private it was clearly impossible with padma and lyra summoned to the professor office together with her she could hardly go there on her own without some questions being asked therefore together with the other two ravenclaws she found herself knocking on the door at three o clock sharp torn between regret mixed with a certain amount of anger at not being able to watch harry play and curiosity about vivienne plans the door opened by itself and they entered the cosy looking sitting room office that fleur was already familiar with to their surprise there were already three hufflepuff and three gryffindor girls present standing about rather awkwardly among them fleur recognised claudine pentecost a hufflepuff she knew from their herbology classes as well as a black gryffindor girl whose name she could not at the moment remember but whom she knew to be the sister of lee jordan the quidditch commentator most of them must be sixth or seventh year but she seemed to remember seeing one of the hufflepuffs and one gryffindor girl together with padma in a class the third gryffindor a very pretty girl with long dark hair but who in fleur opinion was wearing way too much make up seemed to be the youngest good afternoon ladies the professor greeted them amiably i so glad you could come i expect you will all be curious about my invitation but i must beg you to be patient until everybody has arrived slytherins lyra wondered in a very audible whisper very good miss parry the professor who had heard her perfectly well said cheerfully you should not believe there was a knock and she broke off gesturing for the door to open to admit to nobody surprise three slytherin girls one of them was daphne greengrass one of fleur classmates from ancient runes while carmilla dasilva was one of snape favourites in potions the third a rather waif like extremely pale girl with long silvery hair not unlike her own was unknown to fleur now that our little group is complete the professor said breaching the awkward silence why dontwe all sit down with a wave of her wand she arranged a number of comfortable armchairs in a semi circle motioning for the students to take seats another wave conjured a row of glasses of pumpkin juice perfect professor woods said sitting down now without further ado here is the reason for this meeting i have been watching the students of this school for several months now and even if some of you are not in my own classes other teachers have been helping me in this task after careful deliberation and a lengthy discussion with the headmaster i have chosen you because i believe you to have the talent for this special project i am planning first though there is one point i want to make very clear if you choose to take part you will have to keep everything completely secret and will indeed have to submit to a charm preventing you to speak about it to anybody if on the other hand you prefer not to participate which you are perfectly free to do of course i will have to erase this specific memory from your mind now the project itself is this you have all or perhaps most of you have learned about various forms of the confundus charm what you probably dontknow though is that there are certain related magical skills that can only be performed by witches she paused and looked directly at fleur who was sure she saw a mischievous glint in her eyes by a lucky chance at least one member of our little group should know about the kind of magic i mean fleur blushed and was not sure herself whether with embarrassment or anger erm the veela charm she managed to say very good the professor nodded only it should be charms there is not only one you you mean to teach us the veela charm but isntit i mean arentonly veela of course miss greengrass the veela charm is only an ability of true veela i certainly could not teach you to turn into birds for example but as i have said before there are certain related skills witches that possess the talent can learn in fact with these skills it is talent that counts without it all the studying of a lifetime would be no use but to answer your question yes i intend to teach you a few of these skills for instance bewitching boys the young heavily made up gryffindor girl giggled i would not put it so bluntly myself miss vane the professor said trying to sound stern but not entirely succeeding but basically yes this is one of the things i propose to teach you but professor isntthat illegal worse than that miss pentecost using it for personal selfish reasons is immoral wouldntbother some people immoral lee jordan sister muttered giving the slytherins a dirty look and causing daphne to flare up angrily i ll show you immoral she growled already halfway out of her chair ready to rush at the gryffindor with a lazy flick of her wand professor woods impedimenta ed daphne ladies she said slowly please compose yourselves if you cannot stay in the same room together for more than a few minutes without getting at each other throats i suggest you leave right away it will save those willing to learn a lot of time and trouble sorry the two girls said sounding embarrassed and daphne sat down again still glowering at the gryffindors that better the professor said calmly now of course i am not fool enough to believe that i can just trust each of you to use the abilities you will learn in sensible ways only you may get annoyed at somebody or your emotions may get the better of you in various other ways here she looked at the young gryffindor and therefore there will be certain safeguards to make sure of that what safeguards i not telling you miss abbott but i can assure you that i have a reputation of being quite creative fleur who had become increasingly annoyed during this conversation raised her hand professor she said trying hard to suppress her irritation these er skills they work only on er targets that are susceptible dontthey meaning the opposite sex in most cases the professor nodded and i suppose what you are trying to get at is how can i teach you this sort of thing if there is no way to practise it in this group and you wontbe allowed to use what you learn outside a nasty little problem indeed but i think i have found a solution at least as long as you are still learning the basics later on we ll see but now to business at a swish of her wand a picture in a gilded frame materialised in front of the girls it was the portrait of a young wizard in slightly old fashioned gryffindor robes with long auburn hair and bright blue eyes that looked familiar to fleur but without her being able to remember where she might have seen them wow doesnthe look cute jackie the heavily made up young gryffindor remarked enthusiastically in a rather loud whisper to her black house mate shut up romilda you re impossible the other said clearly the professor seemed about to say something but the portrait chuckled good humouredly oh i ve always appreciated an honest opinion and a flattering one at that and i might even repay the compliment if i could only see more clearly through all these layers of paint romilda deep blush even penetrated said layers while the other girls giggled appreciatively obviously there were no members of the romilda vane fan club present let me introduce you to well let call him mr a the professor said who has kindly agreed to assist us as an experimental target good afternoon ladies the portrait said with a polite bow i am happy to assist your worthy professor in her ambitious task i hope you will enjoy these lessons as much as i doubtlessly will he finished with a huge grin and just call me al if you want to address me mr a sounds so terribly formal doesntit now why dontwe proceed indeed the professor said there is no reason we should not and it getting late anyway now while at the end of this course you will hopefully be able to cast the spell without resorting to a wand or an incantation at the beginning you will need both to concentrate and direct your power so watch this she stood in front of the portrait pointed her wand straight at the young wizard head and exclaimed arma mulieris immediately her target eyes turned blank and al assumed a rigid posture you see the professor turned to her students this is the first stage of course normally you would not say the spell out loud and much less require a wand and of course you would not keep your target in this state for any length of time but proceed immediately for example with the following ostenta a shudder went through the wizard body and he began to strut importantly up and down in his painting trying to look important and clever but looking all the more silly for trying so hard the girls giggled the professor ended the spell how was i doing the young wizard inquired did i make a great fool of myself that you did indeed the professor said with a smile but you were really sweet romilda squealed delightedly again blushing under her heavy make up i delighted to hear it the object of her admiration replied in a tone so indulgent everybody except the young gryffindor could not help grinning always happy to be of service there are of course other commanding spells the professor continued when the general mirth had died down however you will find the basics hard enough to grasp so we will leave it at that for the next few weeks now all of you just try the first part and try to do it without any wand movement and without spoken words if you can miss delacour if you would be so kind to make a start perhaps fleur was only imagining it but she thought there was a distinct teasing tone in her grandmother voice inwardly seething and feeling utterly ridiculous she stepped in front of the painting and concentrated even before she had silently spoken the words the young wizard went through the motions she had witnessed during the professor demonstration and when she imagined her target performing somersaults and blowing kisses to the spectators he immediately complied with her mental image enough the professor exclaimed breaking the spell well done indeed even if you need to learn to tame down your imagination i always expected there would be something in your heritage miss parry you re next and while lyra was taking her place fleur stepped aside vowing to give her grandmother a piece of her mind as soon as she would get the chance lyra efforts were received with approval by the professor you have an unusual lot of talent and those of daphne hannah padma claudine and the third hufflepuff girl constance darcy were if not altogether satisfactory acceptable it would have been extremely unlikely for all of you to perform the spell perfectly at the first go the professor told a frustrated padma but i have chosen you for a reason and your gift is most certainly there carmilla dasilva was next she managed the first stage of the spell well enough the young wizard eyes went blank and his posture rigid but when it came to the second part his behaviour changed dramatically baring his teeth in something like a snarl he began to move his arms up and down rapidly causing his robes to billow out like enormous wings carmilla broke the spell hastily and a look of horror appeared in her pale face i i didnt she stammered now dontpanic the professor said soothingly you did excellently at first go you just have to learn to control your mental images better what in morgaine name was that lyra whispered but fleur equally mystified could only shrug however before she could give the incident any more thought the third slytherin girl stepped in front of the portrait well miss o malley the professor said you are next stay calm and dontoverdo things again the young wizard posture went rigid under the spell this time however he started plugging an imaginary musical instrument and began a high pitched wailing song that had everybody hair stand on end stop it siobhan daphne greengrass screamed covering her ears with her hands when the wailing had stopped and siobhan looking embarrassed stepped aside the wizard shook himself a bit tough i must say my dear madam he said to the professor but another extremely interesting choice of yours who would have thought it thought what fleur mouthed but now it was lyra turn to shrug i am glad you think so the professor replied smugly without the slightest attempt to clarify fleur question but i believe the noble house of gryffindor would like to have a go now jackie stepped forward and easily enough made her target go through the motions of a quidditch manoeuvre which lacking a broom looked quite ridiculous and caused everybody to laugh thus dispelling the awkward mood that had developed now miss brown but strangely enough as hard as lavender tried the painting did not show any reaction frustrated she threw down her wand i cantdo it she groaned i awfully sorry my dear young lady the young wizard said apologetically it really does not work at all not even very slightly i could have pretended of course but what would be the use strange indeed the professor mused i cannot imagine i could have been so wrong well i ll have to think about it later last one now miss vane if you please all the girls found romilda exaggerated stance and flourishing wandwork amusing and were therefore particularly surprised that the painting immediately showed the typical reactions to the spell the young wizard went down on one knee pressing his hands to his heart and started declaiming shall i compare thee to a summer day thank you my good sir romilda said after he had finished the poem ending the spell with another grand movement of her wand and looking around her quite satisfied with herself i really have to congratulate you my dear the wizard said with a grin that was quite remarkable for one so young and i d never have expected this poem too fleur could only silently agree romilda vane most certainly did not look the sort of person to be familiar with a poem like that well ladies the professor said this has really been a most fruitful afternoon next time you will practise the spell with reduced wand use difficult i ll admit but not too much so judging from your performance today as for you miss brown i ll think it over and let you know if i have any ideas before you go though i have to make sure you will not give away our little secret so she performed several elaborate wand movements this will make sure you will not be able to talk about today events to anybody outside this group and likewise it will make it impossible for you to practise your skills unauthorised here she looked hard at romilda class dismissed she said finally i sure you wontwant to miss your dinner after a stressful afternoon ah and miss delacour a word with you if you please fleur who had been bursting to give her grandmother a piece of her mind was only too happy to have an excuse for staying behind and as soon as the last of the girls had closed the door behind her she began what on earth are you playing at what the big idea teaching all these girls the veela charms there really no need to get all excited ma chere vivienne said with a smile i think i know perfectly well what i am doing and so by the way does albus he has always believed in developing everybody special gifts and talents to the maximum in fact it just been for lack of a qualified teacher this special field of magic has not been taught at hogwarts before so he was only too happy to have found such a teacher at last but isntit illegal fleur asked you said so yourself didntyou it is indeed vivienne replied smugly with a narrow minded bunch of politicians in charge like we have them at the moment and france or england dontmake much of a difference we have to tread carefully even with dear dolores taken care of there is no way fudge would put up with it that why i have taken all those precautions and if you remember that part of what i said you will also remember me saying that you simply cannot teach humans the veela charm what we are doing here is an extremely softened down variant of confundus nothing more it different for people with a veela heritage of course she finished with a grin but but are you sure it can stay a secret i mean you are planning to have these classes rather regularly and dontyou think someone might guess about your true identity well those spells are pretty strong moreover i have a feeling none of those girls would be too eager to tell anybody even if they could they feel very special to have been chosen and are scared of competition the only problem that might arise is that one might if she develops a very strong feeling for someone could try to use the charm on him emotions are always a very powerful factor where magic of this kind is concerned but even that is not too much of a danger the charm would be rather weak and short lived so there wouldntbe any harm done but why it a very powerful branch of magic if used wisely and may come in extremely useful in the difficult times we are facing and it is certainly something the average death eater will not be prepared for it only a pity that it depends on natural talent so much so that it cannot be taught all the girls here as i said i have watched the students here for five months and the twelve of you are all that i have found unfortunately this is not something you can pick up from books fleur thought of hermione and grinned a n i know i know just enjoy chapter 45 a secret revealed and a new mystery found when fleur entered the great hall most of the students were already gathered for dinner and it did not need a lot of observation to notice the exuberant mood at the hufflepuff table while the atmosphere at that of the gryffindors was more than just a little subdued dontsay anything harry said when she went over to him you can imagine what happened but it not been ron fault this time hermione said grimly he really had a few spectacular saves ninety to twenty we were in the lead ron grumbled surfacing from his plate of steak and kidney pie and then that guy summerby must go and catch the bloody snitch life is so unfair again he turned his attention to the food on his plate and hermione for once did not say anything about his table manners even if her eyebrows went up a good deal at least he not taking it personally as you can see harry said with a wry smile his appetite does not seem to have suffered that something after a short pause he went on what was all that about woods and everything she erm it she wants it to be a secret fleur stammered feeling the blush rising in her face i canttalk about it i sorry she put a spell on us us hermione inquired well yes erm she found her voice faltering and shook her head helplessly the spell she managed to croak i see hermione now sounding very alert and interested said let try a different approach so there were some other students there with you yes how many of you fleur shook her head was it only ravenclaws no all the other houses too yes more than er three from each house no give it a break hermione ron mumbled between mouthfuls what is this twenty questions just go on eating there a good boy hermione retorted irritably and to harry and fleur she continued a simple secrecy spell obviously you can answer relevant questions with yes or no only it will take some time this way but i am pretty certain i ll find out everything sooner or later it just a matter of thinking up the right questions so let see three from each house yes girls only yes all seventh years no interesting well i suppose it wasntjust a tea party with scones and small talk so what would a teacher ask twelve girls from different houses and different years to her office for was it but hermione harry interfered what if fleur doesnt want to tell us i mean it sounds like you promised not to talk about that secret whatever it is fleur who had been wondering about pretty much the same thing smiled at him gratefully i not sure myself she said doubtfully but then a reckless rebellious feeling came over her as she remembered how her grandmother had practically tricked her into everything and she said but i did not ask to be involved in the matter and i dontthink i have to follow her orders moreover you are my best friends here so if anybody deserves to know it you so go on with your questions so where were we teacher students did she teach you something yes something that can only be learned by girls naturally hermione shot a triumphant glance at ron who in the meantime had stopped eating and was following the conversation with big eyes a narrow selection like that and from different years and the secrecy it cannot have been about er sex education can it of course not fleur said vehemently angry at feeling the colour rising in her cheeks some sort of spell most likely yes we are closing in arentwe so the only thing left to find out is the spell itself but i dontthink you will actually have to give that away yourself there no knowing what might happen if you actually do a short trip to the library should do the trick and will probably take less time too fleur who had indeed been getting nervous in spite of herself felt relieved thanks it probably better this way then she cantreally blame me can she certainly not harry said reassuringly besides how is she ever to find out he finished with a grin it was nevertheless with mixed feelings that fleur obeyed when professor woods asked her to stay behind after the lesson on monday to have a word now ma chere vivienne said your friends do you think they know something well fleur replied hesitantly i dontthink they do at least at the moment but well hermione is definitely on the right track and she should have no problem finding out the rest pretty soon an afternoon in the library should be quite enough and knowing her once she knows about the spell it ll take her no time at all to guess the rest she looked at her grandmother anxiously and high time too vivienne smiled all that traipsing around was getting on my nerves back home i almost gave myself away a couple of times so you are not angry fleur said relieved of course not dontyou think i could have found ways to make completely certain they wouldntfind out the only thing is that they should not make it publicly known i sure i can trust them though perhaps ron you never know when he going to shoot off his big mouth do you well i ll take care of that in his next lesson and make sure he doesntblab and i suppose it will be a relief for you too not having any secrets from harry i mean and fleur who had felt exactly like that hugged her grandmother happily and as we can lift this one secret vivienne went on there also no reason why we should not tackle the question of the runes you found in that cave together so we ll all meet up in albus office this evening and talk everything over and we can take care of mr weasley tendencies to blurt out anything that comes to his mind thus after dinner the four of them found themselves in front of the headmaster office facing the gargoyles what can he possibly want us for hermione was asking for the fourth or fifth time fleur had not bothered telling the others about her conversation with her grandmother and secretly enjoyed her uneasiness somehow she still was not entirely comfortable in the clever witch company ice cream sundae fleur said to the gargoyles who obediently stepped aside releasing the moving spiral stairs that led to dumbledore rooms let go she said with a smile ignoring the others surprised expressions she did not think it was necessary to tell them that she had got the password from their defence professor the door at the top of the staircase opened noiselessly somewhat in spite of herself fleur was rather impressed at the variety of magical objects and instruments on display in glass cases and on shelves but most of all she felt drawn towards the phoenix that was perched on his stand next to the huge dark desk besides dumbledore professors woods and mcgonagall were also present welcome my dear young friends dumbledore greeted them amiably it good of you to spare some of your valuable time for an old man none of the four said anything in response to this understatement wontyou take a seat the headmaster continued indicating a number of large comfortable armchairs that had materialised out of nowhere you will be wondering why i have asked you to this little gathering he said after they had all sat down in the case of ron and hermione a bit awkwardly the thing is that recent developments make it seem advisable to pass some information on to you i dontwant to repeat a mistake that i have been making before when i kept some facts from you harry believing you were too young and vulnerable to bear them for which i ask your forgiveness harry opened his mouth but before he could think of anything clever to say the headmaster went on as you miss granger and mr weasley have proved to be the closest and most loyal friends of harry s it seems only fair to let you share this confidence moreover i am quite convinced that given the time you miss granger would find out most of what you will hear by yourself and this way you will save time and misunderstandings can be avoided but perhaps you will tell us what your research has discovered so far hermione who had blushed proudly at the headmaster praise looked surprised what what about well cantyou guess professor woods put in there are two non curricular topics you have been looking into recently arentthere how do you yes that right professor a matter of ancient runes and and fleur private classes with you and which conclusions have you reached well i think the latter is rather obvious isntit you are teaching them some kind of spell or spells that can only be performed by witches similar to the veela charm that are not an innate power but can be learned there just one thing i d like to know she continued hesitantly what my dear the defence professor asked kindly hermione blushed deeply again why why didntyou ask me to join i mean i want to learn and her voice faltered away i know what you mean professor woods sympathised being the cleverest witch of your year if not the whole school actually hermione brightened at this but i sorry to say that there are some things that cannot be learned the normal way with the arma mulierum charms you need the gift rather than the intellectual capacity which you doubtlessly possess so i afraid you will have to content yourself with the more common variants of confundus or disillusionment hermione face fell it is a highly imprecise branch of magic anyway mcgonagall put in and the disapprovement in her voice was very clear very similar to divination and highly questionable morally she added after a pause so i should not worry about it at all if i were you miss granger there are countless fields of magic open to a witch of your abilities that will be a lot more satisfying good reasoning at any rate miss granger dumbledore interjected tell me have you come to any other conclusions regarding this matter or speculations perhaps yes hermione began hesitantly there is something i ve been wondering about for some time already she faced professor woods again there was this lesson a couple of weeks ago where you had us practise resisting that spell remember the professor nodded well i thought then that sort of spell was only a natural veela talent and so i couldnthelp asking myself but but it couldntbe i mean you don t she broke off clearly embarrassed i dontwhat dear look like a veela erm well yes i suppose that what i wanted to say and and now that i know it can be learned easily enough i must have been wrong obviously ten points to gryffindor for excellent reasoning said the professor with a smile i knew you would find out sooner or later miss granger yes that exactly what i am a veela and my grandmother fleur who could not keep quiet any longer blurted out the sensation was tremendous obviously not even mcgonagall had known if her stunned expression was any indication and the look on ron face was one of such dumbfoundedness that fleur could only barely suppress an outburst of laughter you crafty wench harry thoughts were in her mind and she felt immediately guilty harry mental tone however was amused and put her at her ease immediately no need to feel sorry he reassured her i quite understand it just wouldntdo for the school to know and i must hand it to you you ve done an excellent job that why she seemed so familiar somehow back in france hermione on the other hand was wearing a satisfied smile obviously very proud of herself veela the sound from ron was not really articulate polyjuice ron hermione told him patiently enchante madame harry said in a somewhat exaggerated tone bowing to the professor with a cheeky grin i suppose we are to keep this secret hermione ever practical inquired naturally dumbledore said calmly and i would be personally indebted to you if this did not go beyond these walls the ministry would only be too happy to find a reason to interfere with the school again but but why ron had found his voice again to keep an eye on this young lady here vivienne explained after that attack on her we just wanted to be very careful and as fortunately the post of defence teacher happened to be vacant i applied for it and let me say that you are doing a magnificent job dumbledore said with a smile even if last year has made me a bit wary of teachers using polyjuice thank you headmaster vivienne said meekly but with a sparkle in her eyes that reminded harry of the scene under the mistletoe now that this little secret has been unveiled dumbledore continued sounding quite satisfied with himself let us proceed to the other topic at hand those runes have you found out anything yet and before you start telling the long story yes all of us know where and how you found them at this however hermione suddenly exploded why dontyou look for your stupid runes yourselves high and mighty as you are all of you here you ve been playing games with us for months on end she shot fleur an angry look and then addressed the teachers again for all i know you ve worked those runes out already anyway we re just simple stupid students after all arentwe how should we she broke off fuming you are doing yourself grave injustice miss granger as you are most certainly anything but a simple stupid student dumbledore said mildly but i quite understand your annoyance if these were just ordinary runes you would be perfectly right too however they are not they seem to be atlantean vivienne put in but the peculiar thing about atlantean runes is that no matter how carefully you copy them no copy can ever represent them in any discernible way that one of the reasons why many authorities still claim they are just a myth mcgonagall made a sound that sounded suspiciously like a snort but said nothing there was a rustling in the back of the room and sirius emerged from the curtains moreover he said grinning hugely at the youngsters surprise the whole thing has completely disappeared from that wall in the cave so it very likely it had only appeared shortly before i found it which is some relief i can tell you so the long and the short of it all dumbledore picked up the thread again is that the only way to find out more about these strange affair is a pensieve hermione realised at once exactly and i should be extremely indebted to you if you allowed me to examine your memories it may be highly important to look into this matter very carefully of course we will professor harry said at once and the others nodded their agreement after some time it was hard to say exactly how long with their various turns at the pensieve the headmaster stopped the procedures thank you all for your patient cooperation he beamed at them i think this is about all that we can hope to find out now i believe you he turned to vivienne are already certain that these are atlantean or at least very similar after examining the evidence minerva what is your opinion they are certainly nothing i have ever seen before the professor grudgingly admitted and the impossibility of getting them copied is also quite strange so for all practical purposes let s for the sake of argument consider them to be atlantean the question is what do they mean or more precisely how can we ever hope to decipher it but er isntthere ron who had been uncharacteristically silent during these proceedings obviously rendered speechless by the unexpected developments found his voice again i mean there is an ancient runes professor at this school actually there is hermione told him trying not entirely successfully not to sound condescending and i sure professor babbling is good at it too but think of it ron these are not just ordinary runes that can be learned and dealt with like spells mcgonagall put in looking distinctly sour no they seem to have more in common with the er veela like aspects of magic she shot a not too friendly glance at vivienne more like well things like divination if you ask me an excellent point minerva dumbledore said with a chuckle his eyes twinkling and therefore who better to consult than no not who you think a real expert the night is clear and not too cold too so why dontwe all depart right away with a few movements of his wand he conjured a door in the air in the middle of the room when he opened the door there was a grassy patch bathed in moonlight behind it now if you will kindly follow me he said as he stepped through the door a n of course i shamelessly abusing csl here but a simple portkey would have been too normal chapter 47 sorting things out the special lessons with professor woods were continued the following saturday the main task for the girls to master was the reduction of wand movement it would not be much use if your opponents could see you were going to perform some spell and thus had time to shield themselves the professor said so it is essential in the long run that you learn to perform it without any wand at all but professor daphne greengrass spoke up it is always said wandless magic is among the most advanced areas of magic and not everybody is able to learn it very true the professor said appreciatively but then it is equally true if not more so that the skills i am teaching you here cannot be learned at all learned in the normal sense of the word of course just like wandless magic can only be learned by specially gifted people our charms take a special inborn talent and unless i not very much mistaken all of you possess that talent again the portrait of the young wizard proved to be helpful in their practice and most of the girls managed to develop their skills in the desired direction again the two slytherins carmilla dasilva and siobhan o malley caused their target to behave in similarly weird ways as last time and especially carmilla was definitely not happy with it at all dontworry the professor told her soothingly we ll work on that i dontsee why you shouldntbe able to focus your powers in a different direction of course we canthave this sort of thing imagine if he could get out of that picture carmilla shuddered and seemed to turn a shade paler still it the same for you miss o malley the professor continued i am sure things will work out at last all you need to practice is to concentrate on your appropriate half what on earth is she talking about fleur whispered to lyra but her friend just shrugged helplessly when it was lavender turn though try as she might her spell did not have the slightest effect again i quitting she screamed in frustration throwing down her wand one moment miss brown the teacher told her bending down to pick up her wand we dontwant any rash conclusions do we she waved her wand and another portrait materialised on the wall it showed a very young man a boy rather in a dark blue velvet suit and a white shirt with an elaborate lace collar on his shoulders and down his front he was wearing a huge beret of the same material with a large white feather there was a scene of a shipwreck in the background once more if you please the professor said handing lavender her wand and indeed to lavender great surprise the effect of her spell was immediate the young man opened his arms in a longing gesture then went down on his knees and started picking some flowers which he offered lavender with a smile speechless lavender reached out as if to accept the flowers the spell broke and the portrait woke from its state dropping the flowers i i sorry i didntexpect the figure stammered blushing furiously you you wonttell olivia will you it addressed the teacher looking at her anxiously but you did know what this was all about the professor said sounding amused and i sure you have told her what you were going to do haventyou of course i always tell her everything the portrait said proudly no more false pretences between us you are right madam there is nothing to be ashamed of it is a very powerful spell after all isntit that it is indeed and she has no reason whatever to be jealous well let me thank you very much you have done us a great service perhaps in more than one way so i dontwant to detain you no longer give my best regards to olivia and your dear brother sebastian i hope his relationship is going well a smirk appeared in the portrait face i sure it couldntgo any better and to think that i well whatever glad to have been able to help you dear you certainly are very gifted if you will be so kind madam as to send me back i ll be greatly obliged good bye ladies all the portrait bowed taking off the beret with a flourish a cascade of golden locks spilled out from under it reaching down well below the shoulders good bye viola professor woods said with a big smile as she waved her wand and the portrait disappeared dumbstruck lavender gaped at the place where the portrait had been a second before a a girl yes the professor said gently sometimes we dontknow about such things ourselves and when lavender expression turned from surprise to embarrassment she added there is no need whatsoever to feel uneasy about it miss brown none at all it is one of the most natural things in the world and only narrow minded hypocrites will think otherwise you might even think yourself special if you look at it the right way dontyou think the other girls were standing around the two and it took some time for the implications to sink in fleur who thought of margaux and iphigenie was among the first to understand madam woods is right you know she said to lavender who looked at her with a frightened expression two of my best friends are perfectly happy together lavender looked relieved and smiled at her gratefully high time too romilda told her with a cheeky grin i mean everybody in gryffindor was wondering well not exactly everyone perhaps wondering what lavender said weakly when you d finally realise of course parvati will be over the moon absolutely padma said with conviction she been afraid you d never come to your senses lavender gasped in surprise you mean she she wontbe mad of course not she often told me about you and she frightened you might not be her friend if she told you how she feels so if you take my advice you tell her right away when you come back thank you with a sigh of relief lavender made to hug padma but checked herself er you dontmind she said somewhat sheepishly no you silly padma replied with a big smile hugging her heartily anything to see my sister happy lavender returned the hug a bit awkwardly tears of relief in her eyes i afraid my skill will not be so useful then she said ruefully to the professor as it will be a bit of a problem to find targets but then the surprise effect will be all the greater the professor retorted with a chuckle anyway i am glad i have not been wrong in my first assessment of your skills i was already beginning to doubt my judgement well ladies that it for tonight i wish you all a pleasant weekend what up ron inquired of a heavily yawning hermione at breakfast lavender and parvati came the muffled reply between two gulps of tea what about them being giggly and generally noisy half the night but isntthat what girls are always doing anyway have you ever heard me giggle ron no but you are no er no what ron hermione voice carried a poisonous sweetness that even ron could not fail to notice no girly girl is what he means of course harry came to the rescue which earned him a grateful glance from his best mate but what business did they have to be like that in the first place you ve never mentioned them being like that before have you at least someone pays attention to what i saying hermione said slightly peevishly they have been doing their fair share of giggling before that true but never together in parvati bed and certainly not long after midnight either both in the same bed ron ears were turning slightly red yes and whatever they were doing there is exclusively their own private matter and i sorry i ever brought it up i just mustntforget to teach them a good silencing charm is all before ron who was looking thoroughly embarrassed by now could say anything though neville came sprinting towards their table tadpoles he gasped completely out of breath what the sudden change of subject from pretty girls to tiny amphibians was too much for ron it was not of course for hermione oh that wonderful neville she exclaimed then she remembered the background story that must have led to the happy event and she stopped oh she finished rather lamely told you so neville didnti a very proud seamus entered the conversation that what toads do remember but you ll have to do something wontyou there ll be hundreds of them you canthave hundreds of toads in gryffindor tower easy dean laughed just leave the window open and some owls are sure to find their way in and settle the score neville turned white of course not i wonthave trevor family eaten anyway he added it not hundreds it only three as far as i have seen pretty unusual for toads seamus said sounding rather deflated and turning his attention back to his baked beans but then it pretty unusual toads too isntit harry said winking at hermione unusual why but ron have you forgotten about trevor girlfriend harry nudged him at last ron remembered too and almost choked on his toast yes most unusual he managed to mumble after everybody had duly admired trevor and his new family neville had been right there were no more than three tadpoles busily squirming in the water hermione went in search of fleur to tell her the news dumbledore will need to know about this fleur said that spell will just keep her in her animal form until what was it mayday eve and there no knowing what will happen when she turns back not that she doesntlook much nicer now hermione added but it true he will have to be told about it thus it happened that shortly after lunch minerva mcgonagall paid a visit to the gryffindor common room as this usually only happened when there had been a serious case of misbehaviour several students felt rather apprehensive at the sudden appearance of their head of house and especially the weasley twins discreetly faded into the background i hear about a rather rare species of toad the professor said noticing with amusement the relief that was evident on some faces and i would just like to look at them they belong to you mr longbottom i believe glowing with pride neville introduced trevor and his family to the teacher really an interesting specimen mcgonagall said picking up the toad formerly known as dolores umbridge what did you say it was a german exploding toad neville replied hardly believing there was something he knew and a teacher didn t it the pattern on the head you see ah i see mcgonagall muttered sounding a bit absent minded she was looking at the toad intently and a close observer might have seen her lips moving silently as if talking to the animal well thank you mr longbottom she said at last putting the toad down very interesting indeed i may come again in a couple of weeks to see how things are going we need to be very careful with rare species like this one hermione who had been watching the scene closely had a hard time to keep a straight face especially when mcgonagall caught her eye so dumbledore inquired i not sure minerva mcgonagall said doubtfully there are three tadpoles all right a thing that as some of the students have also noted is quite unusual with toads what troubling me is that i could not really communicate with her no contact at all well not exactly i could sense a certain feeling of contentment calm i cantreally describe it but there were certainly no distinct thoughts none that i could recognise at least which is not the usual state of affairs with animagi of course our experience with amphibian animagi is quite small so it might not be anything extraordinary about it but whatever we do we will have to keep a careful watch on her on mayday eve absolutely minerva said with a grim smile it would simply not do to have her revert to her true form among the students a few days later as harry was sitting by himself in the gryffindor common room trying to concentrate on his transfiguration essay romilda vane sat down in the chair on the other side of the table a wave of some rather strong perfume attacked his nose and he looked up in surprise romilda deep brown eyes were only a few inches from his face and he found himself staring into them what he began but suddenly there was a strange feeling creeping up inside him she very pretty he found himself thinking how come i ve never noticed her before and he felt the strong urge building up inside him to do something really spectacular to impress her he was halfway out of his chair with some very foggy ideas about somersaults on the table when a voice in his head said what do you think you re doing she trying to hex you dontyou see harry shook himself and plopped down in his seat again stop it he told the girl sounding angrier than he actually was whatever you re doing stop it doesntwork on me romilda turned a deep red under all her make up i i sorry she began looking at him with a frightened expression i i was just wondering suddenly harry understood you were trying professor woods spell on me werentyou romilda nodded but what for romilda blushed even more deeply but said nothing you mean you you have you are oh merlin he laughed out loud no no way you ll have to find someone else to try that spell on but when he saw the tears well up in her eyes he added good naturedly i mean you re very pretty and everything and i sure there are many guy who would be happy to go out with you and things but just not me i sorry why not pick someone else er ron perhaps he would probably not need much enchanting anyway but he didntsay that ron romilda snorted in disgust ah come he not as bad as all that harry said but had to admit to himself that romilda did have a point anyway he went on whoever just not me understand silently romilda nodded and fled the little minx suddenly fleur thoughts were in his head the idea how do you harry replied surprised her thoughts sparkled merrily i just felt your confusion when you considered doing something stupid under the spell i couldnthelp wondering how you d deal with it and let me congratulate you you managed to shake her off beautifully and she is a very good looking girl but she could never ever come even close to you harry told her putting all his emotions into his thoughts i not talking about your looks here he continued and you know it how can there ever be anybody else but you an once again i d like to ask a few questions what the matter with carmilla dasilva and siobhan o malley where did i borrow viola and her friends and yes i ve always thought that parvati and lavender should end up together a n well my friends here we go again there is a little teaser in this chapter and as i hope a nice cliffie at the end thanks a lot for all the nice reviews awesome twin who says i have to go by the book actually i can t it going to be loosely based on the book of course but there ll be lots of differences so wait and see btw it not even sure in canon if sirius is really dead there no body korifi no i afraid i cantprovide harry with fashionable clothing where would his inferiority complex go then wickerb yes poor big d but what would we do without him panuru just be patient i cantgive away something so important can i loopy dane yes the term flower power gets quite a new meaning doesntit silvermoonset that was exactly the idea some comic relief before things get going karlabob ok i ll try to reduce the fluff and give you more action glad you feel d is back in character enter the lion exactly harry with all his experiences is a lot more mature than the average teenage boy so he would have no use for the normal giggling 14 year old girl not to worry i not going to mess with harry destiny chapter 5 guess who coming for dinner nobody was there to watch when harry and fleur in close embrace for apparating reasons suddenly appeared in the little park on wisteria drive i afraid i must really return home now fleur whispered in harry ear while reluctantly letting her arms glide from his shoulders i dontknow what my mother will have to say about this but i guess i ll find out soon enough she finished wistfully well i can imagine quite a lot the dursleys will have to say harry said dryly but whatever they ll have in store for me it been worth it when will i see you again he added eagerly i cant really tell you it may well be that they wontlet me do it again any time soon but i promise i will come as soon as i can are you sure you dontwant me to come with you to your house i believe i can frighten those muggles enough so they won t much as i appreciate it and even more as i d love you to be with me a couple of minutes longer no i quite sure this is something i ll have to sort out myself you were admirable down there by the river and i dontwant to imagine what might have happened otherwise but this is my job if you mean you have to prove to yourself you can manage things on your own i dont agree but i can imagine what it means to you so good luck with the muggles and i ll see you as soon as i can she leaned in for a quick kiss which however turned into one a lot longer and more intensive but finally they let go of each other again harry watched in wonderment how the beautiful white robed girl in front of him turned into a snowy owl the exact duplicate of hedwig apart from the never changing blue eyes with a quiet hoot fleur the owl flew up to perch on harry shoulder where she nibbled his ear for a moment before she swung up into the sky and quickly disappeared in the blue and now for the bloodhounds harry said to himself in grim resolution as he went on his way however when he arrived at 4 privet drive he found that the dursleys were busy with something else i told you not to go down that lane so fast he could hear dudley shout even before he had reached the garden gate if you stupid idiot had had just kept sitting quietly nothing would have happened came the voice of pierce polkiss who seemed close to hysterics i ve been there loads of times and the first time you are along and now the machine is ruined and i ve not even finished paying for it oh i d like to harry didntlisten any longer glad for the diversion he skirted around the house and silently crept in through the back door and up the stairs to his room while the quarrel still resounded from the living room when he came down for dinner in the evening he had decided to behave completely normally and see how the dursleys would react and indeed whether because of some charm or some other mysterious reason they had forgotten about fleur appearance but perhaps they were only too preoccupied with dudley dudley was quite a sight and harry had a hard time not grinning his face was scratched and bruised and his left arm was in a sling he sat at the table staring morosely at his plate a rather unusual attitude for him good lord harry managed to say hoping he sounded natural what happened to you dudley glared at him i dontknow how you did it and i cantprove you did it but i sure you had something to do with it it always you and i ll get you for that i will harry did not doubt it in the least in fact dudley would get him anyway he didntneed anything so trivial as proof but it would be a lot worse if he knew feigning ignorance he repeated what happened ickle diddikins had a bad accident petunia whined trying to pat her recoiling son i always knew this horrible machine was too dangerous and the way that maniac rides it it a miracle you re still alive my popkin i could have told you pierce was no good harry said trying hard not to smirk too openly but you never asked hey dudley snapped out of his gloom how do you know it was him damn thinking fast harry replied come dud everybody knows about pierce polkiss and his stupid machine he been riding it all over the place and especially at night doesntneed ma i mean doesnt need a genius to know that dudley didntsay anything to this so harry expected he had bought this explanation during dinner none of the dursleys mentioned fleur and harry knew better than to introduce the subject petunia kept fussing over dudley and vernon muttered something about suing the bastard but otherwise the meal passed quietly enough finally vernon heaved himself up from his chair stretched and grumbled at harry do the dishes before you turn in and dontbe late for work tomorrow morning yes i mean no uncle vernon xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx oh cherie said vivienne and her voice though calm could not quite hide her relief i was already having the most terrible visions but you did it didntyou oh i so proud of you and she hugged her granddaughter who had just changed back from the white owl fleur hugged her back energetically thank you grandma thank you so much so i expect you did see him her grandmother replied with a smile and i d venture to say that you spent a rather nice day with him or you would have been back much earlier saving me a lot of worry i sorry grandma if i caused you any anxiety i just couldntgo back right away you have no idea about the horrible muggles he has to live with i wonder why he always has to go back there i am sure there are reasons security most likely he not exactly a nobody if you see what i mean you re probably right as always but tell me does maman know she could not suppress the anxiety in her voice her grandmother patted her hand reassuringly i havent even seen her for two days she seems to be busy in paris or something but i cantimagine there could be any harm in her knowing after all you ve mastered an important veela ability no i d rather imagine she d be proud of you just as proud as i am thanks grandma i do hope you are right i still not sure what to make of her new attitude but where gabie is she still up i d so love to tell her everything everything you ve not told me vivienne said in mock severity no dontbother i understand just go and see if she still awake she been asking me about you all day so i d be surprised if she was already asleep oh grandma you are really the best and after a quick hug fleur dashed off in search of her sister of course gabrielle was not asleep and of course she wanted to hear everything about harry potter whom she had been worshipping ever since that cold february day when he had pulled her out of the hogwarts lake of course fleur complied readily happy to relive the past few hours of course gabrielle was disgusted at her sister description of vernon and dudley and of course she greatly enjoyed how the youngest dursley had been dealt with and quite naturally she made small delighted noises when fleur told her how she had been looking at the morning star together with harry oh fleur she whispered snuggling closer to her her eyes drowsy you re a lucky girl you know with which words she dropped off to sleep and fleur thoroughly exhausted followed suit presently xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx pledge myself forever to the service of the dark lord as a sign of which your lord confers upon you his mark a distinction to be cherished and worn proudly and honourably the cold high voice was not much more than a whisper but the words could not have been branded into the kneeling figure brain any more deeply had they been roared out like thunder a grotesque smile disfigured the deadly white features of lord voldemort as he touched the tip of his wand to the outstretched bare forearm there was a faint hiss and the newly recruited death eater shivered involuntarily watching the skull with the serpent slithering from its mouth appear on the skin ah my eager young friend voldemort chuckled we need to control our tolerance of pain a bit better he raised his wand but thought better of it perhaps another time he said quietly almost as if to himself you may go your instructions will be given to you in due course the figure rose slowly still watching the dark mark with a kind of horrified fascination then covered the arm slowly with the sleeve of the robes yes master and you will think of my reward lord voldemort never forgets foolish young idiot voldemort remarked in an amused voice after the young death eater had left the room but what a very useful tool desire always is especially when it is mixed with hatred it has always been hasntit wormtail but my lord are you sure the small rat like man cringed at his master expression and did not finish his sentence you re lucky wormtail said the cold voice i in a particularly lenient mood today so your impertinence shall go unpunished this young fool will be useful as a spy that will not be suspected easily in hogwarts and can perhaps be turned into a weapon eventually yes decidedly useful in more than one way and that reward if i may be so bold as to ask my lord oh yes the reward they all get what they deserve my dear wormtail rest assured they always do the afternoon was drawing to its end and with it harry time at his uncle factory like last monday and the monday before it had been rather a busy day as most goods were delivered at the beginning of the week therefore tony and he had hardly had time to talk about anything else but the few necessary instruction about where to stack which crate and what to do with the odd damaged boxes but now shortly before five they had finally finished and were sitting on their rickety chairs in the lengthening shadow of the store house relaxing do you know this is my third week starting already harry remarked to nobody in particular stretching his arms and legs luxuriously i do hope that guy who fell from the ladder takes his time returning to his job i really like this and it great working with you tony thanks lad it nice having you here too hey why dontyou come with me to my sister this evening arabella is doing the cooking for me today and she isnthalf good at it i can tell you what say give you a change from those dursleys i dare say old mrs figg good at cooking i d never have thought so all that cabbage but i suppose i cant say no really well i not so sure they d like the idea but heck what can they do after all yes tony i d love to come so at five o clock they put harry dudley s old bike in the trunk of tony car and drove over to wisteria walk where tony parked the car in front of mrs figg house several cats were sitting in the front garden as harry and tony got out hi mr tibbles tony said to one of the cats will you please go in and say that we re here he talking to the cat can he be a bit strange in his head well he her brother after all and she definitely got a screw loose where cats are concerned the cat just as if he had understood each word got up stretched and leisurely ambled inside through the cat flap in the front door although harry had not been there in the last three or four years the dursleys had preferred to lock him in the house when they went away thus saving the money they d have had to spend on a babysitter all the hours in the old lady house came back to him weird feeling this no i guess she did her best just did not know what to do with a small kid dontthink i ever hated being with her at least there was no dudley mrs figg appeared from the back of the house where as harry remembered there was the kitchen together with her a not unpleasant smell drifted towards them no cabbage that some beginning i believe ah tony she said to her brother and then beamed at harry i so glad you ve come harry i ve not seen or talked to you for ages are you still enjoying that school of yours there was a distinct twinkle in her eyes no not that rubbish saint something or other she added when she noticed harry expression i never believed that one for a moment but just go into the living room will you dinner will be ready soon so harry and tony entered the living room curiously harry looked around but found everything much as he remembered it there was the large old fashioned sofa in red and gold plush covered with an assortment of pillows and on those pillows several cats there was the dark brown book case filled with old looking books many of them leather bound and with gold lettering and there was exactly the same fire place as in the dursley house only this one showed clear signs of being used rather frequently with assorted framed pictures of what must be generations of cats on the mantelpiece the most obvious difference to the living room in privet drive however was the striking absence of a tv set in the middle of the room a prettily laid table was awaiting them after removing the cats from two of the chairs the sat down at the table ah that nice said tony stretching his legs under the table a bit old fashioned perhaps and way too many cushions and pillows if you ask me but otherwise a nice place it some time you were here last right oh yes must be some four years now but it hardly changed strange isntit all these houses around here are pretty much the same arentthey and still it so very different i dontknow how to say this it feels warmer perhaps better in a way dontask me why hmm let me guess a huge grin was showing in tony face no dursleys perhaps at this moment mrs figg entered carrying a tray with a large steaming bowl that smelled excellent although harry could not have said of what exactly enjoy she said simply as she put the tray down on the table only now harry noticed that the table was laid for four persons are you expecting someone else he asked mrs figg exchanged an amused look with her brother yes indeed and it going to be quite a surprise for you i sure but why dont you start eating he will probably be a bit late and it would be a pity if your dinner got cold someone i know but i dontknow anybody here nobody i d be glad to see that is who is it but the others just smiled mysteriously and did not answer of course harry could not concentrate on his food at all now as he had to keep wondering who the mysterious guest would be the only people i can think of are all from the wizarding world they cantpossibly appear hear in this muggle house but no matter how much he thought about it he could not in the least imagine who to expect looking forward to school what he had not been listening and only now realised the question was directed at him i was saying are you looking forward to school already it your fifth year isnt it mrs figg was looking straight at him her eyes twinkling again yes it is oh i just cantwait to go back there to see my friends again and to learn well to learn more what your favourite subject then and before he had time to think harry blurted out transfig at this exact moment there was bang and a cloud of smoke and a robed figure stepped out of the fireplace a n no you are welcome to guess and speculate who is the young death eater and who is appearing in mrs figg fireplace i hope i can post the next chapter in a week or so it will have the answer to the second question obviously although you ll have to wait a lot longer for the first answer hope you enjoy a n hi everyone remember me i do apologize for taking so long with this but i have experienced the most awful writer block and just couldntget myself going so here are now two chapters take it as a small xmas gift chapter 50 the day after ah harry fleur whispered stretching luxuriously her eyes still closed harry her arm had not touched anything but a pillow and bumped against a wooden bedpost she opened her eyes and found herself in what was very clearly her bed in the seventh year dormitory in ravenclaw tower and of course she was alone in that bed she sat up confused had it all been a dream morgaine their walk through the tunnels of fire and water their wedding their she blushed at the recollection their love making please let it be real something in her heart though told her it could not have been a dream too vivid was the memory she could still feel harry kisses all over her body the whispered endearments the blinding ecstasy of their final union just when she was beginning to feel unsure remembering her encounter with morgaine a year ago she noticed it a small spray of fragrant purple flowers lying on her pillow thank you she whispered to nobody in particular good morning sweetheart harry thoughts were suddenly in her head i hope you have slept well harry what what happened i have no more of an idea than you i ve just woken up in this dingy old bed with ron snoring his head off next to me not really a welcome substitute for you believe me are you are you sure what i think happened did happen i mean it feels a thousand percent real but is there any proof yes harry no doubt about it at all oh harry i miss you so already so do i dearest i ll be down in the great hall in a minute cantwait to see you happily fleur swung her feet out of her bed to get dressed good morning dear the mirror in the bathroom said in its simpering voice you look especially fetching today if i may say so normally the mirror flattery annoyed fleur especially as it always said something like that no matter how she felt but this morning she was so happy that she thanked it in her kindest voice you are very welcome the mirror replied and it may have been her imagination but it sounded embarrassed to her when she came down into the ravenclaw common room she found luna sitting in one of the armchairs absently gazing into her crystal ball when she heard her she looked up and smiled high time if you ask me she said softly fleur could not have explained it but somehow she knew exactly what luna was talking about and blushed deeply no i didntpeek luna said quietly putting the crystal ball away in her bag though i must say it started in a rather interesting way taking a few deep breaths fleur willed the colour to drain from her face how i could not really say there was such a lot of magic in the air and when i consulted the orb i could see you in the otherworld the real glastonbury tor the labyrinth and the bonding you are very lucky you know it is very rare to find your soul mate her tone was suddenly sad now it will take a few hundred years to happen again she shook her head as if to chase away a melancholy thought well the average loving friendship shouldntbe scorned i expect let go down for breakfast you will be rather hungry wontyou if it had not been so un luna ish fleur would have sworn there was a cheeky smile in her face harry and fleur met at the entrance to the great hall and of course they rushed into each other arms at once completely oblivious to everything around them when they let go again gasping for air and became aware of their surroundings they realised that a small crowd had assembled around them after a moment of silence there were some wolf whistles and the spectators broke into applause normally fleur would have died of embarrassment but now she just smiled at harry took his hand and together they entered the hall reluctantly they separated to join their house tables at the gryffindor table hermione gave harry a quizzical look you look different somehow she said thoughtfully he does doesnthe ron ron who had been stuffing himself with bacon and eggs clearly had no clue at all and mumbled something indistinct between mouthfuls you can be rather useless you know she said exasperatedly what is it harry and as she saw harry blush profusely she added in a satisfied voice there has been something right erm you know harry muttered thoroughly embarrassed that prophecy remember about fire and water me and fleur see well last night we at last he had caught ron interest too who with quite uncharacteristic astuteness seemed to have drawn his own conclusions from harry less than coherent utterances you have mate really at the note of envy in his voice hermione narrowed her eyes at him but refrained from saying anything what was it like ah shut up ron hermione snapped irritated i sure harry will tell us what we need to know without catering to your immature fantasies so what that about the prophecy harry harry took a deep breath and started to tell his friends about the remarkable events meanwhile at the ravenclaw table lyra proved to be similarly observant as hermione there a new look about you she told fleur looking at her questioningly you are i know this sounds weird you are glowing for lack of a better word positively shining with happiness what no donttell me i believe i can yes it finally happened again fleur who had no doubt what her friend was talking about blushed deeply so i am right lyra said sounding satisfied with herself and let me say i am very happy for you i cantfor the life of me imagine how with you in your four poster right next to the rest of us but i sure you will clear up that little technical detail easily enough she looked at fleur expectantly who had little choice but comply with her demand when she had finished her story cho who had heard her too hugged her fervently tears streaming down her face you are so lucky she sobbed cedric her voice broke fleur patted her awkwardly i understand was all that she could say when the students were getting ready to leave after finishing breakfast professor mcgonagall approached both the ravenclaw and gryffindor tables and requested fleur and harry to accompany her to the headmaster office the headmaster wishes to see you at once she told them but refused to say anything more miss chang you should come too the three students looked at each other in surprise now i can perhaps understand about you two cho said a weak smile gracing her tear stained face but what can he possibly want with me a thought seemed to hit her can can it be about cedric do you think but of course they had no answer to this while approaching the headmaster office fleur and harry began to feel more uneasy whatever they are going to say or do harry told fleur in his mind there is nothing to regret or be ashamed for of course not she replied with conviction we have done the best thing we have ever done in our lives at least i have and i d do it all over again would you now harry teased and the mental image he conveyed to her made the colour rise in her cheeks good morning dumbledore welcomed them heartily his eyes twinkling more than usual he seemed to be in an exceptionally good mood do sit down lemon drop unlike their last visit to the office this time dumbledore conjured a comfortable soft couch for them to sit next to each other as well as a large leather armchair for cho i must ask your patience miss chang he addressed cho for talking to these two young people first but rest assured what i have to tell you is nothing bad nothing bad at all these seating arrangements will put you more at your ease i expect he said turning to fleur and harry now even if i have a general idea why dontyou tell me in your own words what happened last night but sir how how i know something has been going on well a sudden outburst of magic around midnight has been clearly registered by these instruments here now of course it just possible that these events have nothing at all to do with you but i would be greatly surprised if that was indeed the case he listened carefully and without interruption as fleur and harry gave a short account of the night occurrences finishing their report with the bonding ceremony this is very good he said at last and i must say i envy you a bit to meet both her and him and to be bonded by them it is a privilege that very few are granted but sir who are they i mean morgaine and merlin yes but both of them say they have had many names clever reasoning harry what you have met are how can i explain in a way incarnations of the two aspects of the life force that keeps things going male and female yin and yang spirits if you like that have assumed human form to communicate with mortals like a god and goddess i suppose you can see them as that and indeed ancient cultures did but there is hardly anything very godlike about them immortal of course by definition but otherwise no omnipotence omniscience and the rest and their power is even more limited in the human world as we all find out to our sorrow day after day an unwelcome thought occurred to harry will will voldemort also know dumbledore eyes became grave again alas harry i cannot imagine how he could not at least he will have registered the same outburst of magic there is no way he could not have noticed that there is a chance that he will not be aware of the source it came from or realise the implications it holds for him but i am afraid it is extremely small implications the prophecy obviously if there is anything at all in it the condition has been met now it all depends on whether he knows about the prophecy if he does which we have no way of finding out he will most likely speed up whatever plans he as made so we d all better be very careful but sir what can we actually do unfortunately harry i dontthink there is anything all we can do is to be on our guard the only thing is to wait for him to make the first move and be prepared as best we can there was a silence which dumbledore ended by turning to cho i thank you for being so patient with an old man curiosity he said and his eyes were twinkling again behind his glasses but now for the news the good news yes harry it sometimes is good news that awaits you in this room and not only you if you will be so good minerva mcgonagall waved her wand the effect was instantaneous if hard to describe as if a veil or curtain was pulled away without however that curtain being visible in the first place a figure was suddenly revealed near the window for a moment the three young people gaped motionless cho was the first to come out of the trance like state cedric with a strangled sob she rushed over to fling her arms around him fleur and harry stared at dumbledore still speechless you must forgive my taste for the dramatic he said with a smile and i believe harry you will agree with me this certainly is good news isntit but sir is it i mean has it has it anything to do with your midnight adventures i would indeed be very surprised if it had not powerful magic like that will have various effects and restoring a loved one seems so very much in keeping with it all dontyou think actually cedric awakening was the strongest hint for me as to what might have happened he looked at cho and cedric who were wrapped in each other arms tightly completely oblivious of anything around them his expression was the happiest harry had seen in him for a long time we had better leave them to themselves dontyou think he asked with a smile and a movement of his wand obscured the couple you are excused from your lessons today he said turning back to fleur and harry and i can imagine you will know various ways to make good use of this incidental free time morgain e words exactly harry told fleur and again the colour rose in their cheeks nobody not even hogwarts a history had an explanation for the fact that rumours spread like well like magic through the castle therefore by dinner time the whole school was abuzz with the weirdest and most fantastic ideas some speculated that you know who had been sighted in hogsmeade others maintained that there had been a robbery of gringotts most severely guarded vaults while another group claimed to have heard from reliable sources which however nobody could name that some sort of horrible catastrophe flood earthquake or fire was certain to hit the school the village the country the general atmosphere among the students was threatening to explode in a chaos of hysterics it was therefore out of a very serious concern for the order of things that dumbledore rose from his seat before dinner to make his announcement i could not but notice he began and a sudden silence fell that there is a certain unrest among you so to forestall all the rumours and gossip that seem to have sprung up i have decided to divulge this news to you and i am happy to tell you especially in troubled times like these it is good news very good news indeed my friends give a heartfelt welcome welcome back to he waved his wand and lifted the disillusionment charm cedric diggory everybody could suddenly see cedric standing in front of the high table holding cho by the hand and looking embarrassed by all the attention there was a second of stunned dead silence but then a storm of excited shouting broke loose like the great hall most likely had never experienced before a surge of enthusiastic students made to rush forward and the headmaster had to cast a series of impedimenta charms to prevent cedric being crushed by the crowds after subduing the noise with a strong silencing charm dumbledore spoke again yes my friends this is a joyous day for all of us and perhaps it will be best if mr diggory says a few words to you right now to explain his long absence the next few minutes cedric gave a short summary of the events that had led to his misfortune and let there be no misunderstanding he said nothing of it all was anybody fault except you know who s that is and most certainly not harry s in fact if it hadntbeen for him i most likely wouldntbe here today when he had finished dumbledore lifted his spells and a group of hufflepuffs dashed forward to carry their recovered housemate on their shoulders to their table if voldemort did not know before harry told fleur there is no way he could have missed this of course peter summerby offered at once to resign and install cedric in his position as captain and seeker for the hufflepuff quidditch team again but cedric kindly but firmly refused having been petrified for almost a year he said had not left him in a physical condition to stand any chance in the upcoming match against slytherine even though although hufflepuff put up a valiant fight and was in the lead with 70 points against slytherin ten for almost three hours draco malfoy caught the snitch thus winning slytherin a game that they clearly had not deserved to win or at least that was what all the other houses fervently believed most people were saying that the snitch had once again behaved in a very unexpected way at least this time they cannot say you hexed it harry told fleur with a huge grin a n a short respite now before the dramatic events of the next chapter i ve said it before and i ll say it again reviews are a writer lifeblood and while favourite story author and chapter alerts are all very nice they are not reviews and this is for you gabriel of course i d really appreciate that massive in depth review you are talking about your first review is anonymous so cantcontact you you can pm me or get my email address from my profile i d especially appreciate to hear about any plot holes and loose ends i may have forgotten about chapter 51 the mask falls i ve been having those dreams harry told fleur awkwardly a couple of days later thought you d want to know dreams good dreams he hurriedly said hearing the alarm in her voice about about my parents your parents good dreams tell me about them well you know dontyou i usually dream about them about voldemort i know harry she said soothingly but it not about that this time is it no it us my mum and dad i mean i am exactly like i am not a baby i mean and they keep talking to me and i can see them and hear them and always at the end i mean when my mum is is going to kiss me i wake up and you never get that kiss fleur said understanding exactly here let me i know it not the same she said withdrawing as she felt him stiffen in her arms and i do feel silly for even trying please don t harry muttered averting his eyes you you are all i have left feeling her own eyes sting she said nothing it the third time now harry went on after a pause and it always the same dream do you think there can be something in it the desperate hope in his voice tore at her heart we cantknow cherie can we it does seem strange to be sure shouldntyou tell dumbledore what for harry retorted rather gruffly he ll just say it no wonder what with us talking about those parallel worlds and things and what do you expect he can possibly do about it i dontknow harry but he did say to tell him about anything unusual didnthe all right i will why dontwe go and seek him out right away no harry i believe you d better talk to him on your own fleur said as gently as she could manage feeling strangely hurt by his sudden brusqueness it a very private matter for you and i sure you can talk more freely all he has left fleur thought when he had gone in search of the headmaster careful to shield these thoughts from harry am i really that to him second best pondering this idea fleur did what she usually did when she was upset she took her broom and went out for a few turns in the grounds flying she hoped would help her to sort out her feelings when she approached the quidditch pitch she noticed with some annoyance that a solitary figure was there that turned out to be roger davies a fact that did nothing to brighten her mood well i canttell him to leave i suppose she said to herself and trying to ignore him as best as she could she made ready to mount her broom to kick off not so fast my beauty his voice was cold and dangerous and against her will fleur froze with irrational fear before she could regain her composure she heard him say portus and felt how something possibly his wand touched her hand where she was wearing harry ring when she felt the familiar feeling of portkey transportation there was no chance for her to do anything at all of course harry had no idea what the password for the headmaster office might be and he was just about to turn away from the gargoyle having unsuccessfully tried various sweets not too unhappy to be quite honest as he still felt somewhat irritated by fleur insistence that he tell dumbledore about those dreams when the object of his visit appeared round the corner you wish to see me harry harry nodded it it probably nothing professor he began hesitantly but fleur she thought i ought to tell you he felt quite stupid now and stopped well we d better get in then dumbledore said calmly turning to the gargoyle strawberry trifle the gargoyle jumped aside and they stepped onto the moving staircase and up to the office which by now was quite familiar to harry have a seat harry dumbledore said settling himself in the chair at his desk now what is it you have to tell me harry proceeded to describe his recurring dream feeling more and more embarrassed as he went on well that is all he finished awkwardly i sure it nothing important and i sorry to bother you professor he stood up ready to leave but a gesture from dumbledore stopped him on the contrary harry he said sounding very serious as i have told you before we should not take any chances now i not saying that there has to be something behind it all but the very fact that the same dream has been repeating itself like that seems to indicate something special as i see it apart from it being a meaningless coincidence after all there are two very different explanations and i am not at all certain which i like less it could really be some unknown power or influence reaching out from one of those parallel worlds he stopped when he saw harry expression you really shouldn t harry he said gently there is no imaginable way people who have died here in our world could ever cross over from one where they are alive it would contradict all the rules of this or any other universe so he did not finish but harry understood but sir you said you did not like this possibility i certainly don t harry even if it is impossible for the dead to return in this way there are any number of things that could once an opening has been established the legends are full of them and more often than not they are anything but nice luckily though these dreams do not indicate that any such opening has yet developed and the other explanation do you need to ask harry voldemort but why again we cannot even begin to guess it is possible that he is using these dreams to try to make you do something rash in the belief you could get through to your parents it may develop into some kind of blackmail even who knows but whatever the dreams suggest harry always remember and that holds true for both my explanations that there is absolutely no chance in our world that lily and james will ever come back always keep in mind that you are dealing with the most evil wizard of our times who has never done anything for anybody except for himself so whenever he seems to be giving you something anything he will be cheating never believe anything voldemort says and most certainly never trust any promises he might make harry could only shake his head too many thoughts were racing through his head well he said after a pause i suppose i d better be going thanks for listening to me professor one minute harry i would like you to take something with you dumbledore clicked his fingers and a wooden box sailed from one of the shelves and landed on the desk do you remember this harry it took harry a moment or two before he recognised the ancient looking box monsieur delacour dagger correct harry you remember i took it with me to investigate its magical properties well i have reason to believe that this dagger might perhaps be used to open doors to those other worlds we have been talking about i must admit that i myself have not yet been able to use it for that purpose however with your affinity to them which may be expressing itself through these dreams you might be luckier than i have been but how alas i cannot advise you harry some of the old legends speak about a knife that can cut windows to those other worlds all i can say is that i have not been able to do it i certainly have tried perhaps the dagger itself will tell you when the time and the place are right i did tell you how magical objects seem to develop lives of their own remember of course there is always the chance that i am completely wrong about this dagger but it worth trying harry said resolutely picking up the box thank you professor when fleur failed to turn up at the table at lunchtime harry walked up to the ravenclaw seventh years who were just returning from the library where fleur he inquired nervously he met surprised expressions but isntshe with you lyra said at last she didntturn up for studying so we thought she didntfinish and a worried look came into her eyes you dontthink she began but harry had already turned on his heel there something wrong his mind was racing while he sprinted up the stairs to his dormitory he tried to send out his thoughts to her and found he did not get a reply not even the faintest echo of her thoughts for a moment he panicked and it was only with an effort that he could pull himself together and try to think clearly it my fault he berated himself as he delved into his trunk she was upset and it because of my idiotic behaviour this morning she just meant to help me and now if something happened to her after a frantic search of a minute or two he consulted the marauders map and had soon located the tiny spot labelled fleur delacour the chamber of secrets somehow it did not even come as a surprise they are after me he reasoned with himself she is only of any use to them as a hostage so why should they harm her at least not just yet a nasty voice in the back of his mind whispered for a moment he contemplated the idea of telling ron and hermione but he abandoned it quickly no this is between me and him it would only mean putting two more people in danger and there is hardly anything they can do after all a strange calmness came over him as he regarded the motionless black dot so this is where we meet again the corridors were deserted and he did not meet anybody as he made his way to moaning myrtle bathroom open up he said in parseltongue the opening appeared and harry let himself down into the bowels of hogwarts without hesitation when he came to his feet at the bottom of the chute he found that the rubble from the collapsed tunnel roof that had almost completely blocked the passage had disappeared but apart from that he was mildly surprised how little the place had changed in all the years he went on cautiously past the hide of the basilisk that was still there quite undisturbed and soon found himself in the chamber where he had fought the beast itself the huge carcass was also still there the hollow eyes staring and the huge fangs glinting faintly in the dim light remembering the power of the basilisk fang he had an idea accio basilisk fang he said pointing his wand at the huge jaws and caught it in his left hand if he had expected to find fleur though he was disappointed the chamber seemed quite empty harry stopped looking around and wondering what to do now suddenly out of the corner of his eye he noticed a movement wand at the ready he spun round but there was nobody just the mirror of erised there was indeed a huge mirror at exactly the spot where tom riddle had been standing waiting for him thee years ago and it did look very much like the magical mirror he had come across in his first year shapes were moving in it and that was what had caught his eye as he went closer however harry noticed several differences even if it did not show any signs of it no chips scratches or blind spots it was obviously very old indeed in some illogical way its very state of perfect preservation was what created that impression and while the mirror of erised inscription had been in legible letters even if the words had not made any sense to him here there was a long band of runes atlantean runes most likely winding itself along the edge of the glass snakelike just like the mirror of erised however there were figures moving in the glass and it was with a strange mixture of longing and dread that harry recognised them mum dad he felt eleven years old again remembering how he had seen them for the first time in his conscious life in that lonely cold chamber harry oh harry the words were barely a whisper but there was no mistaking the sound of the voice the same voice that so far had only been screaming in his nightmares as if hit by a blow harry stopped staring at the figure in disbelief mum he repeated stupidly fleur first impression after the effect of the portkey had abated was that she could not move the sensation was similar to the petrificus curse that she had experienced in various lessons but there was a difference that she could at the moment not put a finger on when she looked around her wildly that she noticed was one difference as the normal petrificus curse would not even allow you to move your eyes she found herself in a dark cave like chamber dimly lit by invisible light sources the high vaulted ceiling barely visible in the dusk was supported by a number of columns decorated with snake shaped ornaments even though she was completely unable to move she was not lying on the ground as would have been expected but found herself standing upright if standing was the correct word at all roger davies she now realised was standing next to her welcome to the chamber of slytherin he said with an ironic bow fleur struggled for words but no sound would come from her lips roger watched her with quiet amusement dontexert yourself my dear he said with a malicious smile that a good spell the dark lord has been generous enough to teach me fleur gasped at the blunt statement roger noticed and chuckled nastily yes the dark lord himself who d have believed it nice roger davies a bit quidditch crazy perhaps but a fair sportsman and good student ravenclaw too not a nasty slytherin he paused to let his words sink in then continued did you really believe i d forgotten last year how you humiliated me in front of the entire house the entire school that i d just watch bloody harry potter getting everything again no my ice queen this time you wontget away with it remember how i told you i d have you roger davies always keeps his word fleur shivered at the hatred in his voice yes he repeated i will have you but i will not keep you long if that is any consolation he smirked horribly the dark lord will reward me for my services and then then i ll have who and whatever i want in spite of her fear a cold fury welled up in fleur mind at these words pathetic the despicable scum he not even able to anything by himself he needs to grovel to his master but first came the hateful voice again you will have the honour of assisting in the downfall of the boy who presumed to stand up to the dark lord with a flourish he pointed at the other side of the chamber only now fleur saw what looked like a very large mirror in which indistinct shapes seemed to be moving and there in front of the mirror was harry her mental scream seemed to evaporate inside her head it was obvious harry could not register it their mental bond did not work imperio his curse hit her like a hammer mum harry repeated as if in a trance irresistibly he felt himself drawn towards the mirror he reached out towards the smooth surface hesitatingly a gesture from his mother image stopped him she seemed to be pointing look harry he heard or perhaps thought he heard the whispering voice he turned and stopped dead over at the far end of the dais perhaps ten to fifteen feet away he saw fleur and it was indeed her in the arms of a male figure whom it took him only a second to recognise roger davies kiss me a wave of nausea washed over fleur as she felt her captor orders crash into her mind but helpless she had to watch herself as it were from an outside vantage point like an empty shell go into the required movements putting her arms round him tilting her face invitingly to receive the hateful lips with her own and accept the thrust of his tongue into her mouth harry help me but again her desperate mental shout seemed to implode inside her head touch me the command came and she watched her hands wander like those of an automaton into his hair under his robes come to us harry the whispering voice was there again come she isntworth it she has betrayed you she has only been playing with you how could you ever believe harry shook himself in irritation glancing back and forth between the mirror and the spectacle of fleur in the arms of roger davies all his insecurities resurfaced she is not worth it harry you belong to us but then an image fought its way into his consciousness fleur and him standing at the sacred stone exchanging their vows tell me you love me davies command burned into fleur mind too late he realised his mistake like a white hot flame fleur control kicked in and summoning all her disgust and fury with a wordless spell flung him from her leaving him sprawled on the stone floor at the very same moment harry mind had sufficiently cleared to realise what he had almost done and simultaneously he and fleur flew at each other into a desperate embrace sobbing as an elemental wave of emotions enveloped them both sensing that they had just had a very narrow escape roger davies however had almost at once recovered from the shock his face livid with fury he screamed a curse at them that swept them off balance and in a maelstrom of red light hurled them into the mirror a n so what do you think anybody saw it coming you may know i something of a shakespeare freak can anyone find the shakespeare line i have used hint it spoken by one of the nastier characters keep your fingers crossed for yours truly i do hope to be able to come up with more a bit sooner now chapter 52 through the looking glass as she frequently did in her spare time luna lovegood was gazing into her crystal ball in the ravenclaw common room what she was seeing seemed to be of interest to her as she was crouching over the ball with her nose almost touching it suddenly she jumped up almost upsetting the ball but paying it no heed and quite unusual of her typical dreamy behaviour made a mad dash upstairs towards the seventh year girls dormitory into which she burst without knocking lyra she gasped breathlessly the older girl who had been lounging on her bed engrossed in a book looked up luna seeing her friend excited state she dropped her book and jumped off the bed what is it no time luna breathed grabbing her hand and dragging her out of the room mirror window harry come on strangely these cryptic words seemed to make some sense to lyra at any rate she gave up her initial reluctance and dashed after luna of her own accord when they reached the second floor bathroom it took luna only a moment to find her bearings down there she said matter of factly pointing at the opening that harry had gone down a short time ago lyra hesitated there are you sure luna did not bother to answer but her look told the other girl that there was no question about that and so the two ravenclaws went down the tube and presently found themselves in the tunnel with the basilisk hide luna stopped only shortly to take a firm hold of her wand and to motion for her friend to do the same then they crept on silently until they reached the tunnel opening into the chamber they were just in time to witness davies spell that threw harry and fleur into the mirror lyra almost screamed but when she realised that there was no shattered glass no broken frame and most importantly no sign of harry and hermione she began to understand her eyes wide with astonishment she looked over at luna who smiled back at her triumphantly roger davies had clearly not expected the effect his spell had had and was still gazing unbelievingly at the spot where harry and fleur had disappeared thus he was completely unprepared for the expelliarmus and petrificus totalis that simultaneously hit him from the two girls wands good work lyra said breathing deeply now what next luna gave her a surprised look after them of course but what about lyra gestured to the prone form of roger davies oh that incarcerous magical cords wound themselves round his arms and legs can you do a patronus luna then inquired yes what for send it to dumbledore or flitwick or someone to come and clean up here we should not wait for anybody to come down they are sure to stop us and that not what we want to happen do we but luna you can i mean this is my own quest there no need for you to you really shouldn t rubbish luna said with a look that expressed more than words what she thought of that idea of course i coming so lyra conjured her patronus which looked exactly like her parrot orest and it flew off to the tunnel off we go luna said cheerfully and it was extraordinary how her usual dreaminess had changed into full alertness together their wands at the ready they stepped through the mirror when harry and fleur could think clearly again they found themselves in a heap on the stone floor stunned with the surprise but otherwise unscathed they clambered to their feet and looked around bewildered at first glance the place was not a lot different the same stone floor the same columns with the same snake like decorations there was however no sign of roger davies and on closer inspection their surroundings showed none of the signs of neglect and decay that abounded in the original chamber also the carcass of the basilisk was nowhere to be seen the mirror through which they had been hurled by the spell was standing there without even the slightest traces of damage what was that harry said more to himself you ve just gone through the mirror came lyra voice sounding slightly amused as she and luna stepped through harry and fleur could only gape at the two girls an atlantean portal luna said sounding somewhat similar to hermione lecturing mode a gate to an alternative universe but what are you doing here well never mind i guess it the getting back that matters and he approached the mirror i dontbelieve it will work harry lyra told him i think it a one way portal to turn it around you d have to use the proper spells anyway luna said brightly we have just arrived haventwe i certainly am not going back anytime soon you mean you have planned to come here what in merlin name it a long story harry but the main point is that lyra is looking for her mother her mother as luna has said it a along and complicated story but at any rate i have at last managed to go through one portal they say the first time is the hardest to do so i am definitely staying but luna what about you you re not looking for anybody are you fleur asked no luna replied cheerfully i just curious and maybe i can write an interesting article for the quibbler but now that we are here we d better look around some and see what we can do next only now harry remembered what he had seen in the mirror before being thrown though it by the spell he looked around bewildered where are they who lyra quite understandably asked my parents i i saw them where harry fleur asked softly taking his hand in in the mirror before and and my mother was speaking to me like like in those dreams he paused suddenly he looked at fleur horrified she she said i i should you were you were betraying me tears came to his eyes and he looked down in shame and i i almost almost believed it fleur folded him in her arms and did not let go when she felt him go rigid at last he relaxed buried his face in her shoulder and gasped between sobs can you forgive me she held him close until the shaking of his body subsided it was just a mean trick of voldemort s harry she said quietly there is nothing to forgive and i ve not even not even asked you what happened i mean you and and roger i really should have he imperiused me made me do all those things there was nothing i could do and i hated every second of it oh harry i feel so so dirty hush love you have nothing at all to feel dirty for it me that should but how did you manage to break the curse i not sure he after he had made me do all those disgusting things he he told me to say i loved him oh harry it was just too much something snapped i cantexplain it it your bond your love luna told them quietly the special connection you have he could make you do all sorts of physical things you see she said to fleur but he could not control your mind and that command was the last straw that made it possible for you to break the curse oh you are both extremely lucky you know but but how did he get you here of all places you need to speak parseltongue to open the access portkey my ring oh harry a hidden portkey remember and it all came back to harry as he took fleur hand to examine the ring it did not look any different at all that shop he said thoughtfully do you think it cantbe but then do you think it was planted on me or something well it doesntmatter i guess it just a ring isntit we checked that didntwe luna however thought differently i bet it helped you break the curse it morgaine amulet after all i told you it wanted to be free didnti she added apparently as an afterthought free yes harry it does not belong in a setting that why your tests didnthave any results now this may all be very interesting said lyra who had been looking around the place through this conversation but there are a couple of more pressing issues it might be a clever idea i believe to be prepared for a surprise or more what for example said lyra there is no sign of the monster that even though dead is such a prominent feature in the place we ve just left the basilisk you mean a distinct possibility i d say lyra said drily what do we do simple luna smiled her typical smile and moved her wand in an intricate pattern here you are she said and handed each of them a pair of bright silver glasses this should do the trick how did you never mind i guess but how can i fight it i mean i cantcount on fawkes again can i harry said luna patiently why does it always have to be fighting you can speak parseltongue why dontyou talk to it is it really the mindless evil monster everyone says yes harry fleur agreed things are often not what they seem at first glance and it worth a try i sure and if the worst comes to the worst there four of us i do imagine we could at least get away without much of a problem er i guess you ll see about all that pretty soon harry lyra said pointing indeed over towards the far end of the chamber there was a movement of something very big the basilisk luna stated flatly or the jabberwock as it would be called in another place and i do believe it in some kind of cage or something fleur added they moved cautiously nearer and it was really as she had said a row of magical bars separated the creature area from the rest of the chamber the basilisk was there coiled up with its head turned towards the wall it looks almost harmless harry whispered shouldntwe leave it as it is and get out of here as fast as we can and never know whether it coming after us not a very good idea in my opinion said lyra it looks so unhappy luna said thoughtfully it not nice being locked up like that really luna fleur began a sudden memory flashed through harry mind he saw himself all those years ago looking at the boa constrictor in the zoo do you know you might be right luna he said with a smile just how do you address a basilisk he thought for a moment and then said well i ll never know unless i give it a try are you sure these glasses will work luna did not answer and just gave him her misty smile all right here goes then and turning to the basilisk he said in parseltongue erm can i talk to you the huge snake slowly turned its head and looked at the humans now snakes of course have no facial expression but it gave harry quite a shock to see the dim light in its eyes that was nothing like what he remembered luna was obviously perfectly correct in her assumption this creature certainly seemed to be extremely miserable why cantyou leave me alone even the snake language conveyed a feeling of resignation and tiredness go away potter harry gasped in surprise you know me know you when you come here almost every day to taunt and deride me taunt and deride suddenly harry understood but i i am not potter not that potter at any rate not the equivalent of a sarcastic laugh sounded in harry ears you are not denying you are him are you listen harry said desperately i know this is weird i am harry potter but i not the harry potter that you seem to know me and my friends we have just arrived through the mirror the basilisk raised its head and for the first time there seemed to be a spark of life of interest in its huge eyes just arrived through a mirror from another world yes that what it seems to be i dontquite understand it myself but i swear whatever person you know as potter it not me true the basilisk said after a pause you look a bit different especially your robes tell me harry said slowly the potter you know you dontseem to like him a deep growl came from the snake i hate him he has kept me locked up here for i dontknow how long excuse me for a moment i have to explain to my friends harry said having noticed how the girls were getting restless i told you luna said with satisfaction after he had told them about his conversation it not the dumb beast at all but what can it possibly mean fleur asked about the harry potter in this world can he be so very different from you i cantbe sure but this potter seems to be rather nasty character that what i mean by different harry and it comes as quite a shock i can tell you harry said thoughtfully i mean what else will be different quite a lot i expect lyra remarked that why it an alternative universe most likely many other things will be the opposite of what we know basilisk alive instead of dead harry potter bad instead of good perhaps downright evil and my parents harry voice was shaking as a horrible thought reared its ugly head fleur understood at once it is at least possible harry she said very quietly taking both his hands in hers it was a trick of voldemort after all we will probably be wiser soon luna interrupted pointing towards the entrance of the chamber where something seemed to be moving someone coming potter the basilisk growled turning its head towards the wall again a n just like harry i was not sure how to talk to a basilisk hence the long interval as you will have noticed the underlined parts are the ones spoken in parseltongue what else can i say ah yes review and gabriel i still waiting for that comprehensive thingy you promised a n welcome back my friends here is the new chapter with some action at last was high time something happened dontyou think thanks for all the wonderful reviews they are a writer food and drink alas the young de identity will remain a mystery for quite some time but of course it not fleur mom congrats to lt200 yes that one of the beauties of the english language isntit but now without further ado on with the story chapter 6 the attack speechless harry was staring at the familiar form of dumbledore as he calmly and without any hurry bent low and stepped out of the fireplace carefully dusting his robes as he approached the dinner table good evening albus said tony and it was his quiet and matter of fact tone that brought harry back to his senses you you re wizards he jumped up from his chair and glared at tony and his sister and you never told me been laughing at stupid harry behind my back no doubt what the devil have you been playing at all the time calm down harry dumbledore said quietly while mrs figg put a soothing hand on his arm i can imagine this comes as quite some surprise you bet it does harry spat but he allowed himself to be gently pushed down on his chair and i believe we owe you an explanation dumbledore went on and it d better be a good one harry retorted still angry here i ve been slaving for my bloody relatives feeling the complete outsider and freak as every summer and now i find out that the place is swarming with magical people without me having any idea not quite harry dumbledore interrupted though i daresay it wontmake much of a difference to you tony here is a squib has been one since birth and arabella he stopped himself and turned to her perhaps you ll tell harry the story some other time maybe i not sure he wants to hear it at this moment you should rather tell him what been going on why we ve been playing this hide and seek game with him all these weeks years grumbled harry fourteen bloody years you are right fourteen years harry and dontbelieve i enjoyed it but i had to the dursleys would never have let you stay here if they had thought you liked it and moreover it would just not have done to let you grow up among muggles and knowing you were a wizard but why far from subsiding harry anger rose again i mean why make me spend a miserable life with my horrible relatives in the first place couldntyou find some wizarding family to look after me ah that where i must plead guilty dumbledore said quietly i canttell you everything right now but believe me it was for your own good oh how i hate that for my own good what good can these awful year have been let it be enough if i say that the house of your blood relatives was the only really safe place for you outside hogwarts and you know only too well dontyou that voldemort is doing whatever he can to finish the business he started fourteen years ago the point is in short that staying with your relatives was the only way to protect you but why have you suddenly decided to blow your precious cover you could have gone on like this for ages and i d never have been any wiser well as you yourself know better than anybody else the circumstances are different this year things have been happening that make a change in plans necessary what things have the death eaters been up to something i ve been watching out for reports on the muggle news but there was nothing extraordinary yes the headmaster said gravely it seems that there were a number of attempts but they are obviously not so well organised so nothing serious happened in the wizarding world they did attack some muggles though i believe they do it for sport or practice were there did they kill anybody do you remember a report about a car crash on the m 4 yes some twenty five cars crashed into each other i dontremember exactly there were a couple of deaths but how do you know it was death eaters what reason did the report give wait i believe they said something about unexpected thick fog appearing you dontmean to say it would seem very much like that yes but this is actually not the reason why i am here today no it something else and much more serious you remember how voldemort regained his body how could i ever forget it not that i ve not been trying believe me among other ingredients the headmaster went on your blood was essential in the proceedings now when you first told me about that i believed it was a good thing because it would link you to the dark lord and transfer some of his powers to you in fact i thought it was the very thing that would enable you to finally stand up to him however every good thing has its drawback too as i have gathered from various sources the most obvious consequence of you and him sharing the same blood will be that the blood protection of your relatives loses its effect quite unexpectedly for the headmaster harry face lit up at this but but this means this means there is no reason for me to stay with them any more you said so yourself the only reason was my protection and now yes harry dumbledore said gently and for the first time there was a smile in the headmaster face i have come to take you away to a safe place well as far as any place can be safe these days wow harry jumped up from his chair when do we start easy the headmaster smile deepened dontyou even want to know where i am taking you no and i dontcare any place is better than the dursleys just give me ten minutes hmm as much as i appreciate your cooperation harry there is no need for so much hurry why dontwe enjoy arabella excellent dinner now and afterwards the two of us will go and get everything ready and although harry was feeling quite impatient and could not concentrate on the admittedly wonderful dinner there was nothing to be done dumbledore seemed to have forgotten everything except the food on the plate in front of him disgusting margaux voice was full of revulsion and you think he would really have raped me fleur responded at which her friends winced i sure he would i could see it in his eyes yes i sure if i had been a normal muggle girl she shuddered at the memory shows what a stupid idiot he is too iphigenie said grinning he must have known you were not a normal muggle girl i suppose he did he must have known that any friend of harry wouldntbe normal i sure his parents told him so hundreds of times but when those hormones kick in i ve noticed that more than once seems it doesntneed the veela charm after all margaux mused not for muggles at any rate they were sitting in front of le chaudron decoulant a small cafe in montmartre just off sacre coeur enjoying their ice creams it was one of the typical paris summer evenings with the heat of the day slowly subsiding in the gathering dusk crowds of tourists were ambling past the few tables and chairs on the pavement but strangely enough none of them paid any attention to the people seated there although some of them were wearing rather strange clothes not even the elderly gentleman in the 19th century style attire complete with high and stiff white collar mauve cravat and embroidered waistcoat in green and gold seemed to attract any special attention the three girls however were not any different from the average teenagers margaux and iphigenie in jeans and t shirts while fleur aware of her effect on muggles in particular had put on a long flowing robe like dress its shiny emerald fabric however accentuated her magnificent hair in a way that rendered her attempts at being inconspicuous perfectly futile even several of the muggles who wandered by not really taking in anything stopped to look at her with a dreamy expression before walking on looking slightly dazed and when are you going to see him again margaux asked i dontknow this transformation is pretty exhausting to be honest but gran mere says it getting easier with practice so i guess i ll need all the practice i can get dontyou think how right you are margaux said grinning what does your mother say is she still so different from what you are used to iphigenie inquired fleur face darkened that what puzzles me she said slowly and thoughtfully she is still the kindest person you can imagine but it seems she is not really interested in anything i do grand mere told her about my new ability but she just didntreact she did say something like how nice for you dear but apart from that she has never mentioned it again and did you tell her about your your excursion to england to be honest i haven t fleur said somewhat shamefacedly it somehow never came up oh who am i fooling i just didntfeel like it i mean there are some things i just want to keep to myself so i suppose we should feel honoured you told us margaux put in and the conversation changed to a lighter tone in the meantime darkness had set in and the girls rose from their table let go up to the church margaux suggested i always love the view of the city by night and she took iphigenie hand intertwining her fingers with hers fleur looked on a feeling of envy and loneliness coursing through her iphigenie ever observant noticed gently she let go of margaux hand and linked her arm with the blond girl s margaux took fleur other arm no moping she said in a mock reproachful voice the evening much too beautiful for that come along it will take your mind off things so the three of them walked through the narrow street over to the park and the church on the hill overlooking the city of course the steps in front of the church were swarming with tourists and the flashes of the photographers were everywhere seems you are not the only one who loves paris by night fleur who had regained her composure said teasingly but it really is beautiful millions of muggles cantbe wrong they wandered off to the side looking for a place that was a little less crowded and finally sat down on a bench a couple of metres away from the masses but still with a good view of the city they sat there for some time each of them thinking thoughts of their own although the atmosphere of silent understanding between margaux and iphigenie was obvious enough so obvious in fact that fleur found she could not bear it i think i ll walk a bit she said to her friends rising from the bench i ll be back in a couple of minutes and she wandered off aimlessly through the park not quite aware of her surroundings the sudden freezing cold hit her like a hammer at the same time all the lights vanished and everything went completely dark even the noises around her stopped abruptly and there was nothing at all left total impenetrable silent bone chilling blackness the shock paralysed her momentarily and she stood motionless hardly breathing blindly gazing into the black void straining in vain to catch the faintest sound but there was nothing panic threatened to overcome her darkness had always been her primal fear and this here was darkness deeper than any she had ever experienced with an immense effort she summoned what was left of her strength and fumbled for her wand with a shaking hand just when her fingers closed on it there was the first sound a sound that made her long desperately for the silence again rasping hoarse breaths that were coming slowly nearer somewhere from the depths of her mind an image rose an image that she had forgotten ever since they had dealt with it in the defence against the dark arts lesson a dementor she whispered to herself gripping her wand tighter in quick succession half remembered fragments of information raced through her mind something happy think of something happy and she remembered herself with harry down by the river and she felt the cold recede and a tiny warm centre form inside her that started spreading slowly but surely lumos she said her voice more confident now and the dim glow from the tip of her wand shed a dismal light into the darkness she sensed more than she actually saw the towering black robed hooded creature skeletal scabbed hands stretching towards her and her courage faltered again the teachers in school had never considered dementors a real danger and had treated the subject in a rather theoratical way and so she could not remember apart from thinking happy thoughts what defences would work against them she raised her wand and used the first spell that came to her mind without thinking expelliarmus the red sparks were feeble and vanished shortly after they had left the tip of the wand the black shadow did not even seem to notice that something had happened the cold grew more intense again as fleur tried another spell inflammare she shouted waving her wand indeed a flame erupted from it and shot towards the dementor robe and for a moment it almost seemed as if the spell was successful in a couple of seconds however the creature with a careless sweep of its robes had extinguished the flames and slowly but purposefully glided on towards her positively panicking now fleur screamed wingardium leviosa if she had still been capable of thinking clearly she would never have used that spell in a situation like this it was one of the simplest weakest beginners spells not to be expected to be any use against this dark creature yet amazingly it was the first spell to have any effect at all on the horrible thing i was really lifted up into the air arms flailing about and it seemed as if this ridiculously weak spell would do the trick but of course it did not last after a second or two the dementor had regained control of its movements and more determined than ever glided towards fleur now only a couple of inches away from her harry i love you you are my happiest memory what happened now was so fast that in her panic fleur could follow the events clearly there was suddenly a blinding white light a dazzling bright form although she could not have said what it looked like that like a flash appeared between her and the dementor which with something like a furious shriek disappeared and as the stars and the city lights appeared again and the air was the mild summer evening air again and as margaux and iphigenie who had noticed something was happening although they had no idea what it was were rushing towards her through the oblivious crowds of tourists fleur fainted and collapsed on the gravel path a n i awfully sorry but i just have to leave you here as i have to go away on a skiing trip with school and believe me looking after a bunch of lively thirteen year olds is not exactly a holiday i afraid you cantexpect the next chapter earlier than in two weeks time at the earliest so dear friends patience is the order of the day a n hello my friends here i am again sorry for the delay but there was no way i could get any writing done on that ski trip you try it while being cooped up with a gang of fifty kids well spotted wingardium happened to work if only partially for the third time already can hardly be a coincidence right now without further ado here is chapter 7 links and connections harry from somewhere far away a voice was penetrating the mist that envelope his mind and again urgently harry what slowly the fog seemed to lift and the first sensation that impressed itself on him was the pain in his head harry wake up are you all right he had heard that voice before a female voice frightened and pressing with an effort he opened his eyes his vision was blurred at first and it took him some time to focus on the three faces bent over him it took him even longer to get his thoughts into the same focus and recognise them old mrs figg shock and fear clearly written in her face tony looking dazed and dumbledore whose eyes behind the half moon glasses were not twinkling for once but gazing at him with a worried expression only now he realised he was lying on the rug in the living room an overturned chair next to him as well as a broken plate with a groan he sat up clumsily and touched the back of his head and felt the bruise where apparently he had hit the floor harry how do you feel what happened donthurry him arabella dumbledore calm voice sounded he ll need some time to order his thoughts i imagine why dontyou sit down on the sofa harry tony suggested bending down to help him to his feet and leading him carefully over to it what what happened harry finally managed to ask his voice shaky well we were hoping you could tell us dumbledore replied and there was the tiniest sound of amusement back in his voice it like this tony told him matter of factly in the middle of a sentence you just went rigid stared as if you d seen a ghost and then bang collapsed on the floor upturning your chair which luckily missed hitting you over the head and then you were lying there not moving at all for a couple of minutes you did give us some shock i can tell you did your scar hurt harry dumbledore inquired what did you see or hear can you remember anything here drink this mrs figg handed him a glass it not actually a magic potion but it will help you sort out things nevertheless harry gratefully accepted and gulped down the contents in one large swallow which was a bit of a mistake what what that he finally managed to splutter out between coughs tears in his eyes almost magic she smiled at him dalwhinnie 18 years old really works wonders really arabella dumbledore said but he tried in vain to hide his amusement he only fifteen it wontkill him she replied dryly it not called water of life for nothing look there the colour returning to his face now harry do you think you can tell us how you experienced everything well harry said slowly trying to catch the elusive images and feelings in his mind i not sure it was this sounds ridiculous but but if i had to describe the feeling it was almost the sudden darkness and the cold yes absurd as it may seem but it was like like a dementor he stopped as if surprised by his own words and looked at the others wondering how they would react crazy i know he muttered you haventnoticed any dementors have you i must have been dreaming or something indeed we haventnoticed anything of the kind dumbledore nodded very strange indeed are you sure your scar didnthurt you mean did it have something to do with voldemort no it didn t and it doesntnow the only thing that hurts is that bump from the fall no it doesntseem to have anything to do with him that one good thing at least but dementors do you remember anything else you were in that state for some five minutes did anything happen sounds sights feelings as i said it was completely dark darker than any natural darkness dementor dark you see but i think i did hear something a scream a woman voice no not my mum he said seeing dumbledore expression i know that only too well someone else though now i think of it i believe i knew that voice too he paused thinking hard there arentso many women or girls whose voice would be familiar to me mrs weasley mcgonagall aunt petunia no the voice sounded younger ginny no hermione realisation suddenly hit him fleur yes it was her fleur a dementor attacked her he jumped up from the sofa quiet harry dumbledore put his hand on his shoulder to stop him even if she was and we have no way of knowing right now there is nothing we can do the only thing will be for you to remember as exactly as possible what happened how did you wake up again harry sat down reluctantly there was suddenly a blinding white light and the cold and dark vanished and then i heard you talking to me does that mean he looked at dumbledore hopefully the dark and cold vanished you say this does sound good it seems the dementor was chased away and the only thing that can chase away a dementor is a patronus this fits in with the white light well i guess she may have learned to do it in sixth year it cantbe that hard i mean i learned it in third year oh i so hope she safe i still dontunderstand it mrs figg said thoughtfully i mean how did it work for all we know the girl is back in france a thousand miles from here how could you possible feel whatever it was that happened are you quite sure it was her voice harry only nodded dumbly the more he thought of it the more certain he felt it had indeed been fleur screaming empathy arabella dumbledore mused you know a strong emotional connection especially intense in times of stress and danger it is not a gift that many people have but all the signs point to one such empathic bond between fleur and you harry it the only explanation unless of course you were just imagining things harry shook his head violently what is most surprising however dumbledore went on is the enormous power of this connection it quite out of the usual for the average teenage relationship to be that powerful i not asking out of curiosity harry but have you and fleur again harry shook his head energetically blushing violently and dumbledore did not finish his sentence which means that there must be something about the two of you that is very special something we have yet to find out i dontsuppose you have any idea harry fleur account of the prophecy about the scorpion sting crossed harry mind but it seemed too absurd to mention to dumbledore so he shook his head once again i ll send her an owl this very night he said finally i have to know if things happened like we believe they did or or if i just going nuts so i think i d better be going the dursleys will be mad at me as it is no dumbledore interjected quietly and harry was surprised at his expression the headmaster looked worried but at the same time there was an eager fire in his eyes that he had never seen there before i afraid it will not be possible for you to return to their house not even for the shortest of times in the light of these recent developments we just cannot take the risk no i will have to take you to headquarters right away headquarters patience harry you will see for yourself and i will give all the necessary explanations in due course i promise but but my things and hedwig your school things and everything else will be arranged for and as for your owl i think you know you can trust her to find you wherever you are now if you have recovered from your shock let leave xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx what hearing the apparating sounds vivienne looked up from the book she was reading and she could not believe her eyes margaux and iphigenie had just appeared in the mansion salon supporting the limp form of fleur between them the book dropped from her hands and she was up and beside the girls in a flash what she began again but her voice failed her together they laid fleur down on the sofa between the windows fleur was still unconscious her face very white a nasty scratch on her forehead where she had hit the ground her breath was shallow and irregular we dontreally know what happened margaux said breathlessly we were in the park of sacre coeur see and she said she wanted to go for a short walk we didntpay too much attention i afraid iphigenie put in blushing i guess we should and and the next thing was she had collapsed a couple of metres away and the muggles were already wondering so we rushed to her and picked her up and apparated here iphigenie finished will she be all right vivienne who had regained her composure looked at her granddaughter critically she doesntseem seriously hurt she said slowly yet she still unconscious obviously this must be something to do with magic enervate she said directing her wand at fleur slowly the spell began to show its effects gradually colour returned to fleur cheeks her breath steadied and her eyelids first fluttered and then opened her look unfocused first soon became clearer and at last she sat up looking around her wildly fleur cherie vivienne sat down next to her and put an arm round her shoulders how do you feel what happened i i dontknow she buried her head in her grandmother chest oh i thought i thought she could not finish the horrible experience was too fresh in her mind vivienne stroked her hair and held her tightly it all right she muttered softly you are home and you are safe from whatever it was she turned to the two girls who were standing next to her awkwardly their faces frightened go to the cabinet in the corner she told them and get me the decanter you find there and a glass too when margaux had dutifully fetched the potion vivienne measured out a small quantity into the glass and made fleur drink it after a convulsive shudder or two the girl relaxed visibly now cherie her grandmother said quietly when you are ready wontyou tell us what happened fleur took a deep breath de dementors she managed to say at last the others looked at her shocked and incredulous dementors but but they are far away in azkaban margaux said her eyes wide and they work for us what would a dementor be doing in the middle of paris are you sure fleur vivienne asked gently no yes i dontknow try to remember what did you feel see hear suddenly everything went dark and then there was that horrible cold i managed to light my wand you see and then then i saw it a huge hooded something gliding not walking and i heard that terrible rattling gasping breathing it was her voice faded away and she buried her face in her hands vivienne moved her hand up and down her back in soothing motions sounds like a dementor all right iphigenie said in a whisper what did you do i was in a panic i didntreally know what i was doing i think i tried a couple of idiotically simple spells and of course none of them worked can you believe it i even did wingardium funny enough it even seemed to work for a second or two but wingardium leviosa vivienne interjected yes silly of me i know why are you asking no matter we ll talk about that later what happened next i not sure i recalled about thinking happy thoughts but of course it was next to impossible in my state of mind and i believe i shouted harry name and then there was a sudden white light and i think i saw some kind of animal a horse or something that attacked the dementor i not sure everything was so fast i may have imagined it a patronus iphigenie said excitedly nothing else helps against a dementor but i cantdo a patronus fleur said numbly you know i can t you never learn it at school they only teach us the theory because they claim that dementors are basically harmless vivienne remarked grimly just going after the bad guys well it seems there is a lesson the authorities still have to learn but then where did that patronus come from only very powerful and accomplished magic can produce one do you know anybody whose it could have been the girls looked at her blankly without answering i wish i knew fleur muttered whoever it was saved my life there in the park she sat quietly for some time lost in thought dontask me why she said finally but i somehow i have a feeling it something to do with harry i seem to remember a rumour in hogwarts they said he dealt with dementors in his third year and it is said that he learned to do a patronus too harry in third year how did he do it a thirteen year old boy doing magic of the most advanced sort i know i know but this is what people said and from what i have seen him do i can believe it too impossible as it may seem to you but you dontknow harry potter there something about him well i expect it just as good an explanation as any other vivienne stated everything seems completely impossible dementors in the middle of paris a patronus out of nowhere why shouldntit be possible for harry potter to save you over a distance of a thousand kilometres far more important though iphigenie ever practical put in what a dementor business in muggle paris and still more important was it an accident or or did it go for me on purpose i suppose that what i meant iphigenie voice was very quiet i ll see the minister herself first thing next morning vivienne said grimly and she d better have a good sound explanation for me too seems they must keep a closer watch on those creatures movements dementors at sacre coeur what will it be next dragons on the top of the eiffel tower do you know i not sure i d not prefer the dragons ah ma cherie that the spirit see you re smiling again now dontyou think you d better go to bed and try to sleep it off we ll stay with you for the night if you like margaux offered fleur accepted gratefully and the three girls withdrew to fleur room of course gabrielle had woken up and had to be told everything too which took some time especially as she had not heard of dementors before she found it hard to imagine such creatures really existed but what are they she kept asking where do they come from nobody knows they told her some learned wizards believe that they are the accumulated fears and sorrows of generations of humans that have taken on a visible form but it only a theory and it isntreally important is it wizards have employed them as prison guards at azkaban how can they employ such awful creatures you say there is almost no protection against them isntit dangerous apparently margaux said dryly if what happened to fleur is any example gabrielle was not too surprised when she heard about the idea that somehow harry potter had been able to save her sister even if he was back in england all the time why shouldntit have been like that harry is special he can do loads of things nobody else can i sure of that why dontyou owl him right away and ask him if anything strange has been happening to him you are such a clever little girl gabie fleur said fondly yes i ll do exactly that but i really have to rest first just dontlet me fall asleep with these words she dropped down on her bed and was fast asleep before her head even touched the pillow just let her sleep it off margaux said she ll need it and tomorrow still another day xxxxxxxxxxx what happened voldemort voice although still cold rose the death eater in front of him took a hasty step back i cannot explain it my lord he said his voice shaking in spite of himself he knew only too well how much his master hated any sign of weakness but it must have been a patronus nothing else works against dementors tell me something new fool voldemort hissed impatiently what exactly happened as you instructed me my lord i was monitoring their every movement and when she left the others and walked away from them i judged the time had come so i set the dementor on her using the spell you so generously taught me stop dithering how did she react she could resist for a very short time in fact she even managed to light her wand but then she must have panicked she tried a few ridiculously simple and of course quite useless spells it was quite amusing seeing that voldemort was not amused at all the death eater returned to a serious tone of voice hurriedly and continued anyway the dementor was coming nearer and was just about to he stopped himself but not quickly enough about to what came the cold voice and the menace was almost tangible she was only to be frightened are you telling me the dementor was going to really kiss her no master the frightened death eater screamed even as the curse hit him and sent him writhing to the floor incompetent idiot voldemort said placidly watching the convulsions of his servant for a minute before lifting the curse rise and thank your stars that she did not come to any harm and donttell me he added as an afterthought that you had everything under control and would have stopped the dementor in time never lie to lord voldemort on with your report now yes my lord the death eater did not dare to wipe the sweat from his face just before i just before the dementor had reached her the the patronus appeared blinding white light an animal shape charging the dementor which vanishes all the signs are there can she have conjured it no master i am perfectly sure of that if you had seen her yourself all those absurd spells impossible and she would not have fainted if it had been her spellwork no i suppose not could you see what shape the animal was it was all so very quick master horse like and i believe it had antlers yes i am almost sure of it a stag a stag the dark lord voice was more a shriek than articulate speech as he half rose from his chair the death eater horrified crouched down at his feet yes yes master what does it mean master nothing it seems the plan was successful this is what matters keep your eyes open and do not let me find you blundering again it is vital that she be sent to hogwarts in september a n now if you find the time how about some guesses why would it be so important for old voldie to have fleur at hogwarts although i repeating myself sorry for the delay but things just happen for those who dontknow yet i not jkr and so i dontown anything except perhaps this bloody computer that keeps mocking me i just borrowing her characters to make them do what i want them to do thank you all for those wonderful reviews i ll do my humble best to live up to them ok so here goes chapter 8 reactions dear fleur are you all right there are such a lot of things i have to tell you but they are all ridiculously unimportant compared to this one question but perhaps you have no idea what i talking about and i just getting nuts and am imagining things so i guess i ll check myself and begin at the beginning never mind where and how but i had this frightening vision or dream or whatever it was you were attacked by a dementor i heard you scream yes i sure it was your voice it was all there the cold and the darkness everything donti know about dementors those horrible things and then suddenly the bright white light you conjured a patronus didntyou i do so hope you are safe i counting the minutes until i hear from you until i hear from you that might be the catch because this is my other piece of news dumbledore has been talking to me and guess what he told me apparently because voldemort has my blood in him now the spells and wards that have protected me at the dursleys house all these years are no good any more and so they are taking me to some secret headquarters for more safety and of course this safety requires that nobody not even me knows where i going it only been with some difficulty that they would even let me write this letter to you before leaving so i would not be surprised if your owl had problems finding me do you know i almost wish i could stay with the dursleys i know it sounds crazy a couple of hours ago i d have given anything to get away from them but now just imagine they even insist on reading this letter before i send hedwig away with it i terribly worried about you fleur just let me know if you are all right i dontknow what i d do if i lost you all my love harry ps written by albus dumbledore my dear mademoiselle delacour i also sincerely hope this letter finds you well as harry says we have to take him to a safe place urgently and lines of communications may become difficult therefore it is probably wise to send your reply directly with harry owl she will know where to find him owls as you will be aware of have their own ways of finding their addressees just kindly remember not to mention any names in your correspondence and just to tell the owl who to go to do not write the name of the recipient on the envelope we will try to contact you again as soon as possible the whole incident is highly mysterious and it seems to be of the utmost expedience to investigate it my best regards also to your esteemed grandmother a d i knew it fleur exclaimed enthusiastically i was sure harry had something to do with it so it was him who saved me and over a distance of more than a thousand kilometres so it seems cherie vivienne said gently and you know what that means dontyou no what just think of it what would it need for him to be able to do a thing like that i dontknow perhaps no you are saying she jumped up from her bed where she had been reading the letter her eyes shining yes dear only a very strong emotional connection between the two of you can have made it possible in other words his love for me and yours for him these things work both ways dontyou forget this suddenly her voice took on a serious tone and of course this means that prophecy must not be taken lightly oh grandma i ve never thought much of it before but now there must be a lot more behind it than we can imagine if we only knew more unfortunately that exactly the nature of a prophecy i have often wondered why they cantjust state things in a simple and easy to understand way half the ancient greek tragedies wouldnthave happened some weird kind of humour if you ask me whatever of course i ll have to write to him at once to stop him worrying hedwig seems to be getting impatient already indeed the snowy owl who was sitting on the dresser was ruffling her feathers and clicking her beak in an unmistakeable manner i wonder if i transformed again fleur said looking at hedwig dreamily you mean you could follow her to harry like you did the other day donteven think of it why fleur pulled a petulant face one you are still too exhausted after your encounter with the dementor you know yourself how exacting the transformation is and it would be far too dangerous in your present state two dumbledore says that harry is in a secret and secure place when he says secure he means secure and i am perfectly certain that you would not be able to approach it and finally it might be even more dangerous if you could get to that place because for all you know you might be watched and followed indeed you could lead vous savez quis directly to harry and i dontthink you d want that of course not fleur sounded quite deflated you re right as usual so as for that letter after the letter had been duly written and dispatched fleur turned to her grandmother again i had no idea you knew dumbledore she began vivienne smiled yes i remember him well we met at an international peace conference after the defeat of grindelwald some fifty years ago he advocated equal rights for non human magical creature very fervently you know like house elves centaurs even werewolves and veela of course in the situation shortly after grindelwald defeat the magical community seemed to be possessed by very strong good will and they accepted a lot of his propositions oh i admired him a good deal not only was he so open minded and positive in his attitudes he was also great fun to talk to grandma i do believe you are blushing well i may have had the tiniest little crush on him i wontdeny it vivienne replied dreamily your grandfather had been dead some seven years and i did feel a bit lonely but it wouldnthave been any good of course she finished resolutely why oh imagine he the greatest wizard of the time world famous vanquisher of evil do you think he d have had the mind for but grandma you could have made him notice you i could have naturally and i almost did but it would have been wrong wouldntit it would have made both of us miserable you know that dontyou of course i know grandma fleur said quietly it just would have been so so nice i sure it would cherie i sure of that yvonne sangfroid the french minister of magic looked up from her desk when she heard the plopping noise of a person apparating ah vivienne she said trying in vain to sound pleasantly surprised it always so nice to see you but no pleasantries if you please vivienne tone was brisk and businesslike but with a hint of anger i want to know what dementors are doing in the middle of paris what i have no idea what you are talking about do you know it wouldnteven surprise me the sarcasm was thick like honey my granddaughter was attacked by a dementor yesterday evening in the park of sacre coeur and i want to know what the ministry has got to say to that attacked by a dementor are you sure no she is all right she escaped thank you for asking the anger was more distinct now what is the ministry comment there there must be some error some mistake who knows what that girl saw or heard or whatever the minister was starting to regain her composure dementors in paris what nonsense they are guarding azkaban everybody knows that the ministry has full control of them we would know if one of them no absolutely impossible so my granddaughter is a liar the steely edge in vivienne voice was glinting dangerously what the minister voice wavered slightly no of course not not a liar but you know what young people are like highly imaginative distracted in love they will be sure something really happens while it just her voice faltered away when she caught vivienne eye i can judge that for myself thank you very much i just want you to look into that dementor business it shouldntbe too difficult to find out if all of them are where they belong and if they have ever left their stations in the last 24 hours i dontthink this is asking too much and when only when you can prove that nothing out of the ordinary has happened then i ll start considering different explanations can and will you do that i still dontsee why this should be necessary how can you take such a ridiculous idea seriously it was only with some difficulty that vivienne could restrain herself from transforming into a harpy i ll tell you how i can now that vous savez quis is back one has to be prepared for the worst the minister drew herself up to her full height which unfortunately still fell about one head short of the veela s ah that what it is is it my dear vivienne i can assure you there nothing in that absurd notion i ve been talking to minister fudge from britain and he predicted there would be some rumours like that but he is quite certain that there is absolutely nothing in it but he did tell you what happened at the tournament didnthe of course an unfortunate accident nothing more and nothing less and he said he didntblame the potter boy for getting these strange ideas difficult mental condition and all but he is perfectly sure that the idea of vous savez quis back is completely preposterous how ever could you even begin to think of it as an explanation to what happened to your granddaughter my granddaughter was there she saw it happen my dear yvonne and i a thousand times more willing to believe her than that pompous old fool who calls himself minister of magic fleur told me he would try to ignore the whole thing as long as he can and i see he is doing a very good job of it so i understand you wontdo a check on all the dementors in the ministry employment i would love to vivienne just to show to you that there is absolutely nothing in this absurd idea of yours but there are so many things to be done you know like a conference of the european wizarding community on regulating cauldron sizes i expect oh i see i just wasting my time good day and unable to restrain her anger any longer she gave in to the strong urge and transformed into a harpy and with a deafening shriek flew out of the open window margaux and iphigenie had got up late exhausted after the terrifying events in the parc sacre coeur now they were having breakfast on the tiny balcony of their flat up on the fifth floor of the picturesque house near pere lachaise it seems so absurd looking at this gorgeous day what happened yesterday dontyou think margaux mused sleepily yes it hard to believe it really happened iphigenie agreed you dontthink she imagined it all well she fainted seriously enough so something must have been wrong with her obviously but a dementor hmm i guess whatever it was was harmful for her even if it wasntreally a dementor something meant to hurt her so much is for sure do you think it s it something to do with you know what happened at the tournament vous savez qui we cantknow but i think there quite a strong possibility hey what that with a soft swish of feathery wings a large colourful bird was fast approaching their tiny table and presently a rainbow coloured envelope was dropped onto margaux plate with another swish of feathers the bird a parrot as they could see now was gone margaux eyes lit up it from bellesfringues she exclaimed excitedly grabbing the letter oh i so nervous will they have those jobs for us do you think there only one way to find out iphigenie told her pretending to remain cool but the sparkle in her eyes giving her away hurriedly margaux opened the envelope and glanced at the equally rainbow coloured letter with a loud whoop she jumped up from her chair yes yes we re in listen dear mlles bellefontaine and durberville blabla happy to inform you that we can offer you two positions as assistant sales managers starting september first as we understand you have some experience abroad that ridiculous isntit we were in scotland for a couple of months can you call that experience abroad you will be appointed to our newly established branch in she broke off suddenly what iphigenie inquired i dontbelieve it listen i am listening but you arentreading listen newly established branch in hogsmeade great britain no yes look and she handed her friend the letter aghast iphigenie took the letter but of course margaux had read correctly d you think we should she asked hesitantly handing the letter back are you joking bellesfringues are one of the most famous wizarding fashion establishments in europe if not the entire world and we ll get the chance to build up a completely new store do you know how often a chance like this will come our way i ll tell you once in a lifetime no we d be criminally stupid to reject an offer like this oh boy will fleur be jealous iphigenie face clouded over but but how will she take it we re her friends no we re about her only fiends can we just leave her here who will look after her to margaux credit her exuberance paled somewhat you re right of course it will be a bit hard on her but then think of it she ll start school in september and will be off at beauxbatons anyway where we cannot be with her so i dontthink it will make all that much of a difference moreover here her grin was back in place again we can send her invitations to visit us for the holidays and i d like to see her mother stop her from coming well if you put it like this iphigenie still sounded a bit doubtful but margaux grabbed both her hands pulled her up from her chair causing the cups and saucers to rock dangerously and started to waltz through the living room with her infected by her girlfriend enthusiasm iphigenie relented but you will tell fleur wontyou she said breathlessly when they came to a standstill after a couple of minutes yes i will dontworry cherie margaux reassured her and planted a firm kiss on her lips whatever it takes to make you happy fleur ma petite how are you feeling fleur who after sending hedwig off with a few reassuring lines to harry had drifted off to sleep again woke slowly to the soft voice of her mother how are you feeling isabeau repeated putting her hand lightly on fleur head how horrible for you i hurried back from paris as soon as i heard what had happened oh my what the world is coming to not safe in our own town any more have you recovered a bit already fleur although she was still vaguely wondering about her mother behaviour was too tired to think clearly i dontknow she whispered allowing herself to relax against her mother soft touch donttalk isabeau muttered in a soothing tone i ve heard more than enough and i not going to have my daughter exposed to any dangers if i can help it so i thought i d just tell you my decision right now you are not going back to beauxbatons this year but maman fleur was suddenly a lot more awake than a minute ago i must finish my education i cantjust drop out of school who saying that her mother smiled i would never think of anything like that no of course you must finish school but i intend to send you some place where you will be safe safer than at beauxbatons at any rate where fleur asked anxiously yes dear you will do your last year at a different school i know you d rather stay with your friends and it always difficult to adapt to new surroundings and people but then you wontbe a complete stranger to the place can she really mean what i think she means fleur stared at her mother in complete surprise you mean you re not talking about but i am dear i talking about hogwarts they say it the safest school in all europe if not the entire world and the most prestigious to boot yes you are going to do your final year there and take your exams but madame maxime she wontlike it of course you re one of her best students after all but i will deal with her and i expect there will be no problem with the hogwarts headmaster either all doubts and suspicions fell from fleur mind she threw her arms round her mother neck something she had not done for years and started sobbing on her shoulder i understand you dontlike it isabeau said to her but it but maman you dontunderstand it wonderful i never dreamed something like this would happen oh i so happy i ll be able to see harry all the time isabeau said nothing but kept stroking her daughter back a n again i awfully sorry for taking so long with this but there been another attack of so called rl annoying how much time this takes that one would much rather use writing anyway here is the next piece nothing really going on this time to be honest the problem with this kind of thing is of course that i am drawing on things as described in oop but have an au story going you ll have noticed there are no dementors attacking harry here and there will be other differences naturally also i dontwant to bore readers with descriptions they already know although they are important to keep this fic well rounded i hope i have found an acceptable way to do this the next chapter will be about fleur end of the story again keep your fingers crossed that it doesnttake so long again chapter 9 the black house plop clinging to dumbledore robes harry found himself in what seemed to be a damp cellar of sorts and plop they were in the crypt of a church plop and the place was a deep black possibly a cave with water dripping in the distance with a final plop they came to a halt in a corridor with black wood panelling and a threadbare carpet on the floor dimly lit by a huge candelabrum which had only a small number of candles in it the whole place had an aura of shabbiness about it as if it had not been lived in for a long time harry who was not accustomed to apparating felt quite dizzy and if dumbledore had not stopped him he would probably have collapsed where he began but there was a huge crash in the back of the corridor and an enormous shaggy black dog came rushing at him barking madly when the animal had reached harry it jumped up at him trying to lick his face and almost pushing him over in the process it took harry a second or two to gather his wits sirius he could not quite believe it but a look at dumbledore smiling face reassured him sirius he shouted again presently the dog transformed into harry godfather sirius black welcome harry he said beaming at him it so good to have you here and he enveloped harry in an enormous hug that he could almost feel his bones creak i must apologize for the state of this house sirius added after a while i mean it my family home has been for generations actually and look at it horrible if it any excuse i was in no position to look after it properly for quite a couple of years harry who knew only too well what his godfather was talking about said nothing but only gave his hand a reassuring squeeze his eyes however betrayed the swirl of emotions that was rushing through him welcome at the headquarters of the order of the phoenix harry dumbledore said quietly smiling at the two affectionately order of what you ll learn about it in due course harry sirius said putting a heavy arm on his godson shoulder but i expect you will be a bit tired and confused after all that apparating so why dontyou come along and rest while we are having a nice long talk about all the things you want to know and i expect there will be rather a lot of them too he added you re right i guess harry muttered still not quite able to form a continuous train of thoughts why did we have to do all that anyway i mean what was it all about those many different stops in all those weird places to make sure we were not being followed of course dumbledore remarked mildly if as we were quite certain you were being watched we had to hide our tracks very carefully all those places were protected you see and it as good as impossible that any spies could keep up with our movements but sirius is perfectly right why dontwe all sit down comfortably and talk everything over we all why of course there are quite a lot of people waiting for you harry not my friends ron hermione just wait one more minute harry this way please and putting his arm round harry shoulder he steered him towards the dark staircase in the back of the corridor that was leading upstairs up the creaking stairs they went and arrived on the first floor the impression of shabbiness was even stronger here the wallpaper was coming off in several places and the large mirror between the two black oaken doors was blind and encrusted in cobwebs through the one window at the end of the corridor harry could see it was already dark outside over here sirius said opening one of the doors and ushering harry inside before he had even time to look around he felt himself enveloped in another huge hug but the fact that it was two people kept him from losing his balance this time harry squealed hermione voice and hi mate came ron s more slowly when they let him finally go harry could breathe again hi folks he said grinning at them somewhat sheepishly only now he found the time to look at his surroundings like everything in the house this room was dark and rather shabby although it seemed that some intensive cleaning had been going on recently the floor was shining and the curtains in front of the high windows looked new there was a huge massive table in the centre of the room surrounded by a number of high backed chairs a bulky room high buffet intrinsically carved and with stained glass doors filled the far wall and a faded tapestry was on his right some people were sitting at the table but harry share of hugs for the evening was not over yet welcome harry said molly weasley beaming at him and enveloping him in a warm motherly embrace it so good to see you hello harry arthur weasley shook his hand energetically and behind their father fred and george were grinning at him broadly have a seat harry said dumbledore steering him towards the table still rather confused harry sat down noticing vaguely that the high backed chair was hard and rather uncomfortable there was the sound of chairs being moved while the weasleys and hermione took seats too and finally dumbledore himself sat down next to him silence descended on the room and harry could at last have a look at the other people present he flinched involuntarily at the sight of moody remembering only too well the impostor who had almost killed him only a couple of weeks ago and he smiled at remus lupin but apart from these he saw no familiar faces welcome once again harry dumbledore said finally perhaps i should start with introductions some time later when he was lying in bed in an upstairs room listening to ron snoring from the bed on the other side harry was trying in vain to go to sleep too many things had happened since he had entered mrs figg house how long ago had it been he had lost all sense of time what with his mysterious vision of fleur being attacked by the dementor and the long and complicated apparating tour that dumbledore had taken him on could it really be only a couple of hours it must be as it was still dark outside the high window through which the yellow light of some street lamps was dimly shining the order of the phoenix harry muttered to himself who were all those people there had been moody of course and harry could still not help a shiver of apprehension thinking of the old auror scarred and mutilated face then lupin whom harry had been especially happy to see remembering how helpful and kind he had been to him and best of all sirius harry smiled to himself as he remembered how embarrassed his godfather had been because of the state of his house how he had apologised repeatedly for the dirt and griminess of the place but of course it not your fault sirius harry had told him you were away on business you couldnthave possibly looked after it could you but i ve been back for more than a year and look at all of it still you were away for how long eleven years twelve you cantpossibly make up for all those years in such a short time he had seen molly weasley looking grim at his words but she did not say anything apart from these three and the weasleys of course harry had never seen any of the order members before and a curious assortment they were indeed most prominent there was a very large black man whose name however harry could not recall something with king in it as far as he remembered then the most unlikely of all a wizard of unkempt grimy appearance who had kept smoking a pipe of something that as harry recalled very clearly smelled like a mixture of damp seaweed and horse manure and who as harry remembered with a grin was called dung by everybody but did not seem to mind finally and again harry smiled in remembrance that weird young woman in her early twenties probably who had been changing the colour of her hair and the size of her nose constantly nymphadora tonks dumbledore had introduced her at which she had pulled a face quite literally as mouth had grown twice as large and her lips had contorted into an absolutely unnatural put and retorted shortly tonks just tonks if you please nymph i mean tonks is a metamorphmagus dumbledore had explained seeing harry expression meta what metamorphmagus harry she can change her outward appearance at will just give him a demonstration n tonks will you and tonks smiling at harry broadly complied and changed her short sandy coloured hair into a long purple mane in an instant which had impressed harry a good deal it what every girl dreams of really tonks said with a mischievous grin all these are members of what we call the order of the phoenix harry dumbledore had said indicating the large table with a sweeping gesture and there are many more who have not been able to be here today we have dedicated ourselves to the fight against voldemort and as you are his most dangerous and endangered enemy it is only fit you should be introduced to it as well we dontusually admit members that are still underage remus said with an apologetic smile it dangerous too dangerous for inexperienced youngsters but seeing as you can hardly be in any more danger than you are already we thought we d make an exception sirius had seconded after these preliminaries harry had been made to tell everybody about his vision or whatever it was of the dementor attacking fleur they had all listened with interest but nobody had ventured any comment when harry finished if i only knew what to think of it he had said at last it drives me nuts really not to know you have done what you could dumbledore said gently and you know that even owls of very strong magic like hedwig need some time but i should expect her back pretty soon now there had not been anything harry could say to that and after a late night snack served by molly weasley which harry did not feel like taking at all but pretended to out of politeness he and ron had climbed the ill lit stairs to the room they were to share where ron had fallen asleep instantly just as after all the excitement harry was dropping off to sleep he heard the familiar tapping of hedwig beak at the window suddenly wide awake he rushed over to open it trying to make as little noise as possible he could have saved himself the trouble nothing short of a trumpeting elephant would ever wake ron once he was asleep hey girl he said softly as the snowy owl alighted on his arm you are fast to france and back just in these few hours let see what you ve got the letter had no address on it it was an inconspicuous pale blue envelope but the familiar faint scent of lilacs came from it causing him to smile this must be from her he said to himself and opened the envelope eagerly my dear friend as you know i cannot write much but i can tell you at least that you do not have to worry about me yes what you saw was true but it was not i who solved the problem i have no idea how or why but i am absolutely sure it was you i am at home now safe and more or less sound too just exhausted as i have been told not to say anything specific i will finish now until a better occasion arises i just too weak o think clearly now but i can still think clearly enough to know that i love you forever f with a huge sigh of pure relief harry put the letter on his bedside table she ok hedwig he said stroking the owl feathers she fine and when his head touched the pillow this time he fell asleep instantly it seemed only minutes when he felt himself shaken harry wake up time for breakfast leave me alone dud he muttered but then he started to wonder dudley would never speak to him in that friendly voice slowly he realised it was ron voice as he opened his eyes he saw the sun shining in through the grimy windows after another few seconds he remembered what had happened and where he was ron had already put his clothes on and was shaking him vigorously breakfast time he repeated trust you to have food as a motivation for standing up harry teased as he got out of bed and pulled on the jeans and t shirt he had been wearing when he arrived there not much else to do in this place is there how right you are mate ron said and there was a note of tiredness in his voice i almost glad mom assigned me to the cleaning squad what the cleaning squad she sure to make you take part too but wait until she tells you ron led the way to the basement where most of the people from the previous evening were sitting around the huge able which was full of all the assorted glories of the english breakfast when the two of them entered everybody rose and at a sign from dumbledore they started singing happy birthday to you speechless harry stood there while everybody started to rush towards him sirius was first harry he said and his voice sounded choked i wish you a very happy birthday i ve been waiting for this for so long he trailed off and hid his emotions in a crushing hug after sirius the others shook his hands or gave him hugs molly with tears in her eyes ron with an awkward pat on the back and ginny blushing furiously which reminded harry of her valentine card in second year and made him smile after the commotion had died down harry cleared his throat feeling he was expected to say something thank you all he said uncertainly this is great i mean this is absolutely the best birthday i ve ever had i never knew there were so many people that liked me well thank you and he sat down at the table and starting helping himself to the bacon and tomatoes to hide his embarrassment after breakfast arthur weasley accio d harry presents into he kitchen and he spent the next one hour and a half opening them and sorting through the growing pile of chocolate frogs every flavour beans and other sweets a chudley cannons shawl and cap as well as a study guide and homework planner i know who that is from and some mysterious boxes that he treated with delicate care knowing they were from the weasley twins after this delightful job he took all the presents up to his room he was just sitting down on his bed when the door opened and mrs weasley entered ron hermione and ginny in tow when he saw that she and the girls were wearing aprons and had their hair tied back with scarves and noticed the bucket and broom ron was carrying with an apologetic grin he remembered the cleaning squad harry dear began molly weasley and she had the decency to look embarrassed we thought seeing as you have nothing to do right now perhaps you d want to help us she means corrected ron that she thought why shouldntyou do some sensible work now you are here and could help clean up this dump ok said harry not too unhappy to get something to do to take his mind off things where do we start the next couple of hours passed in a flurry of sweeping dusting and polishing with mrs weasley continuously grumbling about that impossible house elf that should be given clothes right away accompanied by hermione reproachful looks at which harry and ron would exchange smirks of their own but mrs weasley harry asked i thought you could just use magic for this i mean why dontyou just wave your wand say scourgify or something and everything is as good as new but it seemed there were ancient spells at work that inhibited the use of magic or even prevented it altogether at any rate they had to do most of their tasks they non magical way using soap and hot water at least they could keep the water magically hot in the course of activities harry learned that the house was in one of the shabbier parts of london one that had seen better times a hundred years a go he heard that it was the ancient family home of the black family and that it had been empty during all the years sirius had been in azkaban and that useless house elf apparently did not do a single thing all that time molly complained once again really if i had my way by noon they had finished giving ron and harry room a thorough work over that left molly finally satisfied time for lunch she exclaimed brightly and vanished the last bucket of dirty water together with the heap of dirty dusters isntit a lovely feeling to have accomplished something worth doing and to have earned your lunch ron and harry exchanged another look but said nothing
