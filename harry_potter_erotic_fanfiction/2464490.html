oliver is always over here atleast once a week but never never this early in the morning arentyou gonna make yourself more decent i looked down at my clothes i was wearing a shirt that said partiots on it a pair of jeans and a pair of black all star converse i was in the middle of putting my hair in a loose bun what wrong with it i asked skeptically well number 1 your shirt has a quidditch team on it smarty the patriots are also an american football team so there i walked over to the door taking my dairy out of his hands on my way i suppose you re staying for breakfast of course he says walking over next to me and following my downstairs to have breakfast so lets recap 1 i get woken up by none other than my captain who was two inches from my face 2 my captain criticized my clothes and showed no common sense in american football 3 my captain is now being a pill and reading over my shoulder 4 and yes my captain is a freaking kilt wearing scottish son of a bitch so there oliver 12 02 as usual we made on the hogwarts express and as usual i sitting with oliver fred and george maybe alicia and angelina will come and save me george read that particular line over my shoulder hey i shrugged my shoulders true enough if you dontlike it dontread it what did she say about you oliver asked from my right that maybe alicia will save her from us better than me he said as i shot him a look apparently i a freaking kilt wearing scottish son of a bitch captain the twins looked across from me in mock insult katie fred had a hand over his heart and george pretended to faint and so i promptly threw you diary at him sorry but it was the only thing in reach of course george and fred started to read it and gasped at the naughty trick i un rightly pulled on my dear sweet mother or so how they put it eh no worries they mean well sometimes i think oliver does too strange hu please no flames first time doing a dairy sort of story so please be kind words of wisdom are greatly accepted hey guys sorry it been a while but the 11th was my birthday and so over the weekend my family came over and we went to the beach and stuff because you know it my birthday and everyone has to succumb to my wishes or so i would like oh and i started a new story i know i know i will finish this one dontworry but i have no clue if it good or not so when you re done reading this one go onto my profile and click on puddlemere united yes that the title yes i know i original november 29 saturday 9 am haha haha 1 more hour just one more hour oh i cantwait later hogsmeade is the only good and pure thing about hogwarts i mean really they let us go into a town where there is a huge candy shop the ultimate pranking store and a haunted house honestly what other school would let their students do that and i got oliver the perfect gift i mean the perfect gift which i not going to say incase some one is going to read this book so take that fred and george and it was snowing there so of course we eventually had a snowball fight i wouldntbe surprised if someone thought we were first years angelina said as we sat down in the three broomsticks we were practically dripping wet but luckily we remembered that drying charm ok maybe it was alicia who remembered but that eventually filters to me so i know it too good times as first years though fred said as he took a sip of butter beer his eyes glazing over we were so innocent george added we nearly spit out our butter beer you two were never innocent oliver said oh but we were fred rebutted until we stole the marauders map too bad we gave it to harry george trailed what half of the people stared at me i thought we were next in line for that i motioned to alicia and angelina well harry needed it more fred took another sip of butter beer angelina snorted since when have you been so righteous the twins just shrugged their shoulders all of the sudden the warm and cozy pub went cold and silent and our warm butter beers turned cold we looked out the window we were sitting next to and outside two dementors hovered past there are dementors in hogsmeade alicia asked softly and george put a comforting arm around her shoulders i guess they re looking for black here too oliver said still starring out the window i hate those damn things november 31 tuesday 9 pm perfect that is my gift in a nutshell perfect anyway as soon as classes were over we went and got changed then took that secret passage to honeyduke cellar and then made our way to the three broomsticks where we celebrated fred and george sang their rendition of happy birthday while the rest of us continuously were popping party poppers i got this long green elf hat hey it better than what alicia and angelina got alicia got this really corny wizards hat and angelina got a stuffed vulture on a purple bonnet hehe hehe hmmm i could get used to this fred said looking up at his ring leader hat it was about two feet too high ok one more round of butter beer on me george said and then presents so we all dished out or presents here george said giving oliver a package that looked suspiciously like a broom i swear if oliver thought that we would really get him a broom i would crack up hysterically but so it happens it was a broom or a children broom you know the kind that only fly two feet off the ground but george added a little touch and scribbled firebolt on the side oliver starred at his new firebolt and cracked up laughing like everyone else i whipped a tear of laughter out of my eye will you ever let me live that down i asked as oliver opened fred gift a second hand beater bat and a muggle ball that has bludger written on it in permanent marker everyone in the pub was starring at us we were laughing so loud angelina got oliver a navy blue tee shirt that said captain on the front and i said fly not fall off on the back oh boy was that dead on and alicia got him a gag agenda book that said things like practice practice harass team practice special midnight practice new no eating diet for team sit on fat ass on the ground and shout untrue insults at hard working team and other such things that oliver had already accomplished over the past week and me i gave him a quidditch team our quidditch team no i did not give him the deeds to our soul i got him this miniature wooden team that i charmed in our likeness the little fred and george were back sassing angelina and alicia and the little me was yelling at little oliver and little harry was watching us go at it eventually the little oliver yelled at all of us to get back on our brooms and the little us did we watched the little us fly around the pub laughing hysterically eventually the little me sent a bludger flying at little oliver and thankfully missed this time and little oliver yelled at little me some more i donthave to feed them do i oliver asked laughing while he gave me a friendly hug no i answered and he pulled away just take your anger out on them and not at us amen the rest of the team chorused yes i know it was short but dontworry i have this huge idea for the next chp and i already have it on paper but i have to type it up i ll be back remember go read my other fanfic i need to know if it good yay i ve finally updated it might ve taken like years but i finally updated everybody yay ok ok i ll start yay oh while i was reading hbp i realized that katie was a year younger than alicia and everybody and for my fanfic sake we re going to pretend that j k rowling never mentioned that december 8 friday 9 pm i came out of transfig knowing i had just failed the double period test and i was heading back to the common room katie i turned around and there was oliver making his way through the crowd normally i dontsee him in the hall unless i going to charms every other day katie he had finally made his way over to me he held me roughly by the elbow rattling me a bit meet me at the pitch in 30 minutes he whispered in my ear roughly before rushing down the stairs ok i called to his back what was i going to tell him no he my captain for christ sake i couldntsay no but i should ve realized something was wrong 1 oliver never calls a last minute practice 2 he was walking all weird and hunched over oliver is like almost 6 feet tall and never tried to look shorter 3 he never grabbed me so roughly he rarely touches me at all and when he does it only when i a guiding hand or a hug 4 he was moving all rigid and awkward i ve been on the same team as him for the past four years his movements are always fluid and smooth he a keeper he has to be we all do 5 i dontthink oliver has ever ever called me katie ever since he meet me when i tried out for the team it has always been kat he the only one who calls me that i should ve gone and found alicia or angelina or the tins to make sure oliver told them but oliver would never miss anyone so i went to the pitch i just assumed it was practice when has oliver wood ever gone to the pitch and not run practice so i changed into my robes no one else was in the locker room i just figured i was either the first or the last one here both have happened before i went out onto the field expecting the team to be there and oliver yelling at me for being late but not even oliver was out there i stood stupidly in the middle of the field with my broom in my hand i looked at my watch i was supposed to be here at 3 30 and it was getting close to 4 i should ve turned on my heel and left then i saw someone signaling me from one of the top stands i squinted a bit and realized it was oliver so i flew up there and found oliver he was sitting on the 2nd bench his feet on the 1st and leaning back on the 3rd and he was eating a bag of nacho cheese chips more weird stuff oliver never ever once in a blue moon ate chips and when he did they were always cool ranch he looked up when i landed in front of him hey katie he said smiling sit he patted the spot next to him even his smile was weird like he wasntsure how to move his mouth like he was smiling for the first time and he gave me a command he didntask me to sit he told me to sit i never let oliver order me around unless it was during practice other than that he knew there was a very firm boundary either way i sat down to his left where is everyone i asked how early was i he moved closer to me what do you mean his accent completely gone the team where are they i was looking onto to field and when i looked back he was even closer it was the only time i had ever been uncomfortable around him they re not coming he moved even closer so he was only like two inches away i knew something was wrong but it was oliver wasntit are you feeling ok oliver i moved down the bench but he moved closer every time i moved away he moved closer why do you ask my back was against the wall of the stand but he kept inching closer i dunno you seem seem what my whole spine was plastered to the wall from my tail bone to my head i wanted to sink into it he couldnthave been closer i realized he smelt funny no not funny funky like something crawled down his shirt and died are you sure you re feeling ok i asked placing a hand on his chest hoping to stop him from getting any closer perfect they he swiped my hand away and kissed me kissed me the oliver wood my freaking kilt wearing son of a bitch captain who has never ever made a move in his life to kiss me and it was horrible i could taste the nacho cheese on his lips i stopped it the second it started i pushed him off me and slapped him across the face what has gotten into you ol he cut me off with a punch to the face i felt a trickle of blood from my left cheek bone as he kissed me again this time i pushed him off with my left leg punched him in the mouth with my right hand and kicked him in the side of the face with my right foot he tumbled off the bench to the floor of the stand i jumped from the bench i was on to the floor where my broom was i looked at oliver before i picked up my broom he was using the bench to get up and his skin was moving in lumps like there were bugs crawling under his skin then dark greasy hair replaced oliver brown and his amber eyes turned into black ugly coals i couldntlook anymore i picked up my broom as marcus flint stood up dressed in griffindor robes he wiped the blood from his mouth laughing cruelly the first thing that registered was that my wand was back in my locker just as this to mind marcus reached into his robes for his still laughing i did the first thing that came to mind i ran and jumped of the stand holding onto my broom tight let me tell you free falling is not a good feeling 15 feet before i hit the ground i hopped on my broom i dontthink i ve ever flown faster i looked back once before i flew over the opposite stands back to the castle marcus flint was still in the stand yelling and fire misaimed curses and hexes at me i flew all the way to the main entrance of the school flat against my broom my feet barely skimming the grass i ran through the doors and sprinted up my stairs i got a lot of weird looks i was a speck of scarlet in a sea of black carrying my broom no less i knew i had to find oliver and i ran around like crazy trying to find him i finally found him on the seventh floor heading towards the fat lady thank god he was alone oliver i was trying not to break down oliver he finally turned around he wasntwearing the black robe or vest his collared shirt was untucked and his sleeves were rolled up to his elbows his tie was loosened and he was carrying a few books in his right hand kat then he saw the blood and tears trickling down my face he dropped his books and sprinted towards me i meet him half way down the corridor where he scooped me up in his arms i pulled back as a thought struck me what if it wasntoliver but someone else oliver is that you i asked through small sobs turning his face this way and that trying to find something that didntbelong he grabbed my wrists gently kat what happened his accent the one that i was so used to and loved was back it was definitely oliver i threw my arms around his neck and started sobbing he pulled away and held my shoulders kat tell me what happened he was looking straight into my watery eyes but i could barely talk you you told me to to meet y you at the pitch an and kat what are you talking about w well it wasntyou you but you even i knew i sounded ridiculous oliver looked completely dumbfounded he guided me to an empty classroom where dust was collecting everywhere he gently nudged me into one of the chairs and kneeled in front of me on one knee he took my broom and placed it on the floor next to him then he helped me take off all my padding my hands were shaking so much i couldntunbuckle and unlace them he transfigured a desk into a pot of warm water and a cloth and he gently started cleaning the cut on my left cheek bone kat what happened i took a long shaky breath i came out of a double transfig test and you well i thought it was you you were acting all weird you grabbed my elbow roughly and told me to meet you at the pitch in 30 minutes but you always say half and hour and you were moving really awkward and hunched over and i stopped and took a deep breath oliver was still cleaning the blood on my face and neck so i went to the pitch and got ready for practice but it was last minute and you never call a last minute practice so i went onto the field and you were in one of the high stands so i flew up there you were eating a bag of nacho cheese chips i know you hate those and you kept calling me katie but you always call me kat you were acting all weird so i asked if you were ok and you said perfect then you kissed me oliver eyes grew large with shock and anger and starred at me i pushed you off and slapped you then you punched me and started kissing me again so i pushed you off with my left leg punched you in the mouth and kicked you in the side of the head with my other foot you fell on the floor and when you were getting up your face started to crawl like there were bugs underneath and then you were marcus flint oliver stopped again when i mentioned flint name good thing because i completely broke down i almost pushed oliver over i fell on the floor in front of him threw my arms around his neck and buried my head in his chest he held me tight and rocked back and forth slightly it ok kat he cooed softly as i sobbed drenching part of his shirt it ok he held my head in his hands and wiped away my tears with his thumbs better i nodded and he dropped his hands anything else i nodded again and continued then he stood up and wiped the blood from his mouth laughing i paused for a second then he went to pull out his wand did you have yours it was the only time he interrupted i shook my head and looked at the floor no so before he drew it i jumped of the stand i got on my broom of the way down and flew to the castle as fast as i could to find you a lock of hair had fallen in front of my face and oliver tucked it behind my ear when i looked up he was smiling lovingly he helped my up come on lets go to the common room you can get your stuff from the locker room tomorrow oliver guided me with one hand around my waist in his other hand he was carrying my broom with my padding slid on it everyone we passed oliver glared at with burning eyes i knew if he saw marcus face he would rip it off yay i updated i hope it was good i felt really bad for making you guys wait so long so review and tell me whatcha think yay my reviewers are back i ve missed you guys oh i gonna update a lot more now but i have camp on monday it like two weeks but it not sleep away volleyball baby outside hitter oh yeah eight hours of straight volleyball i going to town with this one ok back to the story november 9 saturday 7 am i not sure why i broke down so much yesterday i mean sure it was unpleasant but i normally dontbreakdown like that it only happened once before and that when i caught my first boyfriend cheating on me i mean back then i was young and and i dunno i not saying i some cold hard stone that doesntlet anybody in or let tears out i ve cried i guess because it was flint or was it because i thought it was oliver and if it was that was it because it was horrible or because i was disappointed that it wasn t i dunno i just gonna try and block it out but it gonna be hard for everyone else to block out my swollen cheek god damn it after breakfast i get dibs on flint ugly face first angelina said while i was trying to eat my eggs but some how they didnttaste right i had told the rest of my friends what happened last night once i calmed down and had a hot coco in my hands sitting in the common room and out of my quidditch robes get in line oliver growled he was skimming up and down the slytherin table but i knew flint wasntgoing to be there i checked too his friends were sitting without him i just sighed starring at my eggs hunched over and my hands in my lap you should probably go see madame pomphrey alicia said her fingers gently skimming over my cut and swollen cheek i swiped her hand away and gave her a small smile i ll be fine dontworry too late oliver muttered under his breath only loud enough for me to hear in a raspy voice he was playing with his eggs we ll get him fred said and oliver cast him a dark look and held it fred was looking rather uncomfortable that is if there anything left of him after woody over here left anything george recovered for his twin and oliver went back to his what he called half eaten eggs which were in fact just played with eggs i just sighed guys really it nothing katie he could ve raped you alicia shrieked rather loudly i got a few curious looks from some hufflepuffs in the next table over could you scream any louder i said rather meanly i took a breath and smiled as much as i could i sorry lic but you know i would never let it get that bad but you didnteven have your wand i guess what she said finally made me realize why i had such a major meltdown i guess some small part of me deep down in my gut was screaming that but the rest of me was screaming something louder and i could only hear the second noon after breakfast i let angelina and alicia and everyone else drag me to the hospital wing guys really it just a cut and a swollen cheek i protested i ve had so much worse and been fine oh yeah angelina said holding my left arm rather tight damn she strong yeah like when that was fred he was pushing against my back with both hands like this i wrench my hand from angelina and pointed to the small scar under my right eye where a bludger had hit me almost three years ago remember no angelina grabbed my arm again this time her nails digging into my skin she was holding onto me so hard by now i was so determined not to get to the hospital wing i sat on the floor they really didntunderstand if i went to the hospital wing madame pomphrey would want to know how i got hurt and i d rather not explain the situation for the record i am a terrible liar i mean sometimes i get lucky but even if i get away with something then i feel guilty the rest of the day and then some i not going to the hospital wing i said as angelina dug even deeper into the only left arm i had i thought it was going to pop off she was holding it so tight alright oliver said he was holding my right arm firmly firmly not digging into my only left arm but firmly i gonna have to teach angelina that word she was cutting off my circulation i sighed thanks ol but the next second he had me draped over his shoulders and was walking to the hospital wing a lot faster than we were going before oliver i screamed kicking and punching i was not going to the hospital wing oliver put me down nope oliver scotty pants wood it not going to happen he put his other arm across my legs so i couldntkick he was chuckling to himself as everyone else followed behind making faces at me and laughing oliver i am not going to the hospital wing two minutes later i was strapped in a hospital bed i hate you all i said looking at the leather straps across my chest and arms stomach knees wrists and ankles is all this necessary i not a mental patient it only a swollen cheek i tried to squirm around for squirming sake but i couldnteven budge i should ve figured that because i could hardly breathe i sighed in defeat ok you win i here i said looking at my smug looking friends what do you want with me only to fix that cheek madame pomphrey said turning my head so she could see my cheek she was on my right so let me tell you she turned my head so hard and fast it cracked like five times oh a little tense are we i laughed lightly but it was not because what she said was funny looks like it why does everyone want to tear pieces of me off first it was angelina with my arm now madame pomphrey wants my head as a slovenlier who wants my feet anybody free feet get your free feet we also have a right arm and both legs who wants em so how did you get this madame pomphrey asked her wand tip on top of my cheek i winced when she asked i guess she thought it hurt because she said i sorry dear didntmean to prod so hard it ok avoiding the question was my number one goal at the moment so so what how did you get this er i took a deep breathe a teacher was going to find out any way marcus flint hit me with a bludger i looked at my friends and realized oliver was the one who cut me off that man is god if i wasntstrapped in i would probably be on the floor bowing madame pomphrey looked at him her wand tip was on me but she looked like she was prodding him we were having a scrimmage oliver explained flint was trying to show his beater the right way crabbe he new on the team and when he did he hit kat madame pomphrey nodded eyeing him like she wasntsure to believe him or not but i guess she did because she started working on my cheek i looked over to oliver while she was working and i caught a playful wink 4 o clock sorry everyone else had left madame pomphrey said it would be a while for the spell to work and my cheek to go back down to normal size exactly 2 hours and 32 minutes it took i know she elongated the spell that woman hates me but by then oliver was the only one waiting with me he said to everyone else that they could go and that i was the one who waited for him that time and so he should wait for me sorry for what oliver asked confused sitting on the chair next to my bed for making you wait i was still strapped in that god damn hospital bed he smiled that no reason to be sorry you waited almost all night that one time i shrugged my shoulders as much as the straps would allow i was the one who did the damage remember oliver chuckled yeah how could i forget it not funny i would hit you if i was tied up like a mental patient he laughed even harder oliver i groaned his laugh died down a bit then he stood up and kissed my forehead i ll go find madame pomphrey your cheek looks better and he went to go find her meanwhile i was sitting rigid in my little mental patient bed ponder what happened what was that all about that was the real oliver right why is the world confusing me like this oliver returned with madame pomphrey a few minutes later the whole time she was poking my cheek i was thinking to tell me head to stop thinking he your captain it was probably just some captain chaser team mate player protector thing right i mean what else could it be god damn it katie stop thinking if anything it was a friendly peck which was exactly what it was i mean we ve been friends for the past 4 years why shouldntwe have friendly pecks i mean it would make the world a better place i said stop thinking i took a mental deep breath here you re probably still worked up from yesterday and that all look oliver is fine why shouldntyou be fine then we can all be fine i said stop thinking so for once i listened to my head and stopped thinking but it was probably only because madame pomphrey had gone back to poking my cheek well i got the swelling down do you want me to get rid of the cut no she made this tsk tsk type of noise and started un strapping me the second i was free i sprinted out of there and up the next hall i wanted to put as much distance between me and that bed oliver eventually caught up to me and stopped my frantic running that was such a bad idea i said as he turned me around i will never let you guys drag me in there again oliver chuckled it not funny i rubbed one of my wrists that woman hates me he put an arm around my shoulders everyone hates you i know he caught the look i gave him but he only laughed louder come one let go get your stuff from the locker room and he steered me down to the pitch we got my stuff from my locker and threw it in my bag that was still in there with all my books he wouldntlet me carry it he insisted that he should oliver really i sighed i only got hit i can handle a bag of clothes oliver smiled i sure you could he slung my messenger bag over his shoulder and ignored anything else i said on the subject half way back i gave him a hug around his shoulders thanks for what he asked as we continued walking for strapping you in a mental patient bed any time number one never again number two i meant yesterday genius he put an arm around my waist pulling me closer to him you dontneed to thank me he whispered in my ear i would thank everyone of my reviewers but i would be here for hours i love you all in a author reviewer way and hope you all review again i ll update soon promise i got so many reviews as always thanks everyone almost everyone wants oliver to kill marcus so i shall make it so probably not this chapter though i have to see where i go with this it might happen though no promises oh i realized a mistake but i too lazy to go back and fix it in the last chap i said it was november 9 but it was really december 9th i thought if i told you here all would be fine and dandy most of you probably didntpick it up though ok i ll stop rambling and start writing now december 15 friday potions well i guess alicia and angelina have kept their mouths shut because as of now there are no rumors flying around the school about what happened amen end of potions apparently the teachers dontknow either because they keep piling homework on me did i mention professor lupin is out sick so snape is covering for him no well that means i have four periods of snape every other day it killing me and 24 inch essay on werewolves who gives a damn about werewolves i for one don t why do i need to recognize them what am i doing roaming around the woods looking for werewolves besides snape doesnteven have right to assign us homework in d a d a he not the damn teacher tell me about it go away fred no right before dinner ugh so o o o o o much homework so i was sitting at my favorite table in the library when alicia and angelina came in looking oddly happy giddy oh no oh no no no no i slapped my hand over my cheek as they sat down i still had a cut there nothing big i am not going back to the hospital wing alicia laughed slightly no silly we know you ve been feeling down so we thought we d get you something to cheer you up angelina finished happily i think my ears perked up like three feet chocolate no candy no butter beer no i rattled my brain what they were smiling very slyly and alicia started to unfold what looked like a photograph no hell no what alicia asked innocently enough continuing to unfold the photo i am not going on a date but why not angelina moaned donti have enough on my plate i asked realistically well i thought i did that shut them up for now dontget me wrong alicia and angelina are the best friends a girl could ask for but i hate it hate it when they try and get me a boyfriend once alicia set me up with one of her cousins i donteven know what to say about it it was that bad 9 pm oliver wood is constantly surprising me sometimes it bad and sometimes it good like practice that was a bad surprise he worked us like dogs for almost four hours four and what happened after practice that was a good surprise in a bad way actually it wasntthat much of a surprise but it still made me smile once the initial shock was over we all trudged back into the main entrance way our bags over our shoulders but still in our quidditch robes saturday is wash day and there was this group of slytherins near the entrance to the dungeons they think they could actually win came one girl voice hey marcus didntyou with that katie bell a boy laughed yeah said a voice that i would rather forget chuckling boy was she my cheeks must have been the same color as my robes i looked down at the floor and started to walk again but before i took two steps someone placed a hand on my shoulder i turned around and it was george i looked at the rest of my friends and they were all watching oliver march across the entrance towards the slytherins mud flying off him i couldntmove and i couldntsay anything i just stood there my jaw hanging down to the floor and watched as oliver disappeared into the group of slytherins then the girl who spoke first screamed and the rest of us sprinted over to where a circle had formed around oliver and marcus marcus had blood dripping from his nose take that back oliver growled at flint both of his hands were in fists take what back boy was he macho oliver punched him in the face again you know damn well now take it back flint took two swings at oliver the first one he missed and the second hit his cheek i knew how that felt oliver barely moved and punched flint in the gut and face again before he knew what hit him flint fell on the floor against one of the walls protecting your girlfriend are you i didnthear that though i was looking at the other slytherins about ten and realized that they all had their wands out covered by the sleeve of their robes i nudged fred and nodded my heads to the slytherin girl next to me fred nodded 15 seconds later the whole team had slipped their wands out from their bags all but one oliver but george was carrying oliver bag and had his wand in one hand and oliver in his other worst came to worst we were outnumbered but they were all cavemen flint was saying some crap when i realized his hand had gone back into his pocket here we go flint had drawn his wand and shot a spell at oliver thank god oliver has keeper reflexes because that spell would ve hit him in the face instead it scraped his cheek george tossed oliver wand to him and without looking oliver caught it and aimed at flint chest in two seconds it went from two captains having a fist fight to almost complete chaos everyone had their wands raised waiting for something to happen between the two captains flint was still shocked his wand was pointed harmlessly away from oliver oliver on the other hand was towering over flint in his scarlet quidditch robes with his wand pointed at flint chest and the darkest look imaginable flint dropped his wand which clattered on the floor but oliver held his still hehe flint managed so oliver heheh stupefy a red spell went straight into his chest and he was out like a light slum bag the next second we dropped our bags and faced the closest slytherin i would ve blasted them all but seeing as mcgonagall flitwick and snape came out of the teacher lounge that very second i never had the chance we kind of forgot that the teacher lounge was connected to the entrance way what is going on professor mcgonagall asked in a shrilly voice looking over the mayhem which was 6 of the 7 players of the griffindor quidditch team still in scarlet robes about to duel 9 slytherins now that flint was knocked out on the floor er was the immediate reply she received from all the students apparently your quidditch team was trying to duel my slytherins snape said in a cold voice next to her maybe we should revoke the team nonsense i couldnttell who she was more mad at us or snape for making such a suggestion can you count they re clearly outnumbered why would they think to do such a thing they she took a deep breath before she could get anymore worked up none the less ten points deduction from their house for every student present so that 100 from slytherin and 60 from griffindor i watched the rubies in our hourglass and detention on wednesday after dinner i stood still not daring to believe we got off that easy i looked over to angelina who somehow got back to back with me who looked just as shocked eventually one of the slytherins crawled back into dungeons and the rest followed suite leaving marcus on the floor he deserves it we decided we better bring oliver to the hospital wing we had no clue what spell marcus used so we figured better safe than sorry oliver was a lot more cooperative than i was he didnteven need a mental patient bed so alicia said once madame pomphrey left to go find something or another does anyone else believe that we got off that easy we all laughed lightly it because we re on the quidditch team you know fred pointed out who cares i asked hugging the scarlet robes i was still wearing this is the ultimate safety seat damn i love those robes can we have a go at him now george asked now that his face is a pulp oliver laughed have fun oh dontworry we will his twins added identical mischievous grins on their faces i smiled god knows what they re going to plan after 8 30 madame pomphrey ushered us all out something like we re ridiculously muddy and how is oliver supposed to get any rest blah blah blah but little does she know i coming back with food 12 am sneaking back into the hospital wing isntthat hard madame pomphrey doesnteven lock the door hmm fred and george ll like to know that bwhahaha ok anyway and those house elves in the kitchen really love me they re so cute and adorable i ve got to get me one of those yeah like i that rich no fruit oliver asked after i laid the spread of food on his lap there pineapple does that count as fruit of course it does it my favorite i sighed hey no one disses pineapple around me and if you dontlike it i ll go back to the kitchen and go get some apples and pears and grapes and oranges and strawberries i stood up from the chair next to his bed i was about to turn around when he grabbed my hand you see here i was expecting something along the lines of it ok you dontneed to go or something like that dontforget peaches he smiled i sighed rolled my eyes but his smile is so god damn contagious i couldnthelp but smile too alright mr healthy i ll go get you every fruit imaginable so i picked up the delicious spread of food ever imaginable and went back to the kitchen mr wood doesntlike our food why does he not want the food is the food not good enough for mr wood maybe they re not so cute after all i mean i was standing in a crowd of house elves who were either angry upset confused by the fact that oliver only wanted fruit and the others were either running into things hitting themselves and one almost threw themselves in the stove i grabbed the last one before house elf was tomorrow main course now listen i said holding the squirmy house elf oliver loves the food you cooked for him it just that he is er injured and only wants fruit he asked me to get every fruit imaginable the house elf i was holding jumped out of my hands and back into the kitchen not any where near the stove thank god let me tell you all that fruit was heavy they gave me like 5 apples peaches pears oranges plums 4 things or grapes like a branch of strawberries raspberries blueberries wild berries 2 coconuts cut up pineapple and a bunch of crazy looking fruit i didnteven know what to call so oliver asked his new spread of food on his lap holding up one of the odd fruit what exactly is this i had my arms folded on the bed and my forehead resting on the top arm my face in between them i looked up you re eating it oliver chuckled then took a bite this is pretty good try some he offered it to me it was red and had yellow swirls on it this isntlike the poison apple in that muggle movie is it oliver laughed it really good so was the poisin apple would the house elves really give you something poisoned i thought for a moment first i saw the sweet little things willing to give me food then the frantic screaming throwing themselves into wall house elves after i told them what he said yeah i think they would oliver laughed was i really that funny i promise it fine i sighed oh alright i dunno what that fruit was but it was delicious oh my god i said looking at the thing after i swallowed it like an apple and a peach mixed in one after a hour almost all the fruit was consumed oliver even had some pineapple so this is how many times i ve landed you in the hospital wing oliver laughed twice i think boy you better stay away from me never there you go guys the fight you ve been waiting for too badi dontwrite fights that well hmmm review please c i love my reviewers seriously though you guys are great i would name you all but i dontthink i have enough room where would i put the story speaking of which i better start hu december 16 saturday 10 am turns out i fell asleep in the hospital wing i woke up sitting on the chair next to oliver bed with my arms folded on his bed with my head resting on that oliver woke me up around 6 am kat he was nudging my shoulder kat kat wake up he started shaking my shoulder harder i opened my eyes slightly when i realized i wasntin the dorm i sat bolt upright and i almost hit oliver in the head what you fell asleep he said really because this looks so much like the girl dorm really why is oliver impervious to sarcasm i really dontunderstand it yes oliver us girls like to decorate our rooms with hospital beds and weird smelling bandages so it looks like the hospital wing he picked up the sarcasm this time and laughed i looked at the cut oliver got yesterday it was right below his eye but on the side of his face from the end of his cheek bone almost to his hair line it was and inch wide but not deep at all madame pomphrey said he got lucky if it got him straight in the face he might ve had to go to st mungo s his cheek was swollen too but we hadntworried about it too much but now there was a purple rim around it er oliver i said my finger skimming around the cut on the purple rim there purple around your cut what i better go get madame pomphrey at first i thought it might be a bruise but trust me i ve had plenty and none looked like that it was splotchy in some places and smooth in others and it wasntthe ugly color bruises were it was a more livid purple i knocked on her office door madame pomphrey i was banging rather loud madame pom the door opened jesus child what do you want she looked at her watch and what are you doing here so early i ignored the last question there a purple ring around oliver cut and it s is it a bruise no are you sure it is very early madame alright alright i eventually dragged her over to where oliver was see she put on her glasses oh my what oliver asked what is it darling go get my bag she told me it on my desk i was back in two seconds when i came back madame pomphrey was leaning over oliver prodding her wand on the purple rim oliver was laying very still he didnteven need the leather straps aha madame pomphrey said after a while of prodding child give me the green vial in my bag yes that the one i handed it to her she put some on a cloth and started dabbing oliver cut and around it there she said after a minute or two that should do it the ring should be gone in three hours at the most she handed me the vial and cloth dab it every 30 minutes until it is gone then she went back to her office probably to sleep is that all oliver asked she isntgoing to tell us what happened i looked at the vial and cloth three hours three i have homework to do and sleep to catch up what does she think she can go around making students temporary nurses or something eh i d probably be here anyway i slumped back in my chair guess not so after 30 minutes i had to use the stupid vial and dab because i a non volunteering nurse who doesntget paid how did i get roped into this ah yes i the reason oliver got into a fist fight and almost got his face burned off that something nice to have on your concise does it sting i asked while dabbing his cut every time i went over it his nose twitched slightly and his brows furrowed for just a second yeah he said smiling just a little even if it was just a little his nose was twitching like crazy i sat back down in my chair once i was done i sorry for what he was smiling out of the corner of his mouth for getting you into this mess what mess one cut kat that nothing big maybe i looked at the floor but it would ve never happened if if flint wasntsuch an ass there i had to smile hey it the truth but i ve known you for ages and a stupid polyjuice potion shouldnthave tricked me like that i protested oliver cupped a hand over mine he shouldnthave tried to trick you kat i looked up at him and then back at the floor maybe he lifted my chin up with his other hand at least we match he rubbed his thumb right at the base of my cut smiling i hate his smile it so god damn contagious i couldnthelp but smile it was small though promise around 9 alicia and everyone else came down there you are alicia said as she saw me it had been three hours and all the purple was gone not to mention the potion in the vial amen we ve been looking for you everywhere she said as she came and stood next to my chair well i said through a yawn i was here fred and george saved me before alicia and angelina started playing 20 questions with me hey guess what fred asked oliver sitting on my lap marcus is still in the entrance stupefied george said before oliver could answer as i pushed fred off me and onto the floor and he got blood dripping from his mouth a black eye and a swollen cheek angelina reported and a bruised ego alicia said we all laughed you guys donthave any coffee do you i asked through yet another yawn no alicia said sympathetically come on let go get you some she dragged me to my feet and out the door so what time did you wake up alicia asked the second the hospital doors closed behind us um i think it was 5 i lied through a yawn alicia laughed katie ann bell you are a terrible liar now what really happened i admitted defeat and told her everything that happened except like oliver hand over mine and little things that would be better for the two of us if she didntknow you fell asleep she laughed as we entered the great hall gosh how stiff is your back let think lic i had a four hour practice and fell asleep in a hospital chair i pretended to think i wonder why i cantfell my back hmm alicia laughed and i found the coffee pot on the griffindor table alleluia i screamed as i practically threw myself at it oh my god coffee i shrieked softly as we walked back to the hospital wing taking a sip of the precious elixir mercy it so good i said through tearless sobs i was almost crying i was so happy to have caffeine running through my veins we walked back towards oliver bed and i found fred sitting in my chair with angelina on his lap off i screamed like a cranky mother as i came to stand next to them the two of them laughed as i sat back down in my chair yes that right my chair what so funny i asked your hair is such a mess george said lifting up a knotty lock of hair la di da major bed hair fred said lucky me you ve got ferocious bags under your eyes whoop di do i could sit in them oh my god you re morning people fred sat back down in my lap and then george sat down on his you guys i said trying not to spill my coffee and trying to expand my lungs it too early for a lap dance now get off the twins laughed and jumped off no they really jumped how many cups of coffee did they have right after oliver got released and marched over to the board and scheduled another practice oliver head could be chopped off and he would still schedule practices everyday of his life even if we lost the quaffle and had to use his severed head he would still yell at us so of course we have yet another practice god damn it why couldnthe be released after the weekend was over i have homework you know after practice hmmm it turn out i have this huge bruise on my side how the hell did that get there oh yeah probably from the bludger fred sent at me after oliver yelled at him for not hitting his marks then oliver yelled at him for taking me out poor fred at least he back to normal could you imagine oliver in a hospital bed while there was practice to be had my god i need more caffeine yes no maybe so review of course you will lol sorry i kinda lost it at the end oh well next chapter soon to be up oliver head could be chopped off

you come back december 20 time who gives a damn break starts today wednesday ha haha ha haaaaaaa it was like seven in the morning when i woke up i ran over to alicia and angelina waking them both up c mon break starts today angelina was still snoring so i did the only thing a true friend would do i jumped on her bed katie angelina asked groggily not believing what she saw c mon no classes we re going to the burrow get dressed alicia crawled out of bed i thought you werenta morning person she laughed my god i felt like a kid that woke up extra early on christmas morning i jumped off angelina bed and sat down net to alicia on hers i put an arm around her shoulder just think i said pretending to look off into the distance today we would ve had double defense and double potions that four periods of snape in one day alicia eyes grew wide and we both started jumping on angelina bed angelina alicia laughed get up thank god the other girls left the day before they would ve killed us all of a sudden the twins came in er what going on fred asked me and alicia still jumping on angelina bed who was curled up in a ball umm we managed stopping in an instant she wontget up i said like it was the most obvious thing in the world pointing to angelina but we re going to the burrow george said we know i looked over to angelina who was still curled up in a ball trying to get back to sleep i looked at alicia who was smiling devilishly at george right sock george saw where this was going and passed me his sock i charmed it to levitate and fall directly on angelina nose the effect was immediate angelina screamed bloody murder jumped out of bed and fell on the floor covers and all what the hell was that she said a hand over her heart george held up his un socked foot and wiggled his toes i thought angelina was going to faint i know i was i was laughing way too hard to get any air to my brain just then oliver came rushing into the room i guess he heard angelina scream but instead of finding chaos well he did he found me alicia and the twins practically rolling around on the floor red in the face with angelina white as a ghost looking like she was going to pass out the laughter stopped for a split second when he rushed in but the confused look on his face made us start laughing again even harder oliver just stood in the doorway his shoulders slightly slumped and the most confused look on his face he scratched his head do i want to know i put an arm around his shoulders no and we all walked down the seventh corridor we stopped right before we walked down the stairs realizing we were still in our pajamas half an hour later we all made it down to the great hall fully clothed jeans and all 8 pm around noon we finally made it to the burrow and we didntforget anything good thing too because the floo powder rosmeata let us borrow smelt funny let me tell you mrs weasley cooking could come from a five star restaurant donteven get me started on the pudding because there no stopping me i ve had one meal lunch and i never want to leave come on i ll show you your rooms fred said once we had all eaten our body weight in pudding me and oliver were the only ones who got our own rooms ron wasntcoming home for break so i got his lucky me it kinda reminds me of a furnace i said as i eyed the bright orange paint job really fred said i have the same impression the cannons arent that good though oliver said from next to me he hadntgotten his room yet i know george said on his way out just donttell ron fred and george left with oliver trailing going to assign him his room alicia and angelina came in as soon as they left did i accidentally walk into a stove alicia asked laughing tell me about it i said looking at the large poster that had been enlarged to take up a whole wall it was one of the whole cannons team the cannons arenteven that good angelina said i flopped on the bed side ways not long ways so my feet still touched the floor at least it was comfy beneath the orange bed spread i know he kind of cute though ron hey he a sweet kid but i thought angelina had more sense than to hit on someone two years younger than her let alone the twins brother no i sat up and realized she had been looking at a photo of the seeker oh the seeker i sighed you scared me me too alicia said watching the gnomes in the garden i laid back down and closed my eyes my hands behind my head little did i know that alicia and angelina had left and instead oliver came in once again he pulled that stunt he did in september haventwe had enough incidents with that stunt i took a deep breath lic ange are you guys even in here ahh i opened my eyes and there was oliver two inches from my face but unlike him i did not sit up bolt right and knock him out oliver i groaned hitting him playfully on the shoulder he was still leaning over me his hands on either side of my shoulder he chuckled gotcha i rolled my eyes and he flopped down on my right laughing it not funny i said looking at him slapping him on the chest with the back of my hand lightly oh i sure he was still chuckling i just groaned he rolled over on his side facing me and traced the now small cut on my cheekbone with his thumb i swiped his hand away and smiled oliver how many times do i have to tell you it nothing oliver scoffed but oliver i groaned then i saw something that made my heart skip a beat there crawling through the crack under the door was a long fleshy colored ear an extendable ear i think my jaw must have dropped to the floor as oliver followed my gazed then i stood up and quietly walked over to the thing i was pretty sure it didnthave eyes i picked it up and screamed stay the hell out of my oven room straight into it the ear squirmed out of my fingers and retracted so fast under the door you would think it was alive what was that oliver asked watching the extendable ear squirm back underneath the door an extendable ear katie oliver c mon i think that was angelina calling us from about four floors down get your brooms and hurry up i looked over to oliver who was still sitting on the bed a grin spreading across his face so fred said three v three we were standing in their backyard with our broom sticks over our shoulders we nodded in agreement but george said before we broke off into teams one team gets a keeper and a chaser the other gets two chasers i looked over to alicia and angelina we would ve creamed them so bad i smiled slyly cantwe do girls verse boys i suggested as innocently as i could manage nice try kat damn oliver caught on i ve got alicia george said then i ve got angelina fred retaliated ouch i said pretending to be hurt dontworry george said i ll take you over oliver oliver shot him a look as i walked over and he shrugged his shoulders she doesntyell of course i punched him playfully on the shoulder smiling their yard is something amazing though it almost the size of a real pitch it even has the goal posts but they re old and have vines clinging to them i think i like them better that way the two teams got into a huddle george you re keeper i said before he could open his mouth hey i the captain of this team and get over to the posts george humpfed dramatically and flew off to the goal posts alicia looked at me for direction boy someday i would love to be captain i put a hand on her shoulder and smiled you ll know what to do i flew off towards the center leaving a very confused alicia behind me i knew she knew the she would know what to do we both knew it does that makes sense katie how many times do i have to tell you to stop thinking it was so much fun though me and alicia together on the same team did they really think they stood a chance half an hour later we were up by almost 100 man it was beautiful then oliver came out of the goals and swapped places with fred putting a little twist on things i asked blocking him as he had the quaffe he smiled cockily just a little it not that hard though this chasing thing really he was trying to get around me but no way that was going to happen yeah you can distract me all you want oliver wood i grabbed the quaffle out of his hands and started the other way but it not going to work no offense to fred or angelina but fred should definitely stick to beating you cheated oliver could never face defeat we were going to play for like two and a half hours but mrs weasley called us in and of course me alicia and george won i dontmean to be so competitive but it in my nature as much as smiling is what are you kidding me i think i even had my hands on my hips some has got to slap me next time i do that you had two chasers and you had a chaser and a keeper besides i thought you said chasing wasntthat hard yeah but but it still wasntfair oliver i groaned what makes this unfair you had two chasers and you had a chaser and a keeper but you cantrun a play with that well you tried it not my fault it didntwork we could ve gone on for hours you too fight like a married couple fred said laughing no we don t we snapped at the same time i going to stop you two here george said yeah alicia agreed remember what happened last time i think it included katie and a bludger angelina said pretending to try and recall what had happened not to mention a night in the hospital wing george added i looked at oliver and we both laughed they werentsupposed to bring that back up again but that was exactly how it started oliver put an arm around my shoulders leading me back towards the house come on we ll call it a draw but we won alicia had come over and slapped a hand over my mouth fair enough i glared at her for a second and we started laughing all over again and oh my god dinner was even better than lunch can you say feast did ya like it if you didn t review anyway my reviewers are the best i love you all and goodybad i know i have bad grammar english isntone of my strong points but i think katie should too because 1 it easier on me and 2 because then she one less step closer to being a mary sue december 21 thursday after breakfast i would just like to say that in the very very very unfortunate event that my parents die i would like to stay with the weasleys who i know will cook delicious food every meal want to go to hogsmeade fred asked as i shoveled pancakes in my mouth sube george said george alicia said swallow george swallowed i said sure how we going to get there angelina asked i was still shoveling pancakes into my mouth i gonna gain like 5 pounds every meal i should probably ration myself we cantapparate i can oliver said from next to me i finally swallowed dontrub it in we could do a slide along he offered ignoring me genius we ll just use floo powder i said a little light bulb went off in everybody head he scoffed at me i think he was still a little mad that we beat him yesterday 8 pm for the record alicia said coughing as she came out of rosmeata fireplace around noon i hate using floo powder she coughed some more as oliver apparated next to me not a word i said as i brushed the soot of my jeans here he said scourgifying everyone we went outside where it was snowing i love the snow where to first george asked as we wrapped our coats around us tighter zonko s fred offered gleefully and we all made our way over there my god that place is like heaven for fred and george there are shelves upon shelves of all sorts of pranks there sugar quills that turn your mouth different colors and all sorts of stuff there were even muggle pranks and magic tricks eventually fred and george bought a bunch of the prank sugar quills and some sort of pastry that made you make all sorts of animal sounds ok this is what we do george said once we were outside we take the fake sugar quills and dissolve them in a cup of tea george alicia said what cup of tea over at that tea shop at the end of the street fred said smiling devilishly and we hand a couple an unsuspecting pastry george finished what on earth oliver said makes you think anyone and i mean anyone would take food from you that where katie comes in what i was watching the snow fall when i heard my name in their devilish plan you ll see this is the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard i whispered loudly outside the tea shop c mon katie george urged whispering too it ll be easy fred added i looked around every stuck up snob from our school went on a date at this stupid tea shop during christmas break everyone else had agreed oh alright i gave in give me the stuff if this worked i would never doubt fred and george again not that i really ever had i looked around if this thing was going to work we all had to look like couples i looked at oliver my date we were sitting at the table near the front window he was chuckling what so funny i paused darling my god that was painful nothing sweetie i groaned and he chuckled some more what is so funny he threw me a look i mean darling i rolled the r and he laughed some more i didntknow how much longer i could take this did some one put oliver on laughing gas i looked at the table in the back where george and alicia where george hand was cupped over alicia and she was as red as my sweater what is this i cocked an eyebrow smiling slightly oliver followed my gaze except he landed on the couple at the table in front of them kissing kat it rude to stare he said i kicked him under the table he didnteven wince that was the leg of the table oh that was why the table shook violently god damn it and i wasntstaring at them them who turned out to be roger davies who was glued lip to lip with his date i was looking at george and alicia oh he said as he looked over oh finally oliver made the connection isntroger going out with leanne oliver asked looking back at me yeah i sighed looking into my tea poor leanne she talked so good of him too get him back for her he said softly my eyes shot up from my tea to him i smiled slyly be right back i said standing up thank you darling i rolled my r again before giving him a peck on his temple before walking over to the counter excuse me i said over the counter then i realized there was a little bell i binged it and the next second i knew a middle aged witched around 45 popped out of now where her brown hair was graying she was pleasantly plump more so than mrs weasley and was wearing a bright pink robe with long pink earrings yes she asked trying to imitate a teenage voice er i was a little thrown off by her appearance you see the boy with brown hair kissing his date she that red head yes they come here every so often they do make a lovely couple dontthey personally i wanted to slap all three of them they really do i lied she bought it though you see i took out the sugar quills and pastries they re good friends of mine and they had a fight and i was wondering to celebrate them getting back together if you could give them each a cup of tea on me of course and mix the sugar quills in she looked at me skeptically it how they make their tea back at school i explained lying she smiled of course oh and could you give them these i took out the pastries they re their favorites certainly i ll get right on it she took the prank food i ll tell them it from you oh no don t don t they ll know it from me i smiled she nodded it ll be out in a minute thank you you do run a fine place here i said handing her the money she beamed as i walked back to oliver how the tea pumpkin i asked sitting down all enthusiasm gone oliver was looking out the window hu oh wonderful he snapped back from his daydream how d it go good i took a sip of tea i think a few minutes later the witch came over to our table miss she said quietly to me i gave your friends your present they said to tell who ever it was thank you thanks for relaying the message i smiled she was about to walk away when she put a hand on oliver shoulder you ve got quite a catch dontlose it i though all the tea in my mouth was going to come flying out oliver just stared at me oliver it rude to stare mocking his voice why was he starring at me oliver shook his head quickly like there was a bug on it sorry honey kinns i groaned and a loud squawk came out of nowhere my head snapped around to davies table his red head date had a hand clamped over her mouth while her date was roaring like a lion his teeth were blue oliver was laughing hysterically fred and angelina were making their way out saying something like how rude the people in this shop are george and alicia were following suite oliver took my hand and handed me my coat let go beautiful he said in a fake sophisticated voice as he helped put my coat on like i needed it i d rather not bring you around such ruffians let go he was still holding my hand guiding me out the door while animal sounds were still emitting from davies mouth yes i agreed in the same stuck up voice let s that was bloody brilliant fred said once oliver and i had made our way out of the shop so how did you do it george asked through laughs i told the crazy witch that they were friends of mine that had just gotten back together after a fight so i asked her to make the tea and give them the pastries as a present i explained she bought it angelina starred at me you lied and got away with it alicia caught on to what she meant oh my god katie ann bell we taught her so well fred said wiping an imaginary tear from his eye and george sniffed come one oliver said smiling putting an arm around my shoulders and leading me down the street butter beers on me when we were at the three broomsticks i finally caught alicia alone when the boys went to go get the butter beers so i said slyly did you have fun during that alicia once again went as red as my sweater what do you mean of course i had fun we did prank davies didntwe i sighed and angelina followed suite we saw what happened lic so did i she said as she got even redder davies date squawked like a bird while he roared like a lion with blue teeth that not what we meant angelina said looking at george back then back to her here alicia played stupid and cocked an eyebrow i dontknow what you mean oh come on i said grinning dontplay stupid lic you re cheeks are so red you look sunburned oh alright she said but donttell anyone and i mean anyone i dontneed rumors flying around if i dontknow how he feels too i smiled victoriously done perfect timing too oliver and the twins came back with the butter beer in like 30 seconds then in started noticing things like alicia would blush slightly when george spoke to her but the more they spoke the less red she got they do make a cute couple though how about the shrieking shack fred asked once we were done in two minutes we were standing in front of the fence that blocked it off bummer angelina said looking at the no trespassing sign looks like we ll have to leave ever since our first visit to hogsmeade two years ago she hated the place i not exactly sure though i mean it was dead silent when we went she started to walk away but fred and i caught her arm come on george said as he climbed over the 8 foot chain link fence but but it says no trespassing angelina pointed to the sign her heels digging into the snow as we dragged her over it ll be ok fred said reassuringly holding her left arm but you guys dragged me to the hospital wing i said now we re dragging you here we managed to get her to the fence but you werentafraid angelina said yes i was i protested that woman hates me i d be crazy not to be scared she has a point oliver said after he jumped the fence george was helping alicia how sweet oh oh alright angelina said ripping herself from our grasp and hopping over the fence fred and i shrugged our shoulders and started over i was climbing down the other side when my foot slipped on some ice and i fell backwards i an idiot but someone caught me i looked up and it was oliver thanks i smiled anytime as he as he helped me stand up so we continued to walk towards the shrieking shack and i swear angelina was shaking like crazy every step of the way once we were standing outside i was kind of feeling guilty about dragging angelina there well we re here i said turning on my heel let go back now you re not chickening out on us are you fred asked teasingly oh he didntjust call me a chicken i stopped in my tracks and glared back at him and he just smiled devilishly god damn him oh oh alright i said returning come on george said walking around the back i looked at angelina who looked more frightened than ever boy the guilt was settling in but then fred put an arm around her shoulder and walked her around would some one like to tell me when all these unsuspected couples came around am i that blind i was pondering that thought when oliver called me then i realized it was standing in the snow with probably the weirdest look on my face hm i realized everyone else was already half way around the house oh right this alicia said once we made our way in from the back door the twins and oliver pried open is the creepiest place ever we were all shaking now well at least angelina alicia and i were angelina was hugging herself her excuse was that she was cold hell we all were alicia was shaking just as much as angelina now and i had my hand wrapped so tight around my wand in my pocket i thought it was going to snap in half let split up george said us girls just starred at him no way in hell were any of us going anywhere alone in that place fine george said looking at our pale faces you girls can stay together then the three boys went into separate rooms they re trying to give us heart attacks angelina said i buttoned up my petticoat even tighter and tied my hair in a loose bun donti know it next thing we know we re roaming around with our arms interlaced scared like little kids afraid of the boogey man i thought we looked like dorothy and everyone else with that dog in that muggle movie skipping through the woods merrily except we were scared out of minds cold and walking as quietly as possible in a haunted house eventually after many frights and jumps we got used to the creaky boards howling wind and dim lighting soon after that we were roaming around in rooms by ourselves i came to this one room upstairs angelina was in the room next door and alicia was in the one down the hall it looked like it could ve been a bed room except the mattress was old and several springs were sitting out not to mention the leg bite off a chair i was about to turn around when someone put a firm hand at the base of my neck i swear i jumped two feet in the air and turned around at the same time and i also had my wand pointed at oliver i slapped him across the face so hard he was seeing stars what was that for he asked rubbing the red hand that was forming on his cheek what do you think i asked in a hushed whisper i was still hyperventilating and shaking i couldnteven tuck a lock of hair behind my ear my hands were shaking so much cold he was looking at my hands more like scared to my wit end but i was stupid enough not to wear gloves curse my forgetfulness he took off his gloves and stuffed them in his pocket give me your hand i just cocked an eyebrow he scared me half to death now he wants my hand he rolled his eyes and grabbed my hand anyway now it was my turn to roll my eyes he just chuckled and rubbed my hand in between his then he did the same to my other hand they instantly became warm then he shoved his gloves on my hands much to my protest thanks i said barley a whisper next time remember gloves he chuckled stuffing his hands in his pockets i rolled my eyes smiling he just had to ruin it and bring up my stupidity then i heard alicia scream run and saw her sprinting down the hall with angelina right behind her terrified oliver and i stuck our heads out the doorway and there at the end of the hall was a huge black dog and it didntlook happy this was no ordinary dog i mean it was just as big as a wolf and just as mad it hackles were up and snarling and growling and drooling the whole nine yards we immediately put our heads back in the room if i was scared before there not a word in the universe to explained how absolutely terrified i was then i was behind oliver and i put a hand on his shoulder i was gripping it so hard he turned around and raised his eyebrows i let go and looked at the ground look he whispered putting a hand under my chin and forcing me to look up when i give the word run and make sure everyone else is out i sure one of the twins is downstairs waiting but kat i sighed and nodded i didntmean to nod though i whole heartedly would ve rather us both jump off the window but before i could say another word oliver walked out into the hall facing that that thing i was going to say something i knew it would be stupid and i would ve said it anyway except my voice completely failed me oliver looked over to me moving my lips but not uttering a word any other time we would ve laughed then i saw him nod barely a movement at all towards the stairs so i ran i felt terrible leaving him there but i ran i practically flew down the stairs and practically sprinted right into fred what going on he asked holding me at arms length then i heard something bounding upstairs and i almost threw up as i realized it was that dog instead i pulled him by the collar out the door as i heard oliver scream some spell or at least that what i hoped he screamed we ran through the back door to where george was waiting with alicia and angelina i was just getting bombarded with questions where oliver is that thing a dog what happened then i saw the most beautiful thing oliver almost flying out the back door running past us and yelling at us to hurry up i swear we have never run faster we sprinted the whole way back towards the fence like five pitches and practically jumped over it in one bound we all landed panting on the other side sitting in the snow that was still forming our backs leaning against the fence i realized i was sitting in the snow next to oliver and i threw my arms around him resting on his panting body for a moment then i slapped him he looked completely shocked what i pointed a finger at him dontever ever do that again oliver chuckled before putting his arms around me alright kat alright well fred said standing up and then helping angelina up as much as i hate to ruin things i freezing i cantfeel my nose or ears and i dying of hunger so this time i treating i think the beginning was a little shaky did ya like guess who the dog is c mon you know you want to i love my reviewers goodybad is so right about j k go read her review for chp 16 you ll understand and i sure you ll agree and i hope grey rivers did

alone rotting in some school 8 pm so what did you get me for christmas fred asked we were just coming in from playing quidditch when mrs weasley called us in for dinner i was ready to sprint inside what makes you think i got you anything i asked faking meanness i got him something but i not going to say unless he somehow reads this he stopped in his tracks you didntget me anything he was serious of course i did i said surprised at how truly serious he was did he think i was that bad of a friend but i not going to tell you so what did you get me oliver asked his face somehow getting right next to my ear he has got to stop surprising me like that i going to have serious problems when i older what makes you think i going to tell you either i your captain he pointed out like i could forget he ignored me and i order you to tell me i just laughed i knew that he knew that he could only order me around on the pitch the school pitch tell me he put a hand on my other shoulder forcing me to stop his mouth still right next to my ear oliver i groaned it not going to happen he was whispering in a low raspy voice that sent chills up my spine but luckily a cold wind just blew past cold he asked kind ah he had put his arms around me from behind pinning my arms to my side and lifting me like a foot off the ground oliver let me go tell me he tightened his hold and i will no i realized everyone else had may there way in well we ll just have to stay here oliver your standing in a foot of snow it dark it cold dinner is waiting inside and i not a twig like alicia how long do you think you re going to last really dunno he said well just have to find out i d rather not i had my broom in my hand and i whacked the handle on the side of his leg he instantly let go and i started walking back to the house you are so stubborn he called after me still standing in the same spot yeah i called over my shoulder not turning around i know when oliver finally came in we were already sitting down and were making our plates i going to find out what you got me he said sitting down to my right i sure you ll try why wontyou just tell me why wontyou just wait two days i groaned i impatient almost five years on the same team and you thought i wouldntnotice oliver just chuckled his smile is so god damn contagious once again mrs weasley had out done her self chicken and soup and potatoes and corn my god some one just shoot me then someone came down he stairs and almost everyone cursed under their breath percy fred said as his older brother sat down next to him you do realize since were not at school you donthave to wear your head boy badge george gasped i guess he cantgive us detention either vacation has only just begun both of you shut up percy said his god damn badge shining in the light or i ll give you detention once we get back oliver shot him the dirtiest look i laughed at the thought of the twins getting detention on a night oliver booked the pitch i could see percy tied and gagged in the broom closet ah bliss can we just have a nice meal for once mrs weasley asked getting a little flustered of course mother percy smiled fred was on my left and i heard him mutter brown nose percy shot him a look that almost rivaled oliver when we goofed off during practice almost when did you come home alicia asked as polite as possible god bless her for willingly talking to percy i knew she would regret it just now percy said george was pretending to gag good thing percy didntcatch it he would ve had detention for a month while you were outside dumbledore wanted me to do a few more days before i left being head boy that is i told you so i heard what happened percy started before break i turned as red as oliver scarlet sweater oliver almost dropped his fork the food in fred mouth almost went flying alicia looked at me angelina looked at the floor and george was going to say something but didn t that last one surprised me the most but percy didntcatch any of this because he was eating his potato salad which was actually fabulous but what in mrs weasley kitchen isn t so how did it happen percy asked well percival fred said and percy glared at him for using his full name i know it wouldnthave happened if you were doing your rounds instead of snogging penelope clearwater in the library near the restricted section it was percy turn to turn red who told you he demanded we have our sources george said smugly you were spying on me we had practice they chorused detention percy said shrilly standing up every monday wednesday and friday for the next three weeks both of you the kitchen was instantly in an uproar oliver stood up no one was going to take both his beaters away that vein on his neck was doing the tango you know we have practices on those days and you cantgive us detention we re not in school calm down boys calm down you want us to lose the cup i never said that you prick i not going why cantwe ever have a nice meal they re not going we have practice oh they re going no they re not no we re not you re not the boss of them i head boy only when we re in school boys that one was mrs weasley a head shorter than oliver but louder boys you re not going to detention mother percy you have no right to give them detention when they re not in school the twins punched the air and oliver sat back down his vein returning to normal size but you two she turned on her twins you should respect your older brother just a little more thank you mother i knew and if you want to go snog some girl she turned back on percy find a private closet if you dontwant anyone to find out mrs weasley laying out the law i have new found respect for her not only for her cooking but because she told off percy after dinner we all went up to the twins room me and angelina were sitting on one bed alicia and the twins were on the other and oliver was pacing the floor in between the two you re brother is such a prick he growled no offense he said to the twins dontworry fred said yeah his twin agreed that a compliment in his case i cantbelieve he was going to give you two detention his vein was back to it usual size but it has always taken him a while to cool down especially when quidditch is brought up he knows we have practice on those days and then some george muttered oliver didnthear it though and if he did he ignored it i know he knew oliver i groaned the whole house knows when we have practice you shout it to the roof oliver shot me a look and i rolled my eyes i knew he would calm down eventually calm down oliver angelina said from next to me it doesntmatter i said they didntget detention so we can still have practice oliver slumped down on the bed next to me his back leaning against the wall yeah he sighed i guess your right i know i am oliver smiled oh crap i still have to wrap christmas presents 11 pm oliver came in while i was wrapping presents dontyou ever knock i said throwing the presents half wrapped under the bed oliver looked at the door guess not then he shut the door and sat on the orange bed so what did you get me he asked i groaned as i sat down next to him i not telling you fine he said then i not telling you good i like surprises i smiled he smiled too i hate you he laid down tucking his hands behind his head i leaned over him slightly no you don t he sighed yeah i know he paused you know who i do hate there so many i sighed looking down at him there percy davies smith diggory flint actually i was only thinking about the first but i do hate the others he looked at the ceiling especially flint i traced the cut on his cheek with the tips of my fingers and his eyes snapped back towards me i know i said in such a soft voice i wasntsure if he heard me hmmmmmm kinda short i know i ll try and make the next one longer reviews are good for the heart and soul there should be a book you know like chicken soup reviews for the soul i think it catchy and guys just because i go to camp doesntmean that i ll stop updating it ll just take me a bit longer just a bit though i wouldntleave you guys in the dark december 24 8 am sunday well i woke up early so i could finish wrapping the presents not to self glorify myself but i find the best gifts i just hope everyone else thinks so 3 pm so what did you get me oliver for the last time i not telling you i was waiting for angelina to get out of the shower i looked in the mirror this morning and i couldntbelieve what my hair looked like i think it grew out like three times the amount it was when i fell asleep i was leaning my shoulder against the wall holding all my crap in my bathrobe no less when oliver came up behind me why not he chuckled i think he just likes to see me get worked up because i smiled the point of giving presents is to surprise the person you re giving it to by how much you really know them did that make sense i dunno but that what i said hmm he pretended to ponder on that for a minute so what did you get me i laughed as angelina finally came out she was in her bathrobe too the guys better not get any ideas what going on angelina asked having trouble balancing the towel on her head well i said brushing past her that my cue my god i needed that shower so much i hope i didntuse up all the hot water i came out of the shower and put my bath robe back on i was going to comb out my hair when i saw a little note written on the foggy mirror what did you get me oliver i dried my hair got dressed and stormed out to go find oliver i canteven take a shower in peace any more what pissed me off more as that he had have to come in while i was in the shower god saved him when mrs weasley decided a blue shower curtain over a glass door i found oliver in the living room laying on the couch reading oliver wood reading i was so shocked until i saw the title of the book quidditch throughout the ages that made sense do you really want to know what i got you for christmas i asked angrily i was standing i the entrance way to the living room in jeans and my white crew neck sweater i think smoke was coming out of my nose oliver looked up i think he saw the smoke coming out of my nose because he chuckled and put the book down while standing up no ok that surprised me but but why have you been hassling me i was somewhat flabbergasted he walked over to me smiling because your just so cute when you get worked up i knew it i knew he liked to see me get mad he pinched my cheek gently and walked past me into the kitchen and up the stairs even when he was kidding around he was always thinking that sounded weird what i mean is he pinched my right cheek instead of my left where there was still an little cut i hate face cuts they always take forever to heal over i smiled and followed him up the stairs calling after him that no reason oliver wood i heard him laugh and i knew he knew i forgave him he always gets out of everything bastard after dinner yay tomorrow christmas i put all my gifts under the christmas tree and almost had to hex fred so he would stay away from his december 25 monday christmas morning for the millionth time this year i woke up to oliver an inch from my face well if he going to do it why not on christmas his hair was hanging down on to my face and his brown eyes were filled with the morning light morning sleeping beauty he said softly once my eyes shot open not matter how many times he does that i will always be surprised every time i yawned mornin tired he was still leaning over me like you would not believe i saw he was still in his pajamas and i smiled he was wearing a white tee shirt and green plaid pants he stood up and offered me his hand i gratefully took it and he helped me up thanks i said through another yawn oh and nice p j s he smiled like wise i looked down yes i forgot which pajamas i was wearing i was almost afraid to look but it was ok a medium sized navy blue tee shirt that said patriots in red and white and red sweat pants that had two white stripes running down the leg i smiled back thanks come on let go down stairs coffee sure mercy i said as i took a sip of the freshly brewed coffee i died and went to heaven well thanks for leaving me here all lonely on earth oliver said taking a sip of his own coffee we were the only ones up i think it was like 7 and oliver made me a cup of coffee we were sitting at the kitchen table side by side and out side it was snowing i licked my lips perfect perfectly brewed perfectly prepared perfect oliver looked over at my cup of coffee lots of milk and sweetened almost to the max how do you drink all that sugar he asked i sighed i could ask you the same thing oliver only drank strong black coffee i dontknow how you drink that stuff oliver took another sip and passed his cup over to me try it it not that bad i had this major flash back to when i was like ten years old my dad only drank black coffee too one day i asked to try some and i spit it out in the sink not my finest hour i looked at it skeptically my safe cup of coffee still in my hands kat he chuckled it not poisoned i knew i would regret it i put my mug in his hand i ll try yours if you try mine well oliver said looking into my sugary milky coffee cheers we clanked our mugs together and took a sip i did regret it black coffee tasted bitter five years ago and it tastes bitter now i forced my self to swallow and slammed to mug down on the table i stuck my tongue out blah it terrible i looked over to oliver his nose was all scrunched up and his brow was furrowed are you trying to give me sugar poisoning he asked handing back my coffee i took a sip of my sweet milky coffee and swished it around my mouth before swallowing it much better oliver took a long gulp of his how do you drink that he asked eyeing my mug with a lot of sugar i answered and milk you know the stuff your supposed to put in coffee i dontsee how you drink it black he smiled without sugar and milk bleh he chuckled as mrs weasley came down the stairs in her night gown robe and slippers oh she said i guess she was surprised to find us in her kitchen i didntwake you up did i i shook my head smiling no i hope we werentthe ones to wake you up oh no no no i got up to make breakfast thoughts of pancakes and sugar plums danced in my head i thought i d get up early and start do you need any help i asked oliver and i getting up no now sit right back down you have to love mrs weasley according to the twins she could be a pill sometimes but arentall moms well oliver said picking up the coffee pot off the coaster at least have a cup of coffee you you made coffee she asked not daring to believe her eyes well i do have time i suppose an hour later everyone was up and a magnificent feast was spread across the long table it was incredible there was double the amount of food than on a regular day which is like quadruple the amount of food on a regular day in my house i was about to bow down on the floor to mrs weasley hell i would ve even used percy as a human sacrifice hehe so fred said once we had all eaten double our body weight in pancakes and such even alicia couldntstop herself the twig how bout presents so we all waddled into the living room where there was like a mountain of wrapped gifts under the over decorated tree mrs weasley of course gave us all sweaters they were all scarlet with a gold band that wentaround the chest and upper back with thesame coloredtrim oliver had three white hoops embroidered on the left where a pocket normally would be me alicia and angelina had a quaffle and broomstick in the same spot as oliver hoops and fred and george had a bludger and a beater bat they are so comfortable we re all wearing them with jeans since the common sense of getting dressed popped into our tiny brains then we all tore threw our gifts my god it looked like a tornado had gone threw the living room once we were done i gave fred and george both a whole bag of muggle pranks you know gum turns your mouth different colors chatter teeth glue tooth paste and their favorite a whoopee cushion you would think they ve at least heard of all this great stuff but they never did i got angelina a shirt that said chasers on the front with a broom and quaffe on the front and said we get it done and a tourist silvioneer of the shrieking shack at first she just stared at it then she started crying it took us a while to realize she was crying because she was laughing so hard i got alicia the same shirt i bought three like months ago when i saw them i know i cheesy and a charmed origami mouse that followed her around it would say eat some more twiggy when she was eating or go get some sleep hun when she stays up late eating at the moment is was saying come on tear through the presents faster in a high pitched squeky voice she fell in love with it i got oliver a tee shirt that say captain on the front and aka spawn of satan and a wooden pitch for the little wooden us i got him for his birthday everyone laughed especially at the shirt that fits him so well angelina said threw laughs aw come one i not that bad oliver said chuckling we stopped laughing and starred at him then we realized he was serious and laughed even harder am i he asked only loud enough for me to hear i stopped laughing no one else did though gosh i hoped he didntthink that i thought that of him only during practice i said reassuringly and he smiled god damn his contagious smile there ya goes wasntso bad right new years eve day in next chap hehehe so many reviews love you all to itty bitty pieces so it seems everyone wants to know what oliver and everybody else got katie and i ll try to fit it in here somehow ok now onward december 27 3 pm wednesday so what are we going to do we were all sitting in the twins room me and angelina were playing with some pranks alicia was talking to george and oliver and fred were moseying about i ve got it fred announced perking up let prank percy everyone snapped out of what they were doing and looked at fred all in favor george said say aye aye six voices chorused all who oppose george said say nay i think i heard some crickets chirp well it settled so in five minutes we found ourselves in the kitchen baking cookies so can i ask why we re baking cookies angelina asked a blotch of flour on her face well fred said proudly where going to put several puking pastries nose bleed nuggets and several other pranking inventions of our genius into the cookies when it all said and done george said percy will be sick in bed for the rest of break mum will be none the wiser and we will be scott free thanks to our geniuses dontflatter yourself i muttered and oliver chuckled we had turned the kitchen into a disaster area we decided to make stations you know one to make the batter one to mix the batter one to plop the cookie dough onto the pan one to put the pranking objects in and another to cook it we decided to make only two pans with pranks in them one for dear percival and one for future profits fred had said and three regular me and oliver were at the mixing one flour everywhere i wiped some off my cheek but i only made it worse oliver was worse off fred had accidentally spilt a cup of it on him it completely covered his left temple and a lot of his hair i swiped my hand on the end of his hair and flour flew off like dust it a nice look for you i smiled speak for yourself he said as he wiped a floury hand on my right cheek five pans of cookies a mess of a kitchen and almost three hours later we were finished scourgify oliver said with a casual flick of his wand and the kitchen returned to it usual spotlessness as did we all we poured ourselves glasses of milk and started to enjoy the result of our hard work the safe ones not the ones filled with pranks do i smell cookies percy called from the next floor up the twins smiled devilishly yeah fred said as george piled a bunch of the prank ones on a plate come on down we saved you some we heard percy come down the stairs really he asked as he sat down pranked cookies right in front of him we all nodded and got back to our cookies trying not to laugh you see percy said to his twin brothers isntit much easier to treat me with respect instead of pulling pranks on me all the time i tried not to laugh but it came out as a demented snort oliver covered for me though bless you kat ah yes bless you katie percy continued turning once again to his brothers but dontyou think i right of course fred said as percy bit into a cookie how very wrong we were indeed george nodded i snorted dementedly again you really should see a doctor katherine he turned to his twin brothers i knew you would see the errors in your way percy said looking around is everything ok you all seem rather qui his face turned so green that if you put him in the woods with brown robes on you would mistake him for a tree or something his slammed his hand over his mouth and ran into the connecting bathroom slamming the door behind him percy fred asked in a voice very much like his mother s percy are you ok in there you could hear him being sick you dontsound so good george agreed five minutes later percy was in his bed mrs weasley fussing over him what happened dear she asked putting a thermometer in his mouth i dontknow mother he said still looking rather green i just had a cookie and then darling what cookies we were currently cowering in the hall what did you do to my son i thought we were your sons too fred muttered i dontknow george voiced over his twin we all had some of the cookies he the only one that got sick in two seconds mrs weasley was scouring the twins room where are they they what fred asked you know damn well the cookies we gave them to you george pointed out you know i mean the pranked ones you gave percy wow she caught on fast but we had already stashed all the pranked cookies in the attic with the ghoul more like me and alicia mrs weasley wouldntlet fred and george out of her sight how the hell did we get off that easy fred asked his twin after mrs weasley left us in their room unable to find any cookies i have no idea george said laying on his mattress which was currently on the floor with the all the sheets ripped off fred looked around at their room it looked like a bomb exploded she doesntexpect us to clean all this up does she george snorted like it would ever happen december 30 1 am new year eve well i suppose it january 1st new year day but i really dontgive a damn right now after dinner i was upstairs in my furnace room laying on the bed and listening to the new weird sister cd angelina got me normally i not much of a fan of them but the songs on this one arenthalf bad then george came running in hey he said we re all going to have partners and at midnight we re all going to kiss for good luck oh and as seeing as me and fred are paired up with alicia and angelina that leaves you and oliver got it that what he said but with my head phones on it sounded more like we re all going to have partners an i need you more than eveeeeeeeeeee for good luck why did you have to go and leave me all a loooooonnnnnnne paired up with alicia still trying to get over you oliver got it ya the italics is the lyrics to the song i was listening to i know not one of their best so what i heard made no sense that george needed me more than ever for good luck why did i leave him all alone paired up with alicia and he was still trying to get over oliver so i decided to humor him what ever you say george so i looked at the ceiling fingering the necklace of a miniature broom oliver gave me and wondering why the hell george was trying to get over oliver and if i was lucky or something i was still listening to the weird sisters so a few more lyrics got tossed in with my thoughts and made an even bigger mess what are you talking about we were all in the living room getting close to 12 i guess wearing the sweaters mrs weasley made speaking of the living room it very quaint there a long couch in front of the fireplace which was currently cracking merrily two arm chairs on one side of the couch and a love seat on the other oh and there an old classical radio that was currently playing some singer mrs weasley loved on some station mrs weasley loved too bad mrs weasley went to bed like an hour ago she had warned us not to dare touch her radio if we did it would probably fall apart the thing ancient any way oliver was in the kitchen getting butter beers for everyone and george had just told me the message again what are you talking about he asked surprised i told you earlier i had my head phones for crying out loud i had stopped myself from throwing my hands in the air do you really think i heard a word well why did you agree i groaned angrily throwing my hands in the air admitting defeat with self control going straight out the window and went to go help oliver where george came in and repeated the same message again they all like to see me worked up i know it i wanted to sink into the floor and never come up you ok kat oliver asked i snapped out of my trance and picked up the three butter beers left on the counter of course and we walked back into the living room where certain doom awaited me a few minutes later the 30 second countdown began on the radio 30 oliver was standing next to me he took the butter beer out of my hands and put it on the coffee table 28 by now my heart was racing a million miles an hour 25 are you sure you re ok with this oliver asked both of my hands in his i nodded i knew my mouth wasntgoing to work and my voice would fail me are you sure i nodded again 20 the next thing i knew oliver had dipped me dipped me i was only happy i was wearing a sweater and that he didntdrop me i looked around holding on to his neck and shoulder when did you learn this i asked with an eyebrow raised smiling he shrugged his shoulders you pick things up he smiled just promise me you ll pick me up if i fall he chuckled you really think i would drop you i was so low my hair was almost skimming the ground and my hair is only just past my shoulders i tightened my grip in response and he chuckled again 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 by the time the lady on the radio had finished the count down oliver had brought me back up and kissed me it was kinda long for good luck i need the extra luck to win the cup this year he explained smiling and blushing slightly my cheeks were as hot as the logs in the fire ha there i gave in to every one of your demands i cannot tell you how glad i am that i started this chap yesterday i came hom e from camp so dead beat tired i thought i wouldntfinish it but it kept nagging at me so i decided to finish today and not put it off any longer 8 straight hours of hard core volleyball will dot hat you know oh and i did have this little tid bit planned ever since the holidays started even though i was kinda abrupt going into it with george but i think i smoothed it over with the lyrics so you re not all that powerful mwhahaha that doesntmean you dontreview though disclaimer you guys know the drill i dontown katie bell or all the other famous characters from harry potter september 2 breakfast time no idea monday well the sorting was the same as always the twins made fun of ron as always and i drowning out oliver new plays over breakfast like everyone else as always the only thing that is actual different is that there are dementors guarding the school they re protecting us from sirius black are you guys even listening i try not to giggle i used to his scottish accent but here it just came really harsh out of no where hehehe oh oliver fred said like a little girl of course we were listening george putting on the same voice how could our superb breakfast bring us away from your lovely voice and plays especially when they are enhanced by your scottish accent they both laughed like little girls so you werentlistening oliver concluded bravo i said from his left and my best friends alicia and angelina started applauding so oliver gave up and sat back down he slouched down and put his hands over his head did anyone have a clue what i said boy when he bummed out his accent really comes out oliver i said putting a hand on his shoulder it just that you sent us well at least me a letter and a play almost every day and i looked over them they re gold and i know almost all of them so no worries only almost oliver he smiled from the corner of his mouth ok ok i get it he sat up i just really want to go all the way this year an we know we all said at once good he started collecting his books now practice will start a month from now and i want good grades from all of you and no detention what so ever after then fred george get it out of your system now and he walked off to his first class so i asked bringing to the table a large manila envelop of all the letters and plays oliver sent over the summer did you guys get all this four other identical envelops made their way to the top of table and i sighed it gonna be a loooooong year 9 pm our teachers really know how to greet us to a new year i get the worst possible schedule and a mountain of homework and by the looks of everyone else in the common room they ve got it the same oh so this is the lovely schedule my teachers put together for me monday 1st defense against the dark arts alicia 2nd herbology fred and george 3rd care of magical creatures angelina 4th and 5th double potions fred 6th lunch everyone including oliver 7th astronomy fred and alicia 8th and 9th double transfiguration angelina tuesday and the rest of the week is pretty much the same with a little tweaks here and there like charms and some other class rotating days with the double classes i already have a potions essay that is supposed to be 5 feet long due tomorrow better get started now 11 pm i am finally done with most of the crap load of home work that is due today i changed back out of the uniform and back into more comfortable clothes such as the ones i wore the first day but with the real patriots and while i was trying to concentrate on my potions essay our dear oliver joins me in the hour of my demise oliver i said before he could utter a word i trying to keep calm i have to work on this can we talk tomorrow your still doing homework i barely got any well once i done i ll have a party for all the 7th years while us 5th years are getting bombarded by preparation for the o w l s dontyou have the n e w t s this year where your pile of homework finished like an hour ago help me that right i ve been reduced to begging by none other than oliver wood please i begged again he smiled that cocky smile of his and sat backwards on the chair next to me his arms crossed over the back and his chin resting there only if you promise not to call me a freaking kilt wearing scottish son of a bitch captain of yours again i bit my lip pretending to calculate my options like i was really thinking but for a moment i was that line was golden kat fine i smiled then turning to my so far only two foot essay that i didn t have a clue about help i said meekly handing it over um kat he asked with one eyebrow raised do you have any type of clue what your talking about here i slammed my head on the table no i answered pathetically i tried fudging it over after i realized i was starring at the book for half an hour but not taking anything in i was still eye to eye with the grain patterns of the table hey look a swirl and that one looks like broom oh my god i ve been turned into a wood clone i could probably find a whole game on the table well as long as it us winning the cup who cares right that wouldnthelp i sat up and slumped in my chair really i was getting a little edgy i dunno why but oliver started laughing at me i guess it was because i had been pouring over my books for the past 4 hours and i probably looked a mess oliver i said desperately i was too tired to even try to be mad at him he took the quill out of my hand and started working on my essay september 3 noon ish tuesday i think i dozed off because i woke up at 1 in the morning pouring over my books with a completed essay in front of me and a note from oliver i rubbed the sand out of my eyes cleaned up all my stuff and trudged up the stairs i swear i could ve slept through the night there i didnteven read the essay which oliver forged in very nicely in girly looking handwriting or the note he left but here it is yes i taped it in with added features i might add kat hope you had a good nap looked like you needed it what does that mean am i ugly and just not know it try to find some time and catch up on your beauty sleep oh he didnt not that you really need it that better wait did he just hit on me over a note naw cantbe right any way hope my handwriting was girly enough to pass snape judgment normally i dontwrite all loopy and in script well i would hope shit neither do i try and read it over so you know the material it probably going to be on the o w l s so study manage your studying so you re not cramming during the season night sleeping beauty your freaking kilt wearing scottish son of a bitch captain oliver yeah i probably should ve read what oliver wrote for me but i already handed it in and probably wontget it back in time to study over it before the not so pop quiz he probably gonna give us someone shot me or hex me anything oliver is never gonna let me live down the kilt wearing captain thing hu and why does he have to ruin such a nice note with a mention of the season that three months away well that oliver for you september 5 thursday sometime after dinner and before i actually gonna start my new mountain of h w i starting to think that i the only one who can take oliver constant bantering of quidditch really is there something wrong with me or am i building an immune system to it than why is everyone else falls apart every time the word is mentioned is there an epidemic going around or something hmm i had just gotten back my essay that i got an o on and since oliver wasntat the dinner table with us at the moment i decided to gloat worst mistake of my 15 year old life so i started what d you guys get on the essay fred and george didnteven bother answering an s alicia answered and angelina nodded hers was the same what did you get fred asked oh nothing much i whipped out the essay or what i thought was the essay instead it was the pop quiz i completely bombed because i didntread over oliver handiwork the twins burst into laughter and even alicia and angelina did after a while i did too after i realized what had just happened no but seriously snape almost gave me detention he said something about my essay being one of the highest in the grade apart from his so called perfect slytherins and that it was highly impossible that i bombed the test i said that i hadntgotten much sleep because i was studying all night for the test next week in his class or some other b s like that he actually let me go amazing i know but i think he punished all of us with another essay oh well oliver decided to join us during our laughing moment it must ve been a sight i was holding up my ridiculously bad quiz grade triumphantly while cracking up hysterically with my four friends oliver looked from my horrible grade that was written big and circled in red at the top from my red face from laughing so hard to the twins alicia and angelina who were all laughing equally as hard do i want to know he asked as he sat down in the middle of me and fred katie actually got he was laughing so hard he couldntfinish a worse grade than us george finished for his twin mean while i still holding my quiz laughing like an idiot the whole great hall is staring at us now and we were getting some very funny looks from harry and his friends who cares though they re third years after our little laughing i decided that i would actually go to the library and of course hermione granger was in there behind a pile of books looking very tired but that was her nature i went over to my favorite table it was next to a large window and you could see the quidditch pitch from al most all of the four seats but it was getting dark and you no longer could see the pitch but who cares i know it out there somewhere hopefully 8 07 ok time for a nice break i actually doing pretty good i should be done with in the hour if i dontget distracted speak of the devil 8 30 well once again i here oliver wood helping me again you know oliver i was doing just fine until i got to potions so you didntread over the essay i wrote he asked as he accidentally pulled out my horrible quiz tsh accidentally sure way to make me feel bad mr freaking kilt wearing scottish son of a bitch captain of mine umm about that kat didntyou get the note i told you to read it over oh the note about me needing more beauty sleep because i dead ugly that one oliver just smiled he knew i was edgy and decided to ignore it well lets see him ignore this one just so you know mr wood dearest captain of mine who likes to wear kilts i am not the brightest bulb in the box i probably not even the brightest out of the two wires that make the light bulb shine oh so bright so if you want a bright bulb that you can go talk to hermione granger is right over there i motioned with my quill which i bit down to a stub to a table i know to be right behind a certain bookcase time for a new quill hu kat how the hell did he ignore that my brother couldnthave done it better himself am i craving attention cantbe right i a dunce when it comes to potions and the world knows it so why would i crave attention about it i ve got people that want to help me alicia and angelina for instant it not oliver right i could laugh at that ha ha ha i laugh i laugh ok getting back on track i just scoffed at him stop making fun of me wood you know i an idiot yeah i know i kicked him under the table and finished my sentence at potions i watched happily as he rubbed his calf under the table and if i recall you arentthe brightest wire in the bulb either when it comes to herbology he scoffed at me oh yeah i hit a nerve i dontunderstand the point of it he said the point all you do is stuff plants into a pot besides you dontneed to know about plants to play quidditch how did i see that coming yeah i agreed but puddlemore wonttake someone who doesnthave enough common sense to stuff a plant in a pot oliver sighed yeah maybe not maybe would you let someone in who didntdo good in the easiest subject in the school they let my brother in though sure go a head oliver ruin my whole speech ok well you fly a lot better when your grades are up because you have less stress so less stress means less nerves before a game and less anger to take out on your team before during and or after genius oliver smiled my speech hit home katie 1 oliver zip just then a bunch of first years came in followed by alicia angelina fred and george who sat down next to us so what are you working on now katie fred asked because if it potions we wontbother copying it george chimed in i kicked both of them under the table reviews make me a happy author ha ha i finally got 100 reviews and it only took 19 chapters normally here i would say things like tsk tsk it shoulda taken a lot less chaps or why the hell did it take so long shame on you all but since your all so great thank you and no i not being sarcastic for once in my life and i ll try and make the chaps longer and get the story moving a little faster but i figured since it break katie would have more time to write i just figuring and i ll try and get a hamster in somewhere lol those who are giving me demands you know who you are i shall give into the as much as possible but if it changes the whole story and yadda yadda yadda no can do opps i rambling again sorry and no one said anything about the george mix up thing well i thought it was funny and i donteven know where it came from one of those outta the blue things god damn it i ve got to learn to stop rambling and being discursive dat was one of the words on my english final take that educational system ok i ll start now really january 1st 9 am sunday i think if i slept in once in my life cities would crumblllle and the wooorld would falllll tooo pei ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeees damn weird sisters get out of my head stop playing catchy lyrics with phenomenal music and get out of my head getting back on track with my life gathering up the pieces you destroyed i said get out ok hey no lyrics i can write this no problem so i woke up this morning not by the gentle rays of new year light and not by the soft chirping of birds like there any in january not by some one lovingly saying my name and nudging my shoulder ever so slightly and not because i felt like it i had every intention of sleeping until noon but a rather annoying rasping loud tap changed my plans at first i thought it was some random thing so ignored it my eyes still closed and tried drifting back off no way would the world let me then it came again and again with in two seconds i thought it was an owl with some stupid letter i thought it could wait so i tried to go back to sleep again but then the stupid noise came back so i reluctantly threw off my covers and walked over to the window nothing god damn owl rays of light were just over the horizon it was early i stood in front of the window like an idiot for a few seconds until something came flying at the window i think i jumped like three feet back and i promptly fell on my butt i stood up and walked back over to the window rubbing my sore little butt ok maybe little isntthe right word as i was walking towards it another thing came flying and i realized it was a pebble a pebble i fell back on my butt because of a pebble a pebble i a chaser for crying out loud i get knocked off my broom by sweaty guys get bludgers soaring towards my face almost everyday of my life and i fell back scared because of a pebble ugh i truly am pathetic at times so i opened the window and stuck my head and shoulders out i was so lucky that the next pebble hit the house wall instead of the window i looked down and there was oliver how the hell did he reach me i like 5 stories up oh yeah he a keeper duh katie he waved his arms signaling me to come down i looked at my watch kind of accidentally fell asleep with it on ok i always sleep with it on happy and shivered as a strong wind blew up and sent my hair whirling it 5 43 he put his hand to his ear well duh he couldnthear me so i stuck my arms far out the window and pointed to my watch he was still signaling me down i sighed exasperatedly so he could see and then nodded in the same fashion like an idiot i slammed the window down and threw on the first set of clothes i saw some sweater jeans and of course my converse plus my black petticoat griffindor scarf and gloves ha i didntforget them this time i ran quietly down the stairs and out the back door of the kitchen it must have snowed last night because there was an extra 6 inches on the ground and everything was shimmering covered in snow oliver was standing in the snow with his broom in his hand wearing a sweat shirt and a pair of jeans he was shimmering too but no because of the snow kat he started as i finally reached him but i cut him off have you been practicing i asked putting a hand on the side of his neck he felt like a million degrees his hair was plastered to his forehead and sweat was dripping down his neck and face drenching the collar of his sweat shirt kat are you have haventyou i was starting to get edgy my hand moved down his neck and around the neckline of his sweater completely drenched and stopped at the front you donteven have a shirt underneath i grabbed his hand and started dragging him back to the house does the word eudemonia mean nothing to you kat you re the one who is always telling us not to get sick oliver wood and then you do something like practicing in only a sweat shirt in january at 5 am none the less i heard him sigh and decided to ignore it you must be the biggest hypocrite in the world you re worse than my mom we finally reached the kitchen door and i shoved him through and into the living room i grabbed his broom out of his hands pushed him onto the couch and draped a blanket over his shoulders dontyou dare get sick kat we have practice i mocked in a shrieky motherly version of his voice how are you going to practice when you re in a hospital bed i want you all healthy for practice i donteven want to hear a sniffle out of you bell yak yak yak why dontyou listen to your own advice oliver looked at my pant legs why dontyou he smirked i followed his gaze and realized my jeans were soaked up to my knees well at least i have gloves on i held up both my hands he grabbed my right hand there a hole in this one he pointed out that doesntmatter i stormed up stairs up to my room where i quickly changed into sweat pants tee shirt and a sweat shirt then i went down to charlie room where oliver was staying and tried to find the same for oliver i found some laying on the floor well they looked clean enough when i came back down stairs oliver was still where i left him i threw the sweats at him from the kitchen try and make your self look some what decent i heard him laugh as i put on a pot of hot water hot coco sounded perfect then once it started to boil i realized coffee was the better choice my brain doesntfunction properly at 6 in the morning after only 4 hours of sleep no less i couldnteven imagine what my hair now looked like and at the moment i really didntcare i sat down at the kitchen table and slammed my head on it edgy oliver asked putting a hand on my shoulder i didnteven look up go make the god damn hot chocolate go in the god damn living room he was mocking me so let recap my morning so far 1 i went to sleep at 2 2 i got rudely woken up just before 6 thus giving me only 4 hours of sleep 3 i walked out into the freezing cold 4 yelled at my freaking kilt wearing scottish son of a bitch captain 5 didnthave one sip of coffee 6 and that freaking kilt wearing scottish son of a bitch captain of mine is currently mocking me not that great of a morning to start the new year hu i looked up at him and he was still smirking i mumbled some gibber d gabber and walked into the living room oliver had started a fire which was crackling happily and where i promptly fell on the couch i was so tired i was about to fall asleep i was so tired i could ve fallen asleep on a rock standing up kat i opened one eye and saw oliver standing over me with two cups of hot chocolate i sat up sitting on one of my legs and took the one he was holding out to me as he sat down it was almost overflowing with marshmallows damn he knows me well i took a sip and sighed i was so relieved to have something hot finally in me good oliver asked i licked the marshmallow fluff off my lips and nodded i was having a minute of me and chocolate time kat he asked we were all of a sudden playing 20 questions are you mad at me i thought for a moment i had a major flash back of him harassing me for what i got him for christmas because he liked to see me get worked up waking me up early on christmas having me try his deathly horrible black coffee him waking me up this morning him forcing me to come outside where it absolutely freezing and finally to him mocking me but then i had flash backs to all the good things he had done help me with any amount of homework help me after the flint incident beat up flint for me stop that dog no amount of hard practices or small stupid things could ever cover up all the good things i looked at him only for coming in while i was in the shower to harass me and waking me up early several times oliver chuckled actually i had angelina do the first she forgot her brush i caught her before she was going to open the door and asked her to do me a favor i hate it when things backfire on me oh i took another sip of hot coco besides he took a sip out of his own mug i meant last night he must have felt bad he wasnteven looking at me but instead at the crackling fire i hadnteven thought of that it was only for good luck i paused wasntit i didntthink i wanted to hear the answer if he said no everything would be turned around and mixed up between us years of friendship would be in risk of being ruined and the ever present question do i want a boyfriend will be turned into do i want oliver as my boyfriend i ve avoided the first for months now i couldntavoid the second if he said no if he said yes then everything would be fine and dandy nothing changed we would still be friends but only with one moment in time that we only brought up in good company and laughs 90 of my body the we re friends and he is your freaking kilt wearing scottish son of a bitch captain you idiot part said i wanted to hear the second but the other 10 the we dontjust have to be friends part said i wanted to hear the first the littler part had proved right once what if it did again either way i was saved from this odd moment when fred and george came bounding down the stairs i smell george said sniffing the air chocolate the twins ran into the living room where they found me and oliver next to each other on the couch sipping hot coco at 6 30 in the morning and i spy fred said looking at us an awkward moment oh my god i groaned you re morning people oliver chuckled there hot coco in the kitchen i there george ran into the kitchen fred followed lingering for a second to send me a mischievous look january 5 thursday after dinner that was the last meal i will have in mrs weasley kitchen at least until easter break if not later i think i about to break down and cry for pete sake mrs weasley said as i brought up this very said subject i ll send you food if they re starving you we half protested said that hogwarts was feeding us fine but that a lie have you ever tasted the lover pudding they serve once a week i dontthink so or the lamb bladder ugh makes me sick anyway mrs weasley promised to make us a huge dessert so i gots to be going after dessert oh my god it was b e a utiful i was going to live in the huge cake she baked and live here forever it was so big but after a gigantic slice the first thing that came to mind was to pray that the scale was busted when i saw my phone number after i stepped on it right before bed ok i did not in fact see my phone number when i stepped on the scale so i gained four pounds over a two week period oh my god i gained four pounds ok was that long enough i hope so because my lil fingers are hurting setting was today big thing at camp i an outside hitter and my camp coach is determined to have me as a back up setter apparently i have good hands why canti just hit and have them leave me alone jk jk i had the same coach as last year she a great coach and i was a back up setter then too i can set i d just rather hit oh my god all of you guys reviews made me crack up hysterically i going to stop myself from rambling and just go straight into the story oh and if anyone has anything about me calling a made up character which i now own i guess you might not want to read this but i sure you do so no worries january 9 monday sometime after classes and before practice i ll take a guess and say 5ish yes i could look at my watch but i feel like being lazy some people would say writing all this takes more energy than looking at my watch but guess what i dontcare i still dontunderstand it i said looking at my potions book gnawing at my quill me alicia and oliver were sitting at our favorite table in the library i was across from the two of them oliver i looked up and he was daydreaming well more like starring i guess first i thought he was looking straight at me until i turned around behind me was the queen of the sluts sarah massey 6 th year ravenclaw ugh i want to throw up it a known fact that all the girls hem the length of their skirts normally a few inches give or take so the skirt is three or four inches above our knees sarah on the other hand well let just say hers is hemmed double the norm she was only wearing her skirt and blouse same as me and alicia we have always worn white halter tops under our blouses so we could unbutton enough for everyone to realize we do have something on underneath and are in fact not sluts sarah doesnthave a halter top on underneath and has her blouse unbuttoned almost the same amount as ours i not saying i was looking but you could see her red unmentionable clear across the quidditch pitch at the moment she was looking for a book in the row behind my back and apparently she had an itch on her leg so of course she pulled her skirt up high and higher slut hate her guts hate em hate em hate em slut alicia snapped her fingers three times in front of oliver face oliver earth to oliver oliver shook his head vigorously sorry he smiled coming out of his trance just daydreaming i snorted slightly c mon oliver even you have better taste than that i nodded my head in sarah direction did i mention she was a slut oliver cocked an eyebrow at me a fake i dunno what you re talking about one and resumed helping me when angelina and the twins came in george sat next to alicia and angelina and fred sat in the chairs to my right is that sarah massey george asked looking over my shoulder she still had that itch alicia slapped him playfully on the shoulder and practically demanded that he help her with transfig because alicia is soooooo demanding they do make a cute couple though unlike sarah who will never make a nice couple with anyone because she a slut january 11 wednesday 10 pm something very fishy is going on here and i gonna find out i gonna go dig some dirt up 11 pm holy fudge oliver went out with that slut sarah but oliver has more sense than that right i mean he is the quidditch captain and he does come up with brilliant plays right i know he has a brain in there argh and anyway if he wants to go out with her i wontstop him he can date someone if he wants canthe i dontcare really i don t god damn it january 14 thursday after practice they must have gone out on a date i mean i went to go ask oliver about it last night but fred said he had just gone out where else would he go and i was going to the library when i saw them walking there together and they were talking both of them not just sarah blabbing her sluty mouth but oliver was talking too i saw his mouth move or was it a cough or something but his mouth moved i not sure what happened because i turned on my heel and decided to work in the common room i had a bunch of potions home work and i thought i could get help there but alicia and george were too busy playing chess and having meaningless drabble to help so i went to the dorm where angelina was looking at the photos from over break and stopped way too often on pictures of her and fred to pay me any mind and all practice oliver was off i mean he was still his usual get your ass up in the air now before i kick it up there because the schedule alicia gave me says so but once or twice he saw us chasers mess up and didntbother to say a thing not even to mumble under his breath and than after practice sarah was there and pulled him back while we were all walking back up to the castle i didntsee him until he came back to the common room almost half an hour later i dunno if it took that long because i was walking ridiculously fast and through several shortcuts or because she was snogging him in some closet january 16 monday herbology they are going out what is wrong with the world so let me tell you what happened i went to the bathroom on the third floor during d a and i went into one of the cubicles and while i was in there i found s m r and o w g 4ever in a heart with a arrow through it i nearly screamed what is she up to i know she doesntlike him she only going out with him because he has a fan club or some what not he a captain he my captain my oliver wood did i just say my oliver wood god what is wrong with me january 17 tuesday 9 pm ugh for once i got our table with no sarah in sight for the past week she has always been in the library when me and oliver are i had given up coming to the library all together last thursday but i decided i needed the silence i needed the quiet where george and alicia would be discreetly flirting while helping me i needed the silence when it would normally be replaced by angelina sighing dreamily every once in a while as she flipped through photos i was pouring over my potions text book literally pouring i think my brain was starting to ooze out onto the table hunched over with my hands holding up my temples when oliver sat down next to me kat do you need some help he was sitting next to me and had put a hand on my shoulder i looked up at him he was smiling warmly and for the first time in god knows how long i didntreturn it i looked back down at me potions work are you mad at me he was whispering and he had leaned in closer to me i looked at him only through a sideways glance i couldntlook at him head on he was frowning and his brow was furrowed his brown eyes unsure i just sighed and looked back at my work no i shook my head slightly look i got to get this done by thursday is it because what happened over break he asked ignoring me i sat up straight and stared at him did he really not know but how could he not he has a brain i know he does except i didntvoice this i kind of just blinked a lot because we can just forget about it he started he was trying to fix something that didntneed to be pretend it never happened and oliver i didntmean to scream but i kind of did i saw the librarian send me a dirty look one i often send sarah every time i see her i took a deep breath and went back to my work i knew it oliver said i did something wrong was it break because i it not because of new year s i said still trying to concentrate on potions which i did not exceed in because my brain was frying and i was writing down the wrong answers than what he looked over at my work and i knew that he knew i knew nothing about potions which everyone knew sarah massey i muttered more to my flunking paper than him queen of the sluts queen of the scots he asked confused what wrong with her i think he was slightly offended i shook my head before he got madder at me than i was at him no sarah massey queen of the sluts i said louder and clearer he chuckled and personally i didntthink it was funny at the time but i know we re both going to laugh at the mix up later i didntknow she had such a title he smirked for a second or two what about her you re going out with her i think i even threw my hands in the air he was suppose to slap me across the face like i told everyone to do if i threw my hands in the air or put them on my hips but he didn t instead he looked completely dumbfounded kat what on earth are you talking about he was looking at me like he was unsure whether i was mentally stable or not and if he should strap me back down in that mental patient bed which i might add i was so happy to see so you re not going out with her i was still confused why would i he still looked like he thought i needed a straight jacket because i started you two were always in the library i must ve seen you in the halls a million times together and after practice and you were always out and in every bathroom there s m and o w 4ever in a heart with an arrow threw it in every bathroom and you were daydreaming at her that time last monday oliver chuckled let me guess you believed a rumor that she started written on a bathroom wall no less saw me with her once or twice and assumed i was going out with her you were daydreaming at her when he voiced what actually happened i sounded like the biggest ditz in the world officially who says i was daydreaming at her my heart skipped a beat maybe i was just daydreaming in general my heart got back on track and he added maybe i was daydreaming about the match against ravenclaw that in the end of february incase you forgot he was smiling at me in a you re such an idiot sometimes katie bell way which i agreed with completely how could i i was smiling holding up my right hand i think i getting frost bite on my fingers let me help you then he grabbed my book out from under my quill crossed out almost every word i wrote and started writing in the right answers someday i have to learn that concept knowing and writing the right answers in potions ah a dream come true but why were you out all the time hey i had to defend my reasoning no matter how stupid or wrong it was and why did you get beck half an hour later than everyone else that time after practice when sarah caught you i was telling her off that time after practice kat he chuckled i couldntwalk down a corridor without her flirting with me we have confirmation that oliver knows when someone is flirting with him even though it sounded weird coming form his mouth thank god i got a little worried last year when oliver couldntwalk down a hall with one of those younger fan girls fawning all over him at first i thought he was ignoring them then i thought he was completely oblivious i guess i was right the first time kinda shocking and it was my mum birthday on sunday so i snuck out to hogsmeade a couple of times to find her a gift he sent me a playful wink donttell anyone though i made a x over my heart smiling cross my heart and hope to die he chuckled lightly dontyou dare go and die on me i katie bell am hereby doomed because i need you for the match way to go and ruin the moment oliver wood my oliver wood what the hell is wrong with me i know i know short sorry but my brothers had a lax tourney in greenport today like two hours away so i didnthave much time dontworry next chap will be longer and with more stuff i had originally planned for this sarah mix up thing to go on like a month but according to my book there a match at the end of feb and i didntfeel like dragging it out and i ll mention the firebolt in the next chap too i kinda forgot oppsie eeeeeee everyone of the reviews i get give me warm fuzzy feelings sorry it just so nice to know so many people like my story i had no idea there were so many sarah massey running around ok ok i ll start now and yes the hamster finally makes it debut today january 20 friday after dinner mother of fudge harry potter the harry potter our seeker our fabulous seeker got a firebolt a firebolt can you believe it because no one else on our team can turns out some mystery person got him one for christmas can you believe it oliver asked it was right after classes and we were all sitting in our favorite seats in the common room the very comfy couch and two arm chairs we hadntgotten changed yet but we had all ditched the more horrible parts of our uniform the itchy sweaters cloaks and even shoes i was playing alicia and fred in a card game called b s it so much fun you have to get rid of all your cards and you have to lie so i very bad at it and angelina was talking to george about some quidditch team oliver had just practically flew through the portrait hole smiling from ear to ear into the common room and told us about harry new broom a firebolt he was standing next to the couch which i was sitting on having just lost on our team a firebolt angelina jaw was hanging three feet down the twins smiled devilishly alicia dropped the cards she was holding and i stood up on the couch what did you tell him i asked icily grabbing his tie and pulling it down bringing him closer to me at the moment i didntknow it was a gift i swear wood if he cantpay for his books next year i was leaning over him yes i was now almost a foot taller than him standing on the couch and i realized i was inches form his face kat i think i was choking him it was a gift yep definitely choking him oh the iciness from my voice and realized his face was turning slightly blue oh sorry oliver too bad fred said as i flopped back down on the couch and oliver took off his tie we wouldnthave had practice next week oliver sent him a look and sat down next to me can you believe it he asked in a soft voice a firebolt i looked over to him and saw that his eyes had completely glazed over i smiled typical oliver jez oliver it not even yours i laughed lightly imagine if it was though angelina said he would probably marry it oliver now sent her a look but he had a slight curve in his mouth and that was the cue to keep ragging on him yeah fred agreed but then he would be cheating on his other wife quidditch dontforget his captaincy badge george reminded or his own broom alicia added onto the list oliver chuckled and we all laughed he is so obsessed with quidditch not like that something new though even when he wasnta captain he had always made up plays he knew every international and national team and their style of flying he knew how to make a great team and keep it together i swear he knows us all so well he knows what move we re going to make before we do i think i was daydreaming about this because someone snapped their fingers in front of my face katie oh katie are you awake in there i shook my head and looked at alicia she was the one snapping her fingers yeah you spaced out again she explained sorry i smiled what were we talking about again i was bombarded by talk of the firebolt and how could i forget about it and blah blah blah but mcgonagall took it away oliver said with his brow furrowed what why doesntshe want us to win how could she well apparently oliver stopped the flow of questions harry is in some danger or something with black and they re going to strip it down oliver face lost it color and i could feel all the color draining from my face that mutiny i screamed it going to come back in splinters oliver flinched to what i said like i caused him physical pain harry is in every way the best seeker i ve ever seen but the boy seems to be causing our team so much trouble ever since he started playing we lost the cup the past two years because he was off saving the school or some what not the dementors ruined our first match and they re only here because sirius black did something or the other to his parents and now he gets a firebolt and just because he the boy who lived we re going to get it back in pieces wow i mean i did have a pretty bad day though but he is still the best seeker i ve ever seen katie will you stop spacing out sorry january 21 saturday 10 am i ve got detention i was sitting in the library at our favorite table i had a bunch of homework and it all due monday i was wearing a patriots sweat shirt jeans and my hair was tied in a messy bun a really messy bun i looked up from my work and saw oliver standing over me in the sweater mrs weasley made him he had a mixed look on his face like he didntknow whether to be angry or upset i tried not to laugh but it came out as a snort how attractive it not funny he said sitting down next to me yes it is i contradicted oliver wood perfect well almost perfect student quidditch captain incredible keeper and now the biggest hypocrite in the world oh yeah he chuckled how do you figure now if i remember i pretended to think on like the second day of school you warned us all not to get detention and get it out of our system now before the season started and look at this just over a month to our match you go and get detention an kat wait i not done i stopped him from saying anything else and didntyou also say that the practices a month from matches were most important of all there was a long pause i hate you no you don t i said turning back to my work and i heard him sigh so how d you get it anyway i asked mcgonagall for the firebolt back he sighed i guess he decided to be upset and i didntbother to look up form my work hey i still have to finish it and she said that it wasntready yet and and i said that harry needs it to practice and and she said that it might be jinxed and harry may be hurled off his broom and and i said i didntcare as long as he caught the snitch first bingo she said that for a captain i didntcare enough about my players he added and then she gave me detention for not caring enough can she do that she a teacher i pointed out she can do whatever she wants well i a captain i noticed and i can do whatever i want with my players he ignored me so why dontyou go tell her that i was laying the sarcasm on pretty thick but he didntquite catch it good idea with that he started to get up i snapped up from my work and grabbed his arm are you kidding me what you told me to i was being sarcastic he sat back down oh i slammed my head down on my books for a genius keeper captain play maker he is so oblivious to sarcasm sometimes lot of homework he asked i was head on with my herbology textbook but i could just see the expression on his face ten sickles he was looking at me with one eyebrow raised and giving me a cocky crooked smile ten sickles like you have no idea i muttered into a picture of some man eating plant he grabbed my shoulders and pushed my back upright against the back of my chair then he took my books and finally my stubby quill from out of my hand are you ever going to get a new quill i slid further down in my chair so my chin was practically resting on my chest no oliver chuckled and i sat back up and he explained some potion gibber d gabber to me which i still dontunderstand january 25 wednesday history of magic oliver is driving us nuts he will not stop talking about that firebolt i mean it one of the greatest things to ever happen to our team and i was ok with him rambling for the first three days straight because he oliver he has detention tonight so we all get a tiny itsy bitsy break for three hours before bed but tonight wasntthe greatest night for him to land detention angelina just got out of potions last period and relayed the messaged that i officially have a crap load of homework for a class i haventeven had today joy after dinner so something very interesting arrived for the twins at dinner a hamster that right a furry rodent that is sure to someday bite me oh but it gets out they were going to test a hair color changer hat on it fur as long as it not eating anything the twins shove down it throat i fine a little color change heck i might get a laugh before slapping both of them you are not going to torture the poor dear that was alicia screaming at the twins as she scooped the little thing up into her hands why would you do such a thing her little origami mouse squeaked from on her shoulder and to one of my cousins sometimes i want to rip that thing up what ever possessed me to buy that thing should rot currently the hamster is now residing in a cage on top of alicia trunk it cute enough but i just hope she doesntlet hammy the hamster how creative out of his cage while the owls are in here you can tell i ve had another bad day cantya half an hour after whatever time oliver was supposed to be let out of detention i still cantbelieve she gave me detention oliver was pacing in front of the fire while we all sat and listened to him rant it the only way he cools down we could ve had practice tonight fred punched the air and oliver sent him a look what did you have to do anyway angelina asked oliver sighed as he sat down in one of the arm chairs made me clean the trophy room with out magic well that irony for you alicia said as she petted hammy i know oliver groaned she said if i wanted to win the cup i should act like all the players who did like i should act like flint or all those other filthy snakes i sighed he ll calm down eventually semi short i know but i finally put the hamster in so rejoice ok ok i know it taken me longer than usual to update i sorry but i came home from camp yesterday and completely crashed and today i decided i better post this chappie before you all rebel on me so enjoy february 1 wednesday after practice it is officially 3 weeks and some odd days until our match against ravenclaw and oliver hyperventilates or screams every time it is brought up normally the second though especially during practice always in practice spinnet if you plan to fly like that in the match i ll find a replacement now potter you better get that firebolt back soon or it your head bell the new play isnt that hard just do it for crying out lo weasleys stop harassing my chasers and johnson stop encouraging them this went on for about four hours and for the record the new play is hard fred and george somehow have to throw me through the middle hoop with the quaffle where angelina and alicia will be on the other side waiting to catch me and i somehow supposed to get back on my broom we were going to do it with alicia she a twig i need remind you but oliver says we need someone with more weight if the keeper gets in the way so in not so many words i said angrily as he told us about the switch up when we took a break you re saying i fat i didntsay that then what wrong with alicia doing it i told you if the keeper gets in the way we need somone to plow through i being thrown through a hoop how much power do you think i have enough to get past some keeper now stop throwing your hands in the air and get up there someone was supposed to slap me you re impossible sometimes wood i said angrily as i took off i was so angry as we started the play i was flying in between fred and george holding the quaffle then i felt them grab me by my ankles i had the quaffle in one hand and held myself up on my broom with the other as the twins held up my feet i had to be completely straight so i didntgo flying into the ring of the hoop that would hurt once we were at the hoops the twins pushed me off by the soles of my feet and i pushed off with my arm boy was i going fast but oliver wasntsupposed to be there i was supposed to try it without a keeper at least once but no not with oliver i couldntstop i was freaking flying through the air i did the only thing i could i tucked my head in and sent my shoulder threw first my eyes closed tight holy fudge that hurt i knew i went through before i opened my eyes and when i did i was upside down angelina and alicia holding me by my ankles my shoulder was throbbing i think i jammed it but i was still holding on to the quaffle nice one alicia smiled as i looked up at her my hair and robes were hanging down around me and angelina was snickering as she looked over towards the hoops i followed her gaze and saw oliver hanging from his broom holding on with one hand i laughed slightly before remembering my aching shoulder i saw oliver look over to me and i chucked the quaffle at him yes upside down but he caught it with his free hand before swinging back up onto his broom and my shoulder hurt even more i an idiot sometimes i grabbed my poor shoulder as angelina and alicia brought me over still hanging by my ankles what a sight good job oliver smiled as he looked down at me then he realized i was grasping my shoulder what happened what happened i asked angrily what happened you werentsupposed to be there you were supposed to give me at least two tries before we added a keeper what wrong with your shoulder i saw the look of concern on his face but i was so mad i ignored it i jammed it you idiot you got your broom katie fred said as he and george joined our merry group my broom in tow what happened to your shoulder george asked and he tilted his head so i would appear somewhat right side up and why are you still upside down i jammed my shoulder and i donthave my broom do you think i want to be hanging upside down i oliver sighed grabbed my left forearm my good shoulder and alicia and angelina let go as he hung me right side up and fred handed me my broom i was finally back on my broom still holding onto my shoulder i dontthink that play was as fool proof as i thought oliver trailed off really because i thought it was perfect i said sarcastically oliver smiled just the littlest bit but ignored me that enough for today and we followed him back down to the ground aaaahhhh i moaned in pain barely a whisper as oliver rolled his fist on my shoulder muscle that hurts sorry he said sympathetically i jiggled my leg and held onto the edge of the bench with a death grip with my eyes closed tight trying not to scream out we were in the locker room where everyone had finally calmed me down and oliver said that this would help my shoulder so i was sitting on the bench while oliver stood behind me digging his fist into my shoulder muscle we hadnteven changed out of quidditch robes well he did make me take off the long scarlet one but i still had on half my padding and thick scarlet and gold striped long sleeved shirt come on katie fred said as he walked by towards the shower suck it up suck it up i repeated opening one eye to glare at him he nodded and i kicked him in the shins and then in the back of his knee he fell on the ground good one george said to me as he stepped on his twins back going to the shower but fred grabbed his ankle and then george fell face first too hey i dontneed anybody else getting hurt oliver said sternly and he rolled his fist even harder sorry kat ah aha need anything alicia asked as she sat down on the bench next to me yeah i said opening one eye and looking at her knock our keeper ou oowwww sorry i jiggled my leg even faster why cantwe just let it heal aaahhhaha on it own ah trust me oliver said as he rolled his fist along my shoulder joint it ll make it feel better well what about me then alicia pulled out of her pocket the most beautiful thing i ve ever seen will a chocolate frog help she asked holding out the precious thing to me i just nodded and took the chocolate goodness out of her hand i took a bite and i felt my whole body go limp chocolate is a girl best friend the diamonds are liars but then oliver ruined my happy moment when he rolled my shoulder in it socket sorry he was pressing my shoulder blade flat against my back forcing me to sit upright as he continued to move my shoulder around by now my foot was jiggling at the speed of light and my tongue was hanging out of my mouth and i could tell my eyes were bugging out holy fudge ah ha sorry kat next time move i told you he chuckled told me wha ahhaha t that d you d be the right for the play somehow eee i dontthink the play ahaha didntagree ow i hit my fist against the bench which added to my pain he was massaging my shoulder muscle i thought the point of a massage was supposed to soothe you and calm you and make you feel better this massage was doing the exact opposite feel any better oliver asked half an hour later sitting on the bench next to me the locker room was almost completely empty except for him me and angelina i was gripping my poor poor shoulder my mouth was slightly open and slowly turned my head towards him what he asked smiling crookedly oliver i would feel better if you just ripped my arm out of my socket he chuckled i sure you would i leaned back against the lockers behind me and groaned i ll go find you some ice he said getting up i closed my eyes and massaged my own shoulder gently very very gently is the torture over angelina asked sitting down next to me i opened one eye she was showered and fully dressed i was covered in dried sweat mud i was still in my quidditch robes and had just gone through the most painful massage ever what i would give to swap places with her oh what i would give i sighed probably not my masseur went to go find some ice i heard that oliver called from the ice bin so i didntsay anything bad i saw the quotation fingers god damn it angelina laughed well i going to get some dinner she hit my shoulder my bad one and i gave a little cry of pain as she stood up opps sorry katie see you later i glance over to oliver who was coming back if i live angelina laughed as she walked out the door leaving me alone with my chuckling masseur i closed my eyes again as he sat next to me i really dontsee what so funny no he asked as he sat down next to me one leg on either side of the bench no i answered as he tied the bag of ice let see in the past hour i ve been called fat soared through the air without a broom jammed my shoulder and i just went through the most painful massage ever well he answered if it makes you feel better i going to have a huge bruise tomorrow i told you you had some power behind you doesntmake me feel that much better i sighed no point in two of us getting a gigantic bruise he chuckled and i smiled but you did call me fat for the last time i didntsay you were fat he groaned alicia a twig she wouldnthave been able to knock me off my broom so you noticed she a walking toothpick too oliver laughed her origami mouse thinks so too i can tell it yells at her for not eating enough every meal i sighed she eats the same as me but has the fastest metabolism i ve ever seen damn twig oliver chuckled and i took gasped as he slid his hand through the neck of my shirt and placed the bag of on my bare shoulder cold he asked freezing i replied happy for any excuse he threw at me but it was cold he stood up make yourself look decent and he walked over into the next row of lockers february 2 thursday double d a holy fudge i have the biggest bruise in history seriously though it should go in hogwarts a history it that big holy fudge i have biggest bruise in history seriously though it should go in it that big it covers my whole shoulder and goes around the whole joint then it almost goes to the base of my neck following the shoulder muscle it the ugliest shade of purples blacks blues and even yellows you have ever seen and it kills and of course it my right arm my wand arm my throwing arm my writing arm and my use it for almost everything arm i am a huge right handy girl but i can throw left handed yes even better than angelina so there hahaha february 3 friday after classes are you kidding me no i starred up at oliver in belief i was sitting in the library doing my homework minding my own business and now oliver just reminded me we had practice you see with the little thing called my gigantic bruise i kinda forgot how do expect me to play i asked still in shock i could barley raise my hand in class now he wants me to go plowing into people during practice no hell no come on kat he sighed how bad could it be oh i retorted it bad i was wearing a halter top underneath my blouse as always and i undid some buttons and slid my blouse of my right shoulder exposing the little thing called my gigantic bruise oliver took a sharp intake of breath with a concerned and sympathetic face and i rebut toned my blouse well he scratched the back of his head i guess for just this once you could miss practice 90 percent of me screamed with joy and the other 10 percent said just go stupidly i listened to the second oh no i said firmly i going what i think he was shocked that i was willing to go if you are coming dontgive me anything less than 120 percent skitzo this man is one second he the caring don t hurt yourself more friend next he the don t you dare slack off on me captain wouldnthave it any other way i said as i picked up my books good he retorted the captain part speaking because you need to work on your lefty throw better than angelina and alicia i called over my shoulder as i left the library i heard him chuckle the friend part of him that is skitzo after practice do you have any idea how hard it is to do everything backwards i mean i had to fly lefty the whole practice pass lefty shoot lefty ram lefty everything my brain actually kicked in before practice started and i strapped an extra kneepad to my shoulder and stuffed the shoulder of my quidditch robe with rags and sponges i looked like a football player i dunno what football is either angelina told me so that where all the rags went george saidas i pulled like the fifteenth out of my robes and all the sponges fred added as i pulled out three oh shut up i said laughing as i threw a rag and sponge at them i went over to my locker where angelina and alicia were already getting ready to leave the pitch do you ever get changed fast angelina asked as she slung her bag over her shoulder scarlet robes in hand that reminds me i have to put my laundry in the shoot anyway i looked down i was still in my quidditch robes taking out all that stuffing took a while i sighed and smiled you know me slow alicia laughed as she walked past oh we know i laughed as she and angelina left then george poked his head in our row our being me alicia and angelina aka the girl row george i shrieked so i wasntchanging i was just standing there but he didntknow that how do you know i wasntchanging he shrugged his shoulders well i d be fine either way i threw him a dirty look do you know where angelina and alicia are i cocked an eyebrow what am i not good enough to spend time with he chuckled so they went back already hu i hate it when my team mates read me like a book you d think i a little more complicated than that i guess from the face i made he answered his own question thanks katie see you in a bit then i heard him rush out with no doubt his twin right behind him i rolled my eyes and sighed smiling both alicia are so oblivious dontthey realize the twins have a thing for them i mean come on we went to a party once the three of us me alicia and angelina and angelina could pick out a guy that was looking at us clear across the room how could she not see fred who was always right in front of her i sighed again and let my long scarlet robe slide off my shoulders and onto the floor even though i hadntused it at all my right shoulder was still killing thank you oliver i muttered sarcastically as i rolled my shoulder in it socket thanks for what oliver asked popping his head in my aisle he can thank his stars that i decided to take off my shoes next i jumped almost two feet in the air oliver what i tucked a lock of hair that escaped my hair tie during practice behind my ear and groaned i d like to get back to the castle before eight he chuckled before leaving hahaha a long chapter at last it 6 pages on works so no complaints eeeeee you never how truly loved you are until someone draws you a picture waiting for the address but i sure it great i getting suggestions left and right and i love it let me know you guys arentjust skimming over my chapters though i know you guys never would ok i ll attempt to stop rambling and write the chap wish me luck p s valentine day is approaching what will happen whahaha february 3 monday history of magic you realize it officially almost less than a week until valentine day dontyou i snapped out of my daydream i in history of magic the most boring class in the whole entire world how could you not fall asleep listening to a ghost drone on and on and on and on and on about something that happened thousands of years ago in some place that you ve never heard of with goblins you never want to hear about if you want the answer you should ask alicia she was sitting next to me practically bouncing up and down in her seat i sorry lic what did you say she ignored the fact that i had ignored the fact that it almost less than a week until valentine day i have such a way with words donti it a week and a day from valentine day she said this rather loud but of course only the other student noticed as our teacher continued to feed us boring facts actually it was more like force feeding and i had half a mind to fall back into my daydream alicia just rolled her eyes lic valentine day is for little people that fly around with little did i know that mr bonn was asking me a question what did the goblins use as their prime weapon miss bell bows and arrows i didnteven know he asked me anything and continued obliviously on with my little speech correct he continued to drone on shooting people in the butt i continued still unaware of the fact that i actually answered a question right in that stupid class and for people with boyfriends i am neither incase you didntnotice alicia just smiled but you never know you might become one a little person shooting people in the butt i smiled slyly i know what she meant i just love to bust her chops no a person with a boyfriend she was still smiling even more after my smart alick remark damn practice ahhhhhhh harry got his firebolt back i will personally kiss the feet of the person who sent him that beautiful thing after oliver of seriously he let us all have a go on it that thing is fast i mean my hair whipped me to pieces fast holy fudge so of course oliver ran practice late so he could see that thing go longer but no biggie we didntmind and my shoulder is feeling a bit better february 4 tuesday 10 pm i can no longer feel any of the bones in my body i about to drop dead on the floor right after i kill oliver i was sitting on the bench after a hard practice and i was taking out the stuffing from the right shoulder of my robes i had just finished when oliver threw the quaffle in my lap i caught it purely out of reflexes come on he said you need some more practice my jaw almost dropped to the floor but i didntlet it i was determined to show him up because if i let him get away with this he would do it every time we had practice so i took out the rest of the rags out of my robes threw them down on the bench and followed him back out onto the pitch quaffle and broom in hand with the most determined face on let get your right arm back to work he said once we were up in the air in front of the hoops i rolled my right shoulder knowing it was going to die again today poor thing alright i put the quaffle in my right hand where i threw it up and down two inches off my palm a few times right handed boy did that feel good after a week and a half of lefty where do you want it hmm he glanced at the hoops behind him his eyebrow cocked and smiling cockily can you handle your right hoop damn it he knew what i was up to he knew i would stay out here all night until the sun rose the next morning just to show him up and he almost did we stayed out until 9 pm when madame hooch saw that the lights were still on and told us off for practicing so late so all in all i had a heaping helping of 6 hours of practice you are so stubborn oliver said as we finally made our way into the entrance way it was 9 15 and we had 45 minutes to get back to the common room before filch gave us detention yes i was officially aloud to stay out until 10 alleluia which wasntnearly enough for my aching bones i would ve crawled up the stairs if oliver wasntthere no way was i going to crash and burn now i gave him a weak smile how so i knew i was stubborn i ok with that it may not be a redeeming quality but it one of my strongest along with sarcasm is that a quality he chuckled lightly every time i push you you push me back even harder i smiled at the complement even if it was pointing out my stubborn ness even more i know he meant it in a good way though jez oliver that chaser rule number 1 push em back harder than they pushed you hell you re the one who taught me that i pointed out nah he chuckled you ve always been stubborn i just made sure you used it on the other teams instead of on me glad it worked i said laying the sarcasm on thick and guess what he finally caught it took him long enough he laughed harder and it echoed in the empty halls i was so sure that filch was going to bust us get us on something stupid like laughing too loud but then i realized it wasntpast hours and his laugh is even more contagious than his smile that i laughed just as hard we were on the same floor as the kitchen and oliver asked if i was hungry when our laughter died down no i lied i fine i thought i was going to get away with this one because it was pretty dim and i was sure he couldntsee my face all that well but of course my stomach growled really loud kat you are a terrible liar he looked at me smiling crookedly i guess it wasntthat dim and my stomach kinda gave it away i felt my cheeks getting slightly red i know come on he grabbed my arm and i let him drag me to the kitchens which is where i ultimately crashed and burned i plowed through the chicken and potatoes the house elves out in front of me in like two minutes flat after that i nearly collapsed onto the table actually i kinda did i sorry oliver said i looked up i had my arms folded on the table and had my head resting on them nose to nose with the table i didntsee a quidditch game in the grain like the table in the library but i did find mountains of plates filled with food for what i asked through a yawn i pushed you too hard ha i laughed weakly i could go for hours i am officially the most stubborn person on the planet oliver just looked at me in all my stubborn glory and shook his head slightly then he looked at the floor and then back up at me 6 hours is too long for anyone i stretched my arms up to the ceiling not for me want to go back out and make sure my arm is still attached to my body another yawn boy i was just asking for it if it wasnt9 30 at night i sure he would have we are talking about oliver remember he smiled and i gave him a sleepy one before yawning and returning to my previous position on the table except now looking at him alright kat he practically lifting me out of my chair and onto my feet let get you to bed i thought you were going to run me into the ground a little bit more i could only fight back with my smart alick mouth i was too tired to even try and fight off him as he dragged me out of the kitchen carrying both our bags oliver i groaned yawned i can walk on my own i finally mustered the strength to pry my arm out of his grasp not like it was hard i think he let me go because he was smiling and give me back my bag if you insist he kept smiling as he handed me my bag i do i replied stubborn as ever i instantly regretted attempting to carry my bag you see i knida forgot i had my potions history and transfig textbook in there along with almost all my notebooks so when i put it in my shoulder my bad shoulder not to mention it kinda wound up on the floor i held the shoulder strap hung my whole torso and arms almost to the ground and looked down at my messenger bag all the contents fell out on the floor i sighed kneeled down on the floor and started to pick up my books i know i know i said as oliver bent down and started helping me before he could say anything i stubborn and if i wasntthis would ve never happened actually he retorted softly handing me some books i was going to say it not the greatest idea to carry your diary in your bag damn it i sighed as we stood up it just a stupid notebook oliver took my bag out of my hands so that why you carry it around he said before i could protest maybe i shouldntkill oliver i mean he only wanted my shoulder to get better and he did manage to get some food down my throat and he did carry my bag alright i wontkill him february 5 thursday after classes so guess what i found today c mon guess though you ll never get the right answer i found oliver wood in the library a shock i know but not the one i talking about with natasha turner helping her do her homework err was all i could say i mean what was i supposed to say get away from him i cantdo that and i wouldn t and for the record natasha turner is one of those look at me i think i m perfect but i m really not type of people she a hufflepuff 7th year about an inch shorter than me 5 foot 6 inches has long wavy black hair and gray eyes i would also like to say she no twig though she thinks she is oh hi kat oliver said smiling looking up at me after my wonderful entrance line you know natasha right i think my mouth was hanging open because i finally shut it uh um yeah 7th year hufflepuff right i asked natasha checking that my sources were right but when were fred and george ever wrong they pranked her last year said she was stuck up natasha nodded and you re katie bell of course right of course who else would i be i mean i only played in front of the whole school my name was only said about a gillion times on lee commentaries i just nodded i didntknow what to do i looked from oliver to her then back to oliver then i realized oliver arm was resting on the back of her chair which was very close to his i not interrupting anything am i i asked unsure what to say no oliver shook his head i was just helping nat with her homework she not sure about her herbology homework i froze number 1 when has oliver been a genius at herbology number 2 oliver has already given her a nickname how long has he known her i mean it was different with me even though i gained mine the second he meet me i a team mate and not to mention a close friend number 3 and why did her nickname sound precariously like mine kat nat does nobody see the connection here what is going on oh well i said my eyes not leaving his i guess i ll go find alicia and angelina and the twins before he could say a word i turned on my heel and left oliver alone with a very confused natasha or nat and what kind of nickname is nat anyway a nat is an annoying little bug well she fits both descriptions annoying and bug argh i should ve killed oliver when i had the chance why am i getting so worked up over this i mean he can see someone canthe i cantdecide who he should date natasha isntgood enough though but who is at least she no sarah massey if he does really like her i should be happy he is one of my closest friends after dinner i telling you fred said once we were in the common room after dinner it not going to last oliver hadntcome to dinner he was on a date with natasha i know i should be happy for him but i not well as long as he doesntrealized i dontthink i can lie happiness though either you are or you re not i ll try though i dontlike her i said edgily we were sitting in front of the fire and i was curled in a ball on the couch a unhappy ball an unhappy ball in comfy sweats hey we all were in sweats i mean you donthave to george said because it not going to last his twin said again she so i was moving my hand in a circle in the air trying to find the right word not right we should be happy for him though alicia said from next to me i ll give it two weeks george said a week and a half fred wagered ten sickles do you have ten sickles of course will you two stop alicia asked icily did i mention hammy was on her lap so it completely ruined the effect we should be happy for him she not right for him i retorted and you are angelina asked from the arm chair next to fred s i never said that i said edgier than before then i died down into a quieter voice it just she so she not interested in quidditch she couldntcare less i mean she couldnthandle him he just so obsessed fred offered well yeah i sighed but he so stubborn spoken like the true queen of stubbornness george said she right though angelina agreed after our light laughter died down after george comment he so bent on winning that cup all he talks about dontforget the firebolt i put in smiling or practice george added we laughed again alicia sighed it ll never last told you fred said i lovingly fingered the necklace oliver gave me for christmas i smiled at the miniature broom at the thought of christmas break mrs weasley cooking playing quidditch beating oliver team at quidditch mrs weasley cooking christmas day our snow fights mrs weasley cooking the incident at the tea shop davies date squawking like a bird mrs weasley cooking the shrieking shack oliver and that huge dog mrs weasley cooking and even new year eve lic right though i sighed after a while we should at least try and be happy for him and if not try and look happy for him we re his friends after all he would do the same my friends nodded in agreementok do ya like know you ll review either way i hope i haventstarted world war three ok guys 1 yes i know oliver has recently obtained a magnetic force for random girls but do really think i ll keep her for that long 2 i loved the pictures so great thanks sooooooo much 3 i recently read a story called saving katie by siriuslypranked i dunno it sounds a lot like mine so could you guys maybe go read it and tell me if i going crazy or not because the name kat and everyone writing in her diary sound familiar 4 do you really think i haventhad this chapter planned out for ages well maybe not ages but ever since february started love you all february 6 lunch oliver has recently obtained a new topic to constantly talk about natasha aka nat so what do you think of her he asked me once he came back from his date with her last night he had just told me rather us about his date how he took her to hogsmeade and everywhere this went on for like 30 minutes but it felt like forever and the only thing i could do from screaming was to constantly space out staring at the lock of hair sticking up in the back of his head pretending to listen i shrugged my shoulders jez i only met her once oliver but she seems nice i lied i felt my cheeks get warm and instantly diverted my eyes to the crackling fire but for once he didntcatch my lie so now it today at lunch and natasha is officially sitting with us she completely threw a monkey wrench in our whole system of living february 7 saturday after practice i am seriously afraid for all our lives oliver wood the oliver who makes us fly circles around him while he sits on his butt and yells at us the oliver wood who talks about nothing else but quidditch cut practice short for natasha when oliver wood cuts practice short you know the world is about to end you know that the sky will fall and pigs will all of a sudden fly out of everyone nose take cover february 10 tuesday 9 pm it was snowing as i walked to practice today and it was a nice snowfall not the kind where the wind howled and whipped the snow in your face painfully but the kind that just fell like any other time it snowed i took my time taking in the peacefulness and beauty snowfall is on my top ten list of prettiest things your never going to make it on practice on time at this rate i spun around and there was oliver dontdo that i scolded punching him lightly he was wearing his old denim jacket i ve known for four years and snow was sticking to his hair he shrugged his shoulders it not my fault you walk slow and he started walking quickly to the pitch i dontwalk slow most of the time he was a good twenty feet in front of me by then so of course i sprinted to him and jumped on his back except he kinda spun around at the last second and we kinda tumbled down the hill i forgot was there and he kinda landed on top of me kinda ok i said pulling my arm out from in between us and pushing my hair out of my face i definitely didntsee that one coming i would hope so oliver said smiling still on top of me because then i would have to give you double practice and you would never ever do that i said sarcastically he chuckled and then all was silent i mean there is always some sound but not then there was only the snow falling silently and us in the snow oliver laying on top of me awkward hu ok oliver said finally getting up after a while breaking the silence if we donthurry we ll both be late for practice he offered me a hand and i took it brushing off the snow and we walked to the pitch silently oh the awkwardness any other time before natasha i would ve enjoyed it but every bone in my body wanted to scream out how horrible she was and it took all my concentration not to so i said breaking the silence as we neared the pitch you and natasha hu yeah he said smiling how i searched for a word nice yeah he sighed happily she is i can only hope he

rummaged through her clothes for something she should wear it was almost two hours before we had to go no i don t i protested as i tried to get a large knot out of her hair opps sorry dontworry but you have to i donthave anyone t go with so alicia asked from angelina closet so no one would dare go into hogsmeade on valentine day without a date i explained you would angelina pointed out remember last year that was different how you two didnthave dates either i pointed out you should go alicia said walking over and carrying an outfit it ll cheer you up i laughed lightly cheer me up from what natasha they chorused together i sighed do you really think she brings me down that much yes they said together again just go for an hour or two alicia said yeah angelina agreed my best mate isntgoing to sit in the castle alone on valentine day oh alright i gave in but only for an hour or two noon just outside of hogsmeade sitting on a stump at the edge of the woods how did i ever let myself get dragged into this i mean really i have reached an all time low only i would sit on a stump in the cold while it snowing without a date in hogsmeade on valentine day only me i hope alicia and george are having fun angelina and fred too even oliver but not natasha she can rot they re so cute together though alicia and angelina and the twins i mean george took alicia to that little tea shop and angelina and fred have spent the better part of the day pranking random people on the street that one reason i on this stump the other is that i saw oliver and natasha i was walking towards zonko when i saw them i was kicking a little tuff of snow on the ground and when i looked up i saw natasha hanging on oliver arm across the street and laughing at some witty thing she said oliver was laughing lightly and then he saw me he sent me a concerned look before natasha caught sight of me too and dragged him away i think he felt bad that i was alone he kept looking back over his shoulder at me as i stood in the snow and natasha kept trying to keep his attention finally she stopped the both of them grabbed him by the ears and kissed him not to mention sending me an evil smirk before hand i kinda panicked i turned on my heel and here i am i had forgotten my gloves again and shoved my hands in my pocket it the one i wore to hogsmeade over break you know the old black petticoat and oliver gloves were still in the pockets i am truly pathetic griffindor chaser and i canteven find a lousy date for a lousy hogsmeade trip ugh well such is a life as a bell 8 pm funny world this is one moment i sitting on a tree stump and the next i sitting in the three broomsticks with cedric diggory that has got to be the definition of weird um are you ok it was around three and i was still sitting on that tree stump playing with the snow with my feet i looked up and there was diggory i smiled or made an attempt to smile god knows what it looked like yeah i ok alone on valentine day he smiled how the hell did he know oh yeah i was sitting on a tree stump alone letting the snow collect on my shoulders that just might give it away rubbing it in i smiled he laughed lightly and shrugged his shoulders stuffing his hands in his pockets i looked at my own hands which were warm in oliver large gloves say he said breaking the silence you want to go get a butter beer at the three broomsticks i looked over to the busy streets of hogsmeade saw couples with their arms linked and laughing i knew alicia and george were somewhere in there angelina and fred too maybe even oliver and natasha one butter beer couldnthurt right love to i smiled he offered me his hand and helped me up off my pathetic tree stump and we walked back to hogsmeade i ll tell you i never got more looks than i did then just think me and cedric diggory walking down the streets of hogsmeade together on valentine day almost any girl would sell their soul to be where i was but honestly i would ve traded spots with any one of them it not like it was a date it not like we were a couple we just didntwant to be seen alone on valentine day it not like we were holding hands or anything i ll be right back cedric said going to get some butter beers we had found a raised table and stools near the front of the pub near the large window while he was gone i took off my coat and gloves and stared out the window cedric came back in five minutes with the drinks i wrapped my hands around the warm mug and took a few sips my eyes not leaving the window you look great you know cedric said softly i snapped out of my little trance and snapped my head towards him what the hell i looked down at my clothes i was wearing the sweater mrs weasley made with a pair of jeans and converse not to mention my hair it was down but my sandy blonde hair was in a bun last night so it was really wavy and really messy i was barely wearing any makeup nothing flattering i swear hu i wasntsure if i was hearing right was cedric diggory hitting on me no it couldntbe i said you look great oh my god he was oh i said surprised thank you er you look nice too not really though well a little his hair was really messy i mean oliver always is but when his hair is neat which is close to never you always have the urge to mess it back up cedric didnthave that kind of hair he couldntpull it off uh thanks katie he said there was a long pause i mean a really long pause good luck on your next match he finally said i know you ll do great yeah i said realized i didnthave to break the silence we ve been working really hard i know cedric agreed wood got the pitch booked almost every night it hard for everyone else to find a day to practice i think that what he going for hell i was probably right either that or he wants to run us into the ground before we play ravenclaw i heard harry got a firebolt he said this like he forgot about it if oliver was here he d say something like dontyou dare tell him anything bell or i ll bench you through the whole match like he has another chaser please yeah i said in an offhand way shrugging my shoulders even if my captain was dating a little prick i wasntgoing to let him down cho ll find a way around it though was he seriously thinking someone could get around a firebolt and on a comet 2 60 none the less you think i was going to entertain him i mean better than spending valentine day alone again he nodded cho a great flyer really yeah a real book wiz too wait a second he just hit on me two seconds ago and now he praising cho what the fudge you dontsay he nodded again did you know she volunteered at an animal shelter over the summer a real do good er hu yup for pete sake why didnthe just date her why was he sitting in the three broomsticks with me i took one large gulp of butter beer emptying the mug boy that stuff is hot take my word for it you want another one cedric asked looking at our empty mugs er oliver would kill me if i had two always going on about how un nutritious i am no i good well he got up and grabbed our mugs i going to get another be right back i sighed as he walked away once again i stared out the window i watched all the couple walk by their cheeks all red from the cold laughing as it got darker outside i hate valentine day i thought then i saw something that made me jump oliver walking quickly down the street alone why the hell is he alone where was natasha then he looked over to where i was sitting and i guess he saw me because he started jogging to the pub i looked around the pub as the bell rang as he walked in no natasha waiting for him in here hey kat he said smiling as he sat down in cedric chair where natasha i asked what the hell was he doing here back at that tea shop i think he answered still smiling now that didntmake sense so why arentyou with her i was very confused by the whole situation he shrugged his shoulders i guess i realized i didntwant to be there and he cupped his hand over mine oh cedric came back that very instant he looked from me to oliver to his hand cupped over mine and then back at me it was oliver turn to oh i guess i came at a bad time oliver said he looked hurt and he stood up and walked out of the pub i looked back at cedric and then out the window to where oliver was walking in the street with his head hung low i watched him until he was out of my sight i felt terrible i looked back at cedric i sorry i said standing up and putting back on my coat thank you so much but i really have to go i rummaged through my pockets and found a few sickles here i shoved the money in his hand i sure you and cho ll make a great couple someday and i ran out the door but by then it was snowing really hard it was getting dark and most of the student were heading back i could barely see the buildings down the street oliver i called as the street lamps clicked on i looked at my watch 5 50 i had to be back at the school by 7 damn it oliver i walked down the street calling his name with my hands cupped around katie i spun around for a split second i thought it was oliver instead it was fred and angelina oh i sighed disappointed it just you two not good enough for you now kates fred asked by the way i heard you were with diggory wood going to kill you for fraternizing with the enemy angelina pointed out but good going she sent me a congratulatory wink but all of this went over my head yeah yeah yeah have you seen oliver forget to give him a valentine day kiss fred asked smirking of course not i lied well it wasnta lie but my excuse was he forgot his gloves i held them up you are a terrible liar bell i know where is he they shrugged their shoulders and i continued to run down the street at the last building i completely gave up i had so many things running through my head i completely collapsed plus i still had that transfig essay due i slumped over to the stoop and sat down i curled my legs up to my chest and hugging them i let my chin rest on my knees i didntknow what to do 1 oliver was dating a prick 2 oliver world suddenly revolved around the prick 3 valentine day 4 i didnthave a date 5 everyone else had a date 6 i still didnthave a date 7 i spent the better part of it alone sitting on a stump 8 diggory hits on me 9 soon after diggory hits on me he becomes completely obsessed with cho 10 oliver ditches the prick 11 oliver ditches the prick to spend valentine with me 12 soon after oliver ditches the prick to be with me on valentine s cedric comes back 13 soon after cedric comes back oliver runs out the door 14 now i sitting on a stoop alone again 15 i still have that essay due yeah with all that running through your head i bet you would breakdown too i just cantcatch a break i screamed out and then buried my head in my knees yeah me neither someone sigh as they sat down next to me my head snapped up and there was oliver oliver i shrieked in a very odd manner throwing my arms across him he just chuckled and i pulled away i rummaged through my pockets and took out his gloves you forgot these he laughed and took them out my hands have fun with diggory i looked at him his eyebrow was cocked and he was smiling crookedly his hair as messy as ever i smiled before punching him playfully on the shoulder you have a bad valentine day too he asked sighing i sighed too you couldnttell well yeah he answered but that why i went to go find you to rub it in he chuckled no one deserves to have a bad valentine day well i kinda did how so i spent half the day sitting on a stump in the snow and a quarter of it listening to diggory talk about chang i said does that sound like a good day he chuckled i cantsay it does there was a pause and i had to ask what happened to natasha he sighed i told you i realized i didntwant to be there i had to ask another question why because i realized she one of the biggest pricks alive he answered looking out to the falling snow i was so happy i threw my arms around him again and then pulled away after a while what was that for he chuckled it took you like a month to realize how terrible she is i think i threw my hands in the air god damn it why doesntanybody ever slap me you ve thought so this whole time of course even fred and george knew he scratched the back of his head so either i completely oblivious or have the worst taste in girls well i said the first one i completely agree with especially with sarcasm and susie wasntthat bad last year he chuckled again but why didntyou tell me i shrugged my shoulders because you seemed so happy hell you even cut practice short for her he smiled i did didnti so when did your brain kick in and say she an idiot after i saw you standing in the snow alone he said softly oh i paused sorry for ruining it for you he laughed lightly sorry for ruining it kat you saved from another few months from that thing i shrugged my shoulders that why i here he looked like he was going to say something else but at that moment fred and angelina along with george and alicia came up to us thank god fred said his arm linked with angelina s he finally ditched that bug praise the lord angelina agreed oliver stood up and offered me his hand she was that bad hu he chuckled yes we all chorused firmly how bout around of butter beers on me george asked so we all headed back to the three broomsticks oliver hand around my waist maybe this valentine day wasntso bad after all except i still have to finish that paper haha a long chappie for your enjoyment i hope you liked it even though it was a little choppy not one of my best but tell me what you think anyway and remember to go read that other story and send me an email or review you know how it goes eeeeeeeeee reviews love them all i glad all of you loved that when did your brain kick in bit not to mention all the fluffiness and i have lots more fluffy ideas either in this chap or the next depends on where i go with this but there will be a certain scene with lots of george alicia fluff which we all love and i know it been ages since i updated i so sorry february 15 saturday noon i was walking through the halls towards the library when some 6th year girl called me a whore she said something like how dare i go out with diggory and wood in one day especially on valentine blah blah blah let just say she sitting in the hospital wing with elephant ears and a bunny tail with a bloody nose my fist might have accidentally found february 18 tuesday after practice ugh as the amount of days till the end of the month aka the match get smaller so does oliver patience how many times do i have to tell you to stop harassing my chasers so all of a sudden we re property he means well though bell fly right or get out of the air then again bell ok it on well maybe instead of just screaming you could tell me what i doing wrong wood once again he came up with this impossibly hard play and was expecting us to get it right on the first try did i mention he was wearing the shirt i got him for christmas how right that thing is sometimes your flying like a two year old that what your doing wrong i think it that time of the month fred said to his twin yeah george agreed for the both of them i mean for your information it isn t i spat at them and that no reason to blame a certain chaser for screaming at a certain pig headed captain now i pig headed oliver screamed back yeah ok that was a little lame i guess when you looked in the mirror you over looked your pig snout and gigantic ego that little comeback came full with hand gestures me making a pig nose and all ok maybe that was lame too maybe double practice he declared and everyone else groaned but did he seriously think that was going to stop me the queen of all that is stubborn no way i ll stay out here for triple practice now i was being unreasonable i hope you re up to 6 hours bell hell i ll stay out here all night but at that moment the rest of the team slapped their hands over my mouth five separate pairs of hands clamped over your mouth isntsomething one would like to experience what was that bell oliver asked triumphantly i would ve screamed something witty and sarcastic back but i did have ten hands covering my mouth nothing fred answered for me she was just saying how much she was looking forward to it alicia said and what a good captain you are way to suck up harry and how talented you are you too angelina you too and how much fun we re going to have ok george that was a little over the top that what i thought she said and he flew back to the hoops i just glared at his back the rest of our double practice mainly consisted at oliver countinously yelling at us me in particular but i kept my composure and only threw him dirty looks instead of starting another row february 19 wednesday after practice you ll never guess what i found today guess all you want because you ll never ever get the right answer no it wasntoliver sitting in the library with some random girl do you really want to know what it was alicia and george snogging in the locker room ok there i said it i feel so much better now i ll tell you what happened we had practice and i decided to get there a little earlier and beg oliver not to take his anger from yesterday out on the team again some may call it sucking up but it can save lives especially when oliver and quidditch are thrown in together not to mention a little prematch kill your team nervousness so i finally made it to the fourth floor of the pitch that where the griffindor locker rooms are i had sprinted all four flights of stairs and luckily i decided to sit down and take a bit of a breather outside the locker room trying to compose myself for the life saving job i was about to endure when i heard some peculiar noises i realized the locker room door was cracked open just the slightest bit to peer an eye through so of course i did i stood up and peered through and there was alicia and george snogging on the bench the dogs i backed up to the railing along the landing my hand clamped over my mouth praying that they didntsee me i was grinning form ear to ear kat this was not one of my finest moments all adrenalined up from happy giddiness and cautiousness not to get caught i was extra jumpy so when oliver called my name from the next landing down i kinda fell down there you see i jumped up so high i kinda fell back over the banister did i mention i landed on top of him i am so sorry i said thanks for breaking my fall though it was true i was currently sitting in his lap he chuckled dontworry about it so i got up and offered him a hand thanks i guess he suddenly remembered yesterday practice because he got all mad on me he pushed past me on the small landing and headed up the stairs to the locker room leavening me still standing on that stupid landing you re going to be late bell i sighed before i remembered what a certain couple was doing in there at the current mood oliver was in their heads would soon be mounted on his wall wait i screamed sprinting after him and scrambling in front of him you dontwant to go up there i had one hand on the wall and another on the banister blocking his path and why not bell er fred and george set off a stink bomb i lied bell you re a terrible liar he tried to get past but i wouldntlet him well i searched for an excuse doesntfred socks smell like a stink bomb oliver just stared at me in all his angry captain glory doesntit i force a fake laugh and sighed as he pushed me out of his way and continued to go up the stairs then i realized he was like five steps away from uncovering my new favorite couple so i did what any true friend would i practically flew up the stairs and jumped on his back bell he screamed at me trying to catch his balance what the hell do you think you re do that when he fell backwards and we both fell down the stairs why donti ever see any of this coming but this time i landed on top of him for the second time today bell he growled i prayed alicia and george heard the large noise and decided to stop their fun i am such a good friend katie i turned around and looked up at the landing that connects to the locker room there was alicia bright red and george if possible even redder oh i smiled meekly hey guys do you plan to get off me anytime soon bell jez those two owe me big for this one and i mean big like give me chocolate every time i have a craving for the stuff and i cantbelieve oliver was still mad at me well yes i can but that not the point i told you wood giving him back the same edginess fred sent off a stink bomb in the locker room i said that last part loud enough for alicia and george to hear too praying they would get the hint i turned around just enough to see george pull something out of his robes and throw it into the locker room god bless his soul because if he didntcatch on i would have his head before oliver yeah alicia covered smells terrible then why were you in there spinnet oliver oliver oliver if only you knew you just might be as happy as me but probably not she was helping me george helped why the hell would she do you plan to get off me anytime soon bell so i got off of him before he started blowing fire out of his nose and incinerated my eyebrows but this time i didntoffer him a hand up you know wood some girls are sensitive about their weight i said towering over him menacingly and if you do catch them at the wrong time of the month you ll be sensitive about you re broken nose and with that i stormed up to the locker room landing so what is that like two incredibly bad comebacks in two days but i think it had the right effect because he didnteven criticize me all practice all in all i think it was a good practice february 21 friday history of magic so i gave alicia some breathing time before i started playing a gillion questions with her but of course i was going to do this note style so how george fine i guess why dontyou ask him yourself i would but i haventbeen able to find him i think you would know best since you two were snogging before practice on wednesday he told you of course not then how do you know i thought you were supposed to be the smartest witch in our grade katie alright alright i caught you you sly dogs how well let just say peculiar noises were emitting from the locker room oh my god dontworry i haventtold anyone you haven t of course not i even saved both your heads from being mounted on oliver wall no you didn t of course i did you two were just lucky i got to the locker room before oliver that why you were laying on top of him well we kinda fell down the stairs what were you holding hands lic he was about to go into the locker room so i stopped him how by jumping on his back no comment i always wondered bout you two hey this interrogation note is on you about a certain spinnet snogging a certain weasley not some non existent relation between me and oliver i never said anything about a relationship are you hiding something from me katie you think you re so sly oh but i am stop beating around the bush and tell me everything what bush it a saying i know it just fun to make you lose it it even funnier when it a note lose what katie what you and oliver are so meant for each other lic well it true ask anyone so then she sent me this a few minutes later do think katie bell and oliver wood deserve each other of course and attached to that was take that katie so i sent her this who did you ask some random guy sitting next to me lic what sometimes you re worse than me you wish i ve taught you so well it brings tears to my eyes oh please but you really have to stop the denial act what denial act about you and oliver there is no act sure there isnt hey sarcasm is my job butt out but really katie even though he is married to quidditch i sure he would take a break from his relationship to be with you deep down i sure he really nice so quit the act and commit commit to what like i even have time to commit to anything other than school and quidditch i barely have time to commit to eating and sleeping come one katie stop lying you know you like him 1 have you ever noticed the fact that i cantlie to save my life 2 i d rather commit some time to eating and sleeping before some guy 3 have you not notice that oliver only calls me bell and that he only calls my name to yell at me or pass some food at meals bell cantyou fly any better than that pass the butter bell 4 how did this note go from me asking you about george to you asking me about oliver hmm dontknow about the last one but i am enjoying this i giving you to the end of the day to tell angelina then i am and everybody else i can find alright but when will you go out with oliver ok i stopping this she sent me a few other little i m just sending these to pester you notes which i crumpled up and chucked at her how can one note form into that question the note wasnteven about me it was about her but then she had to go and change everything around she better tell angelina soon so i finally got alicia and george together sigh alright bring on the reviews telling me i better get katie and oliver together asap c mon i waiting haha reviews i love you all sooooooooooooooooo much and of course there going to be lots more fluffiness and so you know i had this chap finished the day i posted the last but i made sure everything was as close to perfect as possible mahahahahaha february 27 friday lunch ok as of now it is physically impossible to even talk to oliver without him screaming at you telling you how to fly better even if we re no where near the pitch he canteven look out that window in the library if he sees the pitch he gets all jumpy so we re completely avoiding looking out any westward windows that where the pitch is 9 pm oliver i had finally made the decision to try and pry oliver out of his captain office after dinner it been his official hide out all week and i had brought a secret weapon he was currently pouring over plays i donteven think he heard me ol what do you want bell he snapped glaring at me for a second like i was going to back down i just cocked an eyebrow and smiled ever so slightly he hung his head i sorry he sighed and looked back up at me i ve been a real prick all week haventi i pretended to think and then shrugged my shoulders just a little oliver i sorry he hung his head it just the match i finished for him the game that either makes us or breaks us the match that puts us in the finals and the match we need to win to get the cup your last shot i know he looked back over the play in front of him you know that not going to do you any good he slumped back in his chair i know he sighed but but nothing we know all the plays by heart we ve had them pounding into our heads twenty four seven for three months we know them oliver he sighed again but can you do them i nearly dropped the box containing my secret weapon are you kidding me oliver i could do all the plays in my sleep he smiled and sat back up i know you can but there more than one person in the air really i said sarcastically all these years i thought i was the only one out there but then i do recall someone yelling at me not to fly like i was two he chuckled boy i am bad arenti i smiled you want to win i shrugged my shoulders nothing wrong with that he slumped back in his chair again what that he was looking at the white box tied with red string i was holding classic italian cookie box hey i almost 90 italian but my great grandpa had the name bell so i stuck with something completely non italian but i had to do my grandma proud full italian wanted me to go to an italian wizarding school i had no problem with that but my dad on the other hand anyway what this i held up the box yeah you didntbring me cookies did you he asked with one eyebrow cocked i sighed and walked over to his desk and put it down even i know better than that i undid the string and opened the box to reveal the gods of all gods you didn t oliver said smiling over my famous chocolate covered strawberries i took one out of the 18 i made and took a bite well i made 20 but i ate two before tying the box i sorry but when a chocolate crave kicks in you cantjust ignore it c mon oliver i said swallowing there good you couldnthave just gotten me regular strawberries oliver i groaned you god damn nutritious kilt wearing son of a bitch captain just eat the god damn chocolate i was yelling but i was smiling i didntwant to but when you just finished off a chocolate covered strawberry you canthelp it he just chuckled and finally picked one up and took a bite he didntsay how grand of an idea it was to combine both great worlds chocolate and fruit he didntsay how wonderful my home made sweets were he didntneed to say it you knew he loved it we polished off the box in half an hour so will you finally come out of this dump i was sitting on his desk the empty box next to me he sighed and looked around the scarlet room maybe i looked around too even though i had been criticized so many times in this place i knew it by heart there was a big white board on one wall where the new team play was currently residing on the opposite wall there was plays tacked over every inch and behind his desk was a huge griffindor flag everything here was business and oliver business was quidditch but there was one thing that caught my eye a picture on his desk it was of us last year after we beat slytherin up in the air someone must ve taken it from the stands we were all red in the face our hair completely wild but smiling so hard you would ve thought our heads werentbig enough to hold our grins and we all had our arms around each other shoulders boy if only we could beat slytherin in the finals then oliver would have a picture exactly the same but with a large silver cup in our hands what are you smiling about oliver asked i snapped out of my little trance i guess i was smiling what am i not allowed to smile he got up not tomorrow in the air and he walked out i sighed but followed him out at least i got him out of that place february 28 saturday 6 am holy fudge i am so nervous i dontthink i can climb out of bed i think i hyperventilating well a little nervousness never hurt any one better than being completely calm then you move and angelina are up too angelina staring at the ceiling and alicia is staring out the window towards the pitch go i hope we win for all our sake s especially oliver s after the match like 3 in the morning we won we won we won holy fudge i canttell you how good i feel the adrenaline is just starting to leave so i better finish writing before i completely fall apart and go to sleep again nervous alicia asked me after i finished writing this morning i took a shaky deep breath uh hu well angelina said coming to sit on my bed at least we got a firebolt that only gives me so much comfort room there always a chance they could win no matter what broom we have it true ask anyone yeah alicia agreed but we do have the best team and we re so close angelina pointed out and alicia blushed alicia did manage to tell her before i shouted the big news to the rooftops hell i said oliver would glue us together if he had the chance they laughed lightly better to bring the team together angelina said in oliver scottish accent actually it was really good we decided to get into our quidditch robes and had down to the great hall at around seven most of the team was there already and oliver was beaming over the firebolt laid out on the table everybody came over people from hufflepuff and ravenclaw even a few slytherins discreetly lingered over to get a look at it no doubt reporting the news to their captain the scum bag more commonly known as flint cedric came over too and left after congratulating harry for getting such a great broom but not before sending me a glance why doesnthe just date cho for pete sake and percy practically gave us orders to win oh we ll win but not because he said so the little prick malfoy came over and started some lame attempt to put us down more specifically harry but with a broom like that how could you we all laughed as he sulked away defeated harry had some snappy comeback but i was dazing out and just joined in the howling laughter everyone else had started quarter to eleven we all marched out towards the pitch feeling slightly better with the firebolt in our midst god bless that thing and who ever sent it to him so we finally got out there after oliver pre game pep talk and oliver shook hands with davies more like glaring at him but whatever but i did notice harry looking at cho diggory better hurry up and snag her before harry does i quickly turned my attention back to madame hooch who i just caught giving the command to kick off i swear harry broom went like twenty feet higher than mine and three times as fast i came up with the quaffle and lee was going on about the firebolt you d think he was advertising for the thing i scored the first goal when we all saw harry dive for the snitch but a bludger came out of nowhere and he had to veer of course and the thing got away but george sent his compliments to the other beater with a second bludger that made him roll over to avoid it ha ha ha and we even were able to pull off several of oliver plays even the one where the twins sent me through the hoop it went a lot smoother than it did in practice probably because the keeper didntget in my way even upside down i could see oliver punch the air from the other side of the pitch what the hell kind of play was that lee asked in awe over the mic how d she pull that one off my god one of wood crazy plays i guess boy did he guess right by then it was 80 0 us and lee continued to advertise for the firebolt and mcgonagall almost stole the magical mic from him but ravenclaw was pulling back and we were only 50 points ahead by now oliver getting antsy harry this is no time to be a gentleman oliver roared from his goal posts as cho blocked harry again knock her off her broom if you have to i let out a small laugh as we headed to the ravenclaw goal posts good ol oliver then harry pulled off this perfect feint and streaked with us to the goal posts well more like ahead of us that thing is fast then tree dementors came out onto the field and angelina nearly dropped the quaffle at the sight of them but it was different it didntget cold and the joy wasntsucked out of the stadium then harry pulled his wand out of no where and sent a silver spell at them they fell to the ground and harry caught the snitch with his wand still in his hand angelina chucked the quaffle in the air and we all raced towards harry me alicia and angelina all kissed that blessed kid fred and george almost knocked him out and all the while oliver was shouting that my boy how we ever got to the ground i have no idea we must ve been some sight though i was half way off my broom for the whole time and alicia almost fell of but george caught her at the last second no matter what anyone says they will always make a cute couple i worried about them someone had just finished congratulating me and fred had come up behind me what do you mean i looked over to george and alicia who were currently kissing in a group of onlookers who were ooooooooooh ing they make a great couple anyone who says otherwise is crazy fred laughed try telling that to oliver he ll be the crazy one i laughed too and then weaved my way through the crowd to go and find him everyone was slapping me on the back so hard i thought i would get knocked over then someone picked me up by the waist and spun me around in a circle once my feet were back on the ground i realized it was oliver there you are i said i ve been try to find you but he cut me off he practically lifted me off the ground by my ears and kissed me what a dozy that one was my legs were even shaker than before the match i didnteven think that was possible w wha what happened about no smiling on the pitch today i stammered smiling what poetry flows out of my mouth i swear he chuckled i said in the air i shrugged one of my shoulders and smiled well if you want to get technical about it then he drew his arms around me and kissed me again i returned it snaking my arms around his neck if only the cup was there that my only complaint it was pretty god damn close to perfect though lemme tell you that come on he wrapped an arm around my waist after wards fred and george have a party set up already i put an arm around him well i would hope so he chuckled and guided me back to the common donteven get me started on the party butter beers and candy galore we even stuffed a few chocolate frogs down oliver thought hell it lasted to one in the morning how fred and george nicked all that stuff is still a mystery to me though i did hear them say thanks to goony thongs wumwhirl and sadsoot to harry what ever the hell that means i ll figure it out later mcgonagall came in around one in the morning screaming at all of us to get to bed half the people stayed for another half an hour but at 2 me oliver alicia angelina fred and george were the only ones sprawled out in the common room still on our quidditch robes alicia was in george lap on one of the arm chairs i was leaning on oliver shoulder curled up in a ball with his arm wrapped around me on the couch angelina was sitting on the couch too with fred propped up against her legs sitting on the floor i dontknow about you two oliver said to alicia and george my god what a hypocrite my hypocrite though all mine back off fan girls coming from the man with kates in his arms george said i had drifted off for a bit but woke up at the mention of my name hu we re just going on about how oliver is the biggest hypocrite in the world fred said from the floor i stifled a small yawn hm oh yeah i nestled into him placed a hand on his chest and yawned again the biggest what oliver asked in disbelief and we all groaned no i not come on oliver angelina said donteat junk food how many butter beers did you have today dontget detention fred mocked i remember you getting detention for telling off mcgonagall about the firebolt don t alicia started hey that enough i laughed but how right they were thank you oliver said i smiled slyly oh i couldntresist dontget sick for practice now who went out flying at five in the morning in january alright oliver groaned you guys win he chuckled and gave me a peck on my temple i just smiled contently and closed my eyes i dontknow how long it was it could ve been an hour or five minutes but oliver was shaking me gently c mon i moaned five more minutes and i nestled into him deeper i would not be moved kat oliver groaned come on you have to get to bed no i yawned my eyes still closed you are so stubborn yeah i yawned again i know fine he protested i ll just have to carry you try your best you ll never be able to move my fat carcass oliver wood but he did in one swift motion i went from sitting contently sleeping on the couch to slung over his shoulder wide awake how many times do i have to tell you you re not fat he said once i was hanging over his shoulders oliver i think i woke up half the tower but he didntput me down though he carried me all the way up to my dorm where he put me down on my bed well more like er i said looking at my quilted bed next to the one i was currently laying on this isntmine oliver rolled his eyes smiling well i ll just have to fix that so in another swift motion i went from laying on angelina bed to back into oliver arms but in the more romantic newly wed style mush preferable to over the shoulder so which one yours he asked that one i nodded towards my quilted one my arms wrapped around his neck are those lions quilted on it yes i groaned my grandma yes the italian one quilted a scarlet and gold quilt when she found out i was in griffindor way back in my 1st year there were gold and scarlet squares where there was a scarlet square there was a gold lion and visa versa i like it he smiled putting me down on the right bed dontlie to me oliver he brushed his lips over mine never and he walked quietly out the door i laid there for a while my heart absolutely swelling with happiness then i realized i was still in my quidditch robes and i had to get up and change into my pajamas that kinda ruined oliver bed time tuck in oh well if he asks i ll just say i fell asleep in them by accident like he wontpick up on my lie well did i deliver did i give you the chapter you all have been bugging me for did i make you proud oh and i might throw in a black tie party maybe because it fun to dress everybody up but i donthave a good excuse to have one so ideas are welcome but i dontwant anybody saying the yule ball because that only in the tri wizarding tournament thingy but anything else i completely open to and either a yes or no to the black tie thingy well hope you all liked my last little chappie now on to the next which is sure to have lots of fluff eats peanut butter and fluff sandwich told you so ok i ll stop my pathetic excuse for a joke and just write the chap february 29 sunday 11 am katie and oliver sitting in a tree k i s s i n g alicia and angelina can sing that aaaaaaaaalllllllllllllll day long it just makes me all the happier because it true ok well maybe not the tree part but the other part is who came up with that song anyway i mean who would kiss in a tree i would if i could somehow drag oliver up into a tree wow weird image very weird will you two shut it i threw a pillow at the singing duo laughing it was like seven in the morning and they woke me up by singing their new theme song no angelina said simply it just too much fun alicia said fixing her now messy hair you re just jealous i laughed no i not alicia protested laughing as well i ve got georgie holy fudge here come the pet names lord help me and i ve got fred angelina said me and alicia just stared at her when the hell did that happen i asked demandingly she scratched her arm er i guess she let a little something slip that she didntwant us to know but did she really think we d drop it tell me i demanded fess up come on ange tell us alicia pleaded sure alicia goes for the please please please point with all the sugar and cherries on top and i go for the i your best friend and i declare you tell me now part with both ends covered no way was she going to snake out of this one alright after you got carried upstairs and alicia and george went to bed right after she confessed i knew it alicia shouted i looked at her no you didn t well she started i would like to think so i sighed wouldntwe all i threw another pillow at angelina damn you you re so discreet woman angelina laughed and then the pillow fight started how many people can say they ve had a pillow fight at 7 in the morning well three griffindors can officially say they have what happened to you oliver asked as i sat down next to him on the couch i smiled as he kissed me on my temple them i nodded my head towards alicia and angelina direction who were snickering little demons twiggy over there can swing a pillow really hard if she wants to i got her back though hehehe a quarter past us pillow fighters decided to trudge down stairs into the common room and yes we were still clad in our p j s hey i like my pajamas they re all comfy and not to mention probably he messiest hair ever seen in history new thing to go into hogwarts a history hehehe oliver chuckled and put his arm around me and i nestled in a ball into him and so we all started talking about the match and all then i started to drift off again remembering i only running on three hours of sleep so now we play slytherin oliver said once we ran over the whole entire game twice everyone groaned we knew what hell we were about to go through we have made it to the final match the last two years but have always lost using our reserve keeper you see harry needs to save the school and world every year so he just spends the final match unconscious in the hospital wing and every year the practices leading up to the final match get harder and harder not to mention two hours longer what oliver asked after we were finish groaning just no more six hour practices at dawn i said ok he smiled at me ok kat i know he going to give us one though probably ten or more and then he ll be sitting on the ground sipping hot coco yelling at us to fly better but at the end of it he ll be smiling from ear to ear and surprise us with an extra thermos of hot coco and six other mugs thirty minutes later fred got up and stretched in his too short pajamas come on he said helping angelina up let get something to eat i starving here here the rest of us chanted laughing all the way down the grand staircase i could only think of coffee the precious elixir that would be waiting for me the second i sat down and at that second i sat down and took a sip my brain finally kicked in and informed the rest of me that i still in my pajamas i still in my pajamas i cried once i downed a bit of coffee both alicia and angelina looked down yup they were still in theirs too i wasntso bad gold and scarlet plaid pants with a long sleeved gold tee on i was thanking the gods that i was too lazy to take off my sports bra last night could be worse i suppose alicia had it bad though mint green pants and a light pink tee well that would ve been bad for me oh my god angelina cried we were all in our pajamas even oliver and the twins i laughed i dontsee what so funny alicia said i couldntstop i think i looked like a madman or madwoman but then oliver and the twins joined in angelina looked at them and started up too even alicia laughed by then the whole great hall was staring at us and we discreetly left with everyone staring at us discreetly is official absent from our vocabulary but i think everybody else already knows that 10 pm i so doomed i so doomed on so many different levels i guess i forgot to mention that i have this huge and i mean huge potions test tomorrow and it was only luck that i heard some hufflepuffs mumbling about it in the hall that i remembered so from 12 to like 1 i was sitting in the library with alicia and angelina but then around 1 the twins came and whisked my brains away damn them with their damn witty charming twin ish charm damn it so by 2 30 i was mumbling to myself my head cradled in my hands starring at the pages of my textbook with nothing sinking in damn potions test from damn sniveling damn serverus damn snape damn why does he hate us so i think he gave us this stupid test to get us stressed before the match and even if we did good our weekend would be done for with this damn test damn greasy haired damned potions master giving out damn tests out from under his damn greasy nose so are you just going to sit hear and curse under your breath all day some asked placing a hand on my shoulder i turned in my seat and looked up at oliver damn snape gave us a damn test tomorrow i said with probably the biggest puppy eyes ever do puppy eyes and cursing go pfft probably not and you want me to help you he was smiling mischievously what was he up to i nodded a couple of times puppy eyes full force he looked up at the ceiling well it going to cost more than puppy eyes i rolled my eyes and sighed smiling dropping the puppy eyes and looking up at him now he was doing puppy eyes at me damn him so i stood up and wrapped my arms around his neck and gave him a kiss damn him and his damn puppy eyes but then that nazi of a librarian came over and hit oliver on the back of the head with a yard stick we broke apart his hands still on my waist and mine on his shoulders she was saying something along the lines of how dare you two kiss in the library a library is a place of reading and studying blah blah blah we watched her walk away and i was wondering how the hell did she catch us i mean we were right at our favorite spot completely out of her line of vision was she stalking us or something i think she hates couples because wait couple i a couple with oliver holy fudge why didntthat kick in before my day cantget any better unless snape cancels the test tomorrow and the cup just so happens to be there and oliver too and we just beat slytherin in the finals ok so maybe there a long list for a perfect day but it ll happen somehow anyway as i was saying ok maybe more like writing i think she hates couples because she was never actually part of one that has got to be the source of her problem maybe we should get her and mr filch together oh the images that are running around in my head now holy fudge they just jumped like three level up in a relationship i scarred for life get out of my head i ll never be able to look at those two again ever anyway so me and oliver watched her march back to her desk which was thankfully out of our vision because with the images in my head now it was possible that i would get sick all over oliver then we looked at each other his hands still on my hips and mine around his neck and i realized he has the most handsome eyes ever hell everything about him is handsome and cute and anything else positive you would like to insert here so he said smiling crookedly twiddling his fingers on my hips which actually tickled potions test i turned around and looked at my books yup need some help i looked back at him it can wait right he chuckled no kat it a bunch of books i sure they re not going any where i protested he chuckled again but your test isnteither it going to be there tomorrow he pointed out so keep reminding me why dontyou i perfectly fine right here so i gave him puppy eyes come on puppy eyes work work damn you work they didntwork he just chuckled again grabbed my hand and dragged me back to my torture i have got to get lessons for puppy eyes lic ll teach me that girl is the queen of all puppy eyes once she puppy eyed me until i gave her chocolate and it was a lot of chocolate do have any idea how hard it is to get chocolate from me almost impossible alright i groaned and i sat next to him so what dontyou understand he asked smiling i threw a dirty look in the direction of my potions books damn those things then i looked back at him not with a dirty look though everything he chuckled and we spent the better part of the day studying well maybe it was more like oliver spending the better part of the day trying to re teach me meaningless crap i dontunderstand why i dontunderstand potions i said after three hours of studying potions by then it was around three and we were just heading back to the common room maybe if you paid attention in class you would understand it he pointed out well maybe if snape nose wasntso damn greasy it wouldntreflect the light into my face blinding me from the chalkboard i pointed out he chuckled well i guess you cantargued with those facts no no you can t i smiled readjusting my bag on my shoulder here let me take that he tried taking my bag away no i protested i got it why dontyou ever let me take your bag he sighed because i fully capable of doing it myself i smirked you re so stubborn yeah i sighed dreamily basically at myself i know he chuckled and we continued to walk down the hall then i heard peculiar noises coming from behind the tapestry of the lion and snake fighting the lion was winning of course but anyway do you hear that oliver asked me the peculiar noises sounded somehow similar and i smirked like no other only the twins and the rest of us knew that passage you dontthink they would oliver asked me in a whisper would they would you i asked shrugging my shoulders whispering back he smiled only with you oh my god he so cute i smiled back and then walked over to the tapestry should i he thought for a second well i got hit with a yard stick i smirked and turned back to the tapestry you know i said pulling it back you two should really be more quiet and i stopped dead you see it wasntalicia or angelina with one of the twins it was a couple of fourth year ravenclaws and they were just staring at me with big little kid eyes so they re actually only a year younger than me but they re little kids with big little kid eyes staring at me do you know how awkward that is b be because there are classes in this hall during the week i recovered and you two are really loud how do expect anyone to concentrate so now i a preaching nun or at least i sounded like one if they felt stupid imagine how i felt so they stopped holding onto each other for what looked like for dear life and walked past me mumbling their apologies so they walked away no doubt to go find somewhere else to snog and i was standing there still holding the tapestry back looking like the biggest idiot in the world and a preaching nun well oliver said now standing behind me i think that went well i groaned and went into the little passage dropping the tapestry in front of oliver i sat down on the cold floor with my back against the wall my bag thrown on the floor next to me it was a good cover though oliver said holding the tapestry back i just banged my head against the wall behind me i should be a nun there are classes in the week and you re kissing really loud i made fun of myself a new low he sat down next to me dontyou dare go and be a nun i looked up at the ceiling why not i already have the preaching down because then i cantdo this before i knew it i was completely wrapped in his arms and he was kissing me i seriously need a slow mo of all of this so at least have an idea how all of this stuff happens i mean one second i trying to find oliver in a crowd of people the next he kissing me one second i asleep on the couch next thing i know i slung over his shoulder another second i preaching to fourth years the next he kissing me again no complaints though honestly i wrapped my arms around his neck well maybe i wontbe a nun after all i think that a very wise choice i laughed and kissed him then tapestry was pushed back and the light from the corridor filled the little inlet we instantly broke apart to see none other than fred i screamed at the devil of a twin yes kates he asked smirking then i realized angelina was linked in his arm i know how those fourth years feel wh what the i didntknow what to say you laugh really loud katie angelina said i banged my head against the wall again and oliver chuckled cantyou two find somewhere else oliver asked but this is my spot fred protested fred how many girlfriends have you had i asked he just pulled angelina closer to him does it really matter yeah oliver said it does because we re officially taking over next thing i knew he was kissing me sloppily i really need a slow mo machine i heard fred groan and angelina giggle then the light from the corridor disappeared the second they were gone he stopped well at least they re gone i tucked a lock of hair behind me ear and gave out a small laugh for now at least he was about to kiss me again when my stomach growled my body always finds a way to ruin things did you skip lunch again he asked i was studying i protested then his stomach growled too and i laughed speak for your self come on he chuckled getting up and offering me a hand which i gratefully took let go to the kitchens good idea i agreed i bent down to grab my bag but he was quicker damn him oliver i groaned i can carry my own bag not today he called over his shoulder as he pulled the tapestry aside and walked out i groaned smiling and ran a bit to catch up to him damn him and his damn scottish charm and damn oliver ness he all mine so everybody back off ugh i so tired like katie i running on three hours of sleep and coffee so if it doesntmake sense at any point my apologies oh and i gonna do the black tie thing somehow but i was thinking a family thing out of hogwarts or something you know so they can do all these awkward introductions and so this is your sweetheart i ve heard so much about and blah blah blah but i want hogwarts people there too so they can get jealous maybe a annual ministry ball thing and they re old enough to go maybe i need your advice but i d love to do all those awkward intro s they re just so funny hehehe reviews i strive of reviews so send them in mahahahahaha february 30 monday dada holy fudge potions test at the end of the day i think i going to die die a horrible and painful death of confusing instructions and questions which are sure to fry my brain well at least you have that very amusing howler to make you laugh fred got out of here you re interrupting my thoughts why kates i didntknow you had thoughts besides i already interrupted you and good ol oliver in your little snogging session what a couple of thoughts fred weasley do you care to tell us why you fell out of your chair mr weasley professor lupin asked er fred said from the ground so i pushed him off his chair he done so much worse well you see dear professor lupin it seems that someone placed a bit of slipping solution on my chair so it is natural are you trying to sweet talk me mr weasley professor lupin asked with the slightest bit of a smile my god that man is good fred can normally talk himself out of anything no sir and with that fred clambered off the floor and back onto his seat traitor oh you ll get over yourself i want my spot back it not your spot fred so it yours and oliver now fred hehehehe little demon twin anyway i almost died at breakfast i was sitting next to oliver with everybody else eating my oatmeal when the owls came in i got the usual mail but there was also a very red envelope among the nice white envelopes oh my god alicia said starring at my mail pile you ve got a howler katie dontbe ridiculous i haventdone anything for a while there no way i d get a then my eyes fell on that god damn thing i just picked it up as it started to smoke starring at it i haventdone anything i yelled at it boy only i would yell at an envelope you better open it george advised it ll explode on you his twin added i think i d rather take the second i said still starring at it kat oliver said starring at it isntgoing to make it go away damn it i was hoping on that so i timidly opened the foul thing and out came my mom voice a billion times amplified katherine ann bell how dare you go and snog some guy do you even know this boy at all have i taught you nothing if i hear he taking advantage of you i will personaly walk up there and smack the both of you by this time i had my head buried in oliver arm my face was probably as red as a cherry but then to my amazement it died down to add another message and tell that darling oliver wood i wish him luck on his n e w t s why cantyou date a nice boy like that and with that it sindered up the whole great hall was staring at me of course but they couldntsee my face because it was nestled in oliver chest i cantbelieve she did that i said in a muffled voice from oliver robes it wasntthat bad oliver said rubbing my back dontinsult me he chuckled and then a sudden thought popped into my head it was you i pointed at fred now bolt right in my spot what fred asked shocked what makes you think that y you wanted your spot come on kates i wouldntrat you out like that he pointed out oh yeah he wouldn t not fred or his equally devilish twin never the twins i sighed yeah i know sorry see i not all that bad fred after potions aka end of classes how d it go oliver asked sitting down on the edge of the couch i was currently laying face down on the couch spread across the entire length with my face in a square gold pillow i just let out a groan that bad hu i lifted my head up out of the pillow to look at him do you have any idea what potion will cure one of the unforgivable curses he thought for a second well what potion would bring a person back from the dead i just looked at him waiting for the answer there isn t i groaned again and sunk my head back into the pillow well i got one wrong do you think i ll get points for writing my name down i asked into the pillow what d you say i took my head out of the pillow do you think i ll get points for writing my name i repeated we are talking about snape right i slapped my hand onto my forehead i hate that sniveling greasy disgusting foul long haired evil disgusting you said that already maniacal maniac sick crazy disgusting little man oliver chuckled dontwe all i sat up he out to get me well you re mine and he canthave you he said before he kissed me i swear his kisses could melt glaciers you guys should really find a closet or something if they werentinterrupted we broke apart as alicia came over and sat on one of the armchairs i just starred at her what was she serious lic what the common room is a public place well so is the locker room but that didntstop you and george i pointed out this got oliver attention you snogged george in the locker room she went bright red you snogged george in the locker room he repeated it amazing how he can go from kissing wonderful oliver to i m your captain and why the hell were you kissing my beater oliver he turned back to me a stink bomb hu i shrugged my shoulders guiltily you would ve had their heads mounted on your wall if you found them that why you jumped on my back er what the hell was i suppose to say did you want me to say yes oliver that is exactly why i jumped on your back or did you want something like it wasntreally me it was a slytherin who took a polyjuice potion and they jumped on your back in attempt that you would break a bone from the fall or even i only jumped on your back because 1 it was a dare and 2 because your so god damn cute actually i kinda like that last one but i wasntthinking that way at the time well maybe really deep down but on the surface i was trying to save alicia and george oliver just looked at me while i tried to figure out an answer well i said deciding on one yeah and i know the locker room is part of the pitch and that means it like sacred grounds but you cantkick them off the team for that because you kissed me after the match was over and that was on the pitch and then you d have to kick yourself off the team and then where would we be we d be captain less and we d only have two chasers a beater and a seeker and kat oliver interrupted i think my face was turning blue who said anything about me kicking anyone off the team so i tend to over exaggerate at times err well i just had a terribly hard double potions test i made an excuse hey that one golden your brain would be fried too with that i laid back down on the couch on my side facing out and brought the pillow up to my face where it stayed she right though i heard alicia agree with me that test was hard i knew oliver sent me a glance i knew he did i can tell he chuckled i have a question how many shamrocks do you put into that felix lucky potion thingy seven right oliver must ve nodded because she gave a little whoop of joy damn it i screamed into the pillow get that one wrong too oliver asked kindly i nodded dunno if they saw it with the pillow and all i heard the portrait swing open and some one slowly walk in she do bad too that was angelina and i guess she was referring to me oliver chuckled and said yeah i heard her throw her bag down and then she sat on my legs ow she didntsay anything she just slapped my thigh hard and i managed to somehow kick her in the back kate i failed that test i know i did i said curling my legs so angelina could sit what oh yeah i was talking into a pillow i removed the pillow from my face i failed i know i did and if i didn t snape ll fail me any way at least you get points for writing your name george said as he and his twin came in so you know you at least have two points fred said happily snape doesntgive out sympathy points i said true fred agreed fred was now sitting on the arm of the couch next to angelina and george was sitting in the arm chair next to alicia s but oliver had moved to the ottoman and moved it next to where i was so you use a beazor if you dontknow an antidote right george asked aloud oliver nodded and i screamed into the pillow what did you write angelina asked a beezan i said meekly putting the pillow under my head next year i giving up potions i ll find a job that does not require potion making if it kills me almost every job needs potions making alicia pointed out not quidditch oliver said alls you need for quidditch is enough common sense to duck when a bludger is coming a voice that sounded like it would come from a prick almost everyone groaned and i looked up behind me to see percy standing behind the couch his hands on the back so i joined in the groaning i was sure oliver was going to say something about the quidditch bit but he didn t allowing percy to go on i ignored him for most of the time pretending to be very interested in the fire that was crackling merrily so i heard your howler this morning katie oh the prick was talking to me better pretend like i reeeeeeaaaaalllllllly interested i think everyone did percy i sighed do really need to relive it i didntknow your mom would react like that he said trying to make it sound as though he was wiser beyond his years when i told her you were together with a boy i thought she would be happy i had started to drift off but my eyes snapped open at that last remark what was i hearing right not even percy would do that i owled your mom saying you got together with a very decent boy i didntsay it was oliver because i thought she would be mad oh but he would and he did percy you idoit i was now standing up on the couch pulling his tie why would you even think to owl my mom and if you told her it was oliver she wouldntsend me a howler she d send me a nice little note saying how glad she is to know she taught me something worth knowing and she knows oliver she knows he a great guy your stupidity is even beyond understanding i got a howler because of you percival weasley i hit a nerve there his face got red at the use of his full name or was it because i was choking him because i was pulling on his tie so hard i d like to think the second makes me happy i should ok that enough kat i really need that slow mo machine because all of a sudden oliver has me lifted up in the air his arms wrapped around my waist with my hands pinned to my side none the less and then angelina threw a silencing charm at me so i was being held up in the air my hands pinned to my side with my mouth still screaming at percy but no words coming out she just finished up a double potions test oliver explained to a stunned percy still holding me up o oh percy said rather shakily loosing his tie i see with that he walked away i would do the same thing fred said looking at me yeah george agreed mailing her mom was pretty low he a flipping god damn prick i screamed or rather moved my mouth in a screaming fashion so what should we do with her angelina said nodding in my direction take the silencing charm off for starters oh yeah i still couldntspeak i dontknow oliver chuckled still holding me up i think she trying to tell us something george said watching my mouth scream at him with no noise he walked over to me what is it katie is the barn on fire is billy stuck in the well oh he didn t i kicked him in the ribs and he nearly collapsed to the floor katie that was angelina you heard him he was treating me why would you kick him she rushed over to his side like a muggle dog you re so immature ange except i was still only mouthing all this ok come on kat oliver said carrying me upstairs will some one please take off this god damn silencing charm god damn charm he finally got me to my dorm and sat me down on the right bed and he sat across from me if i take the silencing charm off will you promise not to shout at me i rolled my eyes and sighed finally nodding good he said rather upbeat for the moment and he finally took off the silencing charm he such a damn prick yup first words out of my mouth oliver chuckled yeah he is isnthe now how do you understand potions and ask a question like that of course he is we were the only ones in the dorm any thing else you d like to scream he asked putting a silencing charm on the door i smiled but of course i got off the bed and started my ranting pacing around the room i cantbelieve he owled my mom i mean he didnteven say it was you because if he did everything would me peaches and cream there d be no howlers just a little note congratulating me on a fine catch oliver stood up and walked over to me but no he goes completely over board and tells her everything except to one thing that would make her happy and cancel everything else out i grabbed a pillow and screamed into it oliver took the pillow out of my hands once i was finished better i took a deep breath and smiled actually yeah i do feel better he put his hands on my arms smiling now would i be that fine catch well i shrugged my shoulders smiling i have to say you are better than flint he chuckled before kissing me i would hope so he kissed me again i laughed and wrapped my arms around his neck kissing him back as his hands crept down my back what about diggory i dontfraternize with the enemy he laughed and i felt his thumb run over my skin and over the slightly raised scar on my lower right back it not that big little bit under an inch he ran over it a few times trying to figure what it is or where it came from bludger i said playing with the tail of his hair two years ago i think mmmm ravenclaw he asked in between kisses i shook my head slytherin damn snakes i let out a small laugh which turned out to be a snort i instantly clamped a hand over my mouth my cheeks probably scarlet by then hey he chuckled i need that then he took my hand away from my mouth and kissed me again if oliver keeps kissing glaciers all over the world will melt and the world will be flooded but who cares as long as it me he kissing march 1st tuesday 4 pm so in the past two hours i have been scared out of my mind fainted screamed and yelled and almost fainted again right after classes i was sitting in the common room waiting for everybody else to come in a few minutes later oliver came in with a huge gold hoop earring in his left ear so what do you think kat he asked as i stood up i fainted starring at the hideous thing on his ear kat kat are you alright i was laying on the couch with oliver leaning over me i could see everybody else to behind him am i alright i was coming back around mad what the hell was he thinking what the hell were you thinking i said standing up kat what do you mea i mean your hideous earring i screamed at him i swear i gonna rip it right out of you ear so i gave it a little tug and it came right off i thought i had seriously ripped it out so i started to faint but oliver caught me before i hit my head on the coffee table i just starred at the thing in my hand to his ear but it was fine no blood no cut nothing it was a clip on fred explained from the behind him it was a dare george said are you trying to give me a heart attack i asked oliver he just chuckled never and he kissed me we have to go over a few rules 1 if he ever gets an earring or tattoo i will personally kill him 2 if he ever gives me a heart attack i will personally kill him 3 i cantthink of anything else but i ll probably wind up killing him personally am i too harsh he scared me out of my mind for crying out loud by the way 13 days till my birthday the countdown has officially begun after practice so i really gave you a heart attack oliver asked after an especially hard practice as we walked back up to the castle i think i went pale at the thought of him with that ugly thing i ll take that as a yes you walked into the common room with a pirate earring in your left ear i said was i supposed to be happy about that come on kat he said in a playful voice slipping his arm around my waist you know you liked it i hated it no you didn t you thought it made me irresistible he whispered in my ear hated it you loved it hate love hate love hate i said firmly even more than your ridiculous new plays they re not ridiculous he protested they re great you want alicia to do a flip in the air off her broom and still manage to get a point well maybe that one is a little over the top maybe he admitted but the rest are gold like the one where angelina and i do that twisty thinger ma bobber that came full with hand motions and all pfft you guys can handle it he said with a wave of his hand but did you think i d go easier on you you re still my chaser and i still your captain and i not going to any easier on you in the air i turned in front of him i wouldnthave it any other way i said before i kissed him but that practice was really hard and half of the new plays we ll never be able to do but there is one that involves a chaser and two bludgers that could go wrong but would be great if nothing bad happened by the way i love how you all sent me suggestions for the black tie so many great ideas and i considered everyone of them but i think i going to go with the ministry thing because that included both jealous people and awkward intros between families and if you have an awkward intro i ll be sure to fit it in somewhere if it good which from you guys i know it will be but i already have one planned out for katie mom so other than that send em in september 10 tuesday noon i feel guilty about not writing in you for a while so onward gosh i cantwait for the season to start then i ll have something to help me relax with my homework alicia and angelina keep telling me to go get a boyfriend that there are probably a hundred guys in the school that would go out with me i asked who fred and george came out of no where and volunteered shot me there nice guys and everything but we ve been friends since first year and on the same team for the past three doesntsound right to me besides i really dontwant a boyfriend it just one more thing to worry about actually like ten million like does he really like me do i look ok i would have to wear more make up i only wear soft blush and maybe cover up and a little mascara at times i would have to wear a skirt other than the school uniform and a bunch of other crap i dontwant to think about so there they say i crazy and how wonderful their boyfriends are ugh now you can shot me i dontneed one it as simple as that they say just because i dontneed one isnta reason not to want or have one how the hell do their minds work i mean i like guys i think i have more guy friends than girl friends but all the decent ones i know are my friends and i dontthink i could ever see me dating any of them well i search outside of school for a decent guy 9 pm hey i actually finished all my homework like an hour ago alicia asked me why donti do it after school is over instead of after dinner well because right after school is for lounging under the tree next to the lake duh and i did it without the help of mr oliver wood who is now reading over my shoulder at the last entry excuse me why i hit him over the head with you 10 34 well i going to sleep early and decided to write in you a little more lets say that oliver is now going to sleep with a large bump on his head what was that for he asked when i hit him i think i accidentally got him with one of the corners opps stop reading over my shoulder then he sat down next to me and i knew i was going to regret not standing up and leaving right then so you donthave a boyfriend then no i decided with the sort and sweet answers that oliver preferred to get in the air but never really did and fred and george offered yes and you said no yes why because they re fred and george why dontyou want a boyfriend can i ask why no i sighed i was doing really good up to here i should probably give him something i know he wants to hear because when the season starts i dontwant anything else preoccupying me that sounded right good answer and he started to get up hold on i grabbed him by the sleeve of his robe and practically shoved him back into his seat what is with playing 20 questions just wanted to know what about my nonexistent love life he shrugged his shoulders i took that for a yes i sighed and handed him a piece of parchment and my stubby quill just write up a new play and i left him there wonder if he still down there september 11 wednesday the first class of a double potions hmm when was the last time snape washed his hair i can see the grease from here and i all the way in the back with fred i should probably be paying attention right now but it kinda hard to i mean this guys drones on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on

potions almost free almost free almost eek what the hell is that a ten foot long essay on the effects of mandrake root mixed with rats tail due tuesday are you kidding me the effects arentpleasant but there isntenough to write ten feet of it fred is just as white as me lunch whatever time it is well i ve been here for the past 10 minutes and from those ten minutes 9 i ve been noticing the beautiful grain pattern in the wood of the table speaking of wood i think that oliver just sat down next to me september 16 monday sometime after dinner so i ve been sitting in the library since school ended completely skipped out on dinner and trying to finish this stupid essay for snape i hate that bastard none of my other teachers are doing this to me why him hey my saving grace just walked through the door concealing food under their robe i see 8 41 oliver you re a god i think it sounded a little distorted because i was stuffing my face with the food he had brought a bagel apple bottle of water oh and a bag of chips he brought me junk food go oliver luckily we were sitting at our favorite table which is completely out of the view of the librarian once again i find myself lazing around while oliver does my homework once again well not lazing around because i really did try to do this stupid essay kat did you even try this he asked still hunched over my paper yeah for the past five days but you re not the brightest wire in the bulb he finishedlooking at me smiling i just called you a god try not to ruin it do i get to wear kilts as a god i ignored him but smiled all the same it in my nature i always smiling and i dontknow why the only time i know i not smiling is during potions but other than that why shouldnti smile oliver is reading over my shoulder and saying something like you shouldntsmile during a game or practice either kat something like that i think 9 02 well my freaking kilt wearing scottish son of a bitch captain just threw down my stubby quill finally completed with my essay i gave him a hug across the shoulders oliver you re the best i probably shouldnthave done that but i was just so happy then he pulled out some of his books and started working i couldntbelieve it you did my essay before you did yours i asked amazed even alicia and angelina wouldnthave done that yeah well you re just so cute when you re in trouble he pinched my cheek as he said this and i brushed his hand away besides it just herbology and he started sloppily doing his home work oh no you don t i swiped the book out from under his quill you re actually gonna do your homework the right way why i never going to use this stuff when i flying he protested ok well i started to think of a scenario lets say you and your friends are walking no flying through the woods your friend gets a bad cut and you need to patch it up temporarily until you can find a healer you could mash up some herbs you find on a trial but how will you know which ones to use you could wind up poisoning your friend or you and your friends are hungry while flying through the woods how will you know which berries you should eat or ok ok you made your point now it was his turn to beg help me please and of course i did september 28 saturday 11 am oh my god i love the weekend we re all sitting under the huge oak tree well actually fred and george are tickling the giant squid at the moment oh alicia just passed me a note hold on few minutes later here the note yes i taped it in the normal print is mine alicia is the big one and angelina has the nice pretty handwriting so what

at the same time what was it was it black mail did someone die a love letter black mail or even a what i screamed looking at my own letter we had decided not to wait for alicia she was currently speechless i think it says the first annual fundraiser oliver said reading his and what does that say i asked horrified pointing to the last line on the letter all the color drained from george face formal he gulped i threw mine down i not going come on kat oliver said slipping an arm around my waist it could be fun no no it can t i said firmly fun is flying fun is running around hogsmeade fun is being with your friends laughing fun is not running around in a dress and high heels here here the twins chanted except substitute the dress and high heels to a blazer and tie george added who never ever wears the tie that goes with the uniform i not going i said firmly err your mom might say other wise alicia said holding up a mint green envelope my mom signature letter and i not reading that i said ok angelina said taking my mom letter out of alicia hands i will so she ripped it open and read the letter she says you better get your stubborn butt over there or you ll be sorry lemme see that i said taking it out of her hands katherine ann bell you better find a way to get your stubborn butt over there or you ll be sorry and i expect you to find a decent dress to come in and maybe you

and now she was telling me i have to go i was just happy that we were the only ones in the common room besides a few first years i paced in front of the fire place everyone else sitting down behind me looking rather amused people say i a spitting image of my mom i really dontsee it i mean she has the same sandy blond hair and brown green eyes but that about it oh did i mention she where i got my stubbornness from but why i asked because everyone else ll be there she said and your father job is on the line so you better turn up how dad job on the line and why will he lose it if i dontcome i asked stubbornly my mom sighed stubbornly you re going oh the war of the stubbornness is on but they re going my mom nodded her floating head towards my friends arentthey only from threats and black mail george said my mom let out a little laugh hello george hi mrs bell how things on the other side of the fire he asked cheerfully good she smiled but not at me you know you re older brother going

me in a dress do i have to i moaned yes but no buts my mom said firmly you re going i groaned fine but i not going to be but her head just smiled and disappeared happy about it i screamed at the fireplace like she could hear me i groaned again and her head reappeared in the fireplace what now i asked i just thought i d remind you to wear a nice dress i finished i know mom no she said to bring that boy you re with so we can finally meet him i groaned mom it s donttell me she said smiling at her victory surprise me in two weeks with that she disappeared again damn her so i promptly groaned and collapsed on the couch next to oliver damn her oh and 12 days till my birthday march 3 thursday after practice now i know you re trying to kill us i said to oliver who was in the next row in the locker room after practice come on kat he called back over the lockers you can take more than that well fricken whoop di do for her alicia called back my poor little bones are dying over here wood dying sorry twiggy he called back we all laughed even lic but 6 hours is waaaaaaaaaaaay too long after alicia angelina and the twins marched out i collapsed on the bench laying my back down against it finally out of my quidditch robes and back into sacred jeans i was just starting to close my eyes when someone called my name i opened my eyes and harry was standing over me yeah harry i asked sitting back up then he started asking me about the emerald green envelopes and i said it was nothing important which it isntanyway and then he left and i laid back down on the bench and continued to fall back asleep i not going to carry you back up to the castle i opened one eye oliver was sitting next to my head leaning over me smiling little devil my little devil mine i closed my eye so fly me up he chuckled why not walk with me because i cantfeel any part of my body i said opening my eyes and looking up at him was it that bad 6 hours of practice like 10 new plays and three bludgers to my poor little body i listed counting them off my fingers yeah it that bad he chuckled and stood up come on kat he grabbed my hands and dragged me up to a sitting position so i sat up on the bench and groaned i cantwalk i cantfeel my legs and my hip where that bludger hit really hurts didntwe put a softening charm on those it right where the joint is i think i almost jammed it i explained rubbing the sore spot god damn bludger i ll be sure to yell at the twins he chuckled come on and he pulled on my hands again until i was standing up but it such a long way back to the castle i complained will you stop complaining he asked smiling i smiled too you brought it upon yourself oliver wood yeah he smiled i know then he gave me a kiss before walking out of the locker room that got me going well at least wait for me i called as i followed him out i heard him laughing from the stair way 11 days till my birthday march 4 friday 10 pm aka 10 days till my birthday so guess what i did today c mon guess that right dress shopping i dunno what so grand about that but angelina and alicia were rather happy about it so there we were we snuck out to hogsmeade and into the dress shop attempting to find something nice what about this one angelina asked coming out of the dressing room for the umpteenth time it was now a scarlet dress before that it was yellow before that green before that light pink and before that midnight blue i still think i like the first one the best i said hey just because i wasnttoo happy about the whole idea doesntmean i wouldntgive her a truthful answer and it think i like alicia in the light pink one i said as lic came out in a mint green dress you think alicia said looking herself over in the mirror hmm maybe you re right i know i am i smiled well angelina said what about you what do you mean what about me i asked your dress silly alicia said oh yeah i hadnteven tried on one but i think my mom would been fine if i showed up in jeans and a tree shirt could you imagine the look on her face so i sighed walked over to the clothes rack picked out some random dress in my size and tried it on and it actually looked really good it was an emerald dress with off the shoulders sleeves which were more of a tank top look it was tight and loose in all the right places around my torso but flared around my legs with three layers of soft material underneath to make it flare just a bit more it just covered my knees it had a gold sash tied loosely around my waist so it fell diagonally across my hips and the same color hem at the bottom of it and i actually liked it oh my god alicia said when i came out of the dressing room you re not leaving the store until you buy that angelina said demandingly does it look that good i asked yes they said at the same time i was never very comfortable with the whole dress idea but this one wasntbad at all no itchy spots or places that didntfit right yeah this one would be fine how much is it i asked trying to find the price tag alicia found it and i saw her smile drop well more like her jaw how bad is it i asked angelina went to go look and her jaw dropped even more ok i asked how bad is it did i want to hear the answer 18 galleons and 35 sickles alicia gulped no no i didn t i looked in my purse 19 galleons and 40 sickles well i just made it i said that great alicia said giving a whoop of joy but then i wonthave money for shoes or anything i pointed out so i miss shoe shopping bummer dontworry about it angelina said rather happily why i asked am i going to wear my converse with this she shook her head remember those goldhigh heel sandals that i wore to that thing last summer i smiled angelina you re a god praise the guy who gave us all the same shoe size god bless him wouldntthat be god though so all in all it was a very successful shopping day in the words of the great alicia marie spinnet if i ever quote alicia slap me so what did you get oliver asked me as i plopped down next to him on the couch after we got back trying to peak into my bag a dress and an empty pouch i said well can i see the dress nope i sighed why not it bad luck that only weddings he pointed out and we re not getting married are we well maybe we are whahaha sorry couldntresist could you imagine what our kids would look like they d be so adorable my sons would grow up to be so handsome because they d look just like their dad and ok getting back to the real world and what really happened though i do like my little fantasy world on planet katie but anyway no i said gloomily at the thought that my fantasy world wasntcoming true at least not any time soon so why canti see the dress because i way too tired to even take it out of the bag he just chuckled it makes sense we spent like an extra three hours in that shoe store i wasnteven buying one pair so it was torture and the thought of walking around in those two and a half inch heels isntmaking my day any better so we stayed in the common room for another hour before heading up to bed night sleeping beauty oliver called as i climbed the stairs to our dorm after i said goodnight to everyone he so adorable god damn him and his god damn scottish oliver charm and damn those high heels i ll have to wear pretty soon oh and the 10 day countdown to my birthday is officially under way so 10 days till my birthday hehehe hope you guys liked that little chappie did you really think i would put her in an unflattering dress i think not and i had already wrote this by the time i read my reviews so the off the shoulder thing was already said and done with what can i say great minds think alike and i was seriously thinking of a lilac colored dress and i figured katie would think like me dark is slimming not that she fat or that i am which we re not fat that is oh now i have to do the dramatic questions what will happen at the formal thingy what will happen on katie birthday which officially march 14th if you didntcatch that what will oliver get her will it be a terrible day what awkward intros are bound to happen well if you want to know you ll just have to wait for the next chapter duh lol oh and tell me if you like the dress i think i did ok with it just lemme know though kz reviews so many reviews upon reviews upon reviews i so happy ok i know i not the best dress maker person so i already had it in my head that i was probably going to go back and change it to whatever you guys said would look nice but almost everybody liked it so it stays and if you didntlike it i appreciate it so much that you were honest with me so thanks to both sides of the dress factor and on with the chapter march 5 saturday 12 pm so does anybody want to explain to me why they give us so much homework over the weekend on this matter i completely agree with fred never thought i d say that but we all have a mountain of homework to do and we have practice tomorrow so there ll be no time then actually i probably would ve put it off till then until oliver came down from the his dorm in captain commando mode and made us all do it now so there we were sitting in the library doing our homework with mr commando breathing down our necks to get it done potions potions potions potions potions that like all i had why was snape so determined to kill us when all our other teachers are being a little kind and not giving us that much over the weekend why canthe be more like professor binns did i seriously just say that ugh after an hour of that crap snape gave us with at least another hour of it to finish i slammed my head down on the table and watched the wood grain quidditch game say that five times fast the team with the chaser that had a stain on it back was winning go team go kat oliver said still in commando mode you still have more potions to do damn commando mode my brain is about to explode i said to the wood grain seeker i cannot do another hour of potions yes you can if i even try i said sitting back up there will be nothing else of me to boss around the pitch truer words were never spoken fine fine did oliver wood just cave in did i just make oliver wood cave in mr commando caved in to me oh the power i have be back here in an hour he said before marching out well maybe i donthave all that much power but think of all the lazy relaxing brain de frying things i could do in an hour i would like to take this time to pay homage to katie george said then both the twins got up and started bowing to me on their knees jez guys i said it only an hour break they didntstop they re just thinking of all the people they can prank in that hour alicia pointed out they were still bowing i am a god officially 3 pm oliver oh oliiiiiiiiveeeeeeeeeeer yes i know i crazy to even think and find him at a time like this but what can i say where the hell did he go so now i talking to myself peachy i checked everywhere the common room the guys dorm the owlery the great hall even every inch of the pitch and i still couldntfind him i had given up i had to be back in the library in 10 minutes and i was on the other side of the school near the astronomy tower i dontknow why i even looked there what would he be doing in the astronomy tower so i hurried back i didntneed captain commando yelling at me i was sprinting back by then kat kat oh yeah that me but i had already skidded around a corner so i had to double back i looked around the corner and there was oliver eating one of those really weird fruit i brought him that one time when i almost killed him oliver i asked who else would it be he finally caught up to me who else great now he reading my mind where were you he swallowed some of that fruit in the kitchens i slapped my forehead duh katie duh must ve been the only place in the castle that i hadntlooked what are you doing here he asked you re supposed to be back in the library in 10 minutes i could say the same thing i said as we headed towards the library oh yeah i got him now he just chuckled and we continued to walk back to the library where at least another hour of torture awaited me damn teachers and theri damn homework so what hybrid fruit are you eating now i asked an eyebrow cocked looking at the fruit in his hand he shrugged his shoulders no idea want some i smiled sure i answered as he took a bite i reached out to grab it but instead oliver put his hand behind my neck and kissed me giving me the bit of fruit in his mouth through parted lips once we broke apart i smacked my lips at the bit of fruit now in my mouth i bit into it and swallowed hmm apples and strawberries he chuckled good call i laughed i am a god who else could bring oliver out of commando mode me only me can i have some more i asked as innocently as i could he laughed took another bite and made a move to kiss me again he should ve realized i was smiling mischievously fred and george would be so proud i stepped to the right and grabbed the fruit out of his hand before he knew it i so terrible hey he said slightly shocked after what i did but smiling none the less what i asked innocently my head tilt slightly to the side taking a bite we should definitely call this a strapple i said looking at the fruit he laughed and put an arm around my waist come on we have to get back to the library no we don t i protested before taking another bite letting him guide me there anyway by the way that fruit is good i highly recommend it and compliments to what ever house elf had the genius idea of cross mating different fruits kat he said sternly please dontgo back into captain commando mode i pleaded taking another bite captain what he asked captain commando i said simply swallowing he laughed and give me back my strapple and before i knew it the hand that was around my waist was suddenly around my fruit and back in his hands hey i said stopping that mine well you canthave it he said as he kept walking i stood there for a second or two as he walked away and around a corner so i did what any smart person would do i sprinted after him and around the corner and then jumped on his back thank god he didntturn around falling on marble floor is a lot more painful than snow covered ground kat he laughed as i wrapped my arms around his shoulders and my legs around his waist tightly yes ol i asked innocently what are you doing getting my strapple back i said as a matter of factly you re not getting it he laughed well then you ll just have to carry me back to the library because i could hang out here all day alright then and we continued to proceed down the corridors to the library so how things back there oliver asked still carrying me piggy back style strapplisious i said smiled taking a bite of the strapple that i had rightfully regained he laughed i not crushing you am i i asked concerned if he said yes i would ve killed him not in the least he laughed are you sure come on kat he groaned you re not fat no matter how many different ways you ask or say it i placed my chin on his right shoulder sure kat if you ask one more time i going to kick you off the team i laughed alright alright strapple i asked holding it in front of his face please i pressed it to his mouth as he took a bit i would hate to know what they did that whole hour oliver whipped around which almost made me fall off behind us was fred and angelina their arms linked together and i d hate to know what you two did weasley oliver laughed stopping so they could catch up nothing as grotesque as you two i sure he laughed as we walked back to the library together funny fred i said from oliver back i only just found him actually i admitted katie angelina said eyeing the strapple in my hand what is that this i took another bite a strapple you want a what a strapple me and oliver said at the same time fred and angelina just starred at us a cross between an apple and strawberry i explained try some and i tossed the juicy goodness to her she caught it and took a bite her face instantly lighting up at the mother of all good fruits this is great she said starring at the thing fred try some so she passed it off to him and he took a bite his face light up almost as much as hers good going kat oliver said now we ll never be able to get another one i turned around and looked at fred and angelina who stopped walking for some reason still with my strapple i guess they were talking about it excuse me for a second and i jumped off his back before he could answer and ran up to fred and angelina what up kates fred asked as he went to take another bite of my strapple i need that i said and i grabbed the strapple out of his hand before he could bring it to his mouth kates fred called as i sprinted back to where oliver was waiting around the corner there you are oliver said when i caught up to him where the strapple it was true i had taken a last bite and all that was left was the pit so you didnteven leave me some he said faking to be hurt what i asked the strapple still in my mouth i saved you some i gave him a kiss and the rest of the strapple thanks kat he said smiling after swallowing then we spent the better part of the afternoon in the library try to finish all our homework 9 days till my birthday march 6 sunday 6 45 am if you re wondering why on god green earth why i up so early on a sunday no less ask oliver i woke up this morning not by the early sun gently caressing my face not by chirping birds and not even by my alarm which i could ve easily thrown against the wall and gone back to sleep but by none other than oliver wood two inches from my face his hands on either side of my shoulders and to my horror i gave out a little squeal and even more to my horror he was wearing his quidditch robes oliver i whispered what are you doing do have any idea what time it is not like i did though either yup he whispered smiling as he looked at his watch half past one you know it a sunday he nodded and you know that gives me legal rights to kill you he gave me a long kiss yeah but i know you d never do that even though i returned it happily i was still mad boy what a weird way i work how sure are you he gave me another long kiss i returned it again pretty sure i glared at him i hate you oliver wood he gave me another kiss and after i returned it again he said oh i sure was that sarcasm come on get up and the other girls and be at the pitch in half an hour with that he gave me another kiss which i returned and walked out the door damn you oliver wood i mumbled as i got out of bed and started to wake up ange and lic that wasnttoo fun waking them up i mean him kissing me was fine but i almost got kicked in the head by ange and lic cursed me off quite a few times what is he thinking alicia cried as me and ange finally got her out of bed lic i whispered you re gonna wake up the whole house i dontgive a damn rat damn ass she screamed what the hell is he thinking boy lic has got some mouth behind her hu next time he can wake you up i muttered changing into my spare robes it too damn hard i second that angelina whispered in agreement lacing up her shoe i going to kill him alicia screamed again yeah i pretty much gave up on shutting her up but if we have to wake up at the crack of dawn on a sunday everyone else does too so there this is such cock and bull oh boy eventually we made our way to the pitch alicia all in a fluster red in the face and cursing the whole way angelina trying to rub the sleep out of her eyes and me dragging my feet praying that oliver would have at least a sip of coffee for me with our brooms over our shoulders well dontyou girls look bright eyed and bushy tailed oliver asked cheerfully once we meet in the center of the field harry was already there waiting too i have a tail i sorry but my brain doesntfunction at two in the morning without any coffee but then i realized oliver had a mug of something i really know it s coffee but i can t think straight in the morning in his hand is that coffee i asked meekly oliver nodded before he took another sip have you seen the twi give me some i demanded cutting him off he just looked at me with one eyebrow cocked you heard me i said firmly holding out a hand give me the coffee now wood it black he laughed you hate bla yeah what ever and before he could stop me i grabbed it out of his hands and downed the whole thing in two seconds i felt the goodness rush into my veins and all of a sudden i felt happiness that only pure caffeine can give thanks ol i said handing him back the empty mug he just looked from me to his mug back to me and back to his mug sure it was black and sure it was piping hot but nothing stops me with coffee on the line so what on the agenda i asked happily oh the miracles of a coffee buzz you didnteven leave me any he was still staring at his mug well too god damn bad for you you son of a bitch alicia spat at him her words slightly slurred and swaying from side to side a little maybe you shoulda thought of that before you god damn woke us up at one in the god damn fuckin mornin we just stared at her so it safe to say she not a morning person oliver asked me looking at her she sounds like she drunk angelina said leaning on her broom staring at alicia it called lack of sleep dumb asses is that alicia fred asked wearily as he and his twin finally made it to where we were my girl has such a mouth on her george said fondly wrapping his arm around her waist damn right fred looked over to oliver mug is that coffee oliver held the mug upside down it was what happened fred almost started bawling kat oliver said simply before going into it s 2 in the morning and i expect you to fly better now than when you do with a full night s sleep captain and you two held us up now get in the air now damn you wood alicia called

time practice was over at 6 i was a zombie who apparently bent on taking over the world coffee supply warehouse i moaned in the locker room laying down on the bench i didnthave a change of clothes so i was still in my sweaty robes but i did manage to get all the padding off and back into my locker what are you moaning about now oliver asked smiling as he stood over my near lifeless form i donthave any coffee i sobbed tearless i know how that feels he said sitting down next to my head you drank all mine well you woke me up at one in the morning i protested laying my arm over my eyes and i should ve killed you and gone back to sleep you could never do that he said in a lower voice before bending down and kissing me i took my arm off my eyes and sat up i almost did once i pointed out and i could do it again you freaking kilt wearing son of a bitch captain he kissed me again no you couldn t i gave a little laugh before wrapping my arms around his neck just because i dontwant to doesntmean i can t he gave a small chuckle and wrapped his hands around my waist and i kissed him hey guys we broke apart instantly and looked a very upbeat alicia what the hell is going on here wasntevery other word she said a curse just a while back er who are you and what have you done with the real alicia i asked seriously where did she come from she let out a laugh a very very girly laugh that was scary i am alicia silly i let out a fake laugh hahaha no you re not yes i am she protested putting her hands on her hips mercy george oliver called and george came stumbling into the aisle we were in yes sir george asked mocking a soldier what did you give alicia oliver asked as alicia twirled a piece of hair in her fingers er some coffee george answered i hit my head against the lockers behind me hasnthe read the signs do not feed alicia coffee oh yeah we never had a chance to put those signs up i knew we should ve done that yesterday and it was very good coffee too alicia added cheerfully oliver just looked from alicia back to george with an eyebrow raised so how do i fix it george asked after a while of oliver giving him one of his trademark looks run her around for a while i answered should wear off in an hour at the most got it george nodded and with that he filed a very happy alicia who now thought everything was hilarious and wouldntstop laughing out the door after a while oliver sighed and i yawned tired he asked i just looked at him so is that a yes you woke me up at one in the morning had me wake up a kicking ange and a cursing lic flew me around the air for four hours straight and i only had one cup of coffee that was black yes oliver i am tired alicia was cursing a lot wasntshe he asked chuckling i groaned and walked out of the locker room hey oliver asked finally catching up to me half way to the castle and putting a hand on my shoulder are you mad at me i sighed as the morning light grew stronger it sent rays of light through his hair and in his deep brown eyes no i said smiling crookedly just tired i guess he wrapped his arms around me and kissed me chuckling arentwe all i laughed not you i dunno how you run a team when the sun not up lots of practice donti know it he just chuckled as we made our way back up to the castle his hand on my lower back still in our spare quidditch robes oh and 8 days till my birthday hehehe so did you

because i have nothing else to do i finished my home work and you re just so cute when you re in trouble well i sorry that i at the bottom of your list i said i knew he was joking you should be he said before giving me a peck on my cheek and starting one of my essays that ll do slave i said patting oliver shoulder about an hour later that ll do now i a slave he asked five minutes later as we made our way out from the library and down a corridor yeah i said pretty much next thing i know i wrapped in his arms and he kissing me and my back was pressed up against a wall when did i get there and i thought i ordered that slow mo machine when is it coming in then again i think it might be too big for those poor owls to carry hmm it was at dinner time so the halls were completely deserted well i guess i do deserve it he said pressing his forehead against mine i did wake you up at one in the morning i slipped my arms around his neck and kissed him that true i said in between kisses and you did make me wake up alicia and angelina that must ve been torture oh it was it was he chuckled before continuing to kiss me i think the glaciers are melting somewhere i think i am he hem some one cleared their throat we broke apart i guess the halls werentas deserted as we thought ange i cried as i saw angelina tapping her foot smiling with an eyebrow raised her arms crossed across her chest and apparently she had something caught in her throat what she asked boy fred must ve taught her good because she was smiling just as devilishly as the twins and what is with all these interruptions what do you think ange i asked my arms crossed over my chest hey i just came up here to tell you your dinner is getting cold she protested and i sure you dontremember that heating charm do you katie she called over her shoulder as she walked away so what i called to her retreating back uncrossing my arms and throwing them to my side she just laughed damn her i scowled so you dontremember oliver whispered matter a factly in my ear before walking down to the great hall so what you really dontremember do you i was currently eating my dinner cold no oliver i sighed in defeat i don t not even the littlest bit fred asked in a motherly like voice putting his thumb and fore finger about an inch apart i know it has something with inflamado in it i said ignoring him as i looked down at my cold plate of food my hands in my lap and i know there word for food in latin or something i supposed to know but but you re not the brightest wire in the bulb oliver suggested smirking the tiniest bit i just smiled back damn contagious scottish smile i wasntsupposed to smile i was eating cold chicken cold rice and cold corn not something i would usually smile about any body want to help me out i asked smiling at my friends no one going to help you on the o w l s george pointed out i racked my brain i knew that steaming spell flames charm spark charm sunlight spell light spell but no god damn food heater upper spell and i couldntremember the damn latin word for meal in the wizarding world when in doubt use latin words i know every other god damn spell that ll make you warm i said but none for food i know the spanish word for meal yeah lance had gone to spain for a quidditch game and the only words he came home knowing was meal broom flying bed sleep food and bathroom cantyou just tell how charming my brother is give it a whirl alicia said but if your meal does go up in flames do you at least know a dousing charm aguamentia i said simply hell even i know that one alright i said pulling out my wand what the worse that could happen everybody meal could explode on them that what could happen and that what did happen so what have we learned today katie angelina asked whipping string beans off her face er never use spanish in a spell i asked smiling guiltily attempting to get all the rice out of my hair scourgify the least i could do was clean up after my little mistake and never scream comidas inflamado around food fred added laughing so i was wrong whoop di fricken do it not they haventever been wrong no one perfect oh five days till my birthday march 10 tuesday after practice ok you officially owe me the greatest birthday present in the world after that practice i said as we clambered up the stairs to the common though my back was killing me i going to have severe back problems by the time i 20 i said clutching my lower back that bludger hadntdone me any favors come here oliver said dragging me to one side of the hallway oh no you re not going to give me a massage are you i asked horrified not many pleasant experiences with those things no offense ol but yours hurt he chuckled then you know they re working for who i asked satan he laughed no just trust me alright i sighed then he turned me around so my back was facing him and he put one hand on my right shoulder now where does it hurt he asked my lower ba a ack mother of mercy he put his hand on my lower back locking his elbows and pulled my shoulder back arching my poor back in a bow shape you could hear my back crack all the way up my spine ahh i cried softly what did i do that was so ba a aaaad he kept his one hand where it was the one on my lower back but instead pulled my other shoulder back once again every bone in my back cracked holy fudge i said softly sinking into the ground that hurt so much i mean if you ve ever had your back cracked you know it hurts the second each of your vertebrae crack and then your whole back goes limp i was now currently in the second stage of pain and trust me oliver wood cracking your back is no picnic i for one i said as he practically dragged me up to my feet holding me under my arms would like to know taught you these methods of torture he laughed as he helped me up remember tom oh boy do i ever he was only my captain for one year my second year at school and my first on the team he could rival oliver in the obsession department if he wanted to i think that why he choose oliver to be his successor how could i forget i laughed well oliver said picking up my bag much to my protest he cracked my back once and never again told you it hurts haha i was right jammed my shoulder once too he sighed i going to guess it was from a bludger and not because you were thrown through the air and a keeper got in your way he laughed and put a hand on my poor lower back more or less i think i was in my second year i think not too much fun is it i asked not in the least he agreed but if it gets you better sooner hey i was in the air the next day i pointed out only because you re so stubborn he pointed out he got me on that one if it gets me better sooner i mocked rolling my eyes he chuckled and gave me a peck on the temple 5 7 and i still 5 inches short than him want to go get some strapples he asked as we made our way to the kitchens floor of course i said if the twins haventeaten them all thank god they didn t or it would ve been off with their heads maybe a little harsh but i think they get my point four days till my birthday count em four march 11 wednesday history of magic and later in the afternoon so i was actually attempting to pay attention to professor binns when alicia sent me a note and the rest of the class went down the drain and the rest of the afternoon where we continued it in the common

actually though it over maybe you re right of course i am i shouted how the hell would the twins know good point angelina said ha i have officially turned them back on my side haha but percy knows angelina said i lost all the color in my face not to mention my smile what yeah about that alicia said scratching the back of her head he over heard the twins telling us and i think he went to go owl your mom what i jumped off my bed when did he leave about two minutes ago but i was already sprinting down the stairs and out the common room i dontthink i have ever run faster than i did to the owlery all the while i was thinking about the different ways i could kill percy i got to the owlery in 45 seconds flat but by the time i wrenched the jar open percy was standing in the middle of the room holding an owl no doubt with a letter to my mom before i could say anything he let the owl free and right before it reached the window i made a wild jump and caught the damn bird before it flew out katie percy asked shocked as i stood up and ripped the letter from the owl leg what are you doing i quickly scanned the letter yup definitely to my mom and definitely about the rumors fred and george stirred up three weasleys just might die tonight what are you doing i yelled at him waving the letter in his face you re supossed to be head boy you re supossed to know the difference from a rumor and the truth b but i think i scared him good does this look like something true percival i spat out his full name still waving the letter in his face kat what are you doing that must ve been a very awkward moment for oliver to walk in on though i was very happy to see him one more person to beat the living daylights out of percy here look what he almost sent my mom i said running over to him oliver took the letter out of my hands and scanned it over twice i dontthink he could believe it either he just shot percy the most disgusted look ever put his hand around my waist and guided me out i think percy is still in there what we re not going to kill him i asked probably just as shocked as percy he just chuckled and lead me back to the common room and from then to now alicia and angelina have been asking me every possible question to make sure the twins little rumor wasnttrue so it safe to say my brain is fried did ya like i know you d all want me to kill percy but my fingers are dying over here i just finished this and a summer essay killed me the essay i mean who gives an essay over the summer honestly so anyway i ve got riding camp all next week but it not sleep away so

gently kat wake up i knew who it was and i knew it was probably 1 in the morning but that couldntbe right because i was up till 3 with my so called best friends interrogating my like i was a criminal i just groaned and rolled onto my stomach kat we have practice no we don t i groaned into my pillow i knew he was leaning over me i knew it yes we do god damn it he was going into get your lazy butt out of bed and to the pitch mode damn it i just hugged my pillow katherine ann bell he whispered sternly she not home i said groggily not even opening my eyes leave a message after the beep beeeeeeeeeeeep bell he said in a not so hushed whisper i told you mr she not home bell i groaned and rolled over onto my back and propped myself up on my elbows there i attempted to rub the sand out of my eyes and try to open them when i finally managed it i nearly collapsed when i saw the time 4 am i had only one hour of sleep please tell me this is an optional practice i pleaded no you re going suddenly very cranky i grabbed the front of his scarlet robes listen buddy i said pulling him down and putting my nose a centimeter away from his thanks to your little stunt last night i was up till three in the morning getting interrogated by the energizer bunny cops over there i nodded my head towards alicia and angelina beds so if you can concentrate your brain to something other than quidditch for two seconds you ll realize that i ve only had one hour of sleep and i swear to god i will unleash alicia on you you know you re really cute when you re all worked up he said after a while dontyou dare try and sweet talk your self out of this one 1 hour of sleep no coffee or caffeine what so ever definite recipe for disaster and if it wasnti dontknow what is alright he sighed and i let go of his robes if you wontto go to practice i ll just have to carry you there next thing i knew i was slung over his shoulder oliver what is going on angelina asked rubbing her eyes we have practice oliver said happily grab kat stuff and meet me down at the pitch in 30 minutes alright angelina said what the hell wood well alicia up i not going to another god damn dawn practice i ll get her there angelina said reassuringly with that oliver walked out the door oliver i screamed as we walked out of the common room oliver as we passed the kitchens oliver as we entered the main entrance oliver as we passed the giant snoring squid in the lake yes kat dear by then my face was blue why in god name did you decide to have another way too early in the morning but i don t care as long as my team is ran into the ground practice hm he chuckled you guys could use the practice no we could use some sleep i corrected well why are you going to bed at three in the morning when we have practice the next day we finally reached the pitch and started to climb the stairs to the locker room i told you i groaned after your little stunt last night lic and ange were interrogating me all night do you really think i wanted to be up that late i guess not he laughed i yawned sleep is a dear dear friend of mine and i try not to neglect it coffee too speaking of which do you have any in the locker room he said well c mon get a move on i said hitting his lower back lightly if you say so and he sprinted the rest of the way to the locker room jesus christ that hurt i said rubbing my stomach he finally sat me down on one of the benches no more sprinting up stairs with me slung over your shoulder he sat down next to me on the bench with two mugs and a thermos laughing if you say so coffee do you really need to ask i smiled he chuckled and poured me a cup of the precious drink oh thank god i said after taking a sip it so good i sobbed tearlessly but it black he pointed out at the moment i dontcare i said i need the caffeine then a cold breeze came through and i started to shiver i was still in my pajamas same ones when we all accidentally walking into the great hall for breakfast with except now i had no socks and a tee shirt instead of a long sleeve shirt brr cold oliver asked i put the now empty mug on the bench beside me and hugged myself just a little here he smiled having me stand up he took off his long scarlet robes and wrapped me in them not letting my arms into the sleeves him being 6 0 and me being 5 7 about a five inch difference it was dragging on the ground quite a bit but it really didntmatter because he sat me back down on his lap better he asked smiling his arm wrapped around me just as much as his robes um hm i said softly resting my head on his shoulder and closing my eyes he started rubbing my back and i instantly started to drift off i had only 1 hour of sleep and even if i drank that whole entire thermos of the precious caffeinated drink i would be out cold with in the hour anyway jesus christ cantthey ever find a decent place to do stuff like that i opened one eye and there was fred and george standing in the door way i know george agreed and he yelled at me and alicia i groaned and stood up reluctant to leave oliver lap slipped my arms through the sleeves of his robe and held them up close to me so they just barely reached the floor i was freezing where are they anyway i asked through a yawn damn oliver waking me up at damn 4 in the morning after only one damn hour of sleep and then being all damn sweet and stop me from being damn mad at him damn oh look fred said in fake sweetness she wearing his robes how sweet they both aaaaaaaaaawwwwww ed and i threw them a dirty look are you still in your pajamas kates george asked catching a glimpse of my bare feet and the hem of my pajama pants yes and i freezing i said now where lic and ange with my clothes we re right fucking here oh so they were i told you i d get her here angelina said sleepily oi you know we ve only had one hour of sleep wood oliver glanced at me i finished downing another cup of coffee and slammed to mug down on the bench yeah i know here are your god damn clothes alicia said chucking a plastic bag at me filled with all my stuff be right back i aid through another yawn as i caught it and went into the next row to change in two minutes i completely ready hey kates yes george you re still in you pajama bottoms damn it in another two seconds give or take i know had on everything that needed to be on to play quidditch at 4 30 in the morning it a wonder how oliver has managed to stay alive all these years and from 4 30 to 5 oliver shoved another new play down our throats that fucking retarded well at least alicia is up i almost started to drift oliver looked over the play on the white board in the back of the locker room no it not he protested after double checking it it perfect so what if it involved intricate risky and confusing moves so what if it included two bludgers that could hit our face if something went wrong in an already high risk place to him it was perfect george put his hand up like an excited school girl you know waving it in the air to catch oliver attention and saying things like oh oh me pick me yes george oliver sighed calling on him reluctantly i going to have to agree with our swearing angel over here he motioned to a fuming alicia who was cursing under her breath it is a little ridiculous oliver scowled slightly and scratched the back of his head kat what do you think i rubbed my eyes and ran over the play on the board a few times in my head trying to imagine what it would like in the air i furrowed my brow starring at the white board with the red and green dots but the fourth time over i made up my mind it ll need to be perfect i said angelina groaned next to me do it over a few times and every time change something just the little bit it ll need to catch them off guard every time oliver beamed at me but everyone else groaned and looked at me like they wanted to rip my head off and mount it on the wall with a little plaque underneath that read here lies katie bell head the idiot who gave oliver wood a reason to beat us into the ground but that just a little off track you only agreed with him because you re the one kissing him angelina said at 7 in the morning once practice was over we had exactly 45 minutes for all of us to take a shower get changed and get up to the castle for our first class so currently the guys were using the shower stalls in the locker room and we were leaning on the wall outside in towels please i said i just want to win and that play will really help us stop lying alicia said son of a bitch i ignored her and pulled my towel around my torso tighter does anybody else feel weird about this just that second harry walk by his face turning scarlet yup they both chorused i laughed since when do damn boys take so damn long in the damn shower alicia asked still swearing me and angelina just laughed what is taking them so long angelina asked once our laughter died down no idea i said hey what taking so long we have classes too i shouted over the running water oliver fred called is that your dear kates my one and only he called back i smiled at that one and angelina and alicia threw me a quick look gosh you know this place is going down hill when you re not allowed to smile is she yelling at us to hurry up george asked because she knows that ll only make us take up more time fred called to his twin weasley that was all three of us look i called angelina feet are getting really smelly right about now and alicia cursing more than ever dontthink i wontuse them against you katie damn traitor for the record getting hit lightly by fellow chasers with their throwing arm hurts like i care fred said besides angelina said as i rubbed my recently attacked arm katie hair smells like mud and is packing 5 pounds of it mmmm oliver called my favorite i ran a hand through my sandy blonde hair and it came out dirtier than it already was i laughed just because she was so right then all the water shut off and the twins filed out oliver right behind them with towels around their waists and water still dripping off them the three of us sighed in relief that they were finally done and we started to walk in when oliver caught me around the waist into a tight hug he put his head into my muddy hair i think you smell delicious he whispered in my ear i laughed and he gently nipped my earlobe which made me jump a little how often does someone snack on your ear and you taste like strawberries he whispered i wrapped one arm around his neck the other was holding my towel and kissed him well you taste like coffee i rebutted smiling he laughed and tried to kiss me again but i put a finger to his lips strawberries need to be cleaned before you can eat them i pointed out he laughed again fine go take your shower and he let me go i gave him a quick peck on his lips before running to the shower promise me some more strawberries later he called before i went into the shower area i stopped and turned around only if you promise me more coffee alright he smiled it a deal then i laughed before running into the showers two days till my birthday march 13 friday potions i think so fred what cha get me for my birthday i asked in a whisper nothing he whispered back you re lying to me no i not yes you are prove it you re ears are turning to a fade shade of red now tell me what you got me no yes no yes no yes no mr weasley damn i hate that snape do you care to tell us about your no doubt highly intelligent conversation with miss bell sure professor he stood up cleaned his throat and i braced myself for the worst we were just discussing the probability to which the last time you washed your slimy hair just might be oh he just didntsay that with a straight face i think snape face was trying to implode on him everything seemed to move towards his greasy nose his eyes started to bug in and his mouth became a tiny line scrunched up in fury kinda scary 50 points from griffindor he finally said and detention tonight mr weasley well fred said as he sat back down next to me as snape walked away in a fury at least i donthave to go to practice tonight he was smiling he just lost us 50 points probably has to wash snape hair for his detention and he smiling oliver gonna have his head and tomorrow my birthday so did ya like i hope so warn me if oliver and katie are becoming gag cute versus

nightstand i groaned sat up and looked around i nearly screamed with joy scattered all over my bed and my nightstand was chocolates tons and tons of chocolates there is a god i sobbed tearlessly smiling from ear to ear and his name is oliver wood who else would give me a mountain of chocolate you ve got to love him he is the most nutritious person i know and he gives me like 5 pounds of chocolate which to him is like the devil itself i took a bite of one of the precious things coconut my favorite i had three more and i realized they were all coconut every last one scratch that last remark on oliver you know him being a god and replace it with the god of all gods i realized alicia and angelina werentin the dorm so i got out of bed quickly got dressed out of uniform thank god for saturday birthdays and practically skipped down the stairs into the common room i probably should try my best not to skip any more i think it was about 9 30 when i was done oliver alicia angelina and the twins were talking and oliver back was towards me so i did the only sensible thing i ran and jumped on his back morning sleeping beauty he laughed as i clung to his shoulders he was wearing that brown sweater he knows i love he so sweet how he remembers little things like that did you like the chocolates you are a god i said well happy birthday god damn it i love it when it my birthday angelina stomach growled loudly as i slipped off his back can we please get something to eat now that the beast is up she asked but if she thinks i didntnotice the emphasis on beast she is so wrong i laughed alright alright i ll comb my hair before i come down next time i said as we headed over to the portrait hole sesh not skipping would help to alicia said as i was about to take a bit of eggs my fork was suspended in front of my gaping mouth oh she saw that damn we had made our way to the great hall and to a very large breakfast laughing the whole way the twins and everyone else had made several remarks on how i could be a beast even on my birthday they still rag on me i was laughing too though but just wait till theirs whahahaha so what cha guys get me i asked after i was finished rocking back and forth slightly nothing oliver said taking the last bite of his toast pretty much fred agreed unless you count that huge prank we re going to pull on you later george corrected that kept me on my toes all day if i went to the bathroom i would either sprint there or look around every corner before walking past it i dontthink i ve ever seen you run so fast oliver laughed i had gone to the kitchens to grab a strapple and none other than oliver was there fred and george i gasped i just sprinted from the tower five floors up which is about a mile in this huge place prank that would do it he agreed taking a bite of a strapple strapple want some he offered i nodded still trying to catch my breath then he walked over to me and gave me some strapple the same way he did that day he went captain commando on us you know the official strapple kiss you could at least let me catch my breath i panted smiling after i swallowed i could he agreed but that would ruin all the fun what fun suffocating me oliver laughed and i gently grabbed the large ear of a house elf as it walked by yes ma am it asked with big eyes those thing are kinda cute when they want to be please explain to mr wood here i indicated to oliver that suffocating his girlfriend is not a nice thing to do it nodded and walked in front of oliver mr wood suffocating your girlfriend is not very nice it squeaked cute little thing and i sure she does not appreciate it it turned back to me good miss i beamed at the little thing and patted it head fondly very good it smiled sweetly before walking away i have got to get me one of those i sighed watching it walk away girlfriend he repeated i looked at him shocked what else would we be i think i was waving my hands in the air i ve got to remind people to slap me when i do that once just isntenough any more i dontknow he shrugged his shoulders friends with benefits oliver i groaned before he swept me up into another kiss jez kat he said afterwards i was only kidding you re really not doing the blonde stereotype any favors hu i glared at him smiling as i followed him out of the kitchens you are terrible i joked as we walked back up to the common room you know that right no i not he protested giving me another long kiss for the record birthday kisses are even better than regular kisses waaaaaaay better yes i said smiling and walking away yes you are i heard him laugh as he caught up to me on my left pray tell he said slipping his hand around my back and into the right back pocket of my jeans oh the list i sighed exasperatedly what he asked an eyebrow cocked showering you with chocolates which i canteat for another week i suddenly shouted he looked very confused by this what are you talking about i looked down at the floor and then back to him i have to fit into that dress oliver laughed it not funny yes it is he protested you ll fit into that dress no matter what i guarantee it oliver i said calmly pulling away and looking at him five pounds of chocolates doesntguarantee anything other than pimples and fat he just groaned girls are so self absorbed i dontthink mud for hair qualifies for self absorbed i said neither does waking up at dawn every other day sacrificing hours i would normally sleep eat and do homework and giving up the feeling in my muscles does either or alright alright he laughed you made your point thank you being smug is fun there was a long pause which i enjoyed my short lived victory but some girls are you can just not admit defeat i laughed can you well it true he rebutted some are so into their hair and make up and weight and clothes and how they look and on and on and on you re really not doing the jock stereotype any favors you know i terrible i know but i couldntresist and neither could you oliver just laughed slipping his hand back into my pocket i smiled snaked my arm around his waist and rest my head on his shoulder as we walked back to the common room we will get you by the end of the day you know i know fred you told me three times already i sighed exasperatedly oliver and i had just gotten back to the tower but i really dontthink you can pull it off us george asked looking fakely flustered not pull off a prank never never they chorused oh boy i ran up the stairs to my dorm before they would actually do something i should careful like this everyday with those two around they will get you i nearly jumped three feet in the air which was followed by my two best friends laughter it not funny i laughed i have a serious problem i always laughing or smiling or snorting because i trying not to laugh someday i going to burst out laughing at a funeral and then i ll be the one in the coffin yes my mom will kill me there has got to be an off button for laughter but they will alicia pointed out alicia was propped up against the pillows on her bed reading witch weekly and angelina was sorting her weird sisters cd s i walked over to my bed and looked underneath it under the covers and behind the pillows even in between that space between my mattress and nightstand before plopping down on it sanctuary i sighed how was your walk with our beloved captain angelina asked hmm i actually thought for a good word i know me actually thinking on my birthday on a saturday at all it was very strapplisious they laughed i thought it was a good way to put it grab your coat it was right before dinner and i was sitting in the common room just spacing out you know just taking a second to think just a second i was sitting on the couch and next thing i knew oliver was telling me to get my coat was that and order captain i smirked with an eyebrow cocked because you know that only allowed on the pitch never mind he sighed i ll just get it for you and he was about to start up the stairs when i practically flew past him i didntlike him giving me orders but i could get my own coat you are so stubborn he called as i ran up the stairs yeah i called over my shoulder i know so where to mr wood i asked cheerfully slipping my light coat on once we were outside the fat lady i ll show you he smiled with a wink before grabbing my hand and pulling me down the corridors i can be just as fast as him but his damn legs are longer than mine eventually we reached the statue of the humpback witch on the third floor we were about to crawl through the hole when i put a hand on oliver shoulder stopping him oliver i asked where everyone else they re meeting us he answered with that he slipped through the hole and looked back up at me are you coming no i said sarcastically as i climbed in i hate this tunnel i said about 15 minutes later it so low it true that thing is only like 5 feet high so you canteven walk upright in it it not even like your slightly bent over no it the whole nine yards me too oliver agrees from in front of me holding my hand it got to be worse for you you re a whole head taller than me i said sympathetically oliver squeezed my hand and looked back at me smiling it not all that bad i smiled back he so sweet sometimes you d never guess he our raging lunatic captain would you a few minutes later we were at the opening to honeyduke cellar any one up there i asked oliver as he lifted the passage door a smidget and peeked through nope he said lifting it up and getting out all clear once he was out he turned around and offered me a hand up we snuck out of honeyduke and out onto the streets of hogsmeade which wasntas easy as it sounded because it wasntfilled with students and it was harder to blend in hogsmeade looked as grand as ever though it was around seven i guess but it was still getting dark out early so the street lights were on and all the shops looked so cozy inside oliver slid a hand around my waist shall we he asked in a very droll and sophisticated voice layered onto his scottish accent where to i laughed slipping an arm around his waist the three broomsticks of course he laughed too so fred can flirt with rosemeata i asked as we made our way down the street i dontthink angelina will allow that anymore hmm she d probably slap him silly that would hurt and i would know i laughed thinking of the hundreds of thousands of times angelina has slapped me this year alone i telling you she could be a good beater if she want to so could you i groaned how many times do i have to tell you i am never picking up another beater bat after that happened i retiring from the beater position i still cantbelieve you thought i died ok i know i know i might ve over reacted just the tiniest bit i put my forefinger and thumb about a centimeter apart with my free hand i think it was a little bit more than that kat he said you were wondering if prairie dogs ate ground hogs i looked at him surprised my head tilted to the side smiling crookedly you remembered that he looked at me warmly um hu he nodded once slightly i also remember you waiting in the hospital wing all night and then fetching me food in the morning and i made you bring it back because it wasntnutritious enough you re such high maintenance i said jokingly at least one good thing came out of that though he said bracingly and what would that be i laughed losing one night of sleep that i dontthink i ever caught back no he laughed strapples i laughed how could i forget i slapped my forehead i so stupid sometimes well we cantalways be the brightest wire in the bulb he pointed out i walked closer to him nestling my head in his shoulder i still cantbelieve he remembered all those little things that happened months ago and i mean months but of course the street eventually ran out and we walked inside the three broomsticks where alicia angelina and the twins were of course waiting a our favorite raised table with six butter beers of course what took you two so long alicia laughed you move slower than slugs george added i realized george already had his hand around alicia waist and angelina was sitting on fred lap there is only about 1 teaspoon of alcohol in every butter beer just enough to warm you up and keep you smiling nothing big how long have they been here and how many butter beers have they had i asked oliver in a whisper oliver looked at his watch 7 34 well i did tell them to meet us here by 6 45 so figure one butter beer every ten minutes oh god we do walk slow oliver laughed and we took our seats at the table where fred went and fetched another round of butter beers i thought you guys said you werentgoing to get me anything i laughed as all of a sudden they piled gifts onto the table in front of me we can take them back if you want angelina said pfft i snorted i dontthink so my friends can read me like a book sometimes a book i mean they always find something that i ll absolutely know i ll love always with out fail god i need to become more complicated fred got me a light blue tee shirt that said i always give 100 at school and then it had all the school days listed underneath with a percentage listed next to it in the end if you added up all the days it was 100 for the whole week it so true though george got me a life time supply of quills we laughed at this i really need them though i go through quills faster than anyone i know i should stop sucking on my quills i have so many bad habits oliver got me a charm bracelet i know it sounds a little odd but just wait there were was a broom stick and quaffle of course but also a strapple a light bulb a little charm that said happy new years an american flag the patriots logo even a little marble note book he thought of everything everything that happened over the year so sweet angelina got me the weird sister new cd i probably should listen to that soon because she already asked me if i listened to it yet about a million times and alicia got me a book on the patriots you know every player they ve had over the past few years plus all the great ones and all their great wins and records and history and anything else you could think of it great i starting to think i not as complicated as i think or thought i said we were walking back to honeyduke around 9ish angelina and alicia were a bit ahead of me and oliver and of course oliver wouldntlet me carry my bag of gifts and of course my jacket was way to light to wear in the beginning of march at night really oliver said was that sarcasm i asked because you know that my job he laughed i know i know will you just let me take my own gifts i asked making a swipe for my bag but of course oliver was quicker and i missed of course no he smiled i just sighed and smiled then a strong gust of wind came past and sent a shiver up my spine it was freezing and i am such an idiot for the record i either forgetting something or taking the wrong thing always are you cold oliver asked concerned as i gave myself a little hug i stopped hugging myself no kat god damn my terrible lying skills i canteven tell a little white lie any more gah what i asked shoving my hands in my spring jacket pockets i fine you are a terrible liar he stopped walking and grabbed my elbow forcing me to stop too he put down the bag and took off his coat and before i could stop him i was wearing it i would seriously like to know when that slow mo machine is coming in really how does he move so fast or am i moving slower this is really starting to irk me hehehe irk that such a funny word hehehe oliver i groaned as he picked up the bag and we started walking again i fine really though that jacket of his is really warm it this big old demin jacket that fleece lined so warm and it huge on me so that makes it even better except now oliver is trudging down the hogsmeade in only a sweater oliver i groaned but he was ignoring me you re not aloud to ignore people on their birthday he laughed i guess you re right what is it i i stopped myself it was no use fighting with him thanks he slipped an arm around my waist anytime we had finally reached honeyduke where everyone else was waiting but we had encountered a problem um fred started it closed how are we going to get back i asked not only was it after hours not only we had a huge chance of getting caught and suspended so we couldntjust waltz back up to the castle but it was cold and dark dontworry george said in his so smooth you ll believe that everything s alright but it really isn t and that s why i m using this voice we ll take the passage through the shrieking shack how many butter beers did you have i asked in shock that goes straight to the whomping willow and that not even in the castle and we ll still have to walk around the grounds and the doors are locked and dontforget filch even if we do get in and peeves ll make a racket if he sees us and oliver put a hand on my shoulder take a breath kat he chuckled i took three deep breaths as everyone else tried to figure out a way to get back into the castle we could owl lee fred offered he could create a distraction or something so we could get back into the castle great idea fred alicia said with edginess that might someday rival mine maybe but what owl are we going to use we could use the post office george piped in but the post office ll be closed oliver said just like everything else everything except the three broomsticks angelina said softly looking down the street towards the place we could use rosmeata owl i said suddenly finally coming out of my little trance kat you re a genius i could see oliver beaming at me even though it was pretty dark so that why we need to use you re lovely owl miss fred is such a sweet talker he was leaning over the counter persuading more like flirting rosmeata into letting us borrow her owl he had on the face of an angel or so he would like to think meanwhile the rest of us were standing a few feet behind him rolling our eyes of course rosmeata giggled we rolled our eyes again just let me get him along with a quill and parchment with that she went into the back room behind the counter fred turned around his elbows leaning on the counter with a very smug look on his face am i good or what he asked cockily we all groaned or what is more like it angelina said a little irritated fred looked like he was going to say something but then rosmeata came back with a large barn owl some parchment and a quill thank you fred said perkily as he took the parchment and quill from rosmeata err what should i say he asked turning back towards us just gimme that i said taking the quill out of his hand dear lee your devil of a friend fred george has been very good on the other hand has gotten all of us in a spot of trouble you see we re currently trapped in hogsmeade with no way of getting back into the castle without getting caught so of course we need your help what time is it i asked everyone 9 25 9 27 no it 9 30 i groaned and looked at my own watch 9 29 we need you to make sure that one of the windows of that empty classroom on the first floor facing the lake is open you know the one you used it to prank snape we also need you to create a distraction at 10 15 on the other side of the castle west on one of the top floors so filch and everyone else is on the opposite side of the castle i know it a lot but since it my birthday and i dontrecall you getting me a gift this can substitute for it oh and fred head is on the line so you might want to do it as always katie and everyone else who currently wants to kill fred p s i dontcare what the distraction is as long as you dontrun around screaming sirius black is in the west astronomy tower and get yourself expelled it your choice lee will be up right i asked the twins as i tied the letter to rosmeata barn owl the twins nodded and i turned to the owl after we walked out the door go straight to lee do not wait till tomorrow morning find him now with that the owl gave what i hoped was a small nod and flew off towards the castle whose sitting on me not me not me i on a root not me er i think that me whose me katie oliver your twin angelina well i ll just hope it ange ow you didnthave to slap me so it was about ten to ten and we had made our way back up to the castle lake side and were currently waiting at the edge of the forest until 10 15 came around and apparently angelina was sitting on fred though i not sure how she got there we were packed close together though and i dontknow why either well you didnthave to flirt with rosmeata i wasntflirting stop slapping me stop lying will you two just quit it i asked no oh boy they ll figure it out on their own oliver said his arm around my shoulders oliver was sitting down at the base of a tree his back up against the trunk and i was leaning on his side they re just so so i searched for a word fightable oliver offered watching the two of them fight meant for each other i sighed though fightable did work i dontcare what anybody else says it true so true angelina is the only one who could tame fred sort of i dontthink fred can be tamed but she ll be the closest i can guarantee it oliver chuckled and i sighed contently nestling my head into his chest more comfy he asked very i answered and he chuckled again you know you re way too sweet to me i said after a long pause what what does that mean he asked shocked hu i was very confused at first i sat upright and looked at him then i thought over what i just said oh oh no no no no no no i meant like you re so sweet i dontdeserve you not that you re too sweet to me and i dontlike it i didntmean it like that i meant it in a good way i swear he laughed what so funny i asked confused more than ever you how in god name oh the confusion i dontknow he answered truthfully you always make me laugh though hm i thought on the thought wow did that make sense go figure he chuckled again and i leaned back against him and sighed contently he started stroking my hair and i traced a small circle on his chest with my finger i kept thinking how lucky i was how lucky to have such great friends plus oliver of course who is in the friends category in my little head and in another all his own hem hem it 10 13 my little love birds i looked up at alicia when it her birthday come april i going to ruin every sentiment moment between her and george just wait your i repeated skeptically smiling with one eyebrow cocked as i got up and then offered oliver a hand i not yours or so you d like to think she stuck her tongue out at me come on we better hurry up it almost a quarter after so we all walked over to the classroom we told lee to leave a window open apparently fred and angelina patched things up because he was holding her hand those two ok fred said once we reached the windows his hand placed on one now for the moment of truth and he slid the window open we prayed he would slide the window open it didn t we tried every single window for that class room we tried every single window on that floor on this side of the castle every single one not one opened not one well this is great angelina said flopping down on the floor underneath a window about thirty minutes later this is just freakin bloody great did you address the letter to lee katie alicia asked me well kinda spat at me of course i did lic i spat back throwing my arms in the air why doesntanyone slap me these days what kind of idiot do you think i am w ok that enough you two oliver said getting in between us kat sent the letter to lee but i guess he didntget it we ll just have to find another way in and how do you suppose we do that alicia spat at him hm scotty gosh lic comes up with some really weird insults sometimes he scottish so she calls him scotty oh boy we need to teach her some new insults oliver ignored her but i was glaring at her weasley oliver said firmly yes they chorused i wanted to giggle at that but i stopped myself i dontwhat made me want to laugh i dontknow if it was the situation or the fact that actually i really dontknow but i know i did stop myself from laughing which is really hard is there another passage in oliver asked i noticed he was using his i m your captain and you better do what i say or i swaer i will run you into the ground damn it voice err yes and no george said what does that mean it means it goes into the dungeons fred explained holy fudge that pretty much sums up our little adventure holy fudge fred i asked on hand holding oliver and the other holding my gifts my shoes and one foot of my jeans submerged underwater yes why the hell didntyou mention this part you do want to get back into the castle without getting caught dontyou yes well this is the only way the only way the only way are you sweet talking me i think he was i mean i really think he was according to him the only way back into the castle was to wade through one foot of water through the small tunnel that lead from the dungeons to the lake so god knows what we were wallowing in i starting to think i d rather get caught alicia said as she stumbled and george caught her just in time we wontget caught fred said reassuringly that not what i said alicia the ice princess i swear she can lace her words so coldly you d think it was january but when your freezing and your feet and calves are under water it already feels like it i told you fred said we had finally reached the dungeons and it was only 12 go fred i so happy please ok can we go back now angelina asked i cold and i wet and i swear if i get sick if anyone gets sick oliver corrected back in captain mode it ll be double practice everyday for you fred oliver was looming over fred their noses about an inch apart oliver have i ever let you down before fred asked innocently yes oliver said and i could think of those few times normally the twins can get out of any spot of trouble but not always they do get caught once and a while it not like they actually are the gods of mischief can we just get back to the common room i asked quietly i was cold and tired and wet too everyone was and i didntwant to get caught let s fred said rather cheerfully before bounding out of the dungeons and away from oliver i m going to kill you because i m the captain and the rules say i can gaze so after another 15 minutes of running quietly through secret passages and corridors praying filch wasntaround every corner we finally made it back up to the common room though i dontknow how you can run quietly in wet floppy squishy loud noise making sneakers oh thank heaven i said before flopping face down on the couch well it 12 13 alicia said looking at her watch it no longer you re birthday actually i rebutted i have till 6 33 this morning so there i gave her a raspberry george chose that moment to take off his soaking left shoe which contained an ocean of that water that had god knows what in it that was by far the stupidest thing we have ever done by far fred agreed i never using that passage again unless i need a way to pull pranks on all the slytherins at once george nodded in agreement and angelina sat on my butt and i of course kicked her with my own wet sneaker jez katie angelina said rubbing the now wet spot where i kicked her get off of me before i kick you again i mumbled sleepily and she got off hey it had been a long day i sprinted around the castle where ever i went spent half the day in hogsmeade and half of that time we were trying to figure out a way back to the castle where lee alicia asked suddenly probably up in the dorm george yawned let go pay him a visit i said and before any one could stop me i was marching up the stairs and into the boys dorms up to the fifth years dorm and wrenched the door open where i promptly walked over to lee bed and glared down at him kates fred said as he came in not five seconds after me you cantkill lee but i wasntgoing to kill lee i was going to kill fred for sitting on lee shoulder was a large barn owl rosmeata barn owl fred i said slowly turning my head towards him i not going to kill lee he took a sigh of relief i going to kill you and i took a leap at his neck and strangled him or so i would ve liked oliver came in the second i started to leap at fred and some how caught me in mid air someone getting cranky oliver said in a sing song voice me currently slung over his shoulder where the hell is that slow mo machine hmm i would like to know people oliver i really dontcare if i woke up the entire house i really don t they ll get over themselves i sure they will even if they don t i dontcare yes oliver asked kindly as he sat me down on my bed i gave a loud sigh nothing a long pause i mean a very long pause that was three time tonight fred was wrong i burst out three oliver chuckled what so funny i told you already you he said you act like you re never wrong well way to make me feel like a prick i said he chuckled again and gave me a peck on my fore head i hate you i said half glaring at him no you don t so he chuckled again before giving me a long kiss on the lips i really dontsee what so funny i smiled damn that man always making me smile when i supposed to be mad i really need to find an off button for all this smiling and laughing and snorting because i trying not to laugh all of a sudden i yawned boy oliver said am i really that boring i laughed before giving him a kiss never i yawned again afterwards boy i am terrible truly truly terrible alright alright oliver said i ll let you go to bed he walked towards the door night sleeping beauty he spoiling me he so sweet to me it a freaking crime and now i canteven get to sleep that was two hours ago two and i still haventgotten to sleep gah maybe i ll go down to the common room it was the best birthday ever though even though i think i catching a cold and everything but who cares jez i still have oliver coat

selves so we re always saying you rock my knee high socks when someone does good but that besides the point ok i going to stop rambling now but thanks for the bowing i really appreciate it because you know i a role model march 15 sunday noon they have got realize where they fall asleep there are first years running around i opened my eyes to my friends instantly jumping five feet in the air and falling off the couch wait a second i donthave a couch did i mention i hit my head on the coffee table does anyone notice there is never any coffee on a coffee table i donthave a coffee table either what the hell is going on i asked shocked you would wonder too if you were sprawled on the floor in your pajamas in the common room with almost everyone starring at you i did remember to put my pajama bottoms on right ok i was good i remembered just checking you want to tell us angelina asked as alicia giggled behind her err i asked you for a reason i said i wouldntask if i knew fred and george were on the verge of cracking up hysterically their faces turning as red as their hair are they drunk i asked angelina not as drunk as you she laughed i sure what the hell are you talking about i asked shocked the twins were the ones who wanted fire whiskeys i followed there gaze and nearly hit my head on the coffee table again oliver was asleep on the couch the same couch i just got petrified off of in a tee shirt and the boxers we got him as a joke last christmas the ones with the snitches quaffles and everything god damn it they will never let me live it down ne v er and as i looked at this sight last night came flooding back and i really mean flooding tidal wave flooding why the hell didnti remember why and why the hell was he wearing those boxers so last night here what happened remember i couldntfall asleep and how i said i might go down to the common room well i did and oliver was there couldntsleep either he asked as i sat down next to him on the couch remember this was at like three in the morning i shook my head and nearly laughed at the boxers remember saturday is wash day so those adorable house elves had all our decent clothes i cantbelieve you kept those i laughed remember i had crawled through a foot of god knows what on my birthday in the middle of the night directed by fred weasley no less i had rights to a good laugh oliver blushed a little i terrible i know i sorry i said as i just managed to die down my laugh but i was sure you would ve thrown those out the day we got them for you it has crossed my mind he smiled putting his arm around me god bless his soul no other guy could take me i swear so we talked for a bit and we eventually fell asleep that all so i had fallen asleep on the couch with oliver stomach pressed against my back and his arms just happen to find their way around me so what i ll tell you what i going to get interrogated by the interrogating energizer cops that what god damn our stupid stunts god damn em that was the flood of what would soon become the longest day of my life poor oliver though his wake up was just as bad as mine without the really bad bed hair well not as bad as mine what going on he asked his eyes still closed as he rubbed the sand out of his eyes he finally managed to pry them open you should ve seen the look on his face if it had happened any other way i would ve but considering the circumstances not only would it have been terribly mean but my interrogation would ve been even longer he just looked from me still sitting on the floor shocked to angelina to a giggling alicia to the hysterically laughing twins to his boxers and back to me now his face was as red as the twins hair morning oliver i said with fake cheerfulness did you sleep good uh hu hu hu his face finally turned the proper shade of of flesh i guess right like a dream he smiled cockily was the cockiness called for i mean he was sitting in the common room in his boxers the kiddy boxers ok so it was funny and i snorted because i was trying not to laugh god damn my ability to laugh at anything and everything and i was still sitting on the floor now if you dontmind me he said standing up and stretching he so cocky sometimes i think i better go find my jeans and he sauntered off towards the boys dorm and up the stairs i think he proud of those boxers i think i should go find mine too i said looking at my pajamas and unlike oliver i flew up the stairs to my dorm 6 pm would some one like to explain why there is no god damn heating in this place i said my teeth chattering i was stuck wearing a pair of jeans and a really old really thin tee shirt i hate wash day i hate it i hate it i hate it all my clothes are gone all of them did i mention i was freezing what were we doing oh yeah we were with fred and george who were planning a prank on some slytherin fourth year that apparently talked bad about them last week i didntmind but we were in one of those secret rooms with stone cold walls and floors so it was even colder no idea fred said i not too cold though well of course you re not i said edgily hugging myself you re wearing a nice warm sweater well if you didntspill eggs on your sweaters you would have one too you re the one who threw them at me did not you did so i dontrecall fredrick weasley yes i hate you so maybe i didn t but i did hate having no decent and warm clothing they all had a sweater of sweat shirt all of mine were in the wash next time fred throws eggs at me i chucking the copper pitcher of juice at him in the head here oliver said handing me the brown sweater he was wearing seconds before he is so sweet to me and i mean sweet beyond belief but if i took it he would ve been the one freezing he had a tee shirt on underneath thought you d like to know that i shook my head just take it kat he groaned he really should ve seen this coming though no point in two of us being cold i said i ll be fine he said practically shoving his sweater in my face just take it i shook my head again i ok really kat he groaned i shook my head again just take the damn sweater katie you know it bad when everyone is screaming at you well oliver wasn t so everyone minus the really incredibly ridiculously so sweet and nice one who happens to be scottish and did i mention really sweet one alright i gave up taking oliver sweater and throwing it one my god it was so warm it was decently big on me but it was so warm i know why oliver wears it all the time not because he looks ridiculously good in it but because it so flipping warm oliver i sighed smiling you are a god i know he smiled cocky bastard very sweet one though take five giant steps back because he mine all mine march 17 tuesday herbology ugh i hate classes there will always be some random pop quiz on some random goblin from some random time period in some random rebellion for some random reason always randomly and professor binns isntactually doing us any favors he might say it ll help us on our owls but it really doesn t it can t i mean unless they want to fry our brains out he not helping me one bit by the by the energizer cops did interrogate me so what exactly happened alicia asked shining a light in my face god have mercy i couldntfall asleep so i went down stairs i said for the umpteenth time and angelina asked and what i asked and what happened she said again and i went downstairs because i couldntfall asleep umpteenth and one i just said that remember who was down there alicia asked ignoring my question santa claus i said sarcastically i couldntsee there face because of the light in my eye so i continued yup he was there alright and he gave me and oliver so oliver was down there yes alicia i groaned this had been going on for an hour now oliver was down there did you miss the fact that he had fallen asleep on the couch why was he wearing boxers angelina asked and why was he wearing those prank boxers that was alicia do they turn you on what were you two doing is there something you re not telling us why hey where are you going but did they seriously think i would sit around and let them play a billion questions with me i dontknow what they re thinking sometimes and they re the ones who should be getting interrogated what does that mean george no really what do you mean by that do i really need to spell it out for you yes you re just as bad as you re carbon copy actually i the older one i know george you tell me all the time but what do you mean you pull stuff on almost everyone on the castle and you two are the ones who are always getting in trouble for doing stupid stuff i still dontknow what you mean actually i dontthink i know either hmm what a fantastic thought to ponder when have you ever thought hmm another good thought to ponder hmm hmm george yes get out of my note book you mean your diary no i mean my stupid note book no george hmm i going to ponder hmmm ponder some where else do you still have oliver jacket damn i forgot to give that back good can i borrow it no why not i going to let you put glue in oliver jacket i cantbelieve i forgot to give that thing back whatever what about his sweater damn it you are so forgetful kates get out 9 pm i cantbelieve i forgot to give this back i said apologetically as i handed oliver his jacket back as we headed towards the pitch dontworry about it he laughed i think you re going to need it again though god damn it i forgot to bring a jacket again i really dontknow what wrong with me i sighed putting on his jacket once again and i still have your sweater oliver waved it off i know you ll get it to me sooner or later probably later you know i pointed out then so be it he said slipping an arm around my waist i thought this was immensely sweet then practice started we had to run around the pitch four times with our brooms in our hand for god knows why why oliver flew next to us on his broom yelling 100 push ups and 100 sit ups oh but there more when we did our push ups the chasers had to balance a quaffle on our back and the twins had to balance a deactivated bludger we did everything in our padding everything and oliver just paced in front of us saying encouraging words like god damn it push it dontyou dare start slacking off if you give me any more lip i swear i ll make you do a 100 more push ups what an encouraging captain we have i m going to kill you wood i panted around my 70th push up kill me after your push ups bell he said in his god damn it i said don t give me lip voice which i tacking on 20 more for you yeah right i can barely do 20 and i had no idea how i had gotten this far another 50 nope not going to happen at least without a fight while he was yelling at fred who was next to me i made a wild grab for his ankle you know to trip him but at that second he moved down the line and i fell flat on my face dontmake me give you another 30 bell he threatened taking a second to stop yelling at george to yell at me damn him i did do those 100 and 20 push ups though i think that showed him sure i was dead and i could no longer feel my arms but i showed him ha but i still hadntgotten him back so half way through the sit ups i tried to kick his shin and i did but i forgot we were all still in all our padding which consisted of shin guards that another 30 sit ups bell damn him so 4 laps around the pitch 120 push ups and 130 sit ups and one head filled with oliver yelling at us i was dead you know i can barely lift this book up i said i was walking back to the common room with oliver and i had my potions text book opened in one hand and a stubby quill in the other writing notes in the margin dontgive me lip next time he laughed oliver i said trying to stay calm my arms about to fall of my legs are about to fall out from underneath me and i dontthink i ll be able to eat for another three days my stomach hurts so much and your screaming rants are swimming in my head i have reason to give you lip oliver chuckled i dontthink you ve ever gotten this sore have you no ok by now there was no stopping me i wasntable to give oliver any physical pain during practice so it only made sense that i yelled at him now and dontyou dare say well that becasuse you never give me 100 and 10 percent because i give you 120 percent every god damn practice weither it at one in the morning or two in the afternoon so dontyou dare say that i was breathing like a madman quick shallow breaths i swear if you saw me you would ve thought i was an axe murderer but he took it all he didntinterrupt me once for a freaking kilt wearing scottish son of a bitch captain he can be a very good listener fair enough he said cheerfully damn him now what did you need help with double damn him always making me smile and being so sweet i can only stay made at him on the pitch triple damn him this god damn potion i said pointing my stubby quill to one particularly complex one oh that one yes oliver that one that an easy one well i thought it was complex i mean it takes two weeks to make oh olllllllliiiiiiiiiiver i stopped in my tracks we both did that was one voice i never ever ever wanted to hear again never the less it was in a sing song voice from none other than a nat the nat to be more precise the natasha what s her face so i cantremember her ugly last name so sue me oliver slowly turned his head to where the voice came and of course natasha came walking towards us swinging her hips a smile across her face and an emerald envelope in her hand if there was one person to be damned it was her hello oliver she said his name in such a way it wanted to make me puke which is really weird because i like his name but when she says it it just wrong er hello natasha poor guy had no clue what to do with the situation oh but i did i was ready to pounce on her and beat her to a pulp but oliver didntcall her nat so take that prissy oliver must ve seen the look on my face probably the look satan gave to god when he got kicked out of heaven or at least something very very very close to it er did you need something he asked could i talk to you for a second she asked twirling a piece of her wavy black hair around her finger no hell no go away you had your chance god damn it he mine will some one please clue me in to when i got so possessive about oliver please oliver looked at me while i was starring daggers knives swords and anything else pointy at natasha only for a second ok i promise she said putting a hand over her heart god somebody hex me better yet hex her please but next thing i knew she dragging him halfway down the corridor by his hand wither her hand somebody hex her please i should ve but i didn t i was still standing there like an idiot in the midst of writing something in my textbook with my bag over my shoulder and yes i was still glaring daggers and several other pointy objects and i continued to glare with my objects that should be flying through the air to natasha s pig head and stuck up nose and kill her because they re really pointy and nobody likes her look i continued to give her this certain look until she bounded around the corner and oliver walked back towards me well he said in conclusion that was unexpected what i was more or less desperate to know and yes i was still halfway done writing a note in the margin what was unexpected err he scratched the back of his head god what happened she asked me to the fundraiser i instantly dropped my note book and quill and let my bag slide off my shoulder and slam to the floor did i mention that i rolled up my sleeves as i went for my wand as i marched down the hall after natasha boy she was going to get it kat if oliver hadntran down the hall after me and grabbed both my arms oliver i screamed if anyone was on that floor they would ve thought i was being kidnapped let me go why how he was being so calm i will never know so i can kill her run natasha run because if she didnt and if oliver hadntstopped me she d be dead by now why do you want to kill her how the hell was he being so calm i mean he was holding me back and by then i was kicking and fighting as hard as i could to go kill her because she asked me to the fundraiser of course you twit dontyou even want to know what i said we were still standing in the middle of the corridor i was still kicking oliver was somehow still calm and collective and my books and bag were some thirty yards away flung across the floor not really i am so immensely stubborn sometimes you are so stubborn sometimes kat thank you for that update oliver i know already and you never know how truly strong someone is until they hold you back when you re on the warpath let me tell you what i said at least then i ll let go and you re free to kill her i stopped struggling fair enough so he stopped holding me and i turned on my heel two inches from his nose what happened exactly boy i am sure a piece of work sometimes she asked if i would go to the fundraiser with her he said yeah i know that i mean that what sent me on the warpath and and i told her i was going with you really i asked shocked i dunno why i was shocked i mean me and oliver had never officially went on a date but i did have all the other privileges if you count getting yelled at on the pitch everyday too of course he nearly laughed arentwe i i guess i figured right who else would i go with now he was laughing well we never actually clarified it i pointed out getting flustered well then he said will you go with me i laughed he had gotten down on one knee like he was asking me to marry him and he had one of my hand in both of his please he asked with his i would call this look puppy eyes but i really can t because i m a captain and no way would anyone catch me with puppy eyes but this look is good enough to do the trick look alright i laughed alright it settled then he said cheerfully jumping up to his feet and he started walking back towards the common room but i didntfollow what he asked looking back at me can i kill her now i asked he laughed but i didn t come on kat he laughed save it for another day i looked down the hall where natasha had gone i d probably never find her now promise he smiled crookedly promise i looked down the corridor one more time fair enough and after i fought with oliver stating several facts why i can carry all my books and bag by myself we finally made it back to the common room i know i know i haventupdated in ages and i deserve to be shot for it dontworry though i ll have the ball in the next chapter i had volleyball i got pulled up to varsity so practice runs till 6 30 and school started gah and i dontactually have any extra free time until like 8 30 and i guilty because normally i spend it crashing on the couch until i cantkeep my eyes open any more which is at like 9 15 a charming life i lead hu i know excuses suck but i think i have a decent one going here and go read oliver wood love by slytherinfan15 yeah friend of mine and i promised i would spread the word and you guys haventleft any reviews for her so go love ya lots sigh reviews got to love them now you all better love me big because i just got home from a 10 hour volleyball tourney that ok because we came in first suckers and the first thing i did after i got home took a shower and gorged myself with all the food i could reach i started this so onward and gasp someone else does crew i had no idea what school do you row for evelas when i tell someone i do crew they give me this weird look and ask me what the hell i taking about ok i ll stop rambling now and just start march 20 friday 7 30 i am going to cry by this time tomorrow i will still be running around in a dress and high heels god have mercy let just say i am not the most graceful person in the world so mixing me with high heels is a definite no at like five everyone whose going to this thing is taking a portkey there from the great hall normally i would expect that granger girl to pop out of no where and give me a lecture on why that cantbe possible because of all this crap she read in hogwarts a history and then i would proudly say that it is possible because dumbledore arranged it especially and she would huff out the door and i would smile all proud of myself because i was smarter than her on this small fact what a run on sentence march 22 sunday 10 am talking bout last night though holy fudge my poor feet but other than that this shin dig wasntas bad as i thought it would of course it took us like three hours to get ready did i mention i really dontwant to go to this thing i asked my two best friends as we got ready about a million times angelina said me and alicia were currently doing her hair so it wasntin those braids but wavy and smooth kinda like mine and alicia s kinda come on katie alicia sighed from next to me it ll be fun two inch heels are not fun alicia they just laughed guys this is pointless i said as angelina and alicia did my hair and makeup two hours later it was my turn damn it i not going to look any better ouch angelina had poked me in the eye with the mascara how you poke a person eye with mascara i have no idea eye liner i could see but i refused to let them put any on me but mascara sorry she said apologetically as i rubbed my eye but you really shouldntsquirm jesus lic i screamed as alicia pulled really hard on a lock of my sandy blonde hair i not made of steel hush up she said too motherly like for me i almost done same here angelina said now onto blush i was going to regret this i was going to look hideous they probably did my make so i would look like a clown when i looked in the mirror it was amazing i screamed before jumping up and hugging my two best friends i dontknow how they did it but my hair and make up looked amazing i mean perfectly amazing it was crazy the make up made the green in my eyes stick out even more and my hair fell around my in loose curls you two are gods pure gods i know they sighed sounding a lot like me actually was that a shot at 4 52 precisely we were in our dresses and were making our way down to the great hall with oliver and the twins who looked excellent in a suit oliver i mean i mean wow how could our captain who loves to run us into the ground just for fun look so damn good oh yeah his oliver my freaking scottish kilt wearing son of a bitch captain that how but i praising the lord he went with suit pants over a kilt that would be too much like that weird dream i had a while back did i tell you you look great oliver asked offering me his elbow i link my arm threw his and looked down at my emerald green dress and half thought what the hell is he talking about but smiled none the less oliver what he asked i not aloud to tell you how beautiful you look ok i laughed now you re insulting my intelligence no matter how little of it i have he chuckled as we entered the great hall what ever you say kat what ever you say he has finally realized how stubborn i am and has given up the fight ha ha i hate portkeys i said from the ground yeah i can barely stand up after a portkey in sneakers did they really think i could manage it in heels i hope not then they re stupider than i though me too alicia said from next to me at least i wasntthe only one who fell down actually a lot of people had everyone one who was in the great hall seconds ago was now in the entrance to the ministry of magic and half of them were on the floor haha oh wait i was one of them damn need a hand up fred laughed him his twin and oliver gave us a hand up how they hell had they managed to stay up it has got to be the heels it got to be so we straightened out our dresses and continued following the mass of people down a hall or two until we came to this gigantic room it was a dome as big as a pitch with tables a dance floor music and no doubt somewhere in the mass of people my family i was thinking how long i could avoid them when katie there you are i was wondering when you would finally get here my mom i prepared myself for the worst my mom has a way of doing that though she did look pretty good in a navy blue dress but that beside the point a green dress green was always your favorite color and it does look rather good she turned to oliver who was standing inches behind me run oliver run while you still can and oliver how nice to see you dear too late it nice to see you too mrs bell he said with a smile how have things been oh fine she smiled just fine but i haventbeen able to place this mystery boy katie been with i slapped my forehead do you have any idea who it is hun hun i have lived with this woman for 16 years and i still not a hun my older brother has just become a hun how the hell did oliver pull it off in record time he doesnteven live with her well he started mom i said it oliver i know this is oliver she said looking at me rather shocked how could i forget who he is no mom i said oliver is the mystery guy i ve been trying to tell you for nearly a month she finally made the connection i always thought i taught you something worth knowing she beamed it was going to be a long night yes mom i agreed fakedly in a rather fake voice that she surprisingly didntcatch onto have you seen you re father she asked suddenly ma i said getting rather annoyed i just got here well where lance she asked before walking off to find him after i rolled my eyes and sighed damn i forgot he was going to be here now how to avoid him sis too late bear hug older brother bear hug back breaking older brother bear hug ouch is all i can say you look pretty spiffy lance laughed as he took my hand from behind me and twirled me a bunch of times till i was almost too dizzy to stand up and hand to hold my spinning head thanks lance thanks i guess you re not the jock i brought you up to be hu nice to see you too i laughed once the room stopped spinning lance older brother extraordinaire same hair as me but as a boy cut of course kinda long kinda short just over the top of his ears but no more same eyes too you can tell were related except his 6 foot and i 5 7 5 9 with heels mwhahahaha so whose this mystery boy ma been going on about he asked i heard oliver chuckle slightly from behind me did you bring him i sighed how many times was i going to have to do this oliver mystery boy lance older brother i introduced them with hand movements and all lance older brother oliver mystery boy got it lance because we have to go find the i had taken oliver by the hand and started to lead him away when lance caught hold of my other hand damn him forgot he used to be a seeker damn it but maybe i want to talk to him lance said oh god no is you re tie on too tight i asked i think i threw my hands in the air why doesntanybody ever slap me you know oliver he over like everyday every summer for the past four years you practiced with him why do you want to talk now lance shrugged his shoulders maybe dad wants to talk to him too hell no ever since i was a little pre teen every boy that has stepped within a twenty feet boundary of me my dad has asked questions some are ok and some are not ok like where we ll be that night that ok what fantasies have you had of my daughter not ok and chances are it could be even more not ok not good we had to escape now peaches too late bear hug dad bear hug even more back breaking dad bear hug ouch again hi dad i said smiling my dad has always called me peaches and it always makes me smile how things at school he asked keeping your grades up as best as i know how i said truthfully even if that consisted of oliver tutoring me every other day good he said giving me a heavy pat on the back i fell forward and almost onto my face but oliver caught me at the last second you would ve thought he had run off into some corner by now good ol oliver good reflexes my dad said to oliver how have you been wood good as always he replied smiling why does everyone forget i in heels sandal heels no less dontthey remember i can barely function in converse low tops what wrong with these people so do you know anything about katie mystery boy wood my dad laughed as oliver helped me back to my feet damn heels that all i have to say actually dad i said now somehow balanced on those terrible things they call heels it oliver i know it oliver he said what the hell you re last name still is wood right of course oliver smiled god bless his soul dad oliver is the mystery boy i explained slowly dad face suddenly went from laughing to ridiculously serious my dad is a full on 43 year old italian dark hair and eyes the works he from southern italy and my mom side of the family is from northern italy everyone knows northern italians have the lighter hair and eyes just thought i d clear that up so this change in emotion was rather odd i guess can i have a word with you my dad asked oh my god say no oliver just say no sure people were milling about and talking around us but this conversation will be the one talked about for centuries it ll be the kind that haunts every teenage girls dreams sure how can oliver be so cheerful at a time like this so how did all this happen my dad asked ok question oliver told him about the ravenclaw match my dad currently had no objections she had told me she didntwant a boyfriend what happened ok question i guess she changed her mind oliver said shrugging his shoulders i certainly didntdo it for her no objections done anything i should know about er getting rather close to the not ok questions category no sir he used sir my dad is going to love him nothing out of the ordinary no objections have you ever pictured my daughter naked not ok dad oliver looked rather stunned by the question lance looked like he was going to burst out laughing dad looked as composed as ever but i could see faint smile lines suddenly appearing around his eyes no oliver said steadily and calmly i hold kat in the highest respect good my dad smiled why dontyou go find the weasleys hmm peaches good i repeated shocked and probably as red as the fat lady who just barged past me dress which was red how was that question good excuse us oliver said placing his hand on my lower back and steering me away from the two of them i think some one just got asked lots of fatherly questions fred said in a sing song voice as me and oliver sat down with angelina alicia and the twins at a round table for six did he alicia asked me she had been there three years ago when some other guy got asked the questions yes i groaned slamming my head on the table no quidditch game going on there they all burst into laughing except oliver i think he was still partially stunned poor guy and there was more to come over the next hour i would introduce the once mystery guy but not any more because i think everyone even the tiniest bit related to me knows him aka oliver i always knew you d find some one nice katie thanks aunt karen eh and such a good looker too you ve got good taste kid thank you grandma i knew they d end up together ever since they were in diapers we re not getting married nana and we didntknow each other when we were in diapers if things dontwork out between you two here my number good bye laura cousin three years older than me new boy friend every other day katie i turned around in my chair afraid to find out what other long lost relative wanted to meet oliver next this was like one big bad family reunion but with other families and almost everyone i knew from school which made it even worse but it wasntas bad as i thought actually i was rather happy to see me favorite cousin joe he was one year older than me 6 dark curly hair which was a little long and desperately needed a hair cut shining dark brown eyes and always good for a laugh joe i laughed as i stood up and he gave me a hug what are you doing here mom he said simply italian mothers i just dontget it ok oliver said as i sat back down in my seat next to him after joe left now it my turn with that he took my hand and dragged me all the way across the room to a large table with many people talking with rough scottish accents even more so than oliver s meet the woods katie dear hello mrs wood i managed through a tight hug from oliver mom i haventseen you since last summer she said through a large accent how have ya been just fine i smiled tucking a lock of hair behind me ear how have you been ah same as always she sighed smiling same as always of course i knew oliver mom dad and older brother but i didntknow his uncles aunts grandparents cousins or second and third cousins he got a family to rival the size of mine always knew you d find a nice lass one of oliver uncle said giving him a large slap on the back but oliver didntfall forward like i did heels remember the heels and i can truthfully say meeting his family was much more enjoyable than the other way around even though he knew half of them from several summer get togethers and what a pretty one too hu laddie ya did me proud boy i remember this one two summers ago wasn it and such a sweet heart too i love his family so many ridiculously nice comments all i ever get is katherine ann why dontyou ever put your hair down those jeans again why not a skirt fun hu but lance normally backs me up until he moved out so by 7 i was officially introduced out and we made our way over to the weasley table for god knows why i guess because angelina alicia and the twins were there but we certainly cantforget about percy will you just shut up percival i still dontsee why you re wearing those suits you look so immature because we look bloody dashing in them that why i agree with percy wow four words i never thought i d say together but since fred and george would kill me if i sided with him i going to have to scratch that last remark and replace it with the twins do look dashing in those brightly colored suits even though they look more hysterical than dashing or whatever they want to look like but not hysterical like haha you two are idiots but more like wearing a bright orange and sky blue suit is a typical twin thing haha and it true mrs weasley almost blew a gasket are you trying to embarrass me she shouted to the roof but the music and the chatter was pretty loud so i would guess only half of the room had heard her why on god green earth would you wear those you have perfectly good black ones the twins just looked innocently up at her in their bright suits as i cracked up hysterically from behind her holding onto oliver arm for support i was about to roll around on the ground but mum fred said taking off his orange top hat that went with his suit dontyou want everyone to remember us years from now i think the is the perfect way to do it george agreed spinning his sky blue top hat on the cane he brought the perfect way to do it would to behave like actual gentleman mrs weasley pointed out correctly but we were talking about the twins here they were always the center of attention wither they wanted to or not because they always insured a good laugh those suits clashed terribly with their hair too which made me laugh even harder got to love them kat oliver said through his own chuckling i think you re going to have to breathe soon i hahahaha can t i laughed hysterically barely able to spit out my words it too damn hahahahahaha funny god i must ve looked like i was drunk brilliant here alicia said through her own giggles passing my a napkin you re starting to tear up i dabbed my eyes and finally calmed down as mrs weasley stalked away i cantbelieve her fred said putting his large top hat back on i was sure these suits would be a hit george said still spinning his on the cane just then fudge the minister of magic was up on some platform and started giving us some drabble de do that he thought we would actually listen too quality quidditch supplies i saw oliver instantly focused on what fudge was saying at this point has donated a firebolt to the occasion which we shall raffle off at the end all the money raised tonight from our several raffles will go to st mungo which is currently reaching out to third world countries and berttie botts would like to remind you all of the splendid new flavors and the rest was some drabble but i saw the gleam in oliver eyes you re not seriously thinking you could win i said looking at him some what skeptically do you a firebolt he said softly i could win one oh boy oliver i snapped my fingers in front of his face to bring him out of his little trance you re not going to empty your safe out on some raffle you ll never win that one wasnta question more or less a command but i could win one he said excitedly oliver i groaned you know you ll never win but i could oliver it d be a million to one chance at best i said sympathetically and knowing my math skills it could be even worse he chuckled and seemed to forget about it for a while as we made our way back to our table with the twins and angelina and alicia where food suddenly appeared but his holy crap i have got to win look came back once angelina brought it up but just think she said we could have two firebolts on our team i d love to see the look on flint face hey two firebolts would ensure us the cup i had to agree on that it might pop a few of those pimples he has fred laughed through a mouthful of potatoes we all laughed maybe it would pop a few it d be doing the world a favor oliver sighed no doubt thinking of brooms quaffles and snitches oliver i groaned you re practically in the same spot all the time anyway i pointed out and you re broom is one up on mine i had a swift wing great broom but oliver nimbus was better the world knew that one and all he really did was circle around the rings or hover around the middle one other than that he either barged around the pitch giving us advice more like not so friendly yelling after that came the worst part dancing i was required to dance by none other than mom damn that woman angelina fred alicia and george were probably the first ones on the dance floor it was quite a sight and i was enjoying it want to dance oliver asked holding out his hand um alright i managed taking his hand and walking out onto the dance floor ok let me tell you a crucial piece of information i can fly i can probably beat you at quidditch any day of the week day or night but i cannot dance not for beans not for my life especially not in heels but it could ve been worse turns out oliver can dance he no ball room dancer but good enough to make me look somewhat good and that is a miracle all it own i would like to take this moment to praise who ever came up with the rule that guys lead thank you thank you thank you i didntknow you could dance i said as he twirled me about i got twirled go figure and since when can you he smiled i can t i fessed up oliver chuckled you are a terrible liar i know i said why must everyone remind me but is the lighting weird because i not lying this was around the end of the song and he suddenly dipped me well you fooled me he said i swear if he ever ever drops me i will personally kill him and he almost did almost sorry mate fred laughed after bumping into oliver and dancing away with angelina who was also laughing by then oliver had brought me back to standing up sorry about that one he smiled i was still griping onto his collar like grim death but i smiled then another song came on a little slower than the last which was fun and somewhat bouncy weird word but it fits so well but emphasis on slow i started to walk away bad things happened during slow dances bad things like me tripping on my own two feet me stepping on my partners feet and other bad things that could happen with a 100 more chances to happen because i in heels where are you going oliver asked grabbing my wrist er i pointed to the our table over my shoulder slow dance i dontexactly mix with those he pulled me in close to him and wrapped his arms around my waist as the song went on really he asked was that a hint of sarcasm i asked wrapping my arms around his neck from me more sarcasm i dontthink so isntsarcasm my thing what sarcasm oliver yes i just laughed a little and rested my head on his shoulder i could get used to this slow dance thing after all it not like i was leading i just had to move with oliver then all of a sudden he stopped but the music didn t i took my head off oliver shoulder what i started then i saw who oliver head was turned towards oh god no oh please no no no no no please no mind if i cut in yes i do go away percy i saw oliver smile at his room mate he wouldn t he wouldntdare not at all he did i was either going to cry or kick one of them so hard they would never have kids as oliver passed me over to percy torture pure torture i watched oliver in horror over percy shoulder as he turned back towards me and gave two thumbs up what the hell is wrong with the world so far percy hadntsaid anything and i figured i might be able to get through this just maybe i ll just let him lead purposely step on his feet here and there not say a word and i ll be fine how ever wrong i was he lead me straight over to where our parents were dancing they had decided to swap spouses so my mom was with mr weasley and my dad was with mrs weasley what a sight katie my ma said happily as she caught sight of me dancing with percy where oliver i thought you came with him her words were just a little slurred and her face was just a little bit red and i almost cried out in horror as i realized someone let her have a few drinks ma i asked what did you drink oh nothing she said happily right tarquin ma i said that not dad that mr weasley she squinted at mr weasley who simply said it me marie so it is she said rather loudly god have mercy this is where i actually sort of lead dragging us away from my crazed mom so er oh my god he was starting a conversation i hear the quidditch team is really coming along i wanted to say duh it coming along where the best god damn team because we have freaking dawn practices but i didn t i dontknow why but heels somehow turn me into someone more lady like and i cantsay i really like it too much yes i said airily it really is desperate to get the conversation off me i asked something i now dread so how penelope his face dropped and i knew i should ve kept my big mouth shut we broke up he said softly very very very deep down inside i felt bad but up at the surface my brain was screaming well i wonder why very sarcastically why my brain seriously needs an off button he sighed percy is bad enough happy percy sad is a completely worse story she said i was overbearing or something of the sort alls i had to do was sympathize with him until the song was over alls i had to do hmm strange thing to say couldnteven manage sympathy there was sarcasm there laid on thick enough that a cave man would realize it damn my sarcasm bone i completely agree damn now he going to keep droning on what the hell is that she is so is oliver dancing with natasha i really dontunderstand girls sometimes really i asked not pay attention at all but glaring at natasha over percy shoulder who was leaning on oliver shoulder oliver looked very confused by the whole situation get away he mine i so possessive of him sometimes penelope isntlike you though that so what are you doing now get your hands off him you re a terribly good listener really why are your hands wrapped around his neck i going to kill you penelope never paid any attention to what i said i cantimagine why i said get away would you like to go get dinner sometime hmm away damn it i mean i know you re with oliver but he wouldntmind for one night right i guess not once this song is over you are dead that great sure is when is this song going to end how about friday at eight why not of course i had no idea i just agreed to a date with percy i was way to busy glaring daggers at natasha who looked very content with herself dancing with a dumbfounded oliver at that second the song ended and i marched over to oliver and natasha aka she devil kat oliver said looking so happy to see me i was still glaring at natasha attempting to use any possible physic power i might have to fling her across the room turns out i donthave any yes katie she asked trying to act all innocent in that innocent look of hers that no one ever buys go away boy my voice was so icy it would make alicia proud what i dontthink she has ever heard that term go away i repeated or i swear to god i will hex you back and forth across the room people will be talking about it for centuries i moved my hand across the side of my dress to the narrow pocket in the skirt part where one would keep their wand i was still glaring at natasha who soon backed up and then nearly sprinted across the dance floor little did she know i had accidentally left my wand back at the table in my purse i could someday act if i wanted to i smiled crookedly as she went and hid behind her current boyfriend roger davies you are so cold oliver said chuckling slightly slipping his arms around me from behind resting his chin on my right shoulder i sighed what are you going to do he kissed my cheek i haventfigured out yet wasntdancing with percy torture enough another slow song had came on and we started to sway back and forth slightly how many slow songs are there oliver chuckled the rest of the night was pretty uneventful i wound up dancing with joe percy lance one of oliver cousins both the twins at the same time how the hell did i pull that one off percy even davies oliver wasntto happy with that but i keep purposely steeping on his feet and mouthing off so two minutes in he couldntstand it any more and left percy again my dad my little cousin who five percy again and oliver of the time but does anybody else see a pattern here why the hell was percy dancing with me so much i need an explanation here by one the whole thing was over my mom had a considerable amount to drink and fred and george each had enough firewhiskey to ask professor mcgonagall to dance when did she get there and oliver look deeply depressed when his single ticket didntget picked in the drawing for the firebolt i cannot feel my feet i said as we climbed back up the stairs to the common room i was currently walking barefoot shoes in my hand i could not be in those things for another second oliver laughed his coat over his shoulder tie hanging untied around his neck and his hair thankfully messy as ever with his free arm being pulled down by me i could barely stand up and i think i have blisters the size of pancakes on my feet do you have any idea what it feels like to be in high heels for seven hours i asked gripping his arm dancing he chuckled no i cantsay i do he paused and i cantsay i know what it like to have a date with percy this friday at eight i slapped my forehead i cantbelieve i accidentally agreed to that in was so mad at natasha i wasntlistening to a word he said the stuff i get myself into oliver chuckled may i please be there when it all goes down like i going to go through with it i groaned i ll tell him i ll tell him well i dontknow what i ll tell him but i ll tell him something soon enough ugh my feet here oliver chuckled slightly before suddenly picking me up newly wed style better i thought for a second my arms around his neck playing with the tail of his hair yup much i smiled leaning my head against him did i mention this was at like 1 in the morning and after seven hours in heels dancing so it was safe to say i was completely exhausted and so i had a perfectly good reason to nod off i think fred and george might ve spiked my butter beers a bit i woke up this morning with a huge headache they are so in for it ugh sorry it took me like three weeks to get this up completely unlike me i know but i have volleyball every day after school to like sick and by the time i take a shower and finish dinner and my homework it like 9pm and normally after all that i dontwanna even think about looking at more words just the football game on tv so once again i sooooooooooooo sorry but you should all blame the education system ahh i love you guys the reviews and nice comments and saying how great i am and standing ovations and bowing and all that good stuff that i love so i finally got my lazy butt to work and started on the next chap before you all revolted against me march 22 sunday after dinner what did you put in my drink last night i demanded an answer from the twins after i woke up i was 100 percent sure i didnthave anything alcoholic but then why did i wake up with a pounding headache and a spinning head nothing fred protested now i a bad liar but i can certainly pick up on lies no matter how fast my head is spinning i glared at the two of them well george started you were all wound up so we gave you something to loosen up that explains it lets just say i have a very very low tolerance for alcohol and lets just say last summer i had the tiniest bit of some raspberry shot crap that alicia said was good at some random party that alicia and angelina dragged me to spent the rest of the weekend and i only had half of one oh and oliver wound up taking me home lecturing me the whole way on how it really takes a week to get everything alcohol takes away and not 24 hours meanwhile the rest of the school population was still partying which included the rest of his team what a night mare that off the subject though so after i nearly hexed the twins halfway to the lake and back in my pajamas still and after they went and hid behind alicia and angelina i plopped on the couch next to oliver dontyou look happy he chuckled i looked up at him with a bit of a scowl but it probably looked ten times worse then i pictured if you take in my bed hair and the fact that i was too damn lazy to wash last night makeup off after oliver had carried me back up to the dorms i smiled sarcastically oh i just a bundle of joy right about now he put an arm around me and pulled me closer to him donti know it i smiled damn him always making me smile when i trying not to practice later today ok way to ruin the moment oliver way to ruin it march 27 thursday history of magic so tomorrow your big date with percy damn it what i forgot to make up some b s lic that what so you still haventcancelled and as far as everyone knows it still on yes what am i going to come up with this late hmmm oliver scheduled some last minute practice no because then he actually

god knows what will come out of my mouth i just caught percy before he went into the great hall and i somehow managed to drag him across the foyer as he was going on about he needs to be in the hall to do his important head boy duties aka stuff his big fat mouth with food just like everybody else i really need to be getting to the great hall so what did you want he could ve been a bit nicer even if it was completely by accident i was going on a date with him or i was supposed to until now because i cancelled so percy i started slowly about tomorrow tonight i cantwait he interrupted god damn it when is there some night duties he needs to do when you need them i ll pick you up at eight and he walked well more like sauntered back to the great hall and i slapped my forehead i did mean to

miss bell this is a library people are trying to read bastard so maybe storming into the library and screaming my head off wasntexactly the greatest idea i ve ever had peeeeeeerrrrrrcccccy i called in a loud whisper around the library i mean he the biggest nerd i know of course he would be in there why are you looking for percy someone whispered in my ear because i have to dump him i explained having no idea who was behind me you re cheating on me i finally turned around then before i said anything else really really did i mention really stupid oliver except that time it wasnta whisper and we got yelled at again did i mention we got kicked out too for some crap about disturbing the peace why were you looking for percy oliver finally asked as we walked back up to the common room err no no reason i lied through a smiled with a soft obviously fake laugh he didnteven have to point out i a terrible liar he just looked at me and smiled crookedly alright i never actually canceled on him oliver just chuckled and i punched him on the shoulder it not funny well it kind of is kat he pointed out you re going on a date with my roommate who just happens to be the biggest prick on our 1 month anniversary you remembered then hu why wouldnti oliver i groaned guys arentsupposed to remember things they re supposed to forget and the girls are supposed to get half heartedly mad at them for forgetting then they kiss and makeup i explained now how that supposed to happen with you remembering everything he put his arm around my waist i dontknow i groaned again and he kissed the top of my head dontworry i ll take care of percy god only knows what he going to tell him after dinner and a very long practice and after a very long talk oliver had with percy in their dorm and god knows what oliver said you re having his babies ok so maybe i have some inkling of what oliver said just maybe what what i was attempting to do my homework with the twins angelina and lic when percy came sprinting down the stairs and yelled out this statement for the whole tower to hear oliver took that moment to come down the stairs behind percy and was smiling guiltily the twins were cracking up hysterically angelina was screaming katie alicia was saying something like if she could be the god mother and if it was a boy or a girl percy was still in shock and everyone else was starring at me and me i slammed my head against the table and knocked myself out i slammed my head so hard good job percival you killed her she slammed her own head george you ran down the stairs screaming like a lunatic you got her pregnant she not pregnant you prick can i be the god mother can we name it after me i was thinking fredricka if it was a girl oh the joys i woke up to number 1 i said as i came around i not dead and number 2 no child of mine is going to be named fredricka and number 3 there is no way in hell i pregnant oliver smiled at me fred looked disappointed percy still looked like he was in a state of shock george had his arm around alicia whose eyes were tearing over no doubt at the idea of being a god mother and angelina was using fred as a shoulder rest and i somehow ended up on the couch katie god damn you percy haventyou done enough damage just shut up for once yes percy i sighed exasperatedly sitting up i cantgo out with you while you re pregnant with my roommates kid oh he didntjust say that and i afraid i going to have to report both of you to lets say we all hexed him at the same time and now he sitting in the hospital wing with tentacles coming out of his nose march 28 friday 11 pm i still cantbelieve you told him that i said as we walked down the streets of hogsmeade around neither of us really had any extra special plans we just decided on hogsmeade always a safe choice turns out angelina reminded him right after she reminded me so we both kinda forgot oliver chuckled his arm around my waist i couldntthink of anything else please i said giving out a small laugh you make a new play every other day and you cantcome up with one lousy lie could you he smiled well uh i a bad liar i pointed out i know he laughed i smiled so where are we going how about that tea shop one look at me and he had his answer that crazy bat of a witch was still kind of creeping me out or the three broom sticks good choice i beamed up at him the great thing about oliver is that he a friend first and foremost then a boyfriend second well maybe he a captain first and fore most then a friend then a boy friend either way he a friend before he a boyfriend and i dontmean that in a get to know you way i mean in a friend for life no matter what kind of thing you know what i mean so for the good three hours we were at the broomsticks we just talked and laughed you know how he gets always talking about quidditch somehow we started on our team and ended on how the coaches for the national teams are becoming corrupt of course it was smiles and laughs the whole way we have to win the cup this year he said as we walked out the door of the pub our laughter dying down i groaned i saw this coming from the second we walked into to hogsmeade oliver i groaned of course we re going to win what makes you so sure he asked as i slipped my arm in his because you run us dry everyday i pointed out filling our heads with plays having three hour long practices everyday sometimes at the crack of dawn you practically make sure we dream of flying and half of us can fly better than we walk especially after one of your double practices you re even on top of us about what we eat he chuckled i guess i am pretty bad hu i shook my head actually if all the other captains did the same there might be some competition this year the last thing we need is to get cocky because you re never cocky i said sarcastically exactly completely oblivious then he gave me a long kiss but all the obliviousness in the world cannot cancel out his kisses so what did you guys do where did you go what did he get you god i took one step inside my dorm and i was already being bombarded by a bazillion questions jez guys i said as i sat down on my bed we only went to the three broomsticks i still dontunderstand how the cues test couple angelina said is also the least romantic what wrong with the three broomsticks i protested where were we supposed to go that crazy tea shop with the crazy old bat at least it more romantic than the three broom sticks pfft i smiled waving my hand at her and laying down so what did he get you lic asked standing over me i smiled and went into the pocket of my robe there inside was a little miniature dragon flies around and breathes smoke oliver had said all the good stuff without the bad it so adorable lic squealed as it flew over to her and landed on her shoulder it was a little norwegian ridgeback barely a foot and a half long and it wouldntget any larger but it wouldntcrap all over the place either awww angelina cooed as it breathed a little puff of smoke is it a boy or a girl i have no idea i laughed how do you tell asked alicia the picture of innocent hold up for a sec i seriously thinking lic is bipolar morning practices she acts like she drunk and know she like a five year old girl i dontunderstand this child you can probably look it up in a book ang said i sure there some appearance distinction between the boys and girls where your book katie err in my trunk i think in a few minutes we found out that it was a boy what should we name it lic asked we were all sitting on my bed with the little dragon flying over head how about fred dron ang offered no me and lic said automatically what about georgio no me and ang said fredgeric no georgie no fredlipe no georgenhon de weaselhon i am not naming my dragon after your boyfriends i pointed out i had hoped they would get the message sooner what about finny finny they both said well it better than georgenhon de weaselhon or fred dron is it short for phineas lic asked why not i said i have no idea where i got the name finny but i really liked it phineas bell ang said slowly like she was tasting the way the name sounded in her mouth i like it lic picked up her wand and tapped each of finny shoulders with it i dub thee finny bell the great what are you ang asked skeptically the queen of england finny nodded his head and we all laughed so what did you get oliver alicia asked after a while i scratched the back of my head and laughed the same thing but a different dragon they both gaped at me you re kidding i shook my head unlike finny who was green oliver was red at that second the boys came into our dorm fredricka oliver said as he came in the twins filing in behind him fredricka fredricka what i asked that my dragon name he said simply with a slight smile and your looking at her proud god parents he indicated to the twins who were running after her i think i ll just call her freddie though he said as he sat down next to me laughing so what did you dub your dragon finny i answered smiling too phineas bell the great ang and lic said together his name finny so did you all like i was running out of presents to give with all the birthdays and holidays so i made due with what i had and i actually updated a lot faster than i thought i would arentyou proud of me and now with the dragons i can do things like my dragon ate my homework and all that good stuff ahhhhhhhhh sweet sweet reviews giving me wonderful reviews i love it and i sorry one person thought that last chapter wasntas great as my others but i must say i agreed i wasntsure wither to put that thing in at the end with percy but the chap needed saving so i did i ll try to make this one great but god only knows what will spew from my typing fingers march 29 saturday 7 am now normally there would be no way in hell i would be up this early on a saturday morning but several things woke me up first at around 1 in the morning finny caught part of angelina curtains on fire and i had to put them out and second oliver what the it must ve been like 3 30 and my eyes were still all crusted over and i must say waking up to oliver nose to nose with you poking you in the ribs is not the nicest way to wake up practice he whispered what i screamed yes screamed that little word kind of woke me up practice he repeated calmly are you kidding me it 3 in the morning he shook his head i hate you i scoffed no you don t and with that he walked out the door so i said to myself so i did what anyone else would i went back to sleep bell go away oliver i want to sleep it fred i opened my eyes and looked at the clock 4 half an hour of extra sleep pfft like that a lot oh i grumbled what do you want we have practice he said no we don t i corrected and went back to sleep next thing i knew i was being carried over to the pitch turns out fred ran downstairs and got oliver who slung me over his shoulder and was now marching down to the pitch in we need to have practice and i can t believe you re making it start late captain mode not a good time for chit chat but a very good time for shouting oliver oliver are you insane it s i quickly checked my watch 4 05 in the morning i should be asleep you can catch your beauty rest another time he said in his i m your captain damn it so listen and do as i say damn it voice you are such a freaking kilt wearing son of a bitch thing do you mean captain no i mean thing of course i meant captain who says thing anyway but like i was going to let him know that we had finally reached the locker room where he finally put me down on one of the benches i just crossed my arms and legs and glared at him well he said well what so maybe i should try harder not to get him in a bad mood i ll try that when he doesntdecide to give us a dawn practice get in your robes he said in his captain commando voice why dontyou i rebutted he cocked one eyebrow at me and it just struck me that he was already in his scarlet robes damn it well he said i refuse fine he said you can just play in your pajamas which i might say is exactly what i did that right i played in my red flannel pajamas and gold long sleeved shirt barefoot take that oliver wood take that arentyou cold katie alicia asked about an hour later i scowled at her it was like 5 in the morning in march and i could not unfreeze my fingers from around my broom no too bad i the only one on the team who understands sarcasm another hour later 6 am we were sitting in the locker room listening to oliver ramble on all in all i think it was a good practice despite some difficulties i sent him a glare as he looked in my direction with a look on his face by then i was soaked from head to foot of course the rest of the world agreed with oliver to make my morning miserable even the weather it had rained during practice make sure to eat right the rest of the day he went on there ll be another practice tomorrow at 6am and pm so as everyone else went to go change into dry clothes i marched back up to the castle and here i am finny defrosting my toes and 30 sunday 3 pm i think they re having their first fight what are you talking about they ve been going at each other for four years now ugh i mean as a couple oh do you think they ll break up please katie ll get over herself eventually i right here you know so for most of the day i sat on my bed doing homework in my spare warm and dry pajamas finny resting on my shoulder and nipping my ear and pulling my hair here and there potions had been taking up most of my day normally i would ve gone and found oliver to help me but maybe we were having our first fight and i would not be the bigger person and be the first one to say i sorry he the one schedualing dawn practices april 3 friday history of magic will you just apologize to him already no please nope i so sick of him yelling at us because you two are in a fight he can apologize first why dontyou just be the mature one for once and say i sorry first its not going to happen why because he started it you know you miss him do not do too uh what makes you think that you sit in our dorm almost all day every day and the only reason you actually go to practice is to go at it with him so i know you miss him i do not well your little fight isnthelping your potions grades not true sure they ve only reached a new record an all time low not true you got a t on your last essay your point you re impossible so i ve heard april 4 saturday after lunch bell what was that for what you kicked me no i didn t now shut up and pass me the salt wood ok so maybe i did kick oliver under the table but he was the one giving me dirty looks through out lunch he deserved it and he never did pass me the salt april 6 monday lunch you have got to love when your teachers know you re in a fight with your boyfriend absolutely love it miss bell could i have a word this was right after d a d a i was starving and the bell had just rung to get to lunch and i was planning on flying down to the great hall to gorge myself with delicious food i looked up from packing my books into my bag um remember i was starving well i kinda have to be some where dontworry professor lupin smiled i d like to get to lunch soon too absolutely starving i smiled too alright what is it we started walking out of the classroom and down towards the great hall me wondering what the hell the twins framed on me now is everything alright with you and mr wood he asked as we came to the end of the corridor this kinda took me by surprise it was pretty much the last question i was expecting umm what do you mean professor i mean i hear you two yelling at each other all the way from the pitch outside my window i sort of laughed oh i sorry professor i ll try and keep it down to a dull roar tonight at this i figured this little conversation was over with and i almost sprinted away but he started up again professor lupin is one of the very few teachers i genuinely like but normally it not a good idea to keep me away from a meal he was walking as slow as molasses that d be great he smiled but i was sorry to hear that you two were fighting oh things happen when some one schedules a 5 am practice every other day i explained we all get a little cranky you should see alicia he laughed at this what can i say i can be funny at times right after dinner apparently it has come to my attention that apparently everyone knows about my fight with oliver i mean it only been like what eight days we ve been in a fight and already girls from other houses are flirting with him and yes nat too they re all idiots i mean technically oliver is still mine unless we broke up and i didntrealize it that would be bad and not my fault because he didnttell me about it then how is everybody else under the impression that we are professor mcgonagall knows we re fighting too i had another lovely lecture with a teacher on that touching subject peachy aintit ms bell a word it was more of a command then a request i was attempting to sprint out of the classroom and get as far as way as possible during the class i turned a gecko into a slimy spork when we were supposed to turn it into a perfect silverware knife when she called me back at the last second i sorry about the spork profes i started i was going to go on how i was going to try harder and study more and possibly practice outside of class it not about your inability to transfigure things into silverware oh what could i have possibly done to deserve to be held after now well what did i do and whatever it is i didntdo it being extremely close friends with fred and george you always expect the worse how practice going these days that one took me off guard i know she just as bent as ol i mean a certain someone to win the cup but she has never asked how things ever er i rubbed my cheek great i guess our captain really pushing us she gave me one of those faces your mom gives you when you know she knows everything before walking over to her desk and sitting down rummaging through one of the draws come here for a second i had half a mind to turn on my heel and run out the door thinking she was going to throw a gecko in my face and forcing me to stay over night until i get the transfiguration right but none the less my stupid legs started walking and before i knew it i was in front of her desk normally professor mcgonagall started i hate showing students grades before i hand them out but she paused giving me once again another knowing look i ll make an exception this time and with out further ado she brought out my latest test with a big red p right next to my name i groaned and she continued to pull out several of my latest all time low grades why didntshe just shoot me on the spot now i know the final match is coming up she said pulling out my fifth and thankfully last test but i have to ask you to try harder no matter how many practices mr wood is giving you she added damn that was my last line of excuses so you ve seen the pitch bookings i said trying to laugh lightly i ve seen the reasons for it she corrected i was about to ask if she thought us as a crappy team when she pulled out several other tests i almost cried when i saw more p and even a t but then i realized the handwriting thankfully wasntmine but oliver test i asked completely dumbfounded by both why she was showing me these and why oliver i mean my captain was getting such crappy grades unfortunately she sighed pushing them over to me take a closer look i shifted uncomfortably i felt a little guilty looking through his tests considering they were so bad then i remembered all the dawn practices all the shouting matches and all the times he practically sat on me as i tried to do push ups then i smiled and looked through them when i was done flipping through the test i was as confused as ever i looked up at professor mcgonagall well he definitely has room to improve i smiled putting them back down professor i asked why did you have me go through these look closer was that a hint of a smile in the margins still completely missing the point of this whole thing i flipped through them again this time discarding his sloppy but still readable handwriting and the stupid mistakes i knew he knew and what do you know there was actually writing in the margins more than that there were hearts yes hearts in the margins of the freaking scottish son of a bitch captain whose heart is currently lost in a void oliver wood well they were more like scratched out hearts and guess what was barely readable in them that right k b that would be me as the dates in the top right corner became more current he got a little more creative like drawing a broom and my initials would be barely visible in the tail or written in minute writing around the inside of one of the three hoops now what was i supposed to do about this i mean the latest test was taken today first period the world is working against me they all want me to cave but the world is going to be disappointed because i will not cave in i put down the tests this time more astonished then i had been right after the ravenclaw match now professor mcgonagall said picking up the tests and putting them back in her desk i would hate to lose the cup of a silly fight in a teenage romance good day ms bell bye professor i was lucky my legs have a power over my brain and walked me straight out the door april 7 tuesday noon look who decided to actually show up on time today just shut it wood i scowled chucking the quaffle in his chest it was a 6 9 practice and i was trying to get as much homework done before hand with out oliver potions was taking double the amount of time and so last practice i showed up two minutes late at the most big whoop i hadnttalked to him since that 4 am morning practice a week ago i mean beside the yeah sure and what not that goes along with him being my captain and some shouting matches on the pitch you could cut the tension with a knife it was mine and lic turn to carry out the crate of balls to practice that explains where the quaffle came from we werenteven on our brooms and we were going at it already now he said in his captain commando voice once again now all of you get on your brooms bell here just gave you all 20 laps to start off with bastard so from 6 9 that pretty much how practice went oliver would yell at me and i would yell back and we would all get in trouble for it i think he thought i would learn my lesson but i just too stubborn to back off this had been going on in every practice for the past week lic and ang had been begging me to apologize to him but i said not until he does first but oliver put a little twist to practice under the lights of the pitch for the last half hour of practice we played bonsai it some stupid drill where one of the chasers will fly around the pitch and try to avoid the two bludgers that the beaters are constantly trying to pelt at us fun i know alicia and angelina did alright they each only got hit two or three times and it wasntanything bad just a knick off the shoulder did i mention we had to hold on to the quaffle too and that it had started to down pour just as it was my turn no well that what happened oh and oliver added two more bludgers to the mix just for little old me remind me to thank him i did pretty good i think or at least i was we were really only supposed to be doing this for 5 minutes at a time but oliver had me going for at least twenty minutes and those were my most stubborn twenty minutes ever i was zooming and twisting and diving and twirling around that pitch gripping onto that quaffle so tight i think my fingers turned blue trying to avoid those four bludgers the only thing i could think of was to show oliver up and that the twins must ve really been enjoying this but i never really did show oliver up two of the bludgers hit me one square in the left shoulder and the other on the side of my right knee and i fell off my broom and face first into the mud thank god i was only ten feet above the ground and thank god mud is actually really good for your skin i moaned into the mud as i heard oliver say practice was over and told everyone to go in and his footsteps sloshing in the mud coming towards me kudos to the twins it was a good hit no matter how much it hurt which was a lot kat oliver asked gently placing a hand on my shoulder what all of a sudden we re back on first name basis after a practice straight from hell a week and a day of practices straight from hell and of course he had to touch my know bad shoulder peachy what hurts kat he asked softly my shoulder i said gritting my teeth and sitting up practically throwing his hand off me and here your damn quaffle i spat slamming the quaffle into his chest i held onto it after all seems all you think about is quidditch anyway it true for the past week he been hunched over that little model of his coming up with new plays and with that i marched aka hobbled back towards the locker room where the rest of the team was leaving oliver standing dumbly in the rain or so i thought next thing i knew i was face first in the mud again turns out he chucked the quaffle in the back of my now bad knee and it collapsed under me and i couldntput my hands out because i was massaging my shoulder the other next thing i knew oliver was practically dragging me to my knees and pulling my up by my robes by the time i was sitting on my feet he was holding me with my arms pinned to my side both my shoulder and knee was burning white hot by know remind me to thank him for this now too he was on his knees in front of me so did the only sensible thing i head butted him ok so maybe it wasntsensible but i got my point across because i couldnthit or kick him at the moment dontyou have some new play to go figure out and drill into our heads or do you just want to hit me with a few more bludgers i spat at him as he was recovering from the stupid thing i had just done i couldntexactly walk away because he was still gripping my robes and that more or less where i blacked out i guess from all the screaming all the blood from my head went straight out my knee and shoulder ok i going to be a terrible person and leave you here sooooooo sorry i didntget this up earlier you see it was practically impossible for me to do anything extra until the end of october my volleyball team made it to regionals and then my comp got a virus and i had to give it to the geek squad at best buy if you dontknow dontask and i can only hope this chapter was half way decent and i already have half of the next chap written up just needs a few tweaks ok i ll get it up soon p s i still haventseen the fourth movie i know i a disgrace so dontmention it in the reviews or i ll be forced to plug my fingers in my ears and sing some random song and i cantsing hahaha more reviews guys i canttell you how much i appreciate them they give me motivation so keep em coming and yes i also love it when couples become completely immature makes it fun to write april 7 tuesday 8am continued ok let recap over the past week and a day oliver has given me hell on the pitch and together we ve created the biggest row this school has ever seen and professor mcgonagall shows me a bunch of his tests with my initials everywhere and not after i hate then i black out after he practically forces the twins to take me out as if they were hired assassins and this morning i woke up in the hospital wings but that little recap took a while to register so instead of resting my head on the very comfy pillow i sat bolt upright having no clue how i got there why i was in the funky teal pajamas they give out in the hospital wing or why in hell oliver was sitting in the chair next to my bed with his head tilt back asleep still in his muddy scarlet robes what a head spinner that one was mercy i mumbled to myself rubbing the sleep out of my eyes with my right hand too afraid to use my left because of my shoulder i brushed the hair out of my eyes where the hell was my hair tie and realized i had a huge bump right in the middle of my forehead i looked over towards the sleeping lightly snoring oliver and was a little proud to see he was sporting a nice black and blue right on his forehead well next time find a more creative way to kill me i smiled to myself but i have to admit seeing him in all his sleepy glory i felt a little pang of guilt or was it loneliness or because i couldntreally stay mad at him forever or was it because i hadnteaten since the afternoon before i going to go with the third the food one i groaned and fell back on the really huge comfy pillow hospital people always give you because you know you re in pain madame pomphrey hadntleft a large tray of food out for me and since she neglected this very important task my stomach growled very loudly which cause oliver to shift in his sleep and fall forward face first in the side of my bed still snoring i would ve laughed except i didntexactly want him there and i would ve pretended to go back to sleep until he left except he just as stubborn as i am and would stay there until the planet blew up i didntknow which would be uglier us blowing off at each other again or the planet blowing up i think the first might ve eventually led to the second hmm so eventually i tried sneaking out personally i thought the large oak doors would ve been my best bet it was 10 in the morning so everybody would be in class leaving the hall empty and leaving no on to see me in these crazy pajamas kat damn i was so close too i spun around in my funky teal pajamas wild hair and no freezing bare feet hey those marble floors are always cold to see oliver standing up scarlet robes blue bump on the head and all what weird fashion statements we make kat he said cocking an eyebrow and walking towards me shouldntyou be laying down i looked at my hand on the door knob so close and yet so far but then i crossed my arms which really hurt my left shoulder by the way madame pomphrey hadntgiven me nearly enough pain killers and looked back at him dontyou have another play to go figure out so you can run into our heads some more ok so i can get a little cranky in the morning with a huge bruise on my head two aching limbs and no coffee but doesnteverybody do really think that all i think about is quidditch he asked softly still walking closer well all the dawn practices this week would lead me to think so ok so i can get a little snappy at times too he hung his head was i winning i sorry he sighed i just want just want to win i finished throwing my hands in the air he was supposed to slap me at the moment i would ve slapped myself just want to beat those snakes just want to have your name on that damn cup i know oliver i know that all you think about so maybe i was being a little harsh just a little no he growled at me suddenly taking my by the shoulders and now from two inches away in the eeriness light of my most feared wing for me in hogwarts wasntpretty sight but i didntflinch or anything just keep glaring then more softly he added i just want you to stop being mad at me you re the one who started it i pointed out but with a bit less venom in my voice just a bit you re the one who just stop it he shook me a little violently but i kind of needed it i haventbeen able to think at all i cantthink of plays i donthave any idea what drills to run in practice and i dontthink my grades have ever been worse the only thing i can think of is you i have less than three months left here with you and i dontwant to lose another day that last few lines kinda kicked my ass into gear and i realized how terribly mean and stubborn i ve been to him over the past week i mean it not his fault he has ocd about winning this cup well maybe it was his fault gotta ponder that one when i donthave a massive bruise on my head so does that mean you caved first i asked cocking an eyebrow hey i dontever want to say i was the first to cave ever because i never ever cave first at anything icavedfirst he mumbled hanging his head and letting his shoulders drop hmm i caved first he screamed to the ceiling happy oh very i smiled slipping my arms around his neck before i kissed him and for once i caught him off guard yeah that right but then two doors in the hospital wing opened and me and oliver practically jumped three feet away from each other one being the large oak doors right next to us and the other madame pomphrey office now of course the people barging through the large oak doors were the twins lic and ange and of course the people coming out of madame pomphrey office was none other then madame pomphrey herself and percival fred said astonished what the hell are you doing here finally come for your cat scan no percy screamed from across the wing i came to see katie it as if they didntnotice i was standing right there damn i wished that happened more often where is kates george asked himself why doesntthis ever happen around teachers i raised my good hand slightly hi guys katie lic squealed that right squealed who squeals before i could even think about this she ran over and gave me a huge bear hug followed by everybody else except oliver who managed to get pushed away this was not doing any miracles for my shoulder and my knee felt like it was about to give out er guys i choked out you re killing me and i cantbreath hu kates fred asked shoulder oh angelina said instantly letting go everybody else a millisecond behind noon so after my near suffocation madame pomphrey basically threw me back into my little cot is it no wonder that i hate the hospital wing and finally drugged me up on pain killers which i have to say made me completely laughy allllllll morning poor oliver sweet guy stayed with me the whole time what hehehe wait waz zat hehehehe i laughed in my little cot as madame attempted to charm my knee back to normal and apparently i had no idea what a wand was for the fifth time ms bell madame pomphrey said for what must ve been the fifth time angrily it a wand i trying to heal you i than the doors burst open to reveal the twins georgie freddie i giggled holding my arms open as if expecting them to run over and give me a hug both sets of their eyebrows skyrocketed and went from me to oliver oliver who finally changed into regular clothes gave them a crooked smile pain killers ah the twins chorused i think madame pomphrey said trying to fight me off apparently i was immensely intrigued by her weird nun hat or what ever you want to call it we need those leather straps leather straps hahahaha that a good one i slapped my thigh are they fun can we help the twins volunteered no doubt anxious to get back at me for half causing a week of hellish practices ten minutes later i was securely strapped in and i didntlike it yet i was still laughing as i fought against the dreaded things these arentfun hahaha luckily the laughing wore off after two hours so around eleven i was sane again alright i said as oliver finally unstrapped me at eleven we re never going to speak of this again fair enough he chuckled as he undid the one around my shoulders my now considerably wild hair had gotten in my eyes and he pushed it back and hmm ed before undoing the rest of the straps around my waist wrists and ankles hmm what i asked tilting my head and rubbing my wrist hmm he asked undoing the ankle straps i smiled never mind i paused for a second i sorry for uh putting you through that oliver laughed it wasntall bad besides you would ve done the same for me no i said smiling i meant for the past week he smiled faintly at me it not your fault i cocked an eyebrow alright he caved moving back towards me and sitting on the edge of the bed it was mostly your fault thought so i smiled giving him a hug i really did miss him and i wish i wasntso stubborn and i figured that out earlier i couldntstop smiling after that not like i ever not smile except when i mad at him for scheduling dawn practices everyday for three days straight or when ange is right like the time she said that i definitely missed him and now that i realized she was right damn her you know there still practice tonight he whispered i let go of him and sat back in my little cot looked at him cocked an eyebrow and crossed my arms oliver laughed but i guess you can skip out on it thanks ol i smiled but you better not skip out on your next class you cantstay here all day says who give madame a few more minutes she ll whack you out of here i guess your right he chuckled standing up but i really dontwant to go to herbology oliver i groaned alright alright he said i ll go and he gave me a quick kiss as the bell rang to get to class before running out the large oak doors and now that i finished i really really bored 5 pm i hate snape with such an undying passion it almost funny so now i had two essays to do that right two the one i have to re due and another that he just assigned i hate him i said throwing down my little stubby quill on my cot along with my essay madame pomphrey was making me sty overnight just to be sure i think she was just waiting for another reason to tie me back up again though you d think she d want t get rid of me more than keep me longer peculiar so either way after the classes were over everyone came down to keep me company i was sitting cross legged on my cot and everybody else had pulled chairs around it and used it as a desk ditto same here ten times more than you i guess everybody agreed with me poor oliver though he attempting to help us all poor guy he never going to make it then the worst thing that could ve possibly happened did little fredricka had somehow found her way into fred bag and chose this moment to fly onto my bed and give a little hiccup of flame right onto my essay no i screamed picking the minurature dragon up and throwing it across the room it was fine it can fly but my poor paper would never be the same and after that several things happened all at once fred and george stood up screaming fredricka and as they stood up fred toppled over and ink bottle which landed right on alicia and her head i grabbed my paper and tried fanning it in the air which only made it larger angelina slapped fred for spilling ink on alicia and oliver grabbed my paper and was about to use a water charm but instead george grabbed it out of his hand and ran into the bathroom with it and came out a few seconds later looking very satisfied with himself and a flushing noise emitting from the bathroom madame pomphrey came out at that second and sniffed the air then she looked at george who was currently closing the bathroom door child madame pomphrey said putting a hand over her heart what have you been eating i guess she smelt my essay burning george shrugged his shoulders only hogwarts finest madame he said with a certain pride madame gave him what can only be explained as the evil eye before returning to her office well george said smugly as he returned to us we re lucky i reacted so quickly to that fire the whole place could ve gone up in smoke my essay went up in smoke you idoit and i jumped from my spot on my lil bed to his throat nearly six feet away i swear to god george if you flushed my essay i ll kill you i was currently on top of him still in my funky teal pajamas crazy wild hair and all his robes in my fists i musta looked like a mad man probably sirius black i er he started flushed your essay what i flushed your i heard you the first time you inconsiderate pumpous alright kat oliver said coming up behind me grabbing me by the waist and lifting me off george i think that enough eventually he put me back down on the little hospital bed which was quite a feat because i was kicking and flailing to rip george head clear off his shoulders dontmake me strap you back in he warned sternly they had to use those again angelina asked currently helping lic clean herself up i just buried my head in my pillow madame pomphrey gave her these pain killers which gave her no control over her laughter oliver explained for me i hate snape with such an undying passion it almost funny what a sight that was george said i made another grab to rip his head of but oliver caught me around the waist again damn keeper reflexes if your wondering why i was in such a warpath ish mood madame pomphrey gave me a different pain killer this afternoon that mad me boiling mad in stead of bubbling over with laughter i still dontknow which one was worse now i really bored i might even sneak out and go to practice you never know ok i was a little void of material in this chapter but i got good ideas for the next few it all up here taps head as scary as that may sound and i know beggers cantbe choosers buuuuuuuut long reviews help me write more and make me even happier and that makes me write more so loooooooooong reviews please disclaimer why would j k rowling waste her time writing a story about her book instead of writing another for our enjoyment oh thank you all for your reviews nyx night s frozen fire 23 and duck goddess you re the best and jilene marr i ll try to keep katie more in character but you re gonna have to give me some leeway on that because j k rowling doesntmention her all that much and when she does it just a couple of lines once or twice in every book so be kind i ll try though ok i ll start the story now thanks again guys october 6 saturday noon ish once again oliver is helping me with my homework i dontunderstand why i dontunderstand potions i mean i was always able to scrap a s but that not good enough for the o w l s i need flying colors i sitting under the big oak with oliver i have no clue where alicia and everyone else is but i told them where i d be so they cantyell at me is oliver asleep he hasntread over my shoulder yet 1 o clock ok he was defiantly not asleep i thought he was he was stretched out on the ground with his hands behind his head it was very convincing so i tried the stunt he pulled on me back in september so i put my nose two inches from his but a lock of hair fell from behind my ear and tickled his nose his eyes shot open and sat straight up knocking me hard in the head i think i blacked out because i woke up in a hospital bed i sat bolt upright when i realized i wasntoutside anymore and looked around madam pomphrey was pacing in her office i could see through the glass window looking out towards the ward all the other beds were empty and oliver was in the chair next to my bed he was hunched over and looking at the floor damn why is your head so hard i asked rubbing my forehead where there was a huge bump oliver looked up and smiled when he heard my voice feeling better i tried to look at the huge bump on my forehead i thought oliver face would be embedded in there he hit me so hard kinda i prodded the bump softly then madame pomphrey came in rushed oliver out much to my protest it was jus a little ok big bump on the head that all she completely ignored me and hit me on my bump with her wand she said something like it ll make the swelling go down but did she have to tap it and it wasnteven a nice tap i think she wanted to kill me it hurt more than the actual bonking how long was i out i asked afterwards hmm about an hour i wouldntsay more than that it was quite a sight though mr wood carrying you through the corridors in his arms what i thought he had the common sense to get someone or at least charm me to the hospital wing or something oh yes he carried you in his arms all the way up here like a newly wed i almost fainted again if anyone saw us i ll scream then alicia and everyone ll find out and the twins will never let me live it down i ll have to transfer can i go now madame pomphrey took one last look at my head and i was free to go october 8 monday last class of double transfig i did ok over the weekend about no body knowing about saturday until angelina passed me a note so oliver carried you in his arms to the hospital what are you talking about yeah you were blacked out and everything what happened did he knock you in the head while you two were making out no well we did bonk heads but not while making out we both bent down to grab a book well would you would i what make out with him would you no well there your answer so i lied whoop di do not about the making out part but the story of us bonking heads what was i gonna tell her that i purposely placed my self two inches from his face i dontthink so even though she one of my best friends you dontmention that kind of stuff to other people after practice we were all sitting in the locker room after practice when oliver decided to give us one of his famous speeches i actually made it the longest before drowning him out and when i did i at least made it look like i was paying attention i think i was staring at a lock of hair behind his head that was sticking up at an odd angle i was daydreaming about sleep we ve had so many practices lately that i ve had to pull al nighters to get all my work done on time i may not get the highest grades but i make it a point to hand everything on time what do you think kat you think you could run the team play oliver asks me out of no where so my mind goes into a whirlwind team play team play i know this one i know i know this one is this the one where the beaters flank us or when i get thrown in the air no defiantly the one the beaters both take out the keeper and fly through the middle hoop and we send the quaffe through after them it defiantly that one sure i was beaming i remembered do you remember which one it is of course i remember it the one where fred and george take out the keeper and fly through the middle hoop and we send the quaffle through i pretended that he hurt my feelings i hurt that you would think that i wouldntremember either oliver was happy that i answered so quickly or that i actually remembered what ever i ll take either i remembered if only i could remember potions october 9 tuesday care of magical creatures i so glad hagrid is the teacher now the other professor wasntall that great he lost an arm and a leg while he was teaching no i wasntthere for either the books were a little annoying it almost ate one of my shoes it was the one that goes with the uniform so even if it did that ok because i hate them he taught us about hippogriffs they re so adorable everyone else seems to hate them though they ve got the head front legs and wings of an eagle and the rest is a horse i love them me and angelina got to pair up with a chestnut one his name was camanche so cute angelina thinks i crazy and that maybe he should be my boyfriend will they ever let me live without having a boyfriend i mean i already dying with just homework and quidditch if i had another thing to worry about i think i would faint october 12 friday dinner yes the first hogsmeade weekend is coming up halloween ha ha i need some chocolate i can never really find any around here oh and i got a v on a potions essay very well done that i actually did myself ok maybe oliver helped me here and there and checked my work but i did it myself ha ha ha in my handwriting and all yay october 16 tuesday right after practice 7 ish i think ugh i just got my progress report and we had a really crappy practice report cards are coming out right before christmas i doing great in all my classes minus one can you guess ya that right potions i still only scraping goods all my other classes i getting outstandings and excellences why am i a dunce at potions i try really hard but i can never get higher than a g ten sickles i getting a howler tomorrow we re all sitting in the locker room i gonna ask everyone why i an idiot at potions 8 30 well fred and george say to be happy with a g because there both getting b s angelina snape out to get every griffindor and alicia agrees oliver was somewhere at the moment so i got no real answer and they pretty much said just deal with it but i need to be a scholar athlete i said i think my voice started to crack well get used not getting everything you want fred said he had a bad practice too not getting everything you want fred i never get anything i want from other people that why i get it for myself besides how is someone else going to provide me with good grades i was getting really angry well george said you should go out on a date with snape i sure that would raise your grade are you sick in the head all i asked for was advice for potions and you all never give me real advice you could care less some one grabbed my wrist and it must ve been oliver because i was yelling and everyone else was in view i was trying to wrench myself out of whoever grip it was but instead they grabbed my by the shoulders and slung me over theirs they started to walk away and i was still yelling at fred and george who ever had picked me up sat me down in one of the showers and turned on the cold water i look up and it oliver now stay there till you cool off i guess he was angry about the practice too so i sat there in the shower for almost 45 minutes with my back against one of the walls i was still in my quidditch robes padding and all just letting the cold water soak me it was actually probably the best thing anyone could ve done at the moment when oliver came back he was dressed and cleaned at least i wasntmuddy anymore feeling better he asked smiling i hate snape i was still edgy and really not in any mood to discuss anything even the weather oliver reached over and turned off the water and offered me his hand come on kat i fine right here and i turned the water back on ignoring his offered hand for anyone out there who cares sitting in a shower fully clothed with cold water pouring on you is a very good way to relieve stress this time he charmed the faucet to stay off and almost dragged me out of the shower and to my locker he grabbed a nearby towel and slung it over my right shoulder make your self look somewhat decent he said as he left the room so i got changed put on a pair of jeans and a very slightly bigger than supposed to be white crew neck sweater i hat tight sweaters so i buy them a size larger than normal and shrink them to the perfect fit for me i dried off my robes and hair and stuffed everything else in my leather messenger bag i left the pitch expecting to walk back alone when i realized oliver was waiting for me outside well at least you look decent he said looking me up and down what took you so long he asked setting his pace equal to mine i didntknow you were waiting so i took my time in the locker room i was hoping i wouldntreally have to talk to anybody till i reached the common room still edgy only slightly yes i was edgy practice or grades both i knew he knew did he have to make me feel worse you shouldnthave yelled at fred and george i should ve been nicer i shouldnthave flown so bad today i shouldntget so worked up over my grades i shouldnthave been so edgy i shouldnthave sat in the shower for almost and hour and i shouldnthave done a lot of things but i did i had my hands on my head and was practically ripping locks of hair out i started walking faster and oliver jogged a bit to catch up actually he said putting a hand on my shoulder to stop me which i shook off and continued walking but he put his hand on my shoulder and forced me to walk slower actually fred and george had that coming they were out of line but wanting to get good grades and fly the best you can isnta bad thing i just wanted to fall on the floor instead i just stopped walking in two seconds i went from stiff and edgy to slouched and ready to fall apart but wanting isntgetting me any where you ve done more than want he moved in front of me placed both hands on my shoulders and forced me to stare into his brown eyes you ve worked hard on school work everyday and i know it of all people the o w l s arentfor another 7 months if you keep going like this you ll be fried before then i sighed and some what smiled crookedly yeah guess you re right i know i right and dontworry about your flying you re the best chaser i know and the only one on the team who knows almost all of the plays and can stand my constant bantering really of course how many chasers do you know he laughed and placed an arm around my shoulders and practically steered me back to the castle and into the common room when we reached the portrait he said to meet him back in the common room at 8 30 i said the password flung my bag on one of the couches after taking my uniform out of it and went upstairs and here i am now it 8 45 better go 10 00 oliver wood is a god above gods when i came down he had a whole spread of junky food turned out he went to the kitchens while i was upstairs i can downstairs and the common room was empty except for oliver his arms over flowing with butter beer chocolate which made him an even better god above gods tons of different deserts and of course some fruit and potato salad what he could never change his ways completely little help he asked as he just caught a bottle of butter beer from falling over iran over to him and help him put the food on the table in front of the fire place i think my eyes must ve grown to the size of dishes when i realized how much food he brought they let you take all this i asked in amazement as he handed me a butter beer we were sitting on the couch i threw my bag on and i was eyeing the food like a dog who hadnteaten in five days you didntskip dinner again did you kat i must ve been drooling well i have a lot of home work i was planning to run from practice straight to here so i could finish at a some what reasonable time i explained so you haventeaten since 12 i told you i have a lot of home work so get it i ll help really i took a bite of potato salad as he nodded smiling i swallowed well then in that case my bag is right next to your feet here he handed it over to me i ll get mine we learning about some man eating plant that supposedly lives in the dark woods he added absentmindedly as he ran up to the guys dorm and came back with his bag when he came back i was sitting on the couch cross legged with my sleeves rolled up to my elbows and my transfig book across my lap what are you up to oliver asked as he sat back down some gibber di gibber about turning a tortoise into a tea kettle or something i was biting my quill which was becoming an even smaller stub everyday are you ever going to get a new quill i ignored him why would anyone ever need to know this i was astounded that our wise professors would give us such a stupid assignment because incase you re on a tortoise farm and you d like a cup of tea but have no teapot that your solution oliver answered like it was the most obvious thing in the world finally out of my edgy mood i laughed we both finally finished our homework by 9 45 and completely stuffed so you think we ll go all the way this year kat i smiled how did i foresee this i didnthave to look into my crystal ball or anything of course you said that last year i sighed and the year before that he pointed out and the year before that and the year before that ok i give up is there anything wrong with being optimistic about things no but the year before that you oliver every year i think we ll go all the way even when i was a first year when i wasnteven on the team i thought we would go all the way i thought you were on the team when you were a first year no i was a second and harry was a first no harry came the year after that he two years younger than me oliver groaned my god i only 16 and i losing my memory i thought you were 17 not until the end of november i knew that i sure he laughed i think we re over worked agreed and we cheered to that with our bottles of butter beer i stood up after a few minutes stretched and yawned well i gonna go to bed i looked at the table where there was still some food need help cleaning up no i got it he said smiling standing up and handing me my bag thanks for everything for what throwing you in a shower anytime har har oliver wood i said as i climbed the stairs to the girls dorm night night sleeping beauty he called softly from the common room reviews make me very happy finally long reviews i love it and i promise i ll try and catch those silly typos for those few who are spelling freaks but i warning you i a terrible speller and if the spell check doesntpick it up chances are i not going to either so bare with guys i about to have a touching moment here so whip out the puff tissues every single time i read one of your reviews i cannot stop grinning from ear to ear i ll come off the comp and my brotherly ask me why i have such a goofy smile on and i must say the lengths are making me jump up and down for joy alright that my one touching moment for the next ten chapters 40 chapters people 40 so if you want to copy and paste that somewhere that fine because it not gonna happen again in any near future whips small tear i sorry it was just such a touching moment between author and reader s april 7 tuesday 10 pm ok so it might ve been a slightly risky idea sneaking out to practice but i sure it would ve been absolutely hilarious to watch so practice was scheduled for 6 00 so i started my mission impossible at 5 45 i crept out of the hospital wing and no i didntgo out the large doors i more or less climbed out the window thank god that wing was on the ground floor and from that point on i mentally kicked myself because you see it the beginning of april which means it still freezing out which means i a complete idiot for even thinking of the idea of walking all the way to the pitch in my funky teal pajamas and bare feet the ground was frosty so after five football fields worth of sprinting and half an hour later i creep out on the pitch this time actually dressed for practice oliver was standing in the middle of the pitch screaming at ange and lic for some random reason what can i say they re useless with out me now i hope they really dontread this because they ll all have my head for that so i sneakily snuck up behind oliver and put my hands over his eyes fred weasley he screamed get your filthy hands off me and get back on your broom i put on my best george voice i not fred ollie i so disappointed you still canttell us apart fred george who ever you are get back up on your broom and what wrong with your voice are you getting sick we i took my hands of his eyes and resumed my normal voice i hope not i jut spent a day in the hospital wing it supposed to be germ free at that point oliver turned around and his face that is normally reserved for killing the twins dropped into a katie what the hell are you doing here you should still be in those crazy pajamas face and my hands arentfifty thank you very much kat he smiled then it dropped and went into either get up in the air or get off the pitch face what are you doing can i pin him or what er cantsay i exactly had a straight answer going to practice that right never miss a practice that what you always say hu i said this all very fast and took off before he could yell at me well at least warm up first be my pleasure just sprinted all the way from the castle in my funky teal pajamas i shout to him from the air i could do with some warmth what he asked shocked and that not what i meant bell i just smiled down at him smiled and shrugged my shoulders before going to practice with ange and lic and for once this whole entire week it didntrain i tell you i really getting sick of the stuff you know madam pomfrey is going to kill you lic warned in the locker rooms yeah i sighed getting back into only my funky teal pajamas maybe shne wontnotice i was gone from 6 to nine good luck with that ange said maybe i could sneak back in i thought it was a good idea besides it would give them all another reason to laugh at me ange and lic laughed as they walked towards the locker room doors but i refused to come out my trudge back to the castle was going to be any better than coming to the pitch plus then it was dark and probably ten times colder coming katie lic asked um i said looking down at my unusual attire not in this stuff i ll freeze so you re just going to stay here ange asked disbelievingly i ve done stupider stuff i wontdeny that lic asked i donthave any extra real clothes i ll go ask if any of the boys do though why dontyou just wear your robes ange asked once she had left i slap my forehead wish i thought of that before i sent them down the laundry shoot yeah ange said sent mine down too what taking lic so long probably snogging george they re so cute together and you an oliver aren t are we of course we fight like little kids and me and fred didn t didn t dontyou mean don t no what does that mean we broke up what i gasped no i wontallow it when did this happen the middle of practice this practice yes when i dunno she shrugged her shoulders we just decided to be friends you re going to get back together i said i calling it now while it miles away what miles away we turned around and oliver was standing in the doorway the fact that ange and fred are going to get back together why did you break p again he asked you knew i asked shocked how did you know i didn t oliver shrugged his shoulders and gave me a lopsided grin because you re not the brightest wire in the bulb ok ange said before i could say anything did you bring this girl some real clothes or not right here he said holding up what seemed like a bunch of random garmets of all colors and patterns fred says donttouch anything in the pockets he warned as he passed them over do i even want to know i asked taking them from him no ange and oliver said at the same time well in that case i said give me two seconds to get changed so who exactly owns all these clothes i asked maybe two minutes later well the plaid pants are fred s the long sleeve tee shirt are george and the sweater and jacket are mine oliver answered oh and here he said handing me a purple and yellow pok a dotted scarf apparently the twins dontwant you catching a cold i looked down at my bare feet if they dontwant me to catch a cold why didntthey give me any socks or shoes all down the shoot same as mine oliver i sighed you know you really donthave to do this it nothing honest carrying me piggyback isnt nothing it a whole lot of bell no he chuckled you definitely lost weight since the last time i carried you oliver i groaned kaa aat he mimicked stooo op it nooo o i laughed and wrapped my arms around his shoulders tighter and kissed the side of his neck then rested my chin on his right shoulder thanks well i canthave my favorite chaser get frost bite on her toes i laughed softly i thought captains werentsupposed to have favorites well i thought they were supposed to be ridiculously hard on everybody equally what i don t he laughed you want me to be even harder on you uhh no then stop while you re ahead he laughed you know what that a brilliant idea though i must say i rather enjoyed the grueling dawn practices in the rain all last week i added as i messed up his hair maybe i went a little over board he contemplated a little ok he sighed i was mad can you blame me no i shook my head after a second or two to really think about it i probably would ve done worse in your position ten minutes later we were standing in the school main entrance and you know what the marble floor in the entrance way is even colder than the one in the hospital wing well i said as we started towards the hospital wing at least there no one else around to see my new sense of fashion what are you talking about oliver asked grabbing one of my hands and twirling me you look wonderful get your eyes checked i laughed your going to need to if you expect to see the quaffle i looked down at my crazy clothes even more crazy then the teal pajamas stuffed in some pockets i was wearing fred mustard colored plaid paints george off colored and faded long sleeve tee oliver brown sweater with buttons that went half way down his chest but practically reached my stomach i was to lazy to actually do them up though and oliver denim jacket oh did i mention the bare feet and the purple scarf and yellow pok a dots which actually turned out to be smiley faces in the right light why does fred even own plaid pants i asked in a hushed whisper as we creep into the wing oliver shrugged his shoulders giving my a crooked smile so i tiptoed as fast as i could into the small bathroom at the back took my teal pajamas out from several pockets and changed back into them and as i came back out of the bathroom i was once again a crazy hospital patient in crazy pajamas so i said shrugging my shoulders once i came out do i still look like a madwoman who needs to be strapped into a hospital bed oliver looked me up and down never he smiled i smiled back until he reached around the back of my head pulled out my hair tie and messed up my hair that better well now that i look like cousin it i laughed pushing my hair back over my head the way it supposed to go i better go strap myself back in oliver chuckled before pulling into a tight hug up till then i wasntreally sure what i missed about him over the past week the most couldntfigure out if it was his lopsided smile the glint in his eye whenever quidditch was brought up or his straight broad shoulders or his scottish accent that became even harsher when he got worked up and this sounds really corny but i missed everything from the way he can be even more stubborn than me at times to the way he smells which is like freshly mowed lawn after it rains if you wanted to know oh my god i becoming one of those girls who cantlive with out their boyfriends gah nooooo not me wait it couldntpossibly happen to me right i mean i did go a whole entire week with no girlfriend boy friend stuff right ok never mind scratch that i think i ll be ok april 8 wednesday time i have no idea probably around lunch because i currently stark raving hungry ok so maybe it during d a d a but i kinda forgot because my stomach is grumbling non see madam pomphrey released me during third period with no breakfast now i have to wait for stinking lunch to eat i starving and i desperately need food people this isntgoing to be katie slow down moh moh i think she means no well maybe she should breath in between bites moh mevha swallow four friends shouted at me i took a particularly large gulp and downed the half of a sandwich and half a cup of soda down my throat food had never tasted so good so if you couldnttell it was lunch and i sprinted there from five floors up nearly falling down the stairs twice almost rolling my ankle and knocking several people down by the time lic ange and the twins had finally showed up i had already finished a potato half a sandwich and some soda pop with no sign of slowing down or stopping how lady like of me how can you eat so fast lic asked i shrugged my shoulders slow isntin my vocabulary i thought it was a good answer you have a vocabulary fred asked i bet i could beat her time george said looking down at his own food as i punched fred in the shoulder the twins were sitting on either side of me let go for it fred said enthusiastically and without a moment to spare they started attempting to eat as fast as i had just seconds before do i want to know i craned my neck up to see oliver standing right behind me looking at the twins probably not i said oliver sighed before pulling fred off the bench by the collar of his robes and sitting down next to me why is everybody beating up on me today fred asked from the ground because it easy we all replied up from the table without looking down at him you know that wasntvery nice fred get outta here sorry no can do especially after that little punch you gave me earlier but you can make it up to me how oh nothing to big just a little kis now kicking my chair over while i still sitting on it isntmaking me like you any better fred how ange put up with you i will never know what can i say i have an irresistible charm that makes everyone want to beat you senseless more like snog senseless what did george slip in your drink this morning i dunno might ve been love potion or loony potion probably the second probably better talk to him about that haha fred i love you i knew my drop dead good looks couldntloss it effects on you i meant in a brotherly way in a drop dead good looking brotherly way haha what ever floats your boat i have a boat i dontknow but your ginormous ego ll bound to keep you afloat now you re mixing me up with perc which i consider a terrible insult it is a terrible insult good call what can i say i great and wonderful and funny and gorgeous and fred stop it ok keep going and funny and sarcastic and funny running out of material oh yeah so can you see what going on in the front of the classroom no snape greasy hair is reflecting the light right into my eyes and i cantseem to see a bloody thing good i thought i was the only one who realized now what is this both me and fred winced as we realized snape was standing right behind us and the whole class was snickering bugger i heard fred mumble before we could stop him he grabbed the piece of parchment we had been writing on cleared his throat and read aloud and after reading the whole entire thing he stumbled upon the last few lines by this time i was either on the verge of killing snape or cracking up hysterically and fred kept his mischievous grin on how he was smiling i ll probably never know can you see what going on in the front of the class room snape continued no snape s his eyes grew wide as he trailed off no doubt coming to the funny part of our little chat what professor fred asked oh god only knows what his going to do is the light reflecting in your eyes he asked with the evilest smirk i have ever seen saw that one coming snape just glared at him i mean glared like i want to shoot you down fred weasley glare it was that bad 20 points from griffindor he declared after the fact that fred had just stated sunk in and detention for the both off you 5 tonight my office with that he walked back to the front of the room more like dreary dungeon and resumed teaching i slapped fred on the shoulder you owe me big i said in a hushed whisper dragging me into that oliver going to have my head we have practice tonight fred snorted no doubt thinking of the look on oliver face when he found out we had detention on the night of a practice that another ten points mr weasley you re and idiot fred i said as we walked away from the dungeons as fast as possible after class i hope you know that what does he know ange said god only knows where she popped out from genius here i said slapping fred on the shoulder just lost us thirty points and managed to get us both in detention good one angelina said oliver going to kill you there less than two months away from the final match and you two get yourself in detention and show up a hour late are you trying to lose us the cup i thought you two were committed why did you even tryout if you planned to show up a hour late wow i love oliver but sometimes he can lay it on a tad bit thick or is that just me so me and fred just stood there for the first five minutes letting him yell and shout and scream and anything else you would like to insert here that pertains to any loud mad i want to kill you voice or synonyms that go with the previously listed adjectives but after a while you just canthelp to stop him or laugh at him i took the first but unfortunately fred beat me with the second all of a sudden he starts snorting i hope he was trying to hold his laughter in but it didntwork because next thing you know he rolling around on the ground laughing and of course at this sight and oliver now nearly purple face i start laughing to it not funny so i somehow manage to stop laughing and i attempt to calm him down oliver i said through dying laughs you actually think we want to spend an extra two hours with snape writing lines pfft fred said standing up i had to personally with out magic clean all the greasy grime on the dungeon windows so the light didntreflect into his precious students eyes at that he pretended to gag all of a sudden george comes and lands next to fred with a very hurt and distraught face on you embarrassed snape he said slowly with out me your twin am i non existent wha get in the damn air now so before he got purple in the face again we all took off in three scarlet did ya like i hope so now since this is our official forty chapters mark you all must write super super super loooooooooong reviews like ultra long reviews because if i dontget really long reviews i might boycott not really but i need something to get you guys to write more but seriously if i can write 7 pages you can give me at least a lengthy paragraph so go and write lots for me and if you were wondering what up with fred let just say he misses angelina because i have no other explination for it that and it was semi funny semi now get on with that long review i know you re going to leave me yes oh my gosh super long reviewness i love it and i goddess or writing i had no idea eeeeee got to go rub that in my little sister face she happens to be under the impression that she the young almighty queen of the universe that may be so but i am a god holy crap yeah that right move over sis and i could ve never made it to 40 chaps with out you guys complementing me the whole way d and ladypup why didntyou ever review for the other chaps and all those other people that gave me a review for the last chap that i ve never heard of before that have been reading my story but not leaving reviews that i m happy to know like my story eh what ever dontworry

people that actually read these and if you keep sending me long reviews i ll keep writing long chaps not like i would stop though ok story i know here it is april 9 friday time god only knows so katie where you re quidditch obsessed boyfriend hu oh i dontknow wait a second i didntknow that didntseem right we were all sitting in the common room i was sitting at the base of the couch on the floor with my books all over the coffee table angelina lic and the twins were scattered on the couches and chairs or floor next to me but oliver hadntshown up all afternoon then i think it was four thirty and oliver is normally the first to show up in the common room so how come he wasnthere now normally i at least have a clue where oliver is i not physically glued to him but if he has a project his in the library you know stuff like that but didnteven have an inkling where he was which didntfeel too great where is he i asked looking up from my paper he said he d help me with it and i d help him in herbology i ll go find him i said getting up where do you think he is angelina asked i mean it pouring outside and katie i had ran up to our dorm and grabbed my pea cot a hat and scarf along with an umbrella you dontseriously think he at the pitch fred asked there half a typhoon outside even he not that bent on winning dear brother george said from next to him of course he is though i d like to believe he has one lick of sense so would i i said as i put my pea coat over my white crew neck sweater we had gotten changed out of our uniforms after classes per usual but i wouldntcount on it either i ll see you in a bit i said before going out of the portrait hole and try to resist the urge not to copy my essay because you re so good in potions alicia called back i stuck my head back in yeah i agreed and i thought sarcasm was my thing are you going to go find oliver or what ange asked alright i said know how anxious you all are to see me leave i heard them laughing as i slammed the portrait door shut hey the fat lady yelled at me be more careful i very delicate i cocked an eyebrow oh i know and before she could catch onto the sarcasm i had just laid on three layers thicker than normal i hurried down the halls paintings are always a little slow with sarcasm funny hu so seven flights of stairs and fifteen minutes later i was out the front doors and fred was wrong it wasnt half a typhoon it was a typhoon it was a stay inside wrapped in blankets with hot chocolate in your pajamas typhoon and here i was attempting to find oliver out in the terrible weather i would ve turned back and gone inside but there was absolutely no doubt in my mind he was at the pitch after yesterday terrible practice session oh that man owes me s s so big i mumbled to myself through chattering teeth it was freezing and the fact that my umbrella got blown away by the wind wasnthelping my mood so by the time i reached the pitch which took double the time it normally does because i was working against the weather i was soaked to the bone and freezing and praying when i found oliver we could fly back up to the castle and sure enough there he was the big idiot hovering around the three hoops saving shots by the charmed quaffle oliver i screamed over the howling wind you big dolt get out of the sky before i come up there and knock you off your broom too bad he didnthear one word i said i was standing more or less in the center of the field off to the side so i trudged onward until i was right underneath him oliver i screamed oi down here no dice still didnthear me how on earth was i supposed to get him back on the ground kick him down to the ground that how so i went and got a spare broom one of those really old ones out of the closet went back out onto the pitch and kicked off it was even worse out than when we played hufflepuff so eventually i was behind the stupid three hoops behind him in my stupid pea coat and with my stupid scarf whipping around my semi stupid head and my stupid hat blown off to some stupid distant land it was a stupid moment what can i say oliver i screamed but the wind swept my words right back down my throat so i moved right behind him and consequently was also right in front of one of the three hoops you ding a ling dontmake me come over there and kick you out of the ai aaaaa freaking genius missed the enchanted quaffle and of course it soared straight towards me and of course the freaking genius enchanted the quaffle so it went as fast and with as much force of a bludger so when it hit me straight in the chest it swept me straight off my broom and through the hoop behind me it was all i could do to catch myself on the rim of the silver hoop at that second oliver turned around and was in complete and total shock which was completely understandable if you think about it i mean how often do you turn around and see your girlfriend hanging off one of the quidditch hoops underneath her arms in a freaking typhoon not often i hope kat he screamed over the rain and wind i think you missed that last one i yelled back now get me down that silver hoop isntall that easy to hang by especially when it a typhoon what are you doing he asked i went to go find you because you re going to get amonia and if i get it too i kill you and if i fall i ll kill you now get me down with that last line i slipped from hanging with my arms crossed over the rim to barely hanging on by my fingers oliver wood i think he laughed at me i mean i couldnthear it but i think i saw it alright alright yup there was definitely a bit of a laugh in his voice as he brought his broom right beneath me so i slid off the hoop and landed behind him on his broom a a achoo tissue ugh hanks lic i said through the miles of congestion that was currently lodged inside me ugh can i have one oo apparently oliver was just as bad as me well that what happens when you try to play quidditch in the rain typhoon better yet so currently me and oliver had occupied the couch which was now lost under five blankets four pillows and the two of us i was somewhere underneath a long sleeve tee a sweat shirt flannel pajama pants and three pairs of socks oliver was hidden underneath the same amount of clothing i told you typhoons were for sitting in your pajamas i just didntexpect the sick part you two are so sick angelina laughed maybe we should take them to see madame po no me and oliver cried at the same time i am never going o see ha mad woman ever again i said through several sniffles issue please besides i fine uh i think you two are sick fred agreed i perfec ly fine uh oliver seconded with me you re sick they all cried define sick i challenged sick is when you cantpronounce your t s george pointed out i can pronounce my t uhs i said look he yphoon ou side is really we oliver just looked at me with a cocked eyebrow and we all cracked up hysterically ok so maybe i am a tad sick it oliver fault though so about five million tissues a hundred cups of tea several small bouts of me not being or being sick and five temperature checks for the each of us later i was getting quiet bored ugh i said i ha e being sick i admitted after angelina and fred went to the library and alicia and george went to the kitchens for some food i ll second ha oliver agreed right before he let out a huge sneeze you jus had a play in he yphoon didn you i asked oliver chuckled typhoons only happen in he sou h i only a li le bi of rain ka a li le bi of rain i quoted are you off your rocker i enough rain o ge bo h of us sick well he said positioning himself so he was laying down with his head in my lap a leas he company good i tried not to smile how is it that this man can never keep me mad at him forget mad even slightly agitated at him how and does this work on everybody or just me like does it work on teachers oh my god baaaaaaaaad image very very bad image like worst image ever i donteven think you want to kno oliver had his head in mcgonagall lap you see i told you it was a bad image and it could even get worse like i sub snape in eeeee or snape head in mcgonagal lap oh my god ok i stopping myself right now before my brain takes me to even weirder places i think my brain needs those leather straps now and then ok back to what was going on before my brain took an unexpected turn into bad image ville i looked down at him with a cocked eyebrow do you really hink ha works he shrugged his shoulders more or less i ha e you i said as i started to fondly play with his hair no you don so he chuckled and a few minutes later he fell asleep i didntknow this so i jumped when all of a sudden my lap started snoring er hi katie i was staring at the fire so i jumped again when somebody said my name why am i so jumpy lately i ll say it because i still sick which is true oh i sighed hi harry wha going on he put his hands in his pockets and shrugged nothing much are you sick i gave him a small smile ya his big dol decided to go flying in he middle of his weather i said slapping oliver on the shoulder in his sleep he grunted and ressumd snoring like he was sawing logs so i had to go ge him he laughed yeah that wood for you more or less i agreed are ron and hermione s ill fighting he looked at me confused i guess he couldntunderstand my newly acquired accent are hermione and ron s tuh ill figh tuh ing i repeated trying to pronounce my tas best i could oh he said finally understanding yeah he walked over to one of the chairs what do you do when angelina and alicia are fighting you re asking me i asked shocked he nodded i love harry i mean brotherly look at him he asking me for advice that right me katie bell for advice i never get asked for advice well i said thinking about what i ve done in the past making a list in my head this is what i got 1 yell at them for being idiots 2 slap the two of them until they understand what idiots they ve been 3 have everyone they know ignore the both of them so they only have themselves to talk too i had a feeling none of these would work and i saw my chances of being asked for advice again going down the drain i had to say something else aka be as original as possible aka say something completely and totally weird do you know what wrong i asked what a stupid question everybody in the whole tower knew what was up with the both of them i mean they went at it more than me and oliver know that is saying something harry nodded well i said trying to come up with someone how about the nex ime they s ar o figh and you re their randomly say i know you wo are despera ely in love with each other so go find a broom close already he started to blush how adorable is he he like the younger and innocent brother i never had um he said scratching the back of his neck there goes my advice career i guess i could try it but ron would scowl at me and hermione will either hit me in the head with a book or turn me into a book well at least we finally got over the language barrier with my t s ha because hey know i rue harry laughed i hope it wasntbecause of my accent because if we re on a younger brother older sister level that give me right to beat him with a stick you know what he said i ll try that really that was even more than a shocker that he actually asked me for advice he even took it took my advice my advice took it ha wait until i tell everybody thanks katie he said getting up and walking towards the portrait hole you know you re like the older sister i never had right my face probably light up like a christmas tree really i asked in a voice that definitely sounded like a little kid because i had about three miles of congestion down my lungs you re like he bro her i never had what about lance harry asked how did he know about lance oh yeah i complained about him that time he sent me that letter telling me not to do anything he would at practice that time what great guy lance doesn coun i pointed out he a pain harry laughed before leaving the common room leaving me to stare at the fire for another hour while oliver snored in my lap at the end of that hour fred and angelina came back from the library how d ha essay go i asked casually attempting to catch them in a little lie i had five galleons saying that they were going to get back together by next saturday great angelina smiled taking an actual essay out of her bag actually got something done same fred said holding up his own please i said rather annoyed that they actually told the truth and actually went to the library funny know i getting annoyed because people are telling the truth you only copied off of her fred and he smiled where alicia and george ange said suddenly realizing thy werenthere i shrugged my shoulders no idea but guess what harry asked me for ad we should go find them angelina said cutting off my riveting tale grabbing fred by his elbow and dragging him back out the door damn it i looked back down at oliver my right leg was starting to fall asleep and by then i really had to go to the bathroom hey if you had ten cups of tea you would too but how was i going to wake up snoring beauty go i i said snapping my fingers but it didntsound as great as i hoped because i was still unable to say my t s but what are you going to do i had to go to the bathroom and hopefully regain circulation in my leg again so i simply pinched oliver nose the snoring instantly stopped and eventually woke up groggily wha he said scratching the back of his head oh good i said you re up so i kinda pushed him into a sitting postion and stood up ha dandy now if you ll excuse me and before he could answer me in his groggy state i ran out the portrait hole and into the nearest bathroom but of course the fat lady had to give me grief getting back in nice pajamas she said with a smirk ifflus mi lus i said rolling my eyes no she said shaking her head that not the password of course i he password wha else would i be not ifflus milus she answered damn i said slapping my forehead why is it i just couldntpronounce my t for the life of me but then that neville longbottom was strolling down the corridor on the other end so i sprinted down to him clad in my griffindor pajamas nearly fell into him cotton socks are particularly on marble floor by the way and nearly brought him down with me neville i said steadying my self by holding onto his shoulders i need you o ell he fa lady he password so i can ge back in he ower he just looked at me like i had three heads god i hate being sick i sick and i can pronounce my t s i explained so after the language barrier was breached for the hundredth time today i finally got back into the tower to find that now oliver had occupied the whole couch and had become snoring beauty once again i groaned and kneeled at the base of the couch crossing my arms over the edge and resting my chin on them so i was two inches away from oliver face hey i said snoring beau y gonna leave some room for me all of a sudden his eyes snapped open and gave me a long kiss why am i always always the kissee why canti ever be the kisser ever i always the one surprised by the whole entire thing me every time i must be cursed you know oliver i said once we broke apart ha probably wasn he grea es idea since we re both half dead and deciding to practice in his wea her probably wasn such a grand idea ei her he shrugged his shoulders wai i said realizing the answer he gave me from this slight movement are you saying ha i righ he sighed and smiled fine you re righ can we ake a momen to realize wha happened oday i was so proud of myself no only did harry ask for my advice he even hinking about aking i he aking your advice don ac so surprised i said sarcastically bu now i also righ yeah ha wha i hough oliver sat up smiling making room for me so i sat down next to him and he put his arm around me being sick is making you delirious isn i oh yeah he chuckled before giving me a kiss on my temple ok so i just realized it 9 at night i still sick as a dog which means i still cantpronounce my t and alicia just got back i donteven want to know where they ve been for the past three hours but she did bring back a bit of fruit which she smartly handed over in a second so now i going to go to sleep before i pass out night hey did you guys like i know this chapter had nothing to do ith the plot but look harry is actually alive he does exists in my own little world over here gah so i finally just saw the fourth movie this saturday took me long enough i know and i was disappointed of course i cried when cedric died not because i particularly like the character but because the actor was so cute dontworry oliver is still number one yeah i know but in the book they ran into oliver at the quidditch cup which scene sucked by the way and he wasntthere and voldemort looked like michael jackson so if you d all give me a nice long review about the story not so much on the author notes i notice some people like myself sometimes only write about the little notes but if you d like to leave a little part about those that d be great too god i getting picky just please leave me a review please jesus i had no idea i was so loved i mean people are thanking me for reading their stories it like i turned into a god or something over night and i must say i love rubbing it in my lil sister face watch out there a new god of the universe move aside sis move aside but thanks so much guys and i am going to actually use the things you mentioned in your reviews no t during classes harry actually taking katie advice and stuff like that which is weird you mentioned because i was going to use them anyway great minds think a like though and i sorry i had no idea my chaps were shrinking gah gotta make em longer so i was bored yesterday and read the first five chapters of this story and it struck me that my author notes just got longer and longer as time went on and so thanks for putting up with my rambling and to show my thanks i going straight into the story now that i ve written three paragraphs april 12 monday transfiguration now the incantation is tachita myfeetta professor mcgonagall said not only did i find this incantation very odd it sounded like touch my feet but there would be no way i could manage all those t s and of course she had me demonstrate miss bell i sure you read the chapter over the weekend and have practiced a bit like the homework assigned why dontyou show us how it done the world is working against me and of course when i said the incantation it sounded like ouchia my fee a which sounded translated into my fee hurts and of course my twig didntturn into an elegant dove like it was supposed to but instead into a bill like a restaurant bill why do i even bother trying potions what did you say bell ha you re po ions class is absolu ly errible errible then out of now where he pulls a dictionary out of his robes and looks up errible why thank you miss bell he said putting the mini dictionary back into his robe i glad you think my class is way cool but i do not allow slang in my class twenty points from griffindor with that he walked back up to the front of the class and i promptly slammed my head on the desk i miss my t s after practice i mean even when i ry o insul a eacher i sounds like i actually like heir s upid class i moaned in the locker room after practice oh here alicia said tossing me a small vial that i caught without even thinking if your wondering oliver used to chuck random things at us at any time during the day to make sure our reflexes were up to par it has it perks i can officially catch anything from that 1000 page hogwarts a history to an itty bitty you can barely see pebble with my left hand i un touchable wha his i asked there was no label cure for the common cold ange and lic said at the same time how long have you had his i asked narrowing my eyes lemme guess i said cutting of lic before she could answer since friday where you wo decided o have an ex ended snogging session more or less ange said i was drinking the potion and nearly spit it out but managed to get it down at ange s comment aha i said triumphantly you did get back with fred i knew it you all owe me five galleons i screamed so everybody in the locker room who part took in our little bet heard hey my t are back what do you mean five galleons ange asked and me and lic high fived uhhhh you mean you took bets on how long it would take us to get back together uh alicia started and i won i am an idiot no ange it not so bad i mean oh come one dontpull my hair fred come pry your girlfriend off of me that didntreally help the twins and harry came onto our side of the locker room and laughed as ange pulled me down by my hair i wasntthe only one who bet you re just jealous i won you little she growled as she continued to pull on my hair oh please i said rather calmly pulling hair isntso bad when i was little lance used to pull off the ground by it my scalps made out of steal like you didnttake bets on me and oliver no i didn t yes you did fred ventured quietly but didntsay anything else with a look from his girl told you i looked at the twins are you gonna get here off of me or what yeah about ange sitting on my back while i was face to face with the locker room floor still in our muddy scarlet robes and five minutes later ange was off me and was on top of fred having yet another snogging session which is more or less when i changed in two seconds flat with lic george and harry and practically ran out of the locker room where oliver i asked harry george and lic were whispering some what not to each other and i didntfeel like asking them gag me please i dontknow he shrugged his shoulders did you check the captain office i slapped my self on the forehead i was just so excited that everybody owed me five galleons that a lot of money when you add it up i would never worry about not having money to buy birthday gifts alicia was coming up that i had walked all the way to ground level only to have to run all the way back up to the top floor to go find him ol iver i panted opening his office door a crack and peeped in with one eye you in here kat i opened the door and walking in so when did you get your t back lunch he was working on something yeah yup why did i get them so late dontknow that so yup normally i never bother him when he making up a new play no one would in their right mind but how could you resist i mean i could pull off stuff now that only you could dream of i smirked so do you still have those boxers with the snitches yup and quaffle uh hu and bludgers you know it and brooms sticks wear them all the time that sounds interesting oliver yup sure is they lucky oh yeah i wish i was captain i know it i could run my team into the ground everyday wonderful you re gonna let me be captain one of these days right got it all planned boy could that quill move fast so you re gonna let me run the team someday great that someday tomorrow i smiled be at practice at 3 am tomorrow and make sure to bring your lucky boxers sounds like a plan with that i ran out the door and waited outside for what he just agreed to sink in three two one and cue the wood kat he screamed charging out of his office like a bull possibly in a china shop right on time and of course he completely blew past me without even noticing i was right there kat oliver i called from the top of the stairs he was already half way down the first flight he spun around on his heel kat i laughed his face matched the color of his scarlet robes which he was still in i think you should refer to me as ma am from now on i said leaning on the wall my bag slung over my shoulder i mean i am your captain after all about that oliver said climbing the stairs putting his arm around my shoulders and leading me into his office you cantbe captain he said shortly but oliiii ver i moaned sarcastically i really really really reaaaaaallllllly wanted to be captain he just chuckled and went to sit back down at his desk i sighed he was starting to pick up on my sarcasm i used to get away with so much too sooo i said after a while rocking back and forth from my toes to my heels and back again this is what you after you beat us all into the ground i looked at his quickly moving quill fun oliver looked at me with a cocked eyebrow one look from me and he put down his quill ok what do you want my five galleons your five galleons he asked shocked i borrowed two sickles not five gal fred and ange got back together pay up buddy it was barely a week he mumbled as he dug through his bag and i moved beside him do all want birthday gifts for the next two years or not he sighed and drew out five galleons and placed them in my hand you collecting from everybody then i looked at the galleons in my hand then after a few seconds of an internal battle you idiot just take the money give the money back take it you really dontneed it 25 galleons if everyone pays up just give it back you re going to buy presents with it so it not for you of course she going to use at least some of it to buy clothes you re point friends donttake friend money they re more like paying up cantyou just see the angel and devil on my shoulders damn the both of them no i answered putting the money back into his hand i ll trade it in for some gloating oliver looked completely dumbfounded but you won eh i shrugged my shoulders betting is a crappy way to get money damn nice person inside me besides i smiled i probably owe you all five galleons each anyway i looked at the new play sheet on his desk so how long is it going to take to drill this into our heads oliver chuckled a long time he said turning to his play well i said i wouldntdo it at 5 am after a two hour practice probably a good idea probably i laughed moving behind his chair and wrapping my arms around his shoulders and kissing his cheek but i dontlike the whole idea of us flying around in a tornado with two bludgers mixed in there i added resting my chin on his right shoulder my arms still around him but that what makes it so good jeez his accent really comes out whenever he talking about a new play well i said looking at my watch so he could see it too it officially 7 45 we missed dinner and i starving i walked over towards the door where my lonely bag was waiting so are we gonna go to the kitchens or what alright he picked up his bag along with his new play shut off the lights to his office and locked the door let go i know how much you love those robes but you might want to change thanks for waiting oliver said coming out of the locker room back in his normal clothes five minutes later i was about to answer but my stomach did for me about that i laughed can we go grab some food oliver was about to answer but his stomach too answered for him what does my stomach think it can randomly start conversations with other stomachs bizarre let go oliver laughed with me i have to say i said beaming at the little house elves around me with their big ears and eyes and not to mention the mountain of food that each had on a silver platter i love you all wrong thing to say now i cantstep into the kitchens without at least five house elves jump on my legs hugging them strange they cantjump higher than my thigh so i practically give them a ride to the platter of food my stomach is so desperately craving why canti just eat in peace so whaz iz new pla i asked oliver through large bites o nado he answered with the same amount of food in his moth o nado i repeated taking a bite of a canoli a house elf brought over yes in two minutes we had plowed through dinner and into desert whaz we haz o du fly bound yn loz o cirleds houns ez enough it amazing in a few short days we have made and overcome the language barrier of two languages language number 1 i m so freaking sick because a freaking scottish kilt wearing son of a bitch captain decided to go flying in a typhoon and i didn t have enough sense to realize if i went out there i would fall deathly ill but did anyway falling deathly ill and now neither of us can pronounce our t language and language number 2 our freaking scottish kilt wearing son of a bitch captain ran us into the ground so much our stomachs started a conversation so we practically sprinted to the kitchen to stuff our faces and talk while house elves everywhere are squeking i love you too miss bell language confusing yes but ridiculously easy to say under the right conditions the beaters might get mixed up in there too oliver added as an after thought finally swallowing great i swallowed two more things i gonna wind up flying into oliver just chuckled but i dontknow why i can see it now katie bell crash extrodinar takes out half her team in two seconds personally i dontreally like the way it sounds but i sure the slytherins are going to get a kick out of it april 15 wednesday after classes my brain has melted i said sitting down next to oliver at the lunch table it has melted and drained out both my ears i slumped forward crossing my arms over the table and burying my face in them transfiguration oliver asked and history of magic ange said sitting down across from me and defense that was alicia who sat next to ange and potions later the twins said sitting next to the appropriate chaser and all practice o w l s i muttered it couldnthave been that bad oliver said putting a hand on my shoulder comfortingly if only he knew i was supposed to turn a small parakeet into a knitted pillow and i turned it into an even bigger bird that was almost reached the ceiling lic put in that lost all it feathers ange said and blew fire the twins said together shoot me i cried slamming my head back into my crossed arms it was cool one of the twins said i think george maybe fred it was one of them i sure you did fine in defense oliver said brightly that easy though i moaned looking back up not for me ange said i hate those red caps and i can never think of anything to make a banshee funny george added have it lose it voice i muttered you see lic said at least you re good at that any normal person could ve thought of that though i said feeling slightly better george didn t fred pointed out like i said any normal person and after a good laugh i was feeling better until i went and completely failed my potions p o w l gah some body shoot me ugh i groaned falling face first into a pillow as i did yet another perfect belly flop onto the couch after classes bag and robe thrown on the floor perfect form i have to say potions i looked up out of my sad little pillow to see oliver sitting on one of the armchairs when d you get here right before you he shrugged said getting up and walking over to me p o w l s he asked lightly slapping the back of my calf meaning move your fat butt katherine ann bell so i can sit too in a nicer more subtle possibly even more loving way and sat down after i lifted my calves underneath me uh hu i muttered into the pillow what a sight i was curled up in a slight ball on one side of the couch facing opposite oliver my face some where in a frilly pillow i sat up and twisted around it barely two months till the real o w l s i mean why do they give us these things i got up and flopped down again so i was sitting next to him the way a normal person would to practice oliver suggested rightly so besides that i said exasperated they re all out to get me i not oliver said putting an arm around me i cocked an eyebrow at him ten galleons says that ll completely flip around at practice tonight oliver chuckled just ruin a nice moment then i looked around nice moment i repeated nice moment i just went through four p o w l s what nice moment and you why arentyou taking p n e w t s why arentyou completely brain dead oliver shrugged his shoulders lemme guess i said eyebrow still cocked to the max probably looked like it was going to go for a joy fly you spend everyone of your classes dreaming up plays well oliver started it more like writing down rather than kat i had currently resumed burying my head in the pillow i heard oliver sigh stand up and walk away but next thing i knew my jacket was thrown onto my head and he was tugging on my elbow come on he coaxed you need some air i gonna get some at practice right after i attempt to plow through a mountain of homework you know i canthear you through a pillow and a coat so i said unburying myself and putting my coat on oliver already had his on over his school uniform ok where we walking to i donthave a single idea to tell the truth i laughed and linked my arm through his and we walked out the portrait hole how come every time i step on foot outside it rains i asked as it started to drizzle lightly the world just mad that you re upset oliver chuckled besides april showers bring may flowers i laughed i haventheard that in ages my mom used to tell me that then lance got into all this scientific stuff and completely ruined it what did he say he said that may flowers have nothing to do with april showers and that the only reason they come up is because it getting warmer out and it only getting warmer because the northern hemisphere is closer to the sun during then and that because the earth is tilted on it axis i looked up at him really ruined it for me i was only five your head must ve exploded with all that scientific knowledge i looked up at him with his freaking tall 6 foot stature to see that he was smirking oh jeez oliver i smiled crookedly do you know how to make a girl feel good and that why you re smiling he pointed out smirking a million miles and hour i not smiling i said looking forward meaninglessly staring at some random tree trying desperately not to smile but of course oliver saw the corners of my mouth twitch you know you want to smile he said in a sing song voice so no i said biting my lower lip damn my frequency to always smile no i don t yes you do damn sing song voice because you canthelp but smile when i around dontinflate your ego too much ol ha he laughed you re smiling i threw my hand over my mouth and shook my head violently am not yes yo ou arrrr re so i asked putting my hand down smiling and half way to laughing my head off you ve never heard oliver say anything in a sing song voice have you thought so we had somehow ended up at the lake and we sat down under the big oak tree oliver i asked resting against his side resting my head on his chest and his arm around me he was sitting against the trunk of the tree hmm what am i going to do without you next year i craned my neck to look at him he was starring at me wide eyed i dontknow he frowned looking out over the lake he looked back at me i haventthought about it since the end of february guess i was trying to forget i sighed me too well that almost a whole three months away he smiled we donthave to worry about it now no i said turning around to face him guess not but what we really need to worry about is that quidditch cup i smiled slyly leaning into him um hm oliver agreed exaggeratedly smiling lopsided we have to win and for once once in my silly little 16 year old existence i was the kisser and not the kissee let the world know it it was a strong kiss too not like those little tender ones that i still probably couldntmanage without but it was like if we stopped the world would cease to exist he was holding me as tight as possible to him and i was tugging on his hair a little harder than normal god only knows how long that went on for but of course it was freezing and raining i mean god forbid it actually sunny and warm achoo oh god choo not again i moaned breaking off and for all i knew the world could ve fallen into an oblivion but oddly enough it didn t you alright oliver asked from on top of me when did that happen yeah i thi achoo come on oliver chuckled standing up and offering me a hand bu i started sitting up we canthave you getting sick again before the cup can we oliver asked grabbing my hand and practically dragging me up off the cold and now wet ground why is it always raining i mumbled do you want the scientific explanation oliver chuckled lacing his fingers in mine no i sighed contently smiling and resting my head against his arm i guess not ok i hope that this chapter was longer than maybe the past few and once again it was more or less pointless but look there is a slight hint of a plot gasp now please review some more because i know you all love me or i hope hmm 42 chaps in you probably should though hehehe reviews i love em great feed back guys you re the best and i sorry but what a beta i an idiot i know but that one ubberly stumped me sorry and yes i will attempt to have some sort of plot in here it might take me a while to figure it out because my story basically doesnthave one big plot but several small ones along the way so if ya ll bear with me that d be fantastic and i was looking under my log in page thing and there this new thing called a forum what the hell is it kz i ll stop rambling april 16 thursday defense so what are we doing for my birthday hu katie my birthday in twelve days i know you ve been telling me over the past month counting down you just caught me at a bad time i didntget any sleep last night maybe that because you were out with oliver for like two hours it was that long yup now what did you get me i dontknow what you get me you re birthday was in march so get something for my anniversary haha alright when is it the 28th that my birthday wait 21 22 23 sorry bad with numbers give me a sec oh my god it is after classes and some time before practice we have to celebrate our anniversary on a different day i said running into the common room i was met by several weird looks from several different people in several different years you see i had hoped oliver would be sitting on the couch as he normally is right after classes so instead of telling this to oliver i told this too some random second year with a camera who instantly took a picture of me with a huge flash i was seeing spots as i climbed up to the seventh year boy dorm oliver i asked opening the door there was definitely someone in there i just couldnttell who because there was currently a huge red dot over their face with several other different colored dots flying around the room umm h hi the red dot said more like squeaked what wrong with your voice ol i asked the dot which was gradually fading away what wrong with it a rough scottish accent asked from right behind me so of course it was oliver when i turned around i mean how many people are running around the school with a scottish accent ok maybe there this one first year hufflepuff who accent isntnearly as deep but that it besides oliver kat are you ok oliver asked through several dots i could see him cocking an eyebrow at me that kid with the camera took a picture of me i explained who needs that big of a flash i was so still so dizzy that i was swaying back and forth so oliver grabbed my elbow and guided me over to the edge of his bed to sit down and then got me a glass of water how i made it up the stairs the world will never know thanks oliver i thanked after a while when all the dots finally disappeared from my view damn flash who has one that big and bight anyway so what d you need oliver asked from besides me hmm oh yeah we cantcelebrate our anniversary on the 28 i said suddenly forgetting about that stupid flash and that stupid kid who took probably a really stupid looking picture of me with that stupid camera that was stupidly huge and stupidly came equipped with that really stupidly big stupid flash why not he asked i was actually going to remember it this time around i was afraid he was going to get mad at me or at least a little bit irked irked hehehe that such a funny word irk hehehe it lic birthday i explained so i was wondering if we could do something the day after or something you dontmind do you oliver smiled warmly of course not but am going to have to find her a gift i smiled and gave him a hug that makes two of us thanks oliver for what he asked as we went down to the common room i shrugged my shoulders for being an all around good guy and being so sweet oliver was about to answer when percy blew by past us from behind on the stairs threw me off balance and pretty much took oliver with me you see at the same time oliver reached out to stop me from falling i grabbed the collar of his robes which sent us flying down the stairs you all right oliver asked sprawled out on the floor next to me ugh i mumbled rolling over onto my stomach i think so what was that all about percival fred said him and george standing over us right prick he is george agreed offering me a hand as fred gave on to oliver reckon he has a crush on little kates over here what that was me and oliver oliver in more of disbelief and me in pure shoot me down and kill me the biggest prick in the whole castle likes me likes me well it makes sense ange said as she and lic came over from the portrait hole i mean he practically stalks you lic added i felt all the color drain from my face really please god in heaven smite me oh mighty smiter no fred said it more of a why doesn t she ever notice me type of thing he a prick me and oliver again i kinda have to notice him when he taking house points away from me i pointed out and always around when you re in the hospital wing ange added as i shuddered at my least favorite part about hogwarts telling your mom stuff that didnthappen that was fred trying to get a date out of you lic added and yelling at you for no good reason george put in i think that us dear brother fred pointed out hmmm george said with a pondering look on his face i think you just might be right he turned to me so what are you going to do about it i looked around the room and registered three things 1 percy was sitting in one of the armchairs by the fire 2 mcgonagall just taught us how to transform books into cream pies 3 there were millions of books lying around give me three seconds i said taking out my wand 3 2 1 bam bell percy screamed whipping pie off of his face what was that for thirty points from gr five more pies came flying across the room straight into his face as i walked away and caught a bit of a bright flash out of the corner of my eye i can see the school news headline now giant prick finally brought down to shame by felow housemates and laughed at by all oh god heaven that would be after practice i still cantbelieve you did that fred laughed i mean it was brilliant you all did it too though i pointed out but that was from across the room ange said no one would dare do it straight to his face it was nothing really gu will you all stop chit chatting and get back to practice oliver howled at us as he came streaking down the field completely red in the face i dontcare that percy a prick and i dontcare that he got five pies on the face but what i do care is that we win the cup we all chorused and it your last year to win you ll never get another chance at it even though there the fact that you re going to get signed on for your favorite team puddlemere united but of course that doesntmatter because this year we have to win the quidditch cup we finished in chorus oliver didntknow what to say i mean by the way the vein on his neck was practically doing the conga it was obvious we hit the nail on the head and therefore he couldntthink of anything else to say but that right ha fred said we re right now get to practice or i swear to god i ll scalp your red head fred weasely so know we re indians fred ventured move it aye aye mon capitan fred said saluting with his twin before streaking down the field as me ange and lic started cracking up hysterically i was laughing at the vein on oliver neck doing the tango but they were probably laughing at the twins oliver turned to us completely red in the face eyes bugging out and his mouth was pursed so much he looked like mcgonagall on too much coffee let not forget to add the crazy wind blown hair this made me laugh even harder and i almost fell off my broom so did lic and ange what is so funny oliver shouted as we tried to steady ourselves helping each other this is practice practice isntsupposed to be fun or or or a laugh fest now get down the field and start practicing we chorused before heading down the field that right more or less practice was hell and i had perfect legal rights to kill him i mean ki i i ll him like with my bare hands kill or whack him over the head with a broom stick kill or so many different ways i could kill him but too worked up to think kill i was pondering the different ways i could get him back when i realized harry was talking to me as we were waiting for the stairs to change oliver for once used his head and decided to hang back a bit making sure i get hit in the back by a bludger and making me do 200 push ups isntexactly the right way to get me into a good mood smart boy so i took you re advice katie harry said as the stairs finally decided to change me and lic had started yelling at them really i asked suddenly the urge to beat oliver like he was a pi ata started to leave my system what happened well harry started scratching his arm hermione blushed and ron ears went red just like the twins i rejoiced i told you i was right i said turning to everyone else yeah but then in potions ron wouldnthelp me until i admitted i was wrong and then in divination hermione predicted that i would spend the rest of my life as a book sitting on a dusty shelf for the rest of my life and i would be a boring book too oh my face dropped well i can tell you where you went wrong mate george said putting an arm across harry shoulders number 1 you asked katie for advice hey number 2 fred said pushing me to the side to put his arm around harry shoulders as well why on the name of merlin beard would you ask ron for help in potions of all things they chorused and finally number 3 george said next time you get on that firebolt of yours fred continued for his twin i hate it when they do that it a freaky twin thing fly far far away they chorused again i really hate it when they do that i think the twins are right about not taking your advice katie harry said as we finally came through the portrait hole harry i said pretending not to be offended and really sweet if we are like yonger brother and older sister that gives me perfectly good rights to beat you with a large and very heavy stick run mate george whispered harry practically bolted up the stairs to the boys dorm and he off april 20 monday charms maybe i dontknow because i cantthink because oliver ran me into the ground cracked my back senseless and almost had me crash three times all before 7 am let me tell you about my day up to now in second period kat kat wake up some one whispered in a harsh scottish accent wonder who that could be no oooo i groaned rolling onto my stomach from my side kat damn it just be stern at five in the morning why dontya but i dontwant to get up mom just five more minutes i pulled the covers around my shoulders up and over my head and pillow because that was going to work not two seconds after that oliver ripped the covers off my bed and left me curled up in a ball in my boxer pajama shorts red tee and bare feet absolutely freezing i going to give you three seconds to put my covers back right back where you found them i said my eyes still closed ka at one we have practice two katherine ann bell three what in this is going to sound very very weird but somehow i managed to spring from my curled up position straight onto oliver back weird i know the mattress must ve helped why are girls so cranky in the morning oliver asked as he tried to fend me off good luck with that buddy because certain freaking kilt wearing son of a bitch captain decided to wake me up at i glanced at the clock 5 am what is going on in that head of yous i asked tugging particularly hard on a lock of his brown hair quidditch he laughed god only knows how he could ve possibly laughed at a time like this oliver i groaned as he suddenly collapsed on my empty bed me squashed somewhere underneath him oliver wood yes katherine bell he smiled down at me turning over can i help you yes i answered with a hint of plea let me sleep past 6 just this once so maybe there was more than a hint of plea ummm oliver said as if he was thinking with a lopsided smile then he gave me a long kiss i hate him damn scottish boy no he said once he was done then he got up and walked out the door wake the two of them up and get down to the pitch in 15 minutes he called back over his shoulder 20 i called back sitting up 15 20 damn damn damn scottish boy damn 18 deal what a nice scottish boy what a nice scottish boy he waking me up at five in the morning what do i mean nice i looked at my fellow chasers how the hell they slept through all of that i will never know i would like to know what happened to the good ol days i said having just finished practically dragging my two best friends one cursing under their breath and the other cursing to the high heavens when i got woken up nice and gently what happened i demanded from oliver poking mr high and mighty mr i think it would be fun to run my team ragged before 6 am so i m going to try it in the chest i would also like to know what happened when dawn practices wasnta word you mean words oliver corrected half smiling with an eyebrow cocked what ever fucking idoit why the hell are we out on the fucking pitch so fucking early in the morning when it so fucking cold out stupid ass dumb ass so damn early why in hell going to kill him ange open your eyes i said bluntly she was facing the wrong way then i decided to take a leaf out of lic book it so damn cold out here wood i going to freeze my fingers off and then when i cantdamn play well enough you re just going to have to deal quite done now oliver smiled slightly no stop smiling damn it it making it very hard to keep yelling at you then i more or less had to prop my self up on my broom because there went all my energy bell why cantyou get this play right because you want me and lic to fly around ange five million times at the speed of light and without crashing and it physically impossible do it fine but when we finally do it it ll all be in your face what was that just guard the hoops already we re going to switch it up so pay attention you can tell what a nice loving relationship we have ok so this play is like beyond hard i mean it an ultra super nova mega on a hardness scale yeah that hard it beats the one where i have to be chucked through the hoops and it top secrect so we canteven complain about it outside the pitch and according to oliver even then it not safe i love him but i going to have to deflate his sense of quidditch obsession or i would if it wasntphysically impossible ok back to the ultra super nova mega hard play i ll explain it so lic starts off with the ball purposely drops it then the three of us dive to catch it but ange is the one who is supposed to now bear with me here this is where the ultra super nova hard part comes in so ange takes it down the field right not hard except me and lic are supposed to barrel roll around her in tight little rolls so we barely miss her shoulders and so it looks like a tornado then somehow me and ange are supposed to change places then we all pretend to be passing the quaffle to each other and then once we reach the penalty line we break off and go to separate goal post all pf us pretending like we re going to shoot ange going towards the middle lic to the left and me towards the right one and i supposed to put the quaffle in ultra super nova mega fun right well it depends who you ask ask oliver and he ll say it the best thing ever ask any of the chasers and it the closest thing to hell so after the 22nd time we were finally getting the barrel rolls right ye ah ange whooped as me and lic kept barrel rolling around her ok when i whistle i said as we made our way down the field half way mark well switch got it sounds like a plan two seconds latter i let out a soft low whistle and ange and i swapped places she barrel rolled at the perfect time and i was only two inches away from her knees and a complete disaster well that what oliver wanted so then we all pretended to be passing it around and i got the great honor of making the sound effects by slapping my hand on the quaffle ok penalty line break i reminded them as we got nearer ready go so we all broke off and i must say it was a beautiful thing seeing oliver having no idea where the quaffle was but the damn scottish boy barely saved it by his finger tips argh i cried pretending to almost fall off my broom but catching myself at the last second both upset and pleased at the same time i was so close oliver came over to me laughing and slapped me on the shoulder so hard that i almost did fall off my broom for real great job girls he said putting an arm around me and holding me so close to him that i couldntbreath oliver air please sorry kat he loosened his grip that was perfect would ve been better if you hadntsaved it i mumbled oliver just chuckled and ruffled up my hair what is this beat up katie day nice one kates fred said slapping me on the back and george joined in too oh please i laughed get out of here and save some congratulating for your girlfriends i motioned to ange and lic who were giving each other high fives will do george laughed as he and his twin headed to their girlfriends oliver was just hovering around watching harry and the twins congratulate ange and lic the quaffle still in his hand so i asked snatching the quaffle out of his hand and hovering next to him does this mean no dawn practices for the rest of my life no oliver laughed making a wild grab for the quaffle but missed so are we going to end practice before breakfast i asked looking at my watch it almost a quarter to seven and i think with the great practice we had and all we deserve a good meal alright he chuckled but you have to bring in the crate only if you help i bargained fair enough and you get the bludgers i laughed flying off before he could say otherwise why do i always get stuck getting the bludgers oliver asked as he wrestled one from the ground as i laughed it not funny he pointed out as it almost slipped away but caught it at the last second you know it is i laughed holding the crate open ready to lock the bludger in once oliver got it under control ugh oliver sighed sitting down on the grass resting his back on the crate as i locked the last bludger in i locked the crate and sat down next to him you know i think no more dawn practices would be a brilliant idea ka at he moaned think about it i said not only did i have to go through an exhausting two hour practice but now i have to go through the whole day too kat and i have p o w l s and you have p n e w t s it going to help everyone katherine ann bell oliver wood you are so stubborn ditto he laughed before standing up help me with the crate i asked a big strong guy like you need my help yes kat he chuckled a big strong guy like me needs your unrelenting strength and help you know sarcasm my thing bell fine i mumbled getting up and helping him carry the crate back in but i think pulling off a ultra super nova mega hard play and running it exempts me from any other strenuous activity just carry the crate he chuckled no i serious he just kept chuckling and since he was carrying the trunk ahead of me i grabbed a chunk of grass and chucked it at the back of his head oh crap here come flitwick damn damn damn da ok i hope you all enjoyed that little bit was the chap long enough i hope so because my fingers are freezing up here on the north shore of long island and i canttype any more plus i have a math and spanish test tomorrow spanish commands gah somebody shoot me now so if i dontupdate before the holidays dontexpect one until after new year s i sorry but i going away traveling on christmas day again i hate spending it at the airport gah so i sorry everybody so i hope you all have a very merry christmas

new mails i smile and think yes reviews it makes my day ten times more bearable honest and oh my god my vacation was on the border line of good and bad the whole time you see we went to orlando and did all those theme parks but my brothers forgot their suitcase our rental car broke down and the stupid people just decided not to pack our luggage for the ride home that and my freaking sinuses wouldntleave me alone so now that i home i d figure i give you all a lil chapter oh by the way i know i didntwrite about the twins birthday somewhere in november but for my sake let pretend i did ok ok happy new year april 20 monday end of charms and a continuous of the last entry because shorty came over during the middle of it and made me demonstrate a cheering charm damn cheering charms and yes shorty does equal professor flitwick incase anybody wasnttoo sure on that one ok where was i oh yes throwing a piece of grass at my dear captain head kat he chuckled over his shoulder and brushing the dirt off the back of his head as we continued to walk towards the cupboard to put the crate away and at that precise second he let go with that hand the other slipped and then i accidentally let go and the crate fell directly onto my little foot ok so i a size ten and me feet arentexactly little but who cares that thing is heavy owwwwwww i howled pulling my foot out holding it and jumping up and down what a sight what wrong oliver asked shocked and worried that i did some serious harm to myself actually one it was kinda serious and two it was partially his fault you dropped the crate i said jumping up and down oliver just sighed and crap why does flitwick always mosey on over to where i sitting divination ok now that i have finally found a class where i know a teacher wontcome five yards near me treawely is always going on about how fred and george are both going to suffer a terrible death yes she does it to every year and yes the twins are basking in the spotlight always wondering about the specific detail baiting her on i ll finally finish this stupid entry gah what does a person have to do to finish up something i ll tell ya what getting your foot killed locked in a broom closet missing breakfast and still having to go to all your classes after a two hour physically killing dawn practice and running on zero sleep did i mention the fact that i currently sitting in my quidditch robes what a day and it only third period slam i stood up straight in the now pitch black broom closet that wouldntbe the door slamming would it oliver err you see after i managed to regain the walking capacity and i could begin to feel my toes we continued to bring the crate back in the cupboard but before i tell you the rest i got to give you a little background information now you cannot open the broom closet from the inside it physically impossible and to put the crate in you have to carry it all the way to the back or else it just wontfit so normally we put a rock or a stick in the way so the door doesntclose except this time it did oliver yes you did put the rock in the way right of course i did then why are we sitting in the dark because the door closed thank you captain obvious anytime oliver then i heard someone crackle outside the door try and get out of that one you ratty lions flint i screamed you see i carried the crate in first so i pretty much climbed over the crate and nearly push oliver over so i could scream at the prick outside the door you flithy no good dead beat ugly son of a bitch prick open this door right now or i swear to god i will castrate you without the second i get out of here bloody prick never answered i think you scared him away kat oliver said next to me in the dark after a few seconds argh i cried falling back and sitting on the crate how are we going to get out of here we re not oliver said sitting next to me peachy oliver how long has it been i asked god knows how long later i dontknow i cantsee my watch probably an hour i started banging my head against the wall behind me but then caught the back of my head damn keeper reflexes can even see in the dark damn it you re going to hurt yourself damn it i could even see him smile in the dark without really seeing but i saw it hmm i think that was the point i said standing up and the kicking the door open up damn it i heard oliver chuckle from right behind me so i did the sensible thing and turned around on my heel and did a complete face plant right into his chest you see the thing i didnthear was him stand up how the hell do you have hard muscles from sitting on a broom all day everyday i asked slowly putting a hand over my stunned face how now just to clear things up so there no confusion oliver has a quidditch players build muscles which is like the equivalent to a soccer players or swimmers build at least according to angelina but she practically a genius so she must be right so therefore there no random muscles just sticking out all over the place like once again according to angelina like a football player or body builder i think it was but how do you build bodies muggles can be so weird oliver chuckled and pulled me into a hug and i rested my head in the spot that just killed my nose how are you laughing i felt him shrug his shoulders and kiss me on my head so um cantyou bust down the door or something i asked tracing my hand up his arm ok muscled arm i mean how does he get them from sitting on a broom is there some trade secret i dontknow about oliver chuckled i dontknow do you have a wand on you er back in my locker i admitted but i sure you could mangae it like in those muggle movies have you seen the lock on the door outside yes ok so the freaking lock was huge who would want to steal school brooms anyway i muttered who gets a four key lock anyway for a stupid broom closet where there only three sharp arrows and the ball crate i mean all the good brooms are kept in the team locker rooms it insane you ran that play flawlessly by the way oliver said after a while i looked up at him or what i hoped was him because i couldntsee past my nose well that because i have a great captain who thankfully drills it into my head every two seconds i said laying the sarcasm on real thick so there would be no way he could miss it glad i could be of service he said right before he pressed his lips against mine when the hell did he get so close now not only am i the kissee but now i the kissee who can t freaking see a thing and just when i was starting to get over the fact that i will always be the kissee with this guy and was starting to enjoy this happy little moment mcgonagall open the closet door and therefore i practically jumped three feet away from oliver or i would ve if the wall wasntonly a foot behind me causing me to kill my back mental note katie bell does not to good in small places where she often hurts herself continuously now i know why you two werentat breakfast she said her lips pursed go to second period this second we nodded our heads and i filed out behind oliver as we headed back to the locker rooms i didntmean after you got changed she said and we stopped in our tracks since you ve been out here since five this morning i had the liberty of getting them was that sarcasm they re in the entrance way get them and get to class this would ve never happened if dawn practices wasnta word i said as we started to climb the first set of stairs in our scarlet robes i am going to kill flint i added stuffing my pads into my bag broom slung over my shoulder the twins are never going to let me live this down at that moment my stomach let out a very very katie why on god s green earth haven t you feed me yet growl and i starving it could be worse oliver pointed out taking off his gloves how i asked exasperatedly we could still be stuck in there snape could ve found us instead we could ve gotten detention meaning we couldnthave practice he said counting off his fingers because not having practice is such a shame i mumbled that would mean more dawn practices he pointed out i looked at him smiling slightly i guess it could ve been worse then he put an arm around my waist i know it could ve been worse by then we reached the sixth floor and i had d a d a peachy well i said looking at my classroom door at least lupin wontkill me and i did miss charms lucky you oliver laughed that where i ve got to go have fun with that i smiled i will he said before giving me a kiss and going up the next flight of stairs i turned to my classroom door and took a deep breath in my scarlet robes broomstick in my hand i would never be able to live that down more or less no kidding lic i dontunderstand why treawely is always with the twins jealous that she taking up time with your boyfriend that means that she with george too damn her april 28 tuesday er around midnight so the plan is to kidnap lic and bring her to the three broomsticks i asked fred during herbology yup he said alls you have to do is half of it sounds easy i said sarcastically none of the twins plans were exactly easy no it is george is going to pretend he wants to have a good snog and then you and ange do that leg lock hex that makes her go as stiff as a board blind fold her and put spell o tape over her mouth that half me and george and oliver are going to carry her she half a twig it not like that hard ok so maybe it more like of the plan hehehe i still cantbelieve i got kidnapped lic squealed as we finally undid all the hexes at our favorite table in the three broomsticks right after dinner believe it george said giving her a sloppy kiss as we all set off party poppers they re a cute couple i said to oliver as i smashed a sombrero on his head what he asked putting a pirate hat with feathers on my head and we re not no ange said before i could answer you two make me gag every second you two are within two feet of each other hey i was just kidding she laughed as i punched her shoulder then she bounded away laughing in her antlered hat towards fred who somehow managed to get a large ring leaders hat again i ll go get the butterbeers oliver laughed as long as you re treating fred called ok lic said a few rounds of butterbeers and an hour later where are my gifts i saw oliver mentally kick himself hehehe yes i physic yeah after a good five years i know when he going to forget things lucky him i added his name at the bottom of the card in his handwriting the best i could now i love giving out gifts you should see me at christmas i bound around the house singing christmas carols laughing like an idiot especially when i can dish out gifts so it only expected that i completely overboard with wrapping things katie how much tissue paper is in this bag lic asked as she attempted to find her gift among the green mint periwinkle purple and light pink tissue paper in the sparkly gift bag katie she cried as she finally then found the wrapped gift how many trees are you going to kill in one gift just rip it open already i laughed jeez i hate it when people unfold the paper and save the freaking tape when i get a gift i make it fun and everyone around thinks a tornado just blew through katie she laughed as she found a velvet box in the wrapped box i told you i was psycho about wrapping things i told you open it lic i couldnttake it anymore she was taking forever katie it beautiful she gasped as she opened the small velvet box is it a wedding ring fred asked from behind me no i laughed as my elbow found his stomach rather painfully for him that is actually i got her this pretty bracelet i was going to get her a necklace but george told me he was going to get her one and sweet boyfriend pretty sometimes beats some times really really edgy life long friend sometimes and it was one of those times where i dropped the stubbornness so any way the bracelet me and oliver got her was a silver chain it really a very pretty sterling silver chain with one of those really cool why doesn t my bracelet have that patterns and then there this little charm of her patronus a a reindeer she squealed yes last semester we learned about them and me lic ange and the twins wanted to find what ours were so we spent weeks practicing them at random times fred tried to send his a grizzly bear with george a grizzly bear surprising hu on oliver when he set up two dawn practices in a row katie i love it she beamed almost breaking me in half in a bear hug it from oliver too i managed to choke out didntyou see the card she let go of me to read the card and thanked oliver when she saw his addition to the card wishing her a happy 16th birthday so we only get one present from the both of you fred asked he shook his head this wontdo one gift from two people i wontallow it it was definitely expensive though lic said as george did the clasp up for her and both me and oliver elbowed fred poor kid going to have one bruised up stomach by tomorrow and so i watched as everyone dished out their gifts for lic ange got her some of her favorite perfume which she was moaning that she was running out of fred got her a coupon for a lifetime supply of any of him and his twins pranking objects and promised never to use her as a tester he claimed that the coupon would be more than life it self when he and george opened up there soon to be in two years time joke shop george told her that he accidentally left her gift up in his dorm and he d give it to her the second they got back apparently lic was the only one who didntrealize that meant a gift and that none of us would be going any where near that dorm for at least 45 minutes which also meant we had to guard that door eventually we left the three broomsticks around three hours later at nine but what a sight we must ve looked i mean look at all our hats lic was wearing this big old sun hat george was wearing this zorro hat with one of those roses sticking out fred was in a ring leader hat that was two feet taller than the normal size oliver was in a sombrero and i was wearing a very feathery pirate hat not to mention angelina hat she looked like a freaking deer with the antlers sticking out of that bowler hat that looked strangely similar to fudge s hey oliver smiled as he lightly bumped into me as an antlered ange left me to go walk arm in arm with the ring leader hey your self mr sombrero i laughed flicking one of the beads that decorated the very large brim of his hat bumping back into him you know you love it he said before giving me an eskimo kiss so the sombrero covered both our heads and the beads swished back and forth against each other oh yes i laughed a scottish man in a sombrero is exactly what i was looking for and sarcasm is exactly what i was looking for he rebutted giving me a lopsided smile what can i say i smiled shrugging my shoulders i have a knack for that oliver laughed now all i need is a stripped poncho and all you need is an eye patch and maybe a hook and how would i play quidditch dear captain i smiled good point he said rubbing his chin we ll definitely have to go for the peg leg what did the twins slip in your drink i laughed it wasntus both the twins called from in front of us one arm in arm with ange and the other with lic by the way oliver said slipping an arm around my waist thanks for covering for me with the gift i cantbelieve i forgot i waved it off with my hand i knew you would forget with all the quidditch more quidditch five practices a week isntenough and dawn practices are the best thing ever invented not to mention we have to win that cup every two seconds it was pretty predictable you would forget oliver chuckled slightly as he scratched the back of his head tilting the sombrero forward slightly thanks he said again as he kissed my temple i think i laughed as we followed the two couples in front of us back up to honeydukes and thankfully the return trip wasntanything like the one from my birthday party no wet shoes oh and lic really liked her gift i mean really like her gift the one besides the beautiful necklace george got her catch my drift hu hu ok i hope you all liked this little chapter my me ok now it like midnight and i really wanted to get this up and i was supposed to be asleep ages ago guys just because i dontnag you about

you and fred what does that mean i dontknow what does it mean ange you two are off your rocker uh hu yup hey if lic doesntwant to tell us i ll just have to pry it out of her april 30 thursday 3 06 when i really supposed to be doing my homework before practice but right now i just dontfeel like doing it what going on lic asked as she came into the dorm last night at around 10 ange was pointing her wand which was charmed with the lumos spell in her face what are you doing holding her hands in front of her eyes sit i said as if i was talking to a dog pointing to one of the chairs sorry lic but dontworry if you ever read this i think that you are a very adorable dog where were you on the night of march 14 i demanded once she was seated celebrating your birthday lic said tentatively with you remember who asking the questions here ange sighed behind me still shining the charm in alicia eyes over my right shoulder and lic rolled her eyes dontroll your eyes at me miss you really cantdo this whole interrogating thing can you ange asked i opened my mouth to say something but i couldntreally think of something that what i thought it because i always the one being interrogated i pointed out finally coming up with a reason that because you and oliver are out of control she said passing her wand over to me and turning into the interrogator not as out of control as you and fred i mumbled turning into the bright light that blinds the bad guys in interrogations like these no ange said not as out of control as lic and george she corrected way to get things back on track imagine her as a lawyer i d be scared what does that mean lic asked finally speaking up a hour and a half ange asked an eyebrow cocked very scared we just talked lic said meekly twiddling her thumbs katie ange asked me how often do you an oliver talk a lot more than you and fred i answered without missing a beat our lips arentalways glued toget katie i let out a little laugh ange sighed at me before getting back to lic like i was saying what happened lic sighed giving in if i tell you promise not to tell anyone we both nodded and you wontwrite it in that crazy notebook of yours katie damn that was the ultimate loop hole promise promise i said promise already promise i repeated making an x over my heart and then she told us and i cantwrite what happened because of that damn loop hole she completely collapsed but for all you perverted people out there they didntdo that comprende good april 31 friday 1 am so i guess it officially may 1st bell damn damn damn snape found out that i gonna help the twins put pink hair dye in his shampoo sunday night so it lasts the week damn damn damn i closed my eyes and hunched over my books on my favorite table in the library right before dinner my back was to the door and the table was in the back corner maybe snape wouldntsee me katherine ann bell maybe i should just hide under the table kat i turned around completely confused the only person that ever calls me kat was oliver what are you doing he asked sitting down next to me oh by the way i was still in my uniform but he was wearing his casual clothes you know jeans and a denim jacket homework i said an eyebrow cocked you know when you have o w l coming up the fierce amount of homework teachers give you to prepare you you know homework oliver laughed i was confused why are you in a good mood i asked in my very confused state right after we hit the under 20 days until the final marker you go even more psychotic about quidditch you never laugh and all you do is go around telling us how to eat and making sure we re constantly thinking about the up coming match i paused what did the twins put in your drink nothing oliver said grabbing my hand and standing up c mon i looked at my books err two foot essay due monday and practices through out the weekend when am i going to get it done later oliver said taking out his wand and with a flick of his wrist all my books and papers closed organized and found a place in my bag not to mention my three stubby quills alright i groaned standing up as he kicked my bag under the table where are we going and what about my bag i asked as he started to drag me out of the library who would want text books anyway he said as we continued to walk some of your plays are in there we ll go to the common room first then he said quickly turning around grabbing my bag and walking like the speed of light back to the common room dragging me all the way yeah like oliver would ever leave his brilliant plays out in the open for slytherins to steal you ll need your coat too oliver said as i came down from my dorm putting my bag away stopping on the second step from the bottom why do i need my coat i asked looking outside it beautiful out we ll be gone late why why what oh my god he doing this on purpose why are we going to be out late i sighed because arentwe celebrating our anniversary today he asked i slapped my forehead i ll be right back and he thought i forgot yeah yeah he did but little did he know i had the greatest ever i mean the greatest gift of all time e v e r so maybe i forgot we were celebrating today but i remembered a gift the greatest gift ever ok i said finally coming down in my infamous white crew neck sweater and one of ange denim jackets yes the best gift ever in the inside pocket where to c mon oliver said grabbing my hand and dragging me out the portrait door we re going to be late for what i asked completely confused for the umpteenth time today i made reservations i stopped short digging my heels into the marble on the fifth floor what oliver asked turning around confused you made reservations you made reservations you yes oliver chuckled i made reservations i made reservations me he started walking but i kept digging my feet into the marble what i am i dressed alright i asked an eyebrow cocked and still confused if you made reservations then it bound to be a very fancy place because this is a once in a life time thing you look fine oliver chuckled before giving me a quick kiss and continued to drag me to the statue of the one eyed witch on the third floor you know the one the one with a humped back it in hogsmeade i asked a little bit outside of hogsmeade he said turning around and placing his thumb and index finger half an inch apart so do we have someone to cover for us i asked as he opened up the passage in the statue hump yup oliver said his back towards me as he groped around for something in the statue you re not feeling so great and i at the pitch well that believable enough i laughed oliver sent me a look jokingly how are we getting to this place were you made reservations for once in your life at that second oliver pulled his broomstick out of the statue we re flying i asked just to clarify oliver shrugged his shoulders can you think of a better way slide along appartation i offered smiling you do have your license well i didntthink about that he shook it off besides he said standing aside so i could climb into the statue first flying more fun i still sore from yesterday practice i laughed as i climbed down him following me shortly after so it depends who you ask well oliver said as we walked along the very short and very small yet what we knew to be a very long passage somebody who on the quidditch team talking to their captain going to the final which they ll win i quickly turned around and tapped on his head twice what was that for oliver asked rubbing to top of his head knock on wood i laughed pun of the century i just crack myself up but how dare he jinx us oliver chuckled before giving me a kiss but i had to back away what now oliver asked 5 3 foot tall passage i 5 7 and your not exactly any shorter at 6 i laughed lightly all hunched over good point oliver said hunched over even more than me ahhh it pays to be short i said as we continued along the passage because 5 7 is real short so your finally getting the hang of sarcasm then hu what can i say oliver chuckled you rubbed off on me he said tugging a bit of my hair lightly too true i agreed over my shoulder we ve only had one dawn practice all week i dontthink i am ever going to go that way again i said after we had made our way up to the streets of hogsmeade where i could finally stand up straight so where exactly are we going i asked oliver to the right of me you ll see he said grabbing my hand and half walking quickly down the street for the third time today i had to kill my heels by digging them into whatever type of surface oliver decided to drag me across kat he pleaded yeah that right pleaded we re going be late what wrong i sick of being dragged all over the country without knowing where we re going and why you made reservations i smiled so he knew i was mad at him just curious but your going to ruin the surprise if i tell you and if we re late he pointed out giving a small tug on my hand oh all right i sighed good he smiled mounting his broom but i hate surprises i pointed out as i climbed on behind him wrapping my arms around his waist and resting my head on his back ever since the twins pt jam in my new socks that one time oliver chuckled as we finally started getting to this place faster than a bent over ouch my back walking pace oliver you know this is a muggle town right i asked as we stood in small alley while many what are they called ron and harry flew one into the whomping willow last year oh yeah cars cars speed home i know he said as he placed an invisibility charm on his broom and placed it next to one of the dumpsters know before you go physco because oliver wood would never would leave his broom in the open even if it was invisible on the ride over i found out that it wasntexactly his broom but one of the schools brooms so there so where are we going i asked as he grabbed my hand and firmly guided me down the street one of those places where muggles always go to see a movie what are they called he asked me movie theaters i asked hoping that was what he meant i had taken muggle studies last year worst mistake of my life i advise dropping it as soon as possible along with history of magic yeah that it oliver smiled now where did percy say it was oh yeah this way he said before taking a quick right at the corner percy i asked you asked percy for directions percy not really oliver laughed he was mumbling about some place penelope clearwater said she went with one of her ex s did you know they were back together oh really i asked as i noticed oliver pace quickened and i was barely able to hold his hand as he plowed two full strides ahead of me two full oliver strides that like three of mine have you noticed that this boy is six feet tall uh hu oliver said looking over his shoulder last week saw that one coming i said as i jogged to catch up that right jogged i had to jog on a date on an anniversary jogged well that oliver wood for you oliver chuckled probably for the better i said now taking extra long and fast strides just to stay neck and neck with him i was kind of sick of him stalking me who wouldntbe oliver chuckled are we almost there yet i asked three blocks and 15 minutes later almost i promise he said reassuringly as i panted next to him in a sprinting attempt to keep up it should be right down here we turned around one more bend and there right in front of me was a old classic movie theater i read off of the sign above the entrance yup oliver said proudly c mon and next i was being dragged into the place 11 what dollars kat oliver said bending down and whispering in my ear what in merlin name is a dolpher it a dollar i corrected in a whisper you know muggle money oh do you have any muggle money no oh that bad i laughed lightly for a second or two i mean who knew oliver wood could get himself into so much of a pickle on a date i just thought it was really funny considering the fact that he had about five girlfriends last year who eventually broke up with him because he already married to quidditch c mon it funny i got it i said you see as oliver was talking to the many pimpled teen who was supposed to be getting our huge tube of popcorn and soda i was fishing around the pockets in ange jacket and guess what i found lepricon gold we had just practiced using nifflers in care of magical creatures and we played around with them using the fake gold so with my fake gold in hand i went up to the pimpled teen behind the crash regibster and put on the weirdest accent i could come up with a million apologies i managed in a some what arabic some what western and somewhat other weird accent but we re visiting from shamalamadingdong and this is de only muney we ave i said placing the lepricons gold on the counter the pimple puss eyes grew to the size of a million suns will that do the kid just nodded as he forked over our tickets and popcorn and soda so are you going to tell me where you came up with a country called shamalamadingdong oliver asked as we found our seats in the theater fred and george were goofing off one day at practice and fred called george the king of this was at practice wasntit shamalamadingdong and so at practice i just thought i d use it and kat i know you re a terrible liar and your just ignoring me to avoid the question and i asked after a while he caught me damn it so it was at practice wasntit oliver asked lowering his voice after he realized how many muggles were staring at him but there was only like six other people were in here so what movie is this i asked taking the large soda we were sharing out of his hands kaa at no further questions i concluded taking a sip of the coke waiting desperately for the previews to end and the movie to begin and to my luck my luck that always goes missing when i need it the most actually found me and the movie started if you re not going to answer oliver said softly as the words casa blanca came up on the black and white screen i just going to take that as a yes no give me some soda trade me for the popcorn then fair enough so when do you think they re gonna come up for air i asked oliver as the guy said bye to the girl who was going onto the plane and i popped some popcorn into my mouth but they re talking oliver said obviously talking about the couple on the screen whie i was talking about the couple two or three rows ahead of us snogging like the world was going to cave in any second no i laughed lightly them i said nodding my head to the couple i was talking about it been like ten minutes oh oliver chuckled at that point i got the greatest idea since the invention of quidditch even though i was going to come off looking like a spoiled muggle two year old but who really cares so either way i grabbed a hand full of popcorn out of the bin oliver was holding and one by one i threw popcorn at there head switching back and forth between them muggle boy muggle girl muggle boy muggle girl muggle boy wondering what is going on muggle girl getting slightly irritated muggle boy still rather confused muggle girl getting very annoyed muggle boy giving me some weird looks muggle girl yelling at me oliver joining in on the fun muggle girl calling for security muggle boy pulling something out of his jacket me and oliver bolting out of the theater hey you from schamalamadingdong that money s not worth anyhting get i had never run so fast and laughing so hard in all my life that was hilarious i laughed panted in hogsmeade yeah oliver had apparated a block away from the movie theater and brought us back to main street in hogsmeade and i of course was there for the slide along what did you expect me to fly back well maybe i would ve if it was a real broom and not a freaking ancient school broom but that beside the point how was that funny oliver chuckled as we started walking back to honeydukes you re chuckling i laughed your point keep laughing it up buddy i warned you just might not get the greatest gift ever well when you put it that way uh oh uh oh what i asked as we came in front of a closed honeydukes yeah that right closed honeydukes it closed i asked it barely ten i cried looking at my watch oh now i see soooooooooo exactly how are we getting back into the castle i asked half an hour later as we trudged up the hill back to hogwarts i going to kill the guy that had the grand idea of building a castle on this huge hilly cliffy thingy it s sitting on we re not going the same way we did on my birthday are we never again in a million years alleluia yeah god forbid the window was open on my birthday god forbid i muttered as oliver slid open the window lee was supposed to open the night of my birthday well let just be happy it open now oliver chuckled as he climbed through and offered me a hand up deal i smiled in the dark as i took his hand and climbed through what was that noise was that filch i think i hear that damn cat peeves i think he after us oliver did you hear that calm down kat he said smiling or atleast what i hoped was a smile you see we were on the fifth floor by then and every now and then i would freak out and think filch was about to catch us or peeves was after me i dontknow why well maybe i do since the school makes a bunch of really really really freaky noises at midnight especially when it s really really really windy out and you could be caught any second and put in detention for the final and have my freaking scottish kilt wearing son of a bitch captain over here kill you three times over you would be bugging out too where are we i asked as we traveled down the same secret passage we ve been walking in for the past half hour i dontrecognize this place we re on the sixth floor he said reassuringly i though we were just on the fifth we took that flight of stairs back there remember oh yeah soooooo are we going to make a spring to the portrait or what i asked five minutes later we finally made it to the seventh floor right down the hall from the fat lady peeking our heads out from behind the tapestry i guess so oliver said craning his neck to look farther we cantget any closer than this i ll go see if filch is around oliver i cried in a whisper as he clambered out from behind the tapestry and started to walk half way down the hall two seconds later he motioned me out from my safe hiding spot and i pretty much sprinted to the portrait hole when neville i asked as i stepped on something katie he whispered obviously happy to see me why are you sleeping out here i asked shocked why anybody would prefer to sleep outside the tower on a cold marble floor instead of inside a nice warm bed is beyond me i forgot the password he whispered and these trolls are scaring me he whispered even more softly oh i looked up at the trolls that have been guarding the fat lady ever since black most recent break in i see at this oliver ran over obviously confused why i still wasntin the tower and why neville was in his pajamas what going on he asked forget it i said walking up the sleeping fat lady hey i whispered loudly wake up and let me in password witherwings now let me in hu the fat lady yawned what do you want her voice getting a little edgy as she realized it was me who woke her up she out to get me that one witherwings the three of us whispered loudly alright alright she yawned opening up well that sounded weird thanks neville muttered climbing the stairs to his dorm so what was that all about oliver asked i dontknow a very prickish voice said what was that all about holy fudge i muttered realizing that the prish voice belonged to none other than percival just shut up where were you two he asked getting up out of the arm chair he was sitting in and walking over to us it would ve looked like a scene out of ange favorite movie she made me sit through the godfather except percy was no bald italian guy that ran the mafia he was just a prick going over some plays oliver said without missing a beat at least it was believable at midnight percy asked cocking an eyebrow behind his horn rimmed glasses i am going to snap those things in half some day look i snapped you didntsee us doing anything wrong so just go shine your headboy badge some more alright percy looked down at his badge for a second and in that second me and oliver walked over to the adjacent stairs i ll give you your present tomorrow oliver whispered in my ear as he gave me a hug and before he kissed me deal night sleeping beauty i hate percy i ant to hex him until he has pigs flying out of his nose and huge elephant ears and a rat tail just for kicks and it will happen eventually now only if finny would stop nibbling on my ear that would be bliss ok i am soooooooo ubberly sorry i haventupdated earlier you see i made this club volleyball team and we just had this four day tourney in ghetto south philly no offensse if you live there but this old guy on a bike yelled across the street to me and my whole team and we have practice two days a week 7 10 pm and i have riding and art club on wednesday not to mention all the homework and testsmy teachers decided to bash me with not to fear because i have three days off this week yay but i wontbe around for one of them sorry so i ll get a bunch of suff done but you ll be proud to know that i did some author searching for the past two days if you want to call re reading every single chapter and all the reviews for each of them author gasp i just figured out i can reply to reviews and yes i will who ever saidi should change the rating i thinki might move it up to t so all in favor say aye and all who oppose say nay and who said my chaps were shrinking this one ten pages ha ha i replied to all of your reviews except to evelas because she was too lazy to sign in might want to fix that you in deep trouble apparently girl you grr damn now i donthave anything to say here hmmm guess you guys donthave any rambling to listen too quite a shame actually sigh well i guess i ll start with no rambling but i like to ramble may 1st saturday 5 04 and officially 20 days from the final so i think it safe to say that oliver is completely off his rocker i was talking to my team mates flying high above the stands of the pitch and on the other side so we were no where near close to where oliver was talking strategy to harry and oh yeah i kinda screamed the last bit so oliver might ve been able to hear it just a little fred agreed there is a slight possibility lic joined in i think running us into the ground since 7 this morning qualifies what time is it anyway ange asked nursing a bruise on her forearm cause by the bludger george had sent her way earlier almost 11 10 50 no 10 55 so almost 11 either way i asked watching my friends go at it over the time and checking my own watch 10 54 we have got to get those things synchronized yes they all answered so that means like george said attempting to do the math in his head but had to resort to his fingers attempting to calculate the amount of hours we were out there hey nobody can think during oliver practices actually according to him we re only allowed to think of a small amount of things those things being quaffle broom quidditch pass throw score hit quidditch quidditch cup bludger snitch broom quidditch beater bat pitch rings quidditch win and let not forget win quidditch cup do you see the track out train of thought is allowed on like three no george still attempting to think off our allowed train of thought four hours lic answered for him and then she jumped on me well not physically we were like fifty feet off the ground you have got to do something about that captain of yours my captain i asked he all of our captain i pointed out yeah fred agreed be we re not the one kissing him i sighed sparing a glance over to where oliver was still bearing down on harry ok ok i ll yell at him i smiled crookedly five hours of quidditch is too much i said to them quidditch practice you know i think i know that scottish accent from somewhere quidditch practice we have this to win the quidditch cup very very familiar why canti place where i ve heard it before katherine ann bell i sighed as oliver flew right behind me alright alright i said turning around what drill what drill what drill the sameone we ve been doing for ages we ve been listening to you talk to harry for ages i pointed out if you re going to run us into the ground atleast give us something to keep us occupied and with that we all flew down into the pitch leaving oliver with his mouth gaping open so much for yelling at him shut up fred i dontunderstand oliver said half an hour later attempting not to yell why you cantget this play i looked over to lic whose face basically said kill him and then over to ange which also said kill him now damn it ohhhhh the choices i sighed maybe that because we ve been at it for two hours without one damn sip of water so so we need to drink oliver is anybody else really thirsty george asked coming over and whipping his brow fine oliver said go get some water yes all my friends screamed almost crying at the belief that oliver gave in punching the air and then sped to the stand where we had left all our water sweet h2o fred said dumping the water in his bottle in his mouth which basically means that half of it spilled down his front i still surprised he gave us a break ange said drinking her water and sitting on the third bench up tell me about it lic said from the bench below her who cares george said sitting next to lic not nearly as much water down his front as fred i thought i was going to faint lic elbowed him playfully as he put on a girly voice and kates you re going to have to breathe sooner or later i laughed spraying all the water in my mouth out i had been chugging down my water for the last minute straight and surprisingly there was still some left so when do you think you could end practice fred asked as i sat down next to him i laughed ok drinks and breaks i can do but ending early is a stretch please it ll never go over pretty please not even with sugar how about a or a cherry on top fred turned to his twin she knows us too well what do you mean us george asked apparently he thought he was more complicated than his twin nope not true we re twins fred pointed out true george agreed please kates they both begged with puppy eyes i turned to harry please tell them it ll never go over it ll never go over he said to the twins and i as all big sisters do gave him a nuggie oliver we all begged as he came over to get his own water what now oliver asked looking at us unsure yes that right six some what dignified quidditch players had been reduced to groveling fred and george were holding onto the hem of his scarlet robes begging for mercy alright alright oliver sighed smiling get off all your scarlet robes and padding we all jumped up off the floor laughing and smiling because you re going to do some running it was safe to say there were no more smiles so how many more laps lic asked from next to me as we ran around the pitch two more oliver said flying next to us when you graduate i panted i going to be a keeper then i donthave to run oliver just laughed it not funny we all screamed he just kept laughing ok fred said panted whispered on the count of three we ll jump him we all nodded our heads as we trudged along one two three and with an amazing amount of effort we jumped him and if anybody had the idea of looking at the pitch they would ve seen one very big heap of griffindor laughing it wasnteven that funny oliver mumbled 45 minutes later by then we were all sitting under the big oak tree by the lake for the record it a really nice day you know one of those spring days where it nice enough just to wear a pair of jeans and a light sweater yeah one of those days absolutely bliss after three freaking months of winter and a total of 5 months of freezing cold oh did i mention we all decided to wear the sweaters mrs weasley gave us well we were yes we re officially a cult oliver i groaned it was funny how our captain got dog piled it was funny oliver sighed sitting next to me with his back resting on the trunk of the tree i looked over to where fred and angelina were playing with a deck of cards the king and the queens kept fight with each other no hearts are better nonsense diamonds are forever alicia was reading a book and george was asleep with his head resting on her shoulder i looked back over to my right at oliver who was apparently starring at the clouds in the sky did i mention that his hair got longer it been like that the whole year dontknow why i didntmention it before it wasntas cut close to his head as it had been the past few years but it wasnt long like the twins were attempting to grow their hair now it more like cedric length but with more wave and less poof and yes i wanted to play with it lemme guess i said playing with that lock of hair that stuck up straight in the back of his head you see the quidditch cup maybe he chuckled maybe i see the whole game up there i followed his gaze to the clump of clouds above us i think you ve lost it oliver laughed as i slid down so i was half way laying down but i could still lean on him you should talk he said putting his left arm around me you re the one who can see the whole pitch in the library table we re not supposed to talk about that i said tracing the three embroidered hoops on his sweater with my finger oliver chuckled and started rubbing my back and then i drifted off hey if you were run into the ground fro almost five hours and then find this really comfy spot and then your back starts getting rubbed you would fall asleep too kat kat wake up somebody was gently nudging me kat c mon let go mmmmmmm kat sto op it the gentle nudges started to become not so gentle nudges please kat it almost lunch and i sure your just as hungry as me no my stomach kind of blew my cover when it gave out a loud growl dontmake me carry you you ll never be able to move me i murmured my eyes still closed and nestling into him more did you know you re so comfy he chuckled no well know you do he is reeeeeeeaaaaaaally comfy for future references she still not up i heard ange ask and oliver sighed and shrugged his shoulders i ll get her up angelina it alright rea katie bell she screamed in my ear and my eyes shot open we re starving so wake up so we can go to the kitchens i sat up did you say something ange she laughed as she grabbed my hand and dragged me back up to the castle with everyone else may 2 sunday um no idea what the time is but i know it right after dinner what cha working on george asked me in a sing song voice after lunch that potions essay that due tomorrow we have an essay yup i nodded my head not looking up from my obviously a piece of crap 1 foot essay that was supposed to be two time to resort to big handwriting i was sitting on the couch of the common room in an emerald green tee and dirt wash jeans and george was leaning on the back behind me where oliver lic said coming down from the girls dorm in the back of the common room what do you want with my boyfriend i turned around and kidded you re not trying to steal him from me are you no lic laughed sitting next to me i think i forgot my jacket in the locker room and he got the keys i ll get i laughed closing my books and putting away my essay he probably at the pitch and i need to find him anyway so i ran up to my dorm grabbed my shoes and a corduroy jacket to put over my green tee shirt why do you need to find him lic asked as i tied my shoe laces no reason i said hoping up and down on one foot and trying to tie the other i haventseen him all day at this i almost fell over but george steadied me as i started to tie my other shoe knowing him he down there anyway probably george laughed oh wait i said checking the pockets of my jacket i forgot something what they asked at the same time but i had already sprinted back up the stairs where is it i asked finny as i searched threw my draws finny if you ate it or burned it to a crisp i ll kill you finny who was curled up on my pillow blew out a puff of smoke in shock that i could think something so terribly about him oh wait i know where it is i said snapping my fingers suddenly remembering i never took oliver gift out of ange jacket now if i could find ange denim jacket finny just kept staring at me as i rummaged about well are you going to help me or not finny sent out another puff of smoke before flying off the bed and the underneath it two seconds later he pulled out the sleeve of ange jacket thanks fin i said giving him a hug before placing him back on my pillow where he fell asleep then i went into the inside pocket and pulled out the white envelope with oliver name on the front you re the best i called as i ran down the stairs did you find whatever it is lic asked george having taken my spot next to her on the couch yup i said running towards the portrait hole dontdo anything angelina would i laughed as i swung the fat lady open knocking one of the trolls in the head and running away before their peanut sized brains registered what happened after running down the pitch looking in the captain office for oliver who wasntthere and looking in the locker room for lic jacket that wasntthere i grabbed my broom and went out into the pitch and found oliver who was there he was practicing yes that right after four hours of practice yesterday he was still practicing he was wearing that long sleeve shirt i got him from christmas you know the one it navy blue and it says captain on the front and aka the spawn of satan on the back in white writing and a pair of black warm up wind breaker pants and he had charmed a quaffle to keep taking shots on him and the brilliant keeper that he is none got through so i took off on my broom flew behind him and gave him a bear hug kat that better be you oliver laughed because if it one of the twins they re dead no i laughed letting him go it me the he turned around and gave me a hug why are you practicing i asked once we pulled apart because the final is in less than twenty days he pointed out ah i said sarcastically how could i have forgotten we had somehow made our way to the ground that not funny he smiled yes it is i laughed laying down on the fresh grass looking up at the sky i still dontsee any quidditch game though oliver chuckled before laying down so his head was next to mine but his feet were opposite of mine do you know what i mean i hope so because that the only way i can describe it it over there he said pointing to a cluster of clouds nope i said shaking me head still dontsee it i turned over resting on my elbows so my head was directly on top of his and my forearms were on either side of his head but do you know what i see what oliver smiled you re belated anniversary gift i laughed sitting up and pulling the envelope out of my pocket that not fair he said sitting up so he was facing me i donthave yours with me i waved it off with my hand who cares i handed him the envelope open it already ok there was a card with it but finny got a little hungry i added as he took the envelope it alright oliver said ripping open the envelope i don t the look on his face was priceless i told you it was the greatest gift of all mankind for oliver at least are these real oliver asked taking out the two blue and gold puddlemere game tickets of course they re real i said exasperatedly why would i give you fake tickets but mind you they count for next month gift too because the game in june and next thing i know oliver has his hands one still with the tickets in them on the sides of my shoulders and is kissing me yeah what ever happened to that slow mo machine i ordered ages ago i hope oliver got me that so i can use it later on now that is a useful gift so it safe to say you like it i concluded afterwards are you kidding me he beamed it the best gift anyone has ever got me really i asked i expected he would like it i mean i cleared out a good portion of saved up summer job money for the past two years but the best gift ever wait i predicted this didnti yes yes i did ahh trelawney would be so proud if i gave a damn about what that old bat thought yes oliver said grabbing his broom and getting up offering me a hand it beats my gift by millions i sure it doesn t i laughed so happy that he really loved it and taking his offered hand luckily not forgetting my broom they re not even that good of seats they re box seats what you didntknow oliver asked surprised as we climbed the grand staircase our brooms over our shoulders no i smiled looking at the seats what do you know they were box seats my uncle asked if i wanted seats to a puddlemere game sometime he works in the department of magical sports up at the ministry he asked me at the ball thing and i said yes he told me to send him a certain amount of money i did and nimbus brought me these two weeks back i handed the tickets back over i just figured they werentthat great because they werentthat much how much were they kat oh god i knew he was going to go into that i cant let you waste that much money on me mode apparently a lot more than i paid for i laughed waiting for the staircase to change how much did you pay for them who knew my uncle could pull that many strings i said changing the subject kat i have just tapped into an undying source of quidditch tickets kat let just take a moment to enjoy this fact kat no i said suddenly standing on my tippy toes and poking him in the chest i am not going to tell you because it a gift from me to you and besides it counts for next month too oliver smiled warmly before giving me a gentle kiss thanks kat that why i here i sighed smiling so how are we going to get there oliver asked as we made it to the seventh floor the date says it the first week of june get this i said as we approached the fat lady witherwings the portrait swung open and we climbed through all we have to do is sneak into hogsmeade walk a block and then i thought i told you not to do anything angelina would do alicia and george jumped like five feet apart actually george almost fell off the couch which i think is pretty hard because two seconds ago lic was practically well was on him what lic asked what i mocked her smiling slyly c mon oliver said grabbing my hand let get your present and he pulled me up the boys dorm dontdo anything angelina would do she never going to let me live that down wait i said right before oliver opened the dorm to his room i know percy in there oliver chuckled and mr headboy percy i pointed out one eyebrow cocked and dontyou dare lose those things or let fredricka get to them i added motioning to the tickets still in his hand that was holding his broom good point and i ll lock them in my trunk far away from fredricka he thought for a second where the key it not that i donttrust him it just that i spent a bundle on those things and i would scream if they disappeared with the pitch keys he said reassuringly and the trunks fire and water proof so dontworry ok i smiled he would never lose those on his life but percy is still in there oliver chuckled just ignore him and he opened the door before i could say anything else hey perc oliver smirked at me and i threw him a half serious look oh hi percy said from his four poster bed without looking up from the book he was reading oliver walked over to his trunk and discreetly put the tickets in an old sock and pulled a few clothes out then locked it i was standing in the middle of the room by then ignoring percy oliver walked over to me and gave me a peck on my cheek i just gonna get changed he smiled make your self at home i dontneed to know that oliver percy said jeez he even more oblivious than oliver and sarcasm though oliver is getting better very proud of him i would ve laughed if i really wanted to talk to percy which i of course didn t so i sat down on what was obviously oliver bed who else would have quidditch posters completely surrounding them while they slept lucky for him there wasntanybody from the holy head harpies all women team god i getting possessive but c mon let say hypothetically you were a girl who had a boyfriend a really great boyfriend like oliver you would not want moving posters of girls watching him while he sleeps i think it makes sense i was pondering this thought when oliver came out of the adjoining bathroom wearing a pair of jeans a white tee shirt a pair of sneakers and a blue jacket with gold trim and what i knew to be puddlemere insignia on the back so what did puddlemere ever do to you kat huh snapping out of my trance why were you frowning i wasntfrowning i protested smiling you were biting you lip i opened my mouth to say something else but percy just figured out there was a third person in the room ple ease be quiet katherine he said from behind his book it took a few seconds for him to register what he just said katherine what are you doing in here err do you want the long version or the short version i asked in fake peppiness there are different versions oliver whispered in my ear and i elbowed him my fake smile still plastered to my face i dontthink i want to know either he said looking at me confused with a mix of what could be disturbed just just get out he said waving me off like he was the queen of england well he is a girl fair enough and i dragged oliver back down the stairs there you are ange and i exclaimed the second we saw each other yes we have confirmed sighting of the rare angelina leanne johnson where have you been ok i said we ve got to stop talking at the same time yeah fred agreed from next to her it sounds like a freaky twin thing fred and george said at the same time fred looked at george who was sitting on the couch stop it they shouted no you stop it i said stop this is not cool let get something to eat lic and ange said at the same time sounds good me and oliver said at the same time stop it we all shouted at the same time that it i said throwing my hands in the air and yet no one slapped me and walked to the portrait hole i going to get dinner before this gets any creepier ok all my friends said following me and i walked out the portrait hole before anybody else said anything the same time anybody else did it was freaky ok i didntexactly know how to end this so there you go dontworry katie ll get her present to beginning of the next chapter and there will be people getting hexed in the halls it eight pages long so no more complaints and speaking of complaints to those who review constantly for each chapter you know who you are i love you and you know that but today i was rummaging through my stats page and guess what there are 66 people that have this story on alert and 63 on favorites lists now normally i get 13 15 reviews per chapter not complaining by any means to my regulars so my question is aprhos avada cruimpero beyond the surface bittersweet sorrow bopeep daydreamrose dm lover giggle725 along with nearly 45 others you know who you are why have you never dropped a review i think now would be a good time to start better late than never and if you dontknow who you are i will post every single name in one of these chapters dontthink i won t but to my regulars i love you in an author reviewer reader type of way you know what i mean ok because i have a day off and nothing better to do that and it too cold to even think of stepping outside or even moving i decided to keep my fingers somewhat alive by typing yay fingers go wok hard and try to keep warm without falling off and sally i have no idea what you re talking about and i couldntreply because you didntsign in and yes i caught some of the people i mentioned before weeeeeeeeeeeee now i love everyone and dontbe afraid t be redundant and remember the long the review the more i have to reply to may 3 monday errr what class am i in oh yeah history of magic why do i sound so excited ha ha so i finally got my belated anniversary gift yup that right it finally appeared i mean literally appeared so one second my alarm is going off and the next i find this little really actually quite nicely wrapped up in pretty wrapping paper and red ribbon box right next to it and of course a letter from oliver dear kat happy belated anniversary i so sorry i couldntgive you this sooner or in person i had to meet mcgonagall about being able to book the pitch more sorry i wontsee you this morning hope you like the gift unfortunately it isntanything like or as good the one you gave me how you managed to deal with me so far is still a mystery to me love you your freaking scottish kilt wearing son of a bitch captain oliver p s try holding off on dying snape hair until after the match several things registered in the few moments that followed 1 how and why the hell is he trying to book the pitch more we re already out there 24 7 2 i was sure he present would be great 3 he never going to let me live that line down 4 being so sweet and all canceled out the quidditch drabble and made it so easy to deal with him 5 he said he loved me 6 i probably should wait until after the match to humiliate snape 7 if i didntget dressed and out the door in five minutes i was going to be late 8 finny was snacking on my ear hold on he said he loved me what awwwwwwwwww ange and lic cooed it was at breakfast and i showed lic and ange the note oliver left me practically underlining the love you part awwwwww i asked what am i going to do tell him you love him too lic suggested really katie ange agreed it not like you can just ignore something like that point taken i nodded looking up and down the table for oliver but where is he says he going to see mcgonagall ange said pointing to that specific line oh i said but mcgonagall is up at the teachers table i pointed out where was he so how are our favorite girls the twins asked sitting across from the three of us where oliver george asked dunno i said looking at my eggs so he finally gave you the note then fred said cheerfully looking at the paper next to my plate what are you going to do what do you mean what am i goin a thought just struck me as i folded it up and put in the pocket of my robes you knew george glared at his twin and fred smiled guiltily i joined george in the glaring dontlook at me fred said george was there too leave me out of this you used the extendable ears too so it was half of your idea what happened i asked stopping their bickering fred sighed at his twin we might as well tell her damn right you better fred rolled his eyes for a few days perc has been complaining that he can never go to sleep with oliver pacing around at lights out and asking him a question every two seconds we just figured it had to do with quidditch george said but percy said it was very unlike him and if you looked up quidditch in the dictionary oliver picture would be there so there was no way it was quidditch so one night we used the extendable ears oliver was asking percy whether or not he should write it percy said why not and oliver asked him what penelope clearwater said after he told her he loved her then there was a big long pause where percy muttered i didn t we figured it out from there but oliver caught us and made us promise actually it was more like a threat not to tell you fred concluded awwwwwwwwww ange and lic cooed again what is with all these aww s i asked katie ange said putting an arm around my shoulders i love you but sometimes you are so oblivious maybe that why oliver and her didntget together sooner lic put in and i elbowed her gently what she trying to say is that oliver actually put a lot of thought into writing that he put thought into something fred started you mean besides quidditch his twin finished i ignored them which means he really cares ange concluded dropping her arm off my shoulders and starting to eat her eggs oh i said suddenly realizing everything that apparently was happening right in front of me awwwwwwwww damn now i feel all warm and fuzzy inside next i going to be giggling gah i wontlet it go that far n e v er so what did oliver get you why are you banging your head on the desk i forgot it back up in our dorm you re terrible as if we dontsay things at the same time enough now we have to write things at the same time hahaha ok well stop thank god so you going to run up to the dorm and get his gift yeah i guess i should almost the very end of double transfig i love oliver yeah i should probably tell him that sometime today preferably before quidditch practice which translates into before i get somewhat mad at him in the pitch yeah that top priority right about now not to mention this stupid canary that i supposed to turn into a bucket of water random enough for you getting my mind back on track i finally ran up to the tower and got my present oh my god yes i nearly squealed nearly he got me the most absolutely positively no doubt in my mind the prettiest locket ever i mean pretty as in this white gold ivory trimmed with lots of pretty design stuff on it with a really pretty chain too pretty locket and after a minute or two of attempting to open the clasp i finally remembered a decent charm to open it and inside was the cutest picture there was a picture of me and him well in one side there was supposed to me and him in the other but apparently the picture me didntwant to stop hugging the picture him so one frame was empty but who cares i cantsay i blame picture me so that basically where i put it on after another minute or so attempting to get the clasp to work does anybody else notice that i have severe problems with these things i ran back down to the fifth floor and was late to transfig but who cares i love oliver really need to tell him that beginning of double potions ok i came to the lunch table smiling from ear to ear where all of my friends were minus one oliver where is he all of my friends shrugged their shoulders lot of help you all are i said yet somehow laughing sarcasm and laughing dontexactly mix before they could answer i turned on my heel and walked out the great hall and so for the next 15 minutes i searched the halls for my oliver wood yes you heard right my oliver wood and after much searching as i was doubling back towards the great hall hey i got to eat too i found him it was on the second floor and i guess he must ve been hungry too because he was heading towards the grand staircase and as i ve done many times before i sprinted up to him and jumped on his back why would now be any different from all those other times oh yes i remember now he didntturn around for once and so therefore i was actually successful in this for once in my life that better be you kat he laughed grabbing my legs that i had wrapped around his waist how d you know i asked laughing lucky guess he joked i hoped off his back he turned around to face me and i gave him the hugest huge i could muster love you ol i murmured what he pulled apart i was shocked confused and taken back all at the same time was that wrong i asked slightly shaken and still completely befuddled you love me boy he looked just as confused as me yes really yes did i do something wrong here i asked i think i even put my hands on my hips really should stop doing that no he said shaking his head smiling what the hell is going on here next thing i know i engulfed in this huge hug yes huger than mine bummer once again what the hell is going on here love you to kat he muttered in my sandy blonde hair alright everything good now ditto i said brightly pulling apart but i didnthave any lunch and now i absolutely starving oliver laughed and i yes i dragged him back to the great hall where my lunch awaited me so did you finally get my gift oliver asked as he let me drag him on the way down the stairs i suddenly remembered this fact so i turned around and gave him a kiss which was really really really hard now that i think of it you see i was one step below him and he a good five inches taller than me yes i laughed continuing to drag him awwwwwwww how sweet hey ange so that all that happened yes there wasntsome crazy snog in a broom closet you mean like what you and fred do no what you cantjust change the subject around i just did be that way then i will shut up katie no hahaha yes now there only three more minutes left in this class then i can escape yes wait what that on the blackboard what hell no no way am i writing a foot long essay for tomorrow may 4 tuesday after practice ahhhhh you can always know when the quidditch final is coming up oliver is always yelling at us people start duels in the halls oliver continues to yell at us more people get hexed oliver yells at us again did i mention oliver yells at us even more or the fact that now he gives us tips on our ay to classes remember harry you have to wait until we re 50 points up oliver said to harry as the poor child walked to transfig i was with him at the moment 50 points up harry or we ll win the game but lose the cup 50 i get it oliver harry screamed before walking into class getting slightly red in the face do you think he understands oliver asked me i rolled my eyes and sighed smiling i sure he understands by now oliver i said as we walked towards the west wing he had charms and i had divination pointless class if you ask me drop it as soon as possible i mean you ve only told him about five million times he d be daft if he didn t good point oliver chuckled argh i forgot to tell him not to walk in the halls alone i sighed every now and then oliver has these bouts of quidditch obsessiveness honestly it best to wait them out ok so maybe it more like every five seconds he has one of these bouts just 16 more days the final ll be over and we ll have the cup knock on wood and we ll be golden may 6 thursday after classes it is official someone finally tried to hex meaning everybody else on the team already had someone go at it with them so i was walking through the hall during second period to the bathroom so i used the fifth floor one and none other than nat was there caking herself with makeup in front of the mirror ew katie she simply said as i walked in i ignored her and walked towards the stalls dontingore me she shoot some random spell at me but i turned around in time to put up a shielding spell and then send a hex right back at her ok so maybe it was two hexes hell it might ve even been three i smiled at my handiwork knocked out cold on the ground nat was truly turned into a bug or somewhat turned into a bug i gave her big fly eyes bat wings for ears and let not forget a forked tail when i went back to transfig she was still knocked out on the floor and her makeup looked really really bad actually she just looked really really bad after practice notice how we re having these every night now what oliver asked as he came over to me ange lic and the twins we were sharing our hexing stories they only seem to get better as the finals get closer what happened kates hexed natasha fred said triumphantly for me what he turned to me when did this happen second period that was george this time what ok oliver enough of the what s we get it why didntyou tell me because of this lic and ange said wow way to hit the nail on the head oliver expression softened and after that he just sighed and told us to go get changed practice was over kat i jumped a bit as i came out of the locker room but it was just oliver way to surprise me i laughed as we walked down the stairs why didntyou tell me about natasha he asked suddenly do have any idea how nice it was to hear natasha and not nat it was like heaven angel singing i sighed and looked at the wooden stairs we were climbing down i didntwant you to get worked up you have enough with the cup and all besides it was nothing i looked back up at oliver who was still frowning what ever happened to telling me everything he asked oh god he was giving me big eyes big pleading eyes damn i hate it when he does that do know how hard it is not to hug or kiss him when he does that no you don t it almost impossible i smiled and gave him a quick kiss why d you do that oliver asked as i slipped my arm around his back and we came out of the pitch and continued to walk back up to the castle because you re too damn cute when you give me those eyes i sighed he sighed and i could tell he was trying not to laugh but next time tell me he said slipping his arm around my waist ok ok i laughed how come you never giggle what i asked snapping out of my happy place where did that come from you never giggle he shrugged his shoulders every other girl i know giggles do you want me to giggle i laughed an eyebrow cocked no he chuckled but then he did something very very mean he tickled me he tickled my sides the most ticklish part of me no no that not aloud i laughed more or less collapsing to the floor i am the most ticklish person i know and he knows it sto op stop oliver ahahaha stop damn i canteven yell at him while i laughing by then i was laying on the grass trying to crawl away as he continued to tickle me yes i ve been reduced to an attempt to crawl oliver stopped tickling me and sat down next to me on the grass what an odd scene i was laying stomach down on the grass in a pair of jeans clumps of grass in my death grip as i continued to laugh into to rest of the grass and then there was oliver sitting next to me his legs spread out in front of him and leaning on his hands that were right behind him and he was laughing too you really dontgiggle do you oliver chuckled no i was in the aftermath of being tickled you know when your still trying to laugh but you canthelp but let one or two out here and here i hope so because i cantexplain it any other way i told i don t i laughed said as oliver helped me up just wondering he said slipping his arm around my waist again god the way his mind works ok so the lest few paragraphs seemed to be completely meaningless but i promise it ll come up again in maybe two to three chapters so remember that you all are so lucky i got this up today because tomorrow sunday i have to wake up at 4 in the morning to go to volleyball tourney upstate so bow damn it lol gah no one mentioned the great gift katie got for oliver gaaaaah lol i noticed people like to review on my notes and i like it a lot but sometimes you seem to forget the chap so review for both or if you only feel like for reviewing for one just review on the chap oh my god do have any idea how nice it is to go to yahoo sign in and see that there 20 new mails just chop full of good reviews and just waiting to be read let me tell you it feels pretty damn good oh and sorry forgot who said it at the moment katie doesntdo the whole scene break thing and if the scene does change it because nothing of value happened or because in the scene you pointed out her thoughts were interrupted by one of her friends that case ange writing in her book may 7 friday 8 09 so you re not study for your test on monday and i not studying for mine yup pretty much why i thought we went over this go over it again i laughed because you re ridiculously comfortable and i really just dontfeel like getting up that so oliver chuckled didntwe just go over this oliver laughed as i nestled into him more i want to point a few things out 1 it not my fault that it perfect day out 2 it not my fault that the fact that oliver is ridiculously comfortable is 100 true 3 but it is my fault for dragging him out there and winding up lolling around under the big oak for a good three hours after classes and after we got changed well we werentexactly lolling around it was more of oliver sitting down and leaning his back against the trunk of the tree and me practically falling asleep in the crook of his arm on my side with my head and one hand resting on his chest so it was my fault who ever says katherine ann bell will deny anything and everything is a damn liar i admit a lot of things like how i never really ever brush my hair in the morning because it ll just poof out and that when i do brush my hair in the morning i always wind up putting it in a bun which more or less is linked with confession number 1 i bite my nails i bite my lower lip when i thinking i more or less gnaw on my quills i stubborn me being stubborn leads to the fact that i never buy new quills because that just how i run and i hopelessly in love with oliver wood who says i cantadmit things but that completely off topic kat oliver asked a few minutes later just as i started to nod off uh hu i asked with my eyes closed for the record resting your head on oliver chest while he not obsessing over quidditch and hyperventilating at the same time is a very good and easy way to fall asleep are you falling asleep no so i wontadmit a few things good he said brightly and then he did something very mean he got up really quickly causing my and my head and not to mention the rest of my upper body to fall to the ground yeah that kind of upset the whole taking a nap idea oliver i said shortly sitting up and spitting several blades of grass out of my mouth what the hell was that for we have practice soon he smiled crookedly down at me no we don t i rebutted yes we do he chuckled now get u get up is that what he meant to say well i did i did get up and more or less jumped onto him which caused the both of us to go tumbling down the hill that the big oak tree resided on now exactly what was that for oliver asked and you have grass in your hair i blew up a lock of hair that somehow managed to find it way onto my face and rest on my nose i looked down at him wait yes that right i was on top of him oh how the tides have turned over the course of the year because i smiled you took my sleeping spot away your point oliver laughed my point is this i said number 1 two galleons say you have more grass in your hair than i do in mine that was true enough and number 2 i still tired i added this as settled down on his side and pretty much was in the same comfortable spot as before except with no tree but we still have pract no we don t i cut him off nestling into him more some how he seemed more comfortable before and i needed to find that perfect spot again but half an hour later oliver was on top of me about practice again no i really mean on top of me somehow he rolled onto me not fun oliver you re squishing me i muttered i ll get off if you get to the pitch he smirked at me i glared back at him ok well i tried to glare back at him do you know hard it is to stay mad at this guy especially when he has this one lock of brown hair that in front of his face making him look ubberly cute and adorable and un stay mad at able i thought not oh i groaned giving in gerroff i said pushing on his shoulders and thankfully he got off because my lungs were currently at a loss of something very important you know a little thing called air yeah kinda need that so being the good person i am we trudged to the pitch where me and the rest of our merry band of friends endured two hours of grueling practice not fun once again may 8 sunday 10 pm so it safe to say that i completely and i mean completely forgot about my potions test tomorrow until about an hour and a half ago so basically at exactly 8 32 when i was sitting in the common room and currently losing a game of exploding snaps while ange and lic were reading these pamphlet thingies on the couch the thought of my no doubt going to be nastily insanely impossible potions test tomorrow and the fact that i hadntstudied at all popped into my head and right before i was squirt with that god knows what it s made of liquid those things squirt i high tailed it to the so here i am all alone studying for this stupid test all aloneyou re not alone ok so maybe oliver came by to maybe help me a bit a bit and maybe that made this whole studying idea a little bit more bearable maybe a little do you want me to help so all in all his great tutoring has helped me greatly and has ensured me an o insert big cheesy smile and two thumbs up happy oliver very he chuckled reading over my shoulder at what i wrote good i said looking back towards my disgustingly ugly not so little but hug potions text book which i am proud to say i don t understand at all potions text books now about me not knowing anything in those disgusting books right oliver laughed before helping me again now i have no idea why i absolutely suck at potions not one all i know is that 1 i terrible at it 3 i have no idea why i terrible at it and 4 i definitely dropping it next year and 5 i have no idea why i donthave a 2 on this list may 9 monday history of magic miss bell you i didntdo it professor mcgonagall sighed from behind me this little scene occurred while i was attempting to eat my breakfast in peace before the twins had tried to chuck eggs at my face so i threw a handful of hash browns at them and so i thought she came over just to yell at me like i was saying she said as i turned around in my seat to face her and whatever punishment she was about to dish out i thought you would like to know that you have a career advice meeting today during third period today oh i said at least she wasntyelling at me for flinging food that was always good any ay i could come eight or ninth period instead i cantmiss charms today miss bell she said i know you have potions then and therefore the answer is no and seeing your grades in that class especially no oh i said disappointed alright so instead of going to charms third i went to mcgonagall office with a few words of support from my friends you ll be fine yeah i sure she wontbite your head off like last time when you messed up that transfigura will you two stop it she obviously scared enough from last time ok so maybe they werent that big of a help professor i asked opening the office door enough to peek my head in finally she said from one of two seats facing each other come in and have a seat i was a little hesitant i must admit last time a teacher sat in a chair facing mine without a desk in between i could ve sworn they were about to lunge at my throat and this is not including madame pomphrey who apparently loves to torture me now she said leafing through a bunch of papers as i sat down what jobs are you considering after hogwarts uh i bit my lip i really haventthought about it that much professor really she said looking up at me over the rim of her glasses and cocking an eyebrow you haventgiven one thought to your future at all ok now that a little harsh excuse me but it kind of hard to think when your captain who also happens to be your boyfriend dontexactly use that word a whole bunch hmmm is driving you into the ground twenty for seven just because he psychotic about winning the quidditch cup it a little hard to even think about the present and focusing on not walking into a wall after a four hour practice let alone the future errr i dontwant to take potions next year i offered hey it the truth she pulled out a piece of paper out of the stack on her lap well severus does mention that you seem to be having difficulty in his class she sighed but a potion n e w t is required in a lot of jobs you really should ve read the pamphlet in the common room so that was what ange and lic were reading guess i shouldntstudy then i mumbled excuse me oh she heard that possibly i guess i should ve i covered up do you have any idea what you would like to do after hogwarts she asked you have very good grades in all your other classes well i do try most of the time i ran a hand through my hair and continued to bite my lip well for starters she said after a few seconds what are you good at quidditch i said confidently without hesitating except i said that without thinking i mentally kicked myself what teacher wants to hear that it not like i talking to madame hooch here she smiled or more of a mcgonagall smile which consists of one of the corners of her mouth curving up the slightest bit true she agreed wait she agreed with me am i getting pranked you are a very talented chaser but you cannot depend on athleticism alone in the outside world damn well riding those coat tails for a while had seemed like a good idea now professor lupin seems to talk very highly of you she said leafing through the papers on her lap once again i beamed how can you not love that guy too bad the position is hexed would love if he could stay around more than one year professor sprout and professor hagrid as well she continued and you do seem very inept in my own class so she continued is there anything outside of quidditch you could see yourself doing in the future i looked around her office yes that would translate into searching for a somewhat decent answer err so that would be a no yeah that would be a no so we spent the rest of third period looking and going over the pamphlets i was supposed to read on my own in the end i still had no idea but i picked some random job that allowed me to drop potions and divinatation and still keep all the classes i was apparently good at letting me keep my options open anyway but the more i looked at these jobs the more i wanted to play quidditch outside of school well i said as i got out of my chair and headed towards the door as the bell rang to leave third period rang thanks professor wood is wearing off on you then huh i asked turning around with my hand still on the doorknob quidditch then she simplified shuffling papers from behind her desk definitely i smiled you better work hard then wait what is this another trace of a mcgonagall smile in a forty minute period a miracle hard not to with oliver around i pointed out as i went into the hall and basically to this boring class quidditch that all you could come up with yeah at least angelina has this far fetched idea of being an aruror far fetched that so miss high healer that only my back up plan so what you re first plan then i going to be the first female ministress of magic ministress did you make that name up yourself possibly hahaha oh you re just sucking up to oliver sucking up to oliver when have i ever done either she got a point she only sucks his face off everyda ok there was absolutely no need to kick my chair over katie she right she could ve made it much worse how she could ve said donteven finish that ange fine so apparently my two best friends at least have some idea what they want to do in life me quidditch is apparently my only vague idea about my future whoo hoo go me great plan even the twins know they want to open a joke shop and everyone knows oliver ll end up on puddlemere sooner or the quidditch plan is better than no plan and yes the quidditch plan get dinner so you had career advice today oliver asked after classes all of us were sitting under our big oak tree yes we have finally taken it actually it was more like oliver laying on his back looking up at the sky through the branches fred and george looking over the grounds for an unsuspecting first year to test their newest products on and me lic and ange trying to juggle the quaffle i mean juggle as in bounce the quaffle off our knees and top of our feet like those muggles do in that muggle sport ange showed us socker i think yeah i said rather proud of myself for bouncing the quaffle on my head five time in a row i d like to pretend that never happened what did you say he asked propping himself up on his elbows sounding concerned nothing too bad i said what i would like to be a smooth voice but probabloy wasn t because i can never pull it off as good as the twins as i juggled the quaffle to ange what did she say he asked ange and lic quidditch they both answered thanks guys i said the quaffle coming back to me thanks a lot i laughed kicking it hard at lic lic caught it and laughed before handing it to ange and dragging george to sit down ange laughed and chucked it at me and did the same with fred except the difference here was that i wasntreally paying attention so it bounced off the top of my head and i started to bop it on my head until oliver came over and snatched it out of the air quidditch he asked holding the quaffle over my head quaffle i asked wanting it back later he said quidditch he repeated practice at six i said trying to veer his train of conversation of course i know i made a wild gab for the quaffle but no luck o kaaaaaaaaaaay i groaned and flopping down to sit on the grass under the big oak tree so i couldntcome up with anything else i looked at my legs weird not so much it was one of those spring days that no doubt predicted the bone boiling days of summer which arenttoo far away so i ditched the jeans shaved for the first time in god knows how long and wore my favorite pair of denim shorts so me looking at my legs in amazement that there wasnta forest growing isntthat hard to believe what so bad about quidditch oliver asked sitting down next to me the quaffle in his lap he was wearing a light pair of slacks and a light blue tee shirt he had slipped his shoes off before so he was currently barefoot i cocked an eyebrow and smiled you mean besides the back breaking practices that can go on for hours and could start at the break of dawn and besides you yelling at us every other sec ok he laughed i get it he paused so quidditch are you daft man i laughed yes quidditch that fantastic he suddenly gave me a bone breaking suffocating hug that caused me to fall backwards with his arms still wrapped around me and his forehead in the crook of my neck fantastic i repeated yes he laughed looking at me i paused for a second how because we can play together on puddlemere he beamed i sighed jeez ol i not that good puddle u ll never take me then they re the daft ones i laughed well then i ll just have to join the vratsa vultures so i can kick your sorry butt and then they ll realize they made a serious mistake for not recruiting me in the first place and i ll get traded over it sounds like a plan he chuckled but vratsa all the way in belgium he said moving around so he was on his side and my back was pressed against his chest with one of his arms under my head so i ll get you some decent chocolate once i get traded over i laughed lightly love you i said squeezing his hand three times hmmm he hummed more or less into my hair before planting a kiss on the back of my neck love you too awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww the love you have finally made an appearance now i know i a terrible person for not getting this up sooner but it feb break in a few days so i should have another chap up soon but no promises because i have another volleyball tourney next weekend in freaking omish country in pennsylvania and a scrimmage and two practices through out the week but i shall do my best which means you have to review alrighty then at the moment i at home by myself and i ve got nothing to do there nothing on tv and there is absolutely not one good new katie oliver story that i haventalready read so here is another chap for all of you ok guys now you know i love you but the two word reviews have got to stop and there will be cursing in this story so if you dontlike it add little bleep when ever you see a curse word ok i think that everything may 10 tuesday around ten i guess ow owie ow katie i not made of steel well your hair apparently is because i cantget this knot out for the life of me ange laughed you see she and fred were going on a date on tuesday i know weird day but what ever floats their boats so she asked me and lic to help her get ready and all the usual stuff so cleopatra over here decided she want her hair to at least resemble me and lic s so for two hours we flipped through textbooks looking for a spell that would make her hair look like she got what muggles get a weave eventually we finally found one and did it but her hair was still full of knots even after she took a shower lic was picking out an outfit while i was dealing with her new mop of hair currently she wanted it slightly lighter and wavy and soft like foxy from goldmember when she woke up in the morning that one time she had said like i knew what she was talking about ok i sighed forty five minutes later looking at my handiwork i think you re good and it was good i must say it was slightly lighter and wavy and smooth just like she wanted we even gave her a few layers and angles and then tied it back in a low pony tail with one of lic blue satin ribbons it actually looked really nice oh katie ange squealed once she looked in the mirror i love it you should do my hair more often with my light smile on my face i slid off my chair and onto the ground that a no incase you didntcatch that ange lic pointed out holding up the outfit she picked out for ange kaki capris a blue shirt and her denim jacket her damn date better have gone well i mean they just got back so it must ve went somewhat decent they were out for four hours may 11 wednesday history of magic kat kat please wake up kat zzzzzzzz kat i sorry she not home at the moment please leave a message after the beep beeeeeeeeeep katherine ann bell wha now practice wha ya talkin bout i heard him sigh quidditch he was shaking my shoulder so i rolled over to look at my nightstand and uncrusted one of my eyes to look at the clock for a second 3 12 it too early to have practice i rolled back over on my stomach and held my pillow close it too early to even think about practice then he did the unthinkable he squished me i mean he laid on top of me and somehow wrapped his arms around me too so i could no longer breath squish me this is not fair i managed to moan c mon he said in a sing song voice you know you want to get up no i rebutted my eyes still closed i want to sleep he kissed the corner of my jaw please no please he begged kissing my neck no still yup he laughed and got off me finally i sighed taking a deep breath and rolling on my side air he chuckled lightly and pulled me up to a sitting position and sitting right behind me so i my back was resting against his chest and his arms wrapped around me do i really have to go to practice ol i yawned the back of my head resting on one of his shoulders yes he said firmly planting a kiss on my temple here i would like to point out that my eyes were still closed and fully crusted why i moaned yawned because he said the final is in less than two weeks you re point we need the practice we need sleep practice maybe i agreed still all crusted up but not at 3 in the morning oliver chuckled c mon he said slapping on of my thighs hard enough to somewhat wake me up and getting up i ve got coffee i stood up after him rubbing the crust out of my eyes look at that i managed to pry my eyelids apart i ll get lic and ange then i yawned as i stretched aka making a pitiful attempt of reaching the ceiling thanks he said giving me a quick kiss before heading out the door ugh i said rubbing my face muttering to myself he damn lucky i love im so much i walked over to ange bed where i instantly slipped on a misplaced sock oof katie ange asked from her bed what are you doing on the floor i slipped on your sock i said throwing it up to her and we have practice what in merlin name do we have well at least you donthave to wake up alicia now ange said somewhat brightly in her groggy state true you did not just say we have another god damn dawn practice lic screamed from the bed on the other side of ange s errr i said we have another god damn dawn practice i cannot believe i am out here at what time is it lic asked as we finally got to the pitch in our robes and sat down in the team room i checked my watch 3 32 at 3 32 in the morning she continued so its safe to say alicia is here harry asked through a large yawn as he trudged in and sat down on my other side where alicia wasntsitting she was in the middle of me and ange yup i laughed as much as someone could that early in the morning tired i asked ruffling up his hair yeah he sighed ron kept having dreams that spiders were making him tapdance i started to laugh as the twins came in so he still going through those fred laughed sitting next to ange we thought he got over those ages ago george said pushing me off the bench to sit next to lic you re going to regret that i said from the floor behind him how is tha he started to ask i dontunderstand why we have to be here so damn early in the damn morning on a damn schoolday it fucking insane oh george said and i smirked at him morning team oliver said as he walking in with a poster under one of his arms it not that nice you damn dictating bastard oliver ignored her as he magically taped the poster up to one side of the white board this he said motioning to the poster is everyone new schedule well fred said skimming over it there no classes oliver sighed and rolled his eyes pointing to a time slot that indicated class hours oh so basically here a new schedule 7 15 wake up 7 20 healthy breakfast 7 45 2 30 classes do not receive detention or get points docked 3 00 4 20 homework 5 30 healthy dinner 6 00 8 30 practice 10 00 bed oh god ange moaned in her still groggy stupor you ve turned into our mother just get out there he said sternly fine you damn quidditch nazi we all trudged out into the foggy morning how the hell is harry supposed to find the snitch in this fog ange asked forty five minutes later i have no fucking idea i laughed it was true i could barely see ange and lic and they were only two feet in front of me harry was in for some trouble katie what time is it ange asked err i had to whip all the condensation off the face almost quarter after four this really is getting ridiculous i noticed it only fuc heads up the three of us ducked just in time as a bludger just skimmed over the top of our heads what in merlin name are you doing we heard oliver voice shout from across the pitch err practicing one of the twins shouted back across why are you screaming i right infront of you the three of us sighed and followed the voices until we came across oliver and fred having a shouting match well not really fred didntrealize oliver had flown right in front of him i told you the fog was thick oh fred said brightly so you are how things you nearly took out all three of our chasers in one shot talk about killing three birds with one stone someone said behind us angelina let out a little squeal i jumped a bit and lic turned around and slapped george for startling us is everyone trying to knock my chasers off their brooms oliver screamed his accent coming out thick it always does when he tired or worked up or both at the same time no harry said suddenly next to me well thank you oliver said to harry before turning back to fred just go to the other end with george and try to practice without knocking anybody else of their brooms that sounds like a great idea fred said so why are you still here oliver asked getting agitated because i canttell where the hell i am fred said same everyone else said at the same time alright then oliver said get back to the ground and do some laps everybody groaned and headed towards the ground well alicia was screaming and george was somehow getting her back to the ground oliver sighed as i turned to head down what now i asked damn fog he muttered well good day for a dawn practice i laughed i had to get him in somewhat of a good mood c mon i said grabbing his hand and pulling on it yelling at us ll make you feel better alright he chuckled that was not 100 pushups that is the last time you try and cheer him up ange muttered next to me as we did push ups better than usual i muttered back push ups bell he screamed down from in front of me this is practice not a social hour i saw ange send me a look o k so maybe not that much better really lic said from my other side i didntnotice i laughed and finally done with my push ups i collapsed on the grass how that woman could do push ups and scream at the same time amazed me bell oliver asked looking down at me what are you doing making sure the grass is cut evenly for the big match i said sarcastically good job he said now how about 100 sit ups i sighed rolled my eyes and started doing sit ups how about i knock you out i muttered what nothing you should know that because of your boyfriend ange said as we changed into our school uniforms right before breakfast was supposed to start i cannot feel any part of my body i laughed but stopped instantly because that hurt my stomach you see what i mean yeah ange i said i see i am going to crash lic muttered as she put on her school tie so the screaming is finally over with i asked what are you talking about me and ange started to laugh but stopped once our stomach muscles started to scream stop haventyou killed me enough dontlaugh damn it i said looking around my locker and the bench what lic and ange asked at the same time dontstart i said quickly before they started talking like twins again my back pack must be back in the tower ouch ange said 7 floors of stairs lic cringed for me good luck with that could you two grab some food for me and give it to me first i asked as i ran out the door they nodded thanks guys so i ran out the door in my uniform well i also kinda ran into oliver literally didntknow you missed me that much oliver chuckled catching both of our balances it only been a few minutes har har i laughed though it kinda hard to miss a quidditch nazi that much oliver laughed alicia did put that eloquently didntshe like no other i laughed now i ll leave you to your dictating job because i have to go climb seven flights of stairs to get my back pack oliver chuckled wait a second then i ll go with you just let me get changed no i said sarcastically he dropped his arms which were on my hips laughing and went and got changed which honestly only took like two minutes so we walked back up to the castle together and i left him at the great hall he wanted to come up with me but i protested saying that there was no reason for both of us not to eat breakfast hey finny i said grabbing my bag and turning back out finny gave a little cry of recognition as i left damn dawn practices i yawned at the floor landing waiting for the staircase to change if i hurried i could still make breakfast right before dinner katie hmm are you asleep no i think you are hmm i have no idea what you re talking about snape coming over i sat bolt upright in my seat it was potions class and i was attempting to get a little shut eye i had made it through the day not so bad until last period of this horrible double period class and you see fred i said as if i was explaining the potion on the board to him that why the potion exploded in your face snape walked by just then and seeing nothing wrong and therefore no good reason to dock points just glared and kept walking ugh i groaned crossing my arms on the desk and then resting my head in them these dawn practices have got to stop tell me about it he said resting his head on his hand which was propped up on the desk do you have any idea which potion we re working on i looked up at him fred even if i wasntcompletely dead do you think i would know anyway no he said after a while of quick pondering 10 pm so after dinner i was sitting on my bed attempting to do all my homework with lic and ange but things kept interrupting us and i barely got anything done george came in a whisked lic away then fredricka came in and her and finny had a flaming fest where they sent half of the curtains on fire fredricka is a bad influence and then fred came in laughed at the sight of me and ange trying to douse the curtains then after that ange got mad at him and started slapping him playfully on the shoulder even though he did help us after a second or two and then they started snogging so i had to push them both out the door do you know how awkward it is being the third wheel especially when the other two wheels are snogging each other senseless i thought not oh and then oliver came in and interrupted my stride in getting things done i telling you i was on a roll i had finished charms and was getting to transfig i was doing good so there i was listening to ange cd of the weird sisters that she put on this cd player thingy and shoved the headphones on my head before her and fred went snog o rific on me and i would like to point out i was doing my homework so take that then oliver came in and ruined my whole work ethic as i mentioned before i was looking down at my books and i didnthear him come in because i had my head phones on i only realized he was there when he laid down on my bed next to me where i was sitting cross legged still clad in uniform so his head was where i was sitting near my books and his feet were laying on my pillow he is so lucky he took his shoes off my pillow is like a god to me especially after practice what are you doing he asked taking my headphones away homework i smiled you know the stuff teachers give out that normally comes in large quantities because they hate you i know what it is he chuckled propping his head on his hand and looking up at me but why are you doing it up here by yourself and move over a bit he added i practically falling off the edge here you know you re ruining my whole work ethic i had going i laughed as i made room for him well i sorry to ruin it for you he laughed slipping his arm around my waist and resting his head on my leg that not exactly helping either i sighed my fingers starting to play with his hair it depends on what i asked an eyebrow cocked on who you think it not helping he said smiling because it not doing me any harm i hate you i said slipping my legs out from under me and laying next to him is that a lie he asked one arm around my waist and hugging me close while the other had his head propped up yes i groaned crossing my arms and resting my head in them looking down i knew it he said cockily as he traced a pattern on the back of my hand with his finger you know i started trying to figure out what he was tracing on my hand this whole dawn practice thing has got to stop he stopped tracing my hand and looked at me it already did that was our last one i asked surprised he nodded oh for some reason i wasntas happy as i thought i would be yeah he smiled half heartedly canthave you guys waking up too early the days leading up to the final i smiled faintly as he rested his head on my shoulder i think the whole me not jumping up and down for joy never happened because i realized how late in the year it was i mean it only two weeks until the final and then only about a month and half of school left until summer and that very limited time after that god knows oliver is going to puddlemere and i ll still be here not like it that bad with the twins and everyone but oliver ll be out in the great big world while we re dawdling in hogwarts it actually really upsetting and more than frustrating if you think about it i love you i said softly as he gave me a kiss on my temple i love you too he said if not more not physically possible highly doubtful hardly most likely and we went on like that for a couple of minutes until ange came back in and started making gagging noises pah it like she thinks she any better for god sake she worse ok now for all who wanted a true i love you i gave in see it not just the red luv ya stuff but full fledged whoot now i noticed as my chaps stay pretty much the same length and longer at some points your reviews get shorter unless i pointed out otherwise so to turn this around i would you to pick out something in the chap quote it even maybe d that you liked disliked thought was funny or just was plain wrong and if you could tell me why that would be awesome it doesnthave to be an essay just a short explanation would be nice as much as i like reviews i cantget much feed back from one liners like update it motivating and all but as an author who gives you 7 page chaps a little more would be quite nice thanks a bunch guys and yeah update i know disclaimer you know the drill i dontown hp blah blah blah and thanks again bri007 and duck goddess you guys are the best october 25 thursday right after double transfig sorry i haventwritten in you for a while ugh we just got this huge project and guess who i paired up with marcus flint out of all the people in the world why him i mean his in his seventh year and still hasntreceived a fifth year o w l for transfig how stupid is this boy he just finished talking to me about how this grade will really help his average so basically he ll flunk again if i dontdo most if not all of the work maybe i should let him fail 3 30 under the big oak well everyone is in agreement that i should let him fail now it doesntsound so bad but if i let him fail then i fail so i ll split the work in half even give him most of the easy crap and so then i do my part he does his i ace he flunks perfect 4 45 so here i am wasting my time on a buffoon who apparently likes to hit on me i sitting there divvying up the project and he just starring at me i dontunderstand it i understand potions more than him and that saying something so do you want the history or the effects i asked i was trying to be civil which ever do you know how pretty your eyes are history it is and i write his name down under that section well we re done assigning things i guess i double checked the sheet to make sure i didntforget anything and look up to find him 5 inches closer than before i shrieked to find him so close and the librarian came over and hushed me marcus what are you doing what am i doing is he trying to be smooth because it really isntworking i dunno but now you re gonna go and find books on your topics and i handed him the sheet in wrote down all the sections on do i have to canti just stay here and he inched even closer boy does he have a way with words or what i cocked an eyebrow and i guess i put him down a bit because he actually went in search of books that made me happy until i saw the books he brought back transfiguration level 1 transforming 101 transfiguration for dummies i read off the titles marcus what section did you look in transfiguration i put my forefinger and thumb on my temples and let me guess you picked the first three you saw you re so smart yeah well you re not in my potions class i muttered under my breath try looking for books that go along the lines of dire consequences of transforming transforming one self something like that and what do you know they were real books go figure another bonus i moved his chair back to where it originally was and then some we actually got some work done well at least i did i think flint was admiring his new chocolate frog cards i ve got practice in about a hour and i still haventeven started any of my other home work i ve got a mountain of home work and i still stuck in this library with a pimple faced greasy haired rotten toothed brainless idiot argh i still haventeaten i guess i ll grab an apple in the great hall before i head over to the pitch and i know practice is going to accidentally going to run late speaking of practice 5 45 oliver is my all around hero savior and what ever else would fit perfectly here he found me sitting at a table stuffed in the back of the library no not our favorite around a quarter to five pulling half of my hair out of my head and trying to do work at the same time as marcus inched even closer i was trying to think of a good wording for one of my topics i guess i was biting my lip because flint said do you know that you bit your lip when you re thinking if only he was that observant in class i was about to say some smart alic comment when oliver came over there you are kat i ve been looking everywhere he seemed out of breath angelina said you might be here i knew he knew i would be here i told him twice i sorry but an opening came up so we can use the pitch for another45 minutes so why didntyou tell me at practice because it 45 minutes earlier i cocked an eyebrow i know it really last minute he apologized this was so unlike oliver he never ever ever ever did anything last minute especially with practice that was the only way to ensure everyone would be there if he changed it last minute it was common knowledge that neither of our beaters would show up they would say something like they had previous engagements or some other bull i was about to say something when i caught a quick wink from oliver oh really i asked pretending to be upset i looked over to marcus who seemed to have moved two inches closer when i wasntlooking sorry marcus i guess we have to cut this short i thought you said we d have until 5 30 well things change i collected my books with such speed i didntknow existed sorry i called over my shoulder as i followed oliver out of the library oliver you re a god above gods i said throwing my arms around his shoulders you saved me from another 45 minutes with that creep i figured you could use a break he said shrugging his shoulders when i let go besides you have your own home work why do his oh and i making it a point to make sure that you eat before practice he added half way down the stairs i was going to eat i protested stubbornly you were supposed to end half past that would have only given you 15 minutes to get to practice when were you planning to eat i was going to grab an apple on my way over well at least it was something healthy i saw him smile out of the corner of his mouth come on you can do your work at dinner how was flint fred asked we had all apologized ages ago at the same time i really mean the same time we all said sorry at the same second and laughed afterwards at our stupidity a monster i said as me and oliver sat across form him and his twin so how many pimples does he have these day george asked from next to fred you know i gonna try and eat dinner be kind that much hu alicia asked as she sat down to my right katie bell about to eat a dinner angelina asked sitting in between fred and george and at a reasonable time i dontbelieve it i got my self a plate of chicken and was about to take a bite when fred and george started a commentary now watch as she takes her first bite fred said in a hushed whisper sounding very excited oh oh here it goes george said bouncing up and down on the bench look at that posture no wonder she has such great form i threw down my fork and glared at the twins smiling as lee jordan cam and sat in between fred and angelina will you two stop it commentating is my job lee put an arm around angelina shoulders isntthat right baby angelina pushed him off the bench backwards and fred moved back to his usual seat lee stood back up why do you refuse to go out with me he asked angelina practically yelling because i have a boyfriend she answered not even looking at him lee jaw dropped since when i thought we had something special exactly what did we have i mean besides a mutual commenter player relationship i not sure but i ll find out and he walked away so who do you guys have as partners for the transfig project i asked looking up from my work some hufflepuff cedric something something fred trailed off cedric diggory oliver offered that the one how do you know him he the seeker on the hufflepuff quidditch team his voice started to rise you know the one the team we re playing in less than two weeks have you been paying attention at all yes we all said at once ok repeat one thing i said about our up coming game we were supposed to be playing slytherin but malfoy is making a big deal out of nothing so now we re playing hufflepuff angelina started who has a completely different flying style alicia continued and cedric is larger than normal seekers so he has weight to shove around so if harry gets in front of him we re golden i finished oliver looked happier score one oh oliver is reading over my shoulder and telling me we have to leave for the pitch gotta go after practice i love flying i donthave a clue what i would do with out it plus it the ultimate way to relieve stress and hatred towards a certain professor and a certain buffoon yup snape and flint thank god we had a good practice it so close to our first match that if we didn t oliver would eat us for dinner and spit us up in time to play we ve been practicing the team play with a lot of others the only problem is that kinda hard to juggle a bludger long enough to hit the keeper and we cantpractice hitting the keeper because we cantexactly take out our only one and our captain at the same time but other than that we ve got every thing down pat those hufflepuffs better watch out because we re gonna hit them so hard they wonthave a clue october 31 saturday halloween morning 9 maybe only one more hour and i ll be in honeydukes candy galore then zonko and the shrieking shack and all that other good stuff one more hour just one lunch oh my god i died and went to heaven we re all in the three broomsticks drinking butter beer eating at least some of our candy or pulling pranks in fred and george case nothing is better than hogsmeade i ll tell you that i gonna retire here or live here under some sort of situation poor harry though his stupid muggle guardians never signed the papers oliver was upset about this because he wanted to go over something with us all not that he was missing out on a great treat but i guess we ll have to wait till we get back he concluded and the rest of us all cheered with our mugs of butter beer are you guys ever serious about quidditch oliver i groaned we all did it just that you are far more obsessed than us fred explained and oliver shot him a look but he was smiling out of the corner of his mouth team 1 oliver 0 zip nada hahaha so i in a good mood so what 3 in the morning so i guess it october 2nd hu sirius black attacked the fat lady how the hell did he get in why do we have the dementors then they re not doing anything if he got in ok maybe i should explain more we all got back from hogsmeade 4 ish happy windswept and a little more than cold but no one paid the cold any mind we went up to the common room dropped all our stuff off and went back down to the feast which was great i might add so much food even though we stuffed ourselves with candy and butter beer all day we always have room for hogwarts desserts and dinners we went back up to the portrait after but it was already crowded with tons of people what is going on i asked a little more than a whisper you ve got me fred said from behind me then percy shoved through excuse me head boy coming through excuse me i head boy he pushed past me roughly and i couldntcatch myself because it was so crowded so i would ve fell down the stairs if oliver hadntcaught me at the last second no offense oliver said to the twins while he helped me regain my balance by placing a steady hand on my back your brother can be a prick at times at times fred asked that considered a compliment we thought he was a prick all the time george explained we all laughed percy is a world renounced pain and now that he head boy his ego has only grown but what is going on angelina asked did some one forget the password i dontthink everyone could ve forgot alicia said but then again the password just changed since the semester over and maybe the first years forgot just then percy screamed some one go get the head master now and a bunch of first years went and did his bidding the first years were back with dumbledore he didntneed to push past because everyone made room a few minutes later peeves the poltergeist said loud enough for everyone to hear he has a bad temper that sirius black dumbledore immediately led us all to the great hall where the rest of the houses were soon gathered the teachers and i need to conduct a thorough search of the castle dumbledore said as all the doors were being shut i afraid that for your own safety you will have to spend the night here i want the prefects to stand guard over the entrances to the hall and i am leaving the head boy and girl in charge any disturbance should be reported to me immediately send word with one of the ghosts he was about to leave when he added oh you ll be needing these and with a flick of his wand the four long tables slammed up against the wall and thousands of purple squishy sleeping bags appeared on the floor we all grabbed sleeping bags and as we were trying to find somewhere in a corner to sleep fred pointed out hey look at perc i think his ego got twenty times larger in the past 3 seconds percy was pacing around with his chest thrusted out so his head boy pin shone in the candle light lights out in ten minutes he was shouting and he told off some first years i hope it doesntget any bigger because there wontbe any more room for any body else we all laughed and found a spot in a corner and laid our bags in a circle you think they ll find them alicia asked she was on my left well the whole school knows he here oliver said from my right i doubt he would stay but how the hell did he get in george asked across from me maybe a secret passage angelina offered from the other side of alicia but fred and george know all of them i said and there only one coming from honeyduke cellar that filch doesntknow about and black cantexactly waltz in there also one from the shrieking shack to the whomping willow fred said from the other side of oliver but why would anybody go in either we tried once remember he twin reminded him fred sighed good times as first years good times what are you talking about angelina shrieked you both almost got us all expelled but the important thing is that we didn t fred pointed out lights out percy shouted from the other side of the hall and all the candles went out at once yeah like that would stop us we pretended to fall asleep every time percy walked past but fred or george would just happen to flail in there sleep either making percy trip kick him in the shins or some thing else it was really a sight percy would get all red and seemed to puff up like a bird eventually the twins and angelina fell asleep alicia was soon to follow i looked overat oliver he was laying on his back his hands behind his head just staring at the enchanted ceiling it was a clear night and the stars reflected in his eyes so what do you think i asked softly he turned his head and looked at me i was on my side that we better win the game oliver i groaned i meant about the fact that there a murderer in the school you know the one hogwarts ring a bell he smiled out of the corner of his mouth before looking back up at the ceiling he long gone he wouldntlinger he looked back over at me so how working with flint you had to remind me he drains all of my energy i paused oh and he tries to hit on me oliver rolled over on his side his face a few inches from mine what did he say oh boy he was angry he was trying to hide it but he was never really good at hiding his emotions just stupid things i rolled on my back he leaned over me like what i sighed and looked up at the ceiling like you have pretty eyes did you know that you bit your lip when you re thinking and he always inching closer but when he gets up i push his chair back like four feet i looked back over at oliver who was now scowling it really nothing he tries to be smooth and things like that but it never works i just get angrier at him i going to rip his head off at the game oliver it really nothing i paused but be my guest if you want to touch that disgusting thing he d probably look better without it oliver laughed and finally dropped the subject rolled back on his back and looked back up at the stars well i about to fall over and oliver is reading over my shoulder so i gonna try and get some sleep i 3 reviews oh my god soooooo many reviews and yeah i replied to them all ha wow this whole reply thing is not leaving with anything to ramble about odd well i guess i ll just spare you all and start the chap then hu oh wait i found something to ramble about 50 chaps guys yeah that right count em 50 yeah go us whoot whoot raise the roof okz i done now oh and peoples before i forget please log in so i can reply to your reviews you take the time to answer me so i should answer you i think it makes perfect sense even though i am typing 6 pages here oh and i going to warn you all now this is a what i like to call a fleshing out sorta chapter so if you dontlike characters to have depth and a few insecurities they feel they need to clear up you might want to skip a bit of this chap and straight to the fluffiness but i highly recommend reading the whole thing aka you better lol but seriously read it and i figured i had better get this up soon before you all mauled me into it may 12 thursday after practice what if i refused to go to practice i would kick you off the team what if we all refused to go to practice i would kick you all off the team and play in the final match with a reserve team you donteven have yes not likely just get to the pitch you lot way to ruin our fun oliver just make us go to practice why dontyou uh yeah he just did so with heavy hearts and even heavier feet makes us get there as late as possible we headed towards the pitch oliver nothing oliver wood still nothing oliver wood he couldntignore me forever dontmake me use your middle name what kat he asked flying next to me and you wouldn t dontbet on it i started and exactly how do you want us to this play i asked my thumb pointing to ange and lic behind me looking over the play sheet he had given us trying to make heads or tails of it the way it written he said both eyebrows raised giving me the not helping the blonde stereotype look again i grabbed the sheet from them which is how exactly i waved it in front of his face ignoring the look he was giving me now i sure it brilliant but we cantunderstand your hand writing or your little drawings on how it supposed to look follow the red circles he said those are you guys i took a second look at it well more like a fifth hundredth look at it and sure enough amidst the many lines and quickly written in familiar messy handwriting were three red circles damn you oliver wood i said not even half heartedly but i still dontget how we re supposed to do this here oliver said ange and lic coming over i ll explain it do you see how much easier it is to explain things nicely oliver it really makes a world of difference then we were actually able to run the play with less difficulty now only if he had picked up on this technique ohhhh let say 4 years ago it would ve saved us from a lot of head aches and a lot of fighting matches as fun as they are ow i cringed later in the locker room owwie owwie owwwwwww dontpoke it nice one you two ange said we didntmean to uh hu that was lic sure you did ange still helping the cause i said donttouch it how am i supposed to fix it then dontthen no really just stop oliver you re killing me it really hurt though during one of the plays a stray bludger came and hit me in my lower back and i knew there was a bruise i could feel it coming one of those ugly yellow ones too with cuts in the middle oliver sighed and looked at lic ange and the twins who were just plain bickering how immature donttouch it ok we were all being immature it alright kat oliver said coaxingly from behind me ok maybe everybody but oliver it had been a hard practice all we did was go over plays again and again and again and that bludger really topped it off for me painful i know no need to tell me of all people so currently i was sitting on one of the benches with oliver behind me attempting to fix what the bludger had done which means constant prodding along with a bag of ice no fun i cringed as i scootched away from the bag of ice he was trying to place on my bare skin kat yea aaaah that cold that would be the point fred pointed out as he and george were about to leave a few minutes later in normal clothes while me and oliver were still clad in quidditch robes it is a bag of ice george laughed oh har har har i mocked oliver fred said looking at oliver who was still behind me if we ever run out of ice you can just chip it off of kates heart oliver chuckled as i glared at the two of them as they left the locker room laughing no doubt going to find ange and lic who had left earlier feeling any better oliver asked as he sat down next to me unfortunately not forgetting to keep the bag of ice on my lower back with his hand damn him i sighed as long as you donttry and give me a massage i think i should be alright i smiled har har he mocked me dontmake me use your middle name do you even remember it i told you way back in your third year it too much dirt to forget i smirked and i never forget oliver alban wood he cringed i hate my mother for ever giving me that middle name pfft i said nudging him sure the sarcasm just keeps coming doesntit yes mother oliver what eat healthy food it almost ten get to bed fred george i said healthy food not chocolate i said mimicking what he had said over the past few days ever since he made that new schedule he just looked at me you just have to remember everything dontyou he asked i shrugged my shoulders and kissed him before getting up now i am going to get changed and get out of here as soon as possible before you get the idea of bringing me to the hospital wing he said smiling and standing up too right after you get changed damn him no way of getting out of it then i asked a little hopeful nope he smiled planking a kiss on my hairline before going to get changed himself i picked my long scarlet robes off the floor damn it so 45 minutes later i hobbled out of the hospital wing right after madame pomphrey treatment which consisted of constant prodding on my poor lower back that woman i said standing up straight which caused all the vertebra in my spine to crack has got it in for me oliver chuckled as we climbed back up to the tower may 13 friday 9 51 on the dot it raining it been raining since before we woke up but it still raining i sighed yes it is fred and it probably wontstop until after we have practice tomorrow afternoon the world cruel like that lic said from the arm chair it was after classes and we were sitting in the common room trying to take advantage of the bad weather and absence of the urge to go outside and were trying to do our homework but god knows that never works so at the moment fred was toying with me while finny was perched on my shoulder george was trying to beat ange in a game of chess the board was on the coffee table in front of the couch and they were sitting on the floor on either end and lic was curled up in the armchair petting fredricka i sighed again i hate the rain sure sometimes it a nice small drizzle which nobody seems to mind but then it could be a tsunami like that one time where it always fun to cuddle up in a blanket but this rain was so blah it was in between to two but just enough to keep you in your clothes and inside it was terrible i sighed for the umpteenth time making you that bored fred asked from the other end of the couch because we could make it more interesting stop while you re ahead fred ange said from the chessboard while moving one of her bishops checkmate george what no way he looked at all the pieces and then at fred your girlfriend beat me it not that hard my good brother fred smiled as ange sat next to him george pondered this thought for a moment before flicking over his own king true enough ron beats me all the time he said leaning back against lic legs i sighed again and looked around the room trying desperately to find something that would amuse me for even the smallest amount of time where oliver i asked suddenly sitting straight up my friends shrugged their shoulders and lic looked out the window he wouldn t i said following her gaze thinking the same thing she was he would they all chorused at the same time damn it at least this time i had enough common sense to check inside the pitch rather outside in the middle field aka in the rain first i had nearly given up when i found him in that entrance that we fly out of at the beginning of a match leaning against the wall on his right shoulder about ten feet from the actual opening and looking at the rain outside with his hands in his pockets he was wearing a navy blue sweater with a hem of a white tee shirt sticking out from the bottom with a pair of jeans i loved that sweater i also knew it had a slight guys v neck in the front you see with the rain and the wind you had to wear a sweater over your tee shirt i told you it wasntnice rain i smirked to myself crept up behind him and put my hands over his eyes fred and or george weasley get your filthy hands off of me or i swear i will i planted a kiss at the base of his neck when he was obviously shocked because he thought i was one of the twins spun around and gave a huge sigh of relief and swept me into a huge bear hug so now i being mistaken for one of the twins i laughed into his shoulder who knew my hands were so manly i asked glancing at them from where they were behind his back kinda callous y from playing so much i guess oh god i have man hands no he chuckled putting me down holding one of my hands and kissing my fingertips they re perfect i smiled how sweet is this man soooo i started looking out at the rain what were you thinking about how come professor treawely hates you again you could be a mind reader he said going back to his position before but this time taking me with him so i was leaning on him if i could i wouldntbe asking and that old bat actually hates me i said with a bit of light laughter fingering the hem of his sweater at his back where one f my hands were i paused so what wrong he gave a deep sigh just mad at myself i guess normally here i would ve sighed exasperatedly and said something like so what made you fail the herbology test this time or something that would pry a smile out of him so instead i simply said why honestly as far as i know he been on beat with everything and nothing too damaging has happened he looked at me with those huge chocolate colored eyes and that always messy hair of his and it took a damn truck load of self control not to snog him senseless right there but then again it wasntexactly the right time to do so anyway a made a mistake he finally said obviously the worst situations popped into my head first the possibilities ohhhhhhh the possibilities 1 he was cheating on me 2 he was leaving hogwarts early 3 he killed somebody other than marcus flint but after a second or two and a mild heart attack i thankfully came to the conclusion that none of these were characteristic of oliver alban wood thank god so the only poetry that spewed out of my 16 year old mouth was oh really he nodded looking back out at the rain umm i searched for the right words running my left hand the one that wasntfingering the hem of his sweater through my hair well um do you need my help fixing it i mean that the thing he smiled warmly at me you cantreally fix it i smiled back realizing that he didntget himself into too deep of trouble everything can be fixed but that the thing it already been done so long ago over such a long period of time i couldntpossibly fix it before i graduate i hate the g word you know the one i mean graduate it officially just as bad as lic choice words that she uses during dawn practices or rather that she used to use when we had dawn practices who knew i would miss them so much sure they were a pain but that where all our good stories came from so i said after a while are you going to tell me of this problem of yours or am i going to have to guess all day it just that he trailed off scratching the back of his head with the hand that wasntresting on my hip his right that i ve taken so much for granted i started to sigh but instead it turned into a light laugh oliver looked at me puzzled i sorry it just that i thought it would be something much worse i explained before he could ask it just nice to know that you haventdug yourself into too big of a hole of trouble but i have he said turning so his back was against the wall vs his shoulder and placing his other hand on my hip so i was up against him smiling slightly because you re such a troublemaker i asked skeptically with sarcasm randomly fiddling with his belt buckle but really how much could you ve taken for granted to get you all worked up well you for one he answered automatically me i asked shocked he nodded me katie katherine ann bell me what did i do he chuckled no doubt at my shock you didntdo anything i didntdo anything and that the problem ok will you stop talking in riddles and explain what you mean in comprehensible means i asked after a slight pause not following at all i didntdo anything when i should have i blinked a couple of times at him mutely telling him to try again to get me to understand i should ve told you years ago that i liked you what do you mea ooooooooohhhhhhh like me i paused thanking god i finally caught on how many years are we talking here he sighed looking down towards the right at least two i slapped his shoulder with the back of my hand two years two years two years at least not counting this one he added softly so all of this year leading up to february plus two more i said so there was only one year when both of us just thought the other as just a friend and teammate i slapped his shoulder again why didntyou tell me iwasafraid he mumbled strumming his fingers on my hips of me i asked surprised at myself for catching what he said at all jeez i didntknow i was so dead beat ugly as a third year i said softly running my hand through my hair oliver laughed pulling me closer to him not of you i was afraid of losing you i didntwant to lose you just because i screwed up i smiled oh please if anybody was going to screw up it would ve been me at that last word i placed a hand on my chest before moving both my hands behind his neck and once again fiddling with the trim of his sweater obviously my manly hands need constant occupying so is that everything now oliver nodded smiling and i knew he was about to kiss me so i started the conversation again good i smiled cheekily as he realized i knew what he was up to because i have my own insecurities i need to vent out now he moaned tightening his grip around me giving me pleading eyes yes now i smiled i knew i was teasing him and the fact that it was working made me even happier we ve spent a good i looked at my watch which was attached to the arm around his neck so no unneeded straining 45 minutes on you at least mr two years and a half and i only have one maybe two quick questions he sighed and smiled what then kat why i asked simply and when why he repeated as i realized he was fiddling with the hem of my own emerald green sweater that i had thrown on before i left to common room yes why me i asked again why me out of the millions of girls in the world i even threw my head back slightly at the last word c mon you know it fun to tease him you know it oh and when to would be nice do you want me to go into a full and detailed list he asked i not going to lie i said still smiling cheekily that would be nice but seeing as it raining and it only going to get worse give me the short sweet and to the point list can i give you the when first why donthave any decent answers to the first he chuckled no i just need some time to revise it into a shorter version ok i said trying to sound disappointed give me the when quick question is it when i realized i was head over heels for you or when i started to like you ummmmmm i thought for a second wonder which i would like to hear more both were so so so irresistible to hear about the second one well in occurrence to the second one the twins tell me it was when you had to get your eyes fixed he answered without missing a beat but that was when i was in my second year i said almost shuddering at the thought about the fateful day when i gained my undying fear of the hospital wing commencing flashback are you sure this isntgoing to hurt i asked in my 12 year old form you ll be fine tom said reassuringly clasping one of my shoulders tom oliver and madame pomphrey were the only ones there at the moment lic ange and the twins eyes were 100 perfect and 20 20 and having no need to be there i had convinced them i would be fine and that they didnthave to stay what a mistake that was werentthere but me i had 20 30 so therefore i had to get my eyes fixed tom was basically bent on making his team as perfect as possible i think it was around december then at after 4 months of quidditch i had already spent a few days in the wing and i thought i would be fine now madame pomphrey said from one side of the cot i was laying on all i need is for you to keep your eyes open wide alright then i nodded confidently none of the other times i had spent in the wing had turned disastrous after 45 minutes madame realized she would have to charm my eyes to stay open by then it should ve been done with but she had only done one eye and after that i wasntabout to let her do the next it hurt that much by that time oliver was the only one else there tom had left because he had detention i thought you said you would be alright madame said as i refused to let her wand any where near my other eye that was before i knew you were going to gorge my eyes out i rebutted just calm down i trying oliver had started to hold my hand at that point time out at this point i would just like to point out that after 4 months and several hundreds of practices everybody on the team had become really close and so at this point i was under the assumption me and oliver were friends ok back to the flash back i looked up at him almost shocked you re fine kat he had said comfortingly bludgers have done worse and you already have had one eye done one more and you ll be scot free i sighed biting my lip scared out of my mind at the thought of madame pomphrey practically sticking her wand through my pupil and pleasantly shocked at oliver gesture but the second one was obviously second to the larger and scarier first one oh i eventually said turning back to madame pomphrey just hurry up about it and that when i put oliver hand in a death grip and gained my undeing fear of the hospital wing end flash back oliver i said after a while that was my second year and he asked not catching on that would be this year plus three then not two but that not when i realized i liked you he rebutted i realized i liked you next september what do you mean i asked with an eyebrow cocked after a pause then what was that whole holding my hand thing that oliver said smirking was one team mate being there for another i had to get my eyes fixed two years before so i knew how much it hurt oh i said somewhat shocked you see after i was aloud out of that hell hole aka hospital wing i told ange and lic what happened and they both started squealing and things pretty much went down hill from there it took me 3 months to convince them we were just friends it was a bit the twin doing actually he said after a second looking upwards as he thought smiling fondly they keep pestering me saying that i should just pull you in a broom closet and get it over with i think my eyebrows suddenly got lost in my hairline let me explain you see now i wouldntcare if oliver pulled me into a broom closet even on several occasions but do have any idea what my 12 year old form would ve done under the circumstances i donteven know i dontwant to know i do know it would be disastrous that what i thought oliver chuckled but know the idea doesntseem so bad i rolled my eyes and sighed laughing lightly ok that one question down he groaned and to add to his little drama he put his hand on my shoulder i really could get used to this teasing thing then he started kissing the base of my neck i really could get used to this teasing thing oliver i growled half heartedly i had to keep the whole teasing thing going it was too much fun to stop be strong katie dontgive in it ll be worth it alright he sighed bring his head back up he paused for a second why was the question right yes oliver i said as if i was an impatient mother why was the question well he started smiling for starts you never cease to make me laugh or smile at the very least without even trying you re sarcastic funny bright except for potions you re a great friend you re a loyal and trustworthy you couldntlie to save your life you one of the best chasers i ve ever seen and one of the few that can put up with me during practice or even during the season and you re gorgeous he added softly raising my chin up that last little bit had made me look down and blush a bit like every time someone said that with his forefinger and thumb and all my teasing was about to pay off because i knew he was going to kiss me but he said our lips practically brushing against each other started up again with all of that you still have your faults i groaned loudly now he was teasing too that doesntwork only one person can do the teasing not two it cantpossibly work oh he good you bite your lip you bite your nails he listed as i put my head on his chest and let my arms hang next to me giving up as he continued in a serious voice you re stubborn you refuse to buy new quills because your stubborn you re sarcastic and can have a dry sense of humor you cantstay serious for long the longest ever was that match that last four hours you always have your hair in a bun every time i want to run my hand through it you always cram and wait for the last second to write an essay sometimes you skip meals and all the tutoring in the world couldntget you an o in potions are we quite done now i asked my face still in his chest no not yet he said in a somewhat lighter tone you re head strong independent and could get along fine without me that is not true i said suddenly snapping my head up and poking his chest ok granted but you re not clingy you re not without a good sense of humor or a lick of sense you re bright and sweet without knowing it you make a boring day fun and your smile is contagious you re a tomboy and athlete at heart and isntworried about petty things that have no real value so we re phasing back into the good things now let me finish he said every time there is even a slight possibility you could even be slightly agitated with me i can never concentrate in classes i cantthink of new plays and eating and breathing dontseem important anymore without even know you have me wrapped around your finger he paused for a second to either let this all sink in or for my little brain to process all this and that he said leaning in and i realized all my teasing was about to pay off is why i choose you over all the other girls in the whole world said mocking me i leaned in smiling almost beaming but he kept going and being friends for 4 and a half years doesnthurt either i had to kiss him before he could day anything else now here some people might say i have less will power than him but the smart people will say i have a bigger heart and it makes sense that i cut him off thank you smart people for a second i opened one eye just a bit and saw that he was smiling faintly as he kissed me back hell i was too so who cared it a good thing for crying out loud his left arm was wrapped around my waist while his right was running along the length of my back with his fingers spread wide supporting me now here i would like to personally thank whoever taught this man to kiss and then i would take a small moment to wonder why on god green earth did they let him go the man was teasing me then too well not literally he would find my bottom lip and move his teeth over it for a second or two meanwhile keeping my hips up against his and it sent shivers up my spine that never happens do you know how unfair that is especially considering that all i was doing was sitting there and enjoying it letting my damn manly hands play with his hair simply because they need constant occupying i did enjoy it though i will not lie oh but then along came a spider literally oliver mmm he asked against my lips there a spider on my arm mmmand i dontlike spiders just swipe it away er i really dontlike spiders he pulled away to look at me but it was only his torso so our hips were still together his hands are still around me so i was unable to move away from the spider on his shoulder are you afraid of spiders he asked taking one arm off me to brush it off his shoulder well i bit my lip not deathly afraid just god it hairy and big and i dontwant to touch it not like them i explained slightly ashamed do have any idea what it like to have no fear of a speeding bludger that is no doubt going to hit you but still be if y about spiders not exactly a good feeling he let out a small chuckle that not funny oliver wood i said playfully slapping his shoulder yes it is no no it not c mon think about it for a second he urged we fly fifty feet above the ground get bombarded and bashed by bludgers and we re frightened by the smallest things i stared blankly at his warm smiling face and really tried to find any remote funniness there was none no i said after a while shaking my head there isn t 1 spiders can be hunormous and 2 we what are you afraid of jellyfish he muttered after a while jellyfish i asked almost laughing myself yes jellyfish he repeated there are huge ones in australia i let out a small laugh before giving him a tight hug i love you he kissed my head i love you too oh gods who knows what they ve been doing all this time i looked around and saw none other than fred weasley standing where i had come out before along with his twin greg i mean george just kidding less than you and ange i said half laughing and have glaring as oliver dropped his hands that combination doesntwork too well hu yeah yeah yeah fred said waving his hand and brushing the subject off can we get back to the castle yeah george agreed fred been afraid of thunderstorms since he was little ow what was that for he asked as fred punched his shoulder so can we go fred asked again choosing to ignore his twin who was currently digging around in his pockets for something that would be efficient payback alright oliver said lacing his hand in mine dontwant you guys staying out here too long could get sick for the final the rest of us groaned s we started back towards the castle damn rain damn spider damn twins and above all damn rain but thank you to the person who let oliver become another fish in the sea for me to catch and officially make him mine clich only a bit but it is true oh god writing this chap was like a marathon that never ended i had no idea how long it was going to be until i wrote it and i pray that i got it somewhat right i not going to lie starting this off i had no idea what i was going to do then i felt like some insecurities needed to be surfaced you know they re fun to toy with and out popped the 50th yes 50th chapter oh was the flashback alright for some reason i had an urge just to put one in there hope you liked and use the same reviewing system we used last time if you forgot go back to the last chap and read the end note i would write it again but i too lazy and i can barely feel my fingers and since this is a ten page chap i want long reviews please reviews reviews reviews raise the roof whoot whoot okz so i a thinking the quidditch final will be in the next chapter so basically this will be a weeks worth of nerves for katie and everybody else sorry if i pushed it suddenly onto you guys but i did say it would be the weekend of the 21st and it will be so uh yeah that all i think oh wait i sorry for the longer than usual wait for the update i had planned to get this up over the weekend but i had a tourney in albany so uh yeah no could do sarry about that may 14 saturday before i keel over and go to sleep after oliver damn practice it is now physically impossible to talk to oliver without him going off about the final and screaming about quidditch why cantyou pass the damn quaffle right spinnet weasleys if i have to tell to stop harassing my chasers one more time i swear to god and stop encouraging them johnson just run the god damn play bell you have a firebolt for a reason potter use it already and catch the damn snitch do you see what i mean he lashing out irrationally even at harry who has been practically raised up on a podium for the past three years it becoming quite a problem and this was only at practice this afternoon poor man losing it at these remarks i had slowly pulled my hand down my face i couldnttake it anymore and by the looks of everybody else on the team they couldnteither alright alright i said before they could say anything i ll go calm him down or something good luck they all chorused together oliver i said flying next to him you really need to take it down a notch take it down a notch the final is in a week and i he continued to ramble on which only made him more agitated and hyperventilate even more who knew it was possible at the rate he was going it was still a shocker he was able to breath at all you all goofing off i dontknow what to do with you all and obviously i had done something drastic and let just say grabbing him by the ears and giving him a big old kiss was that something drastic well he stopped rambling and i laughed as i went back to ange and lic who were shocked and happy at the same time that was completely uncalled for bell oh god i should ve realized that wasntgoing to keep him sane for long where oliver kates right now i glad not to know where oliver is i agree with my twin i am perfectly happy being as far away as possible from him after that practice i laughed at the twins we were outside after practice lic and ange were talking about something under the oak tree while me and the twins were wading in a foot of lake water the twins were looking for snails so i decided to help them have you seen oliver i asked lic and ange plopping down on the grass next to them having collected enough snails for the twins satisfaction no they both said at the very mention of our dear captain name i laughed as someone sat down behind me wrapped their arms around me waist and planted a kiss on my neck that better be oliver i continued to laugh ah how did you know he chuckled lucky guess dontsay anything lic said i guess to oliver who was about to say something because i swear if it sappy i ll oh sugar pie honey bun who i ll love for ever and ever and ever george said in a sing song voice from the lake i watched as lic face went through a rainbow of expressions and finally landed on half heartedly mad at george sooo who sappy now i smirked at lic she just rolled her eyes at me and started walking towards george what do you want now george i looooooooooove yoooooooooooooooou he said still in a sing song voice i heard her groan simply because she knew she was officially head of the sappy department with george as he second in command pretty cute actually so you stopped hyperventilating then i asked oliver as ange started to snore on the grass he laughed i wasnthyperventilating was i yes you were i said standing up and looking down at him i starving you want to go get some food i asked offering him a hand up after he agreed so was i really hyperventilating he asked when we were in the kitchens he was sitting at a small table while i made my famous chocolate strawberries well at the time i was just melting the chocolate and making sure it wasntgetting burnt yup i laughed my back was turned to him as i was cooking i didntknow you could cook oliver said suddenly standing behind me with his arms wrapped around my waist again i can t i confessed simply then what is all this he asked resting his cheek on mine a trick of the trade i answered i just trying not to burn the chocolate it was true not stop stirring while watching it extensively ensured me of that and what trade is that he asked planting a kiss on my jaw line i smiled to myself considering he couldntsee it it called making something to eat without cooking what do you mean i mean if it already pre made and just needs to be heated up i can make it if it a packet you just have to open add water and heat up i can make it oh he said understanding i get it now well i would write more but nothing else really happened basically i finally finished the chocolate covered strawberries we ate them we went back to the tower and here i am every bone in my body aching and throbbing from the damn quidditch nazi practice may 15 monday transfig katie yeah is oliver quite done killing us yeah i mean the final is on

eat something fred demanded i just looked at my food not able to pick up my sandwich oh god she not going to eat george said from my other side lic and ange gasped from across from me but she never not eat lic said looking concerned and stumbling over her own tongue twister take cover ange said shortly what lic asked take cover why the world is going to end shortly because she not eatin ohhhhhhhhhhhh lic said finally understanding what ange had been trying to convey to her just take a bite george said just one little ittsy bitsy bite yeah fred agreed enthusiastically baby steps yeah guys oliver said suddenly standing behind me hey everyone chorused hi was all i could mutter meekly at that point oliver must ve realized i was just staring blankly at my sandwich and he pulled fred who was sitting on my right off the bench by the back of his collar and took his seat what wrong kat he asked softly obviously concerned the final on saturday i croaked oh oliver sighed relieved but he too tensed up at the thought of the final he rubbed my back we ll be fiiiiiiiine yeah i said sarcastically because i ve believed that every time i ve said it today oliver sighed c mon kat he continued to coax me yeah lic said one big breath i took one really big breath better everyone asked almost in unison i nodded sorry about the sarcasm i mean i smiled damn snakes are going down fred and george stood up and started clapping while ange and lic started whoot ing and oliver beamed but in all honestly i still nervous really nervous i mean the final on saturday for mercy sake end of potions still going into hyperventilations and convulsions i sighed at the note fred passed me crumpled it up into a ball and threw it at his head miss bell snape drawled suddenly behind me save the horse play for the pitch 5 points from griffindor damn slimy greasy son of a bitch snake what a i started to mutter under my breath dontbother finishing that bell another five points from griffindor i slammed my head down on my desk as soon as he walked away to go congratulate adrian pucey on his fantastic potion hell mine was better than his and that saying something damn slimy greasy son of a bitch snake go soak your head snape may 16 tuesday divination do either of you see any thing in this thing if i said i saw the quidditch cup with griffindor written on it what would you say i would say knock on wood right this instant i said knocking on the table twice as i said this ange and lic shortly followed no but really do you see any thing lic asked repeating my questions her nose practically touch the crystal ball squinting violently and desperately trying to see something no me and ange replied dully me neither lic said sitting back and playing with one of her dark loose curls here i would like to point out that lic has to be one of the luckiest people ever i mean have you seen her hair it always in loose curls that always make her hair look light and bouncy and so nice and she does nothing to it absolutely nothing damn i wish my hair could be like that but back to this boring class ok then i said lazily taking out my class journal thingy that the old bat makes us keep and one of my stubby quills i just going to say that i saw the impending death of marcus flint when one of his pimples just happened to take up the whole of his face shortly after a troll chased him screaming mommy come back i said writing this down as i spoke do all of your entries include people dying ange asked i shrugged my shoulders i ve passed the class this far with them so lic said taking out her own journal adrian pucey will somehow manage to choke on some pumpkin juice right after he tried gargling lemon juice she said her quill scratching on her paper please lic ange said as i groaned what she asked scowling replace the pumpkin juice with troll snot ew ange ew and the lemon juice with the grease off severus snape greasy nose and the slime out of his hair i finished wow lic said as she tuned up her journal entry we really have got it in for all the snakes oh yeah may 18 thursday after classes three more days just three more days almost there be strong katie three more days just three more days three three days just three days almost there c mon bell you got it just three kates three i suddenly shrieked wow fred said sitting down next to me on the couch where i had been sitting there hugging my knees pathetically having a nerves attack you re even worse than ange you would know hu i cocked an eyebrow he laughed and rubbed my back you ll be fiiiiiiine i just stared at him now you re just mocking me dontmake me get wood whatdoes oliver got to do with anything well i think that the fact that i both your captain i think i have a say in things especially things concerning the final three i shrieked interrupting oliver who had just walking into the common room i slapped my hand over my mouth i really have to stop doing that fred laughed and stood up weeeeeeeell i going to find ange and with that he sauntered out the portrait hole oliver chuckled as he took his seat next to me meanwhile i had resumed hugging my legs and staring wide eyed at the fireless fireplace kat three oliver started to chuckle how is this funny the last word came out in a bit of a squeak think about it he said i dontthink i ve ever seen you so nervous pfft i managed to get out and since when are you so calm about a match he put his arms around me and pulled me closer to him planting a kiss in my hair we will be fine i promise i took one deep breath and let it all out in one big sigh who knows maybe we will be fine march 19 friday 10 aka right after oliver made the whole team march up to bed who knows maybe we will be fine did i really say that really because that doesntsound so right at the moment because the moment my hands are shaking as i write in this stupid notebook my parents gave to write my teenage thoughts in i dontthink i going to be able to sleep i have already voiced this to lic and ange really katie lic groaned we ll be fine how are you so sure we have a firebolt ange said really slow as we changed into out pajamas and we are the best team ever end of story i sat down on the edge of my bed i really didnthave any idea what was wrong with me i had never been so nervous about anything in my whole life hell last year i practiced with lance proffesional team for an hour or so and i wasntshaking at all but here i am send readings of the rector scale i guess i should try and get some sleep ange and lic both volunteered to knock me out if need be i really hope it doesntcome to that we are chasers for a reason ok i wanted to speed this chap up a bit because i promising to give you an awesome chapter next time around i promise and sorry for giving you some crappy fluff there will be much more and better fluff in the next chap and all that jazz you all like to hear and katie will gain her composure now for the reviews this time around i wontbe too picky but i would just like to say that i love long reviews with a quote from the chap and reason why or why not you did not like it i just saying hint hint nudge nudge and the longer the review the faster the update oh my god so many great reviews i insert big overwhelming heart here my reviewers but now i have to blow you all away in this chapter which is the final yeah i know all my rambling in the chap lead up to this point so expect the main line of the final from what you ve read but be sure to look out for those special little tid bits i shall be adding and making my own march 20 saturday 6 15 am aka just four hours before the gulp final so you re probably wondering why i up at such an ungodly hour on such a nerve racking day yes the day of the final gah well it all started at about 2 in the morning where i had finally started to drift off to sleep kat someone said softly in a low voice i ignored them i had been lying in bed awake for the past four hours and when sleep finally comes knocking on your door you are more than welcome to forget everything else and focus on getting it to come in and stay a while kat please wha i asked groggily shifting my covers so they were around my shoulders even more i was on my side my back to whoever was talking to me it oliver so wha i told you sleep was important um this is going to sound weird but er would you mind if i uh slept with you tonight what obviously he had my full attention at that point i had flipped over onto my back propping myself up on my elbows get your mind out of the gutter bell he smiled lopsidedly then he started to scratch the back of his head it just that i well i cantget to sleep and i er thought well uh could i the fact that he had started to trip over his words and that his hair was more messed up than normal from no doubt trying to go to sleep tossing and turning and the fact that if he didntget any sleep we were screwed lead me to giving in one word to either of them i said jerking my head in my teammates snoring direction and heads will roll fair enough he agreed so i scotched over and he climbed and that was awkward let me tell you on minute i was trying to get some sleep tossing and turning by myself and next oliver is sleeping with me god that sounds weird with am arm wrapped around my waist holding my close up against him and dontget me wrong he is very comfy and i love him very much but you understand the awkwardness dontyou i mean my four poster bed has two pillows i sleep double pillowed so i had to fork one over to oliver not cool kat he asked after a while practically whispering in my ear what do you think i rolled over so i was facing him his arm never leaving it place around my waist while his other was underneath the pillows we are going to win i said and quickly tapped his head twice knock on wood i saw him smile i knew that would do it do you really think so he asked suddenly holding me even closer how often do i lie just short of never and how often do i get away with it never good i concluded so when i say we are going to win we are going to win i stated firmly and surely not anywhere near knowing where all this confidence came from thanks kat he whispered eh i smiled that what i here for he smiled back before kissing me you have got to love him and if you don t we re getting your help shortly and just sit still while we put this nice white jacket with locks and stuff on you eventually we fell asleep thank god he was on his side hugging me while my head was nestled in his chest but he left like 15 minutes ago wha where are you doing i asked as he started to shift around a quarter to six i have to go he said settling back down for just a second no you don t i said grabbing the white tee shirt he was wearing around the waist and nestling back into him god he is comfortable but i have to kat he persisted but relaxing again no you don t i repeated my eyes still closed just stay a little bit longer i donteven want to know what would happen if your kind roomies woke up right now and the final in four hours i dontcare leave in four hours then i moaned still refusing to let him go we have to eat and get ready though so scratch four hours and how about 3 hours and 55 minutes ka at no kat i said no please kat it still a no he started to chuckle and wrapped his arms around me again but i really have to go back to my dorm why do i think that you dontbelieve that because i dontwant to he said placing a kiss on my hair line and i sighed contently but i do have to fine i said sitting up but you didnthave to wake me up too sure i said that more harshly then i should ve but he just took two very important things away from me sleep and a very comfy spot to sleep and three if you want to count oliver sorry about that oliver said sitting down behind me and letting me rest against him like that one time before quidditch practice final why dontyou try and get back to sleep i would i sighed if it was any other day but as you kindly reminded me the final i felt him go tense at the f word is in four hours and there is no chance in hell i ll be able to sleep with that rampaging through my mind sorry he said sympathetically again but try will you i ll try i moaned i love you he said placing a kiss on my hair line i love you more i grinned not possible highly doubtful no not really impossible happened but i ahead but i winning bu but that makes no sense think about it he said planting another kiss this time on my temple and getting up so now you left me high and dry practically sleepless with something to think about i asked as he wandered over towards the dorm door real nice i fell back into my pillows as he let out a soft chuckle and left march 21 sunday practically 4 am oh my god we won we won the final we won the quidditch cup we won the cup most freaking amazing fantastic wonderful glorious happiest jump up and down several times over unbelievable can t believe it happened day ever and yes i could keep going with the adjectives but i ve got to get to the point sooner or later you up too katie ange said as i came out of the bathroom not 20 minutes after oliver left lic was just coming out of her own groggy stupor as well yeah i said my voice not faltering or shaking at all my god lic said barely able to utter her words the final in 4 hours almost three now i said glancing at my watch which said 6 52 ange let out a cry no doubt from nerves and lic groaned inwardly c mon you guys i said somehow smiling we re going to win how can you be so sure because i have complete confidence in everyone on our team i said wondering if a pep talk was on the verge of escaping my lips we ve worked too hard and too long too many hours on that pitch being ordered around by a quidditch nazi to lose out there today we already cashed in on our loss against hufflepuff and i wontlet that happen again against slytherin in three hours even if i have to play every god damn position on my own you ve seen me whack a bludger dontthink for one second that i cantpull it off this got a faint smile out of all of them as i wondered where the hell i was getting this oliver given pep talk at 7 in the morning no less now get your stuff on we ll go get some breakfast and after that we re going to kick those snake asses so hard they re going to wonder if it was a bludger that hit them that hard and with new enthusiasm we got dressed and went down to go get some breakfast where oliver was forcing everyone to eat but not chewing on anything himself so i did what every good friend teammate girlfriend would do ka ah at chew and swallow that toast right down he gulped down the toast i had literally shoved in his mouth shortly followed by the orange juice kat what no i dontwant eggs kat will you sto you have to eat something he rolled his eyes and was suddenly staring intently at harry he knows to wait until we re 50 points i started potter eat harry smiled at me as i rolled my eyes how about you finish your eggs and i ll take a stab at the oatmeal fair enough harry did eat though but oliver cantpretend that he didntdrop his eggs on the floor by accident no one hand can slip that much okay no wind to speak of sun a bit bright that could impair your vision watch out for it oliver said as he paced the field in front of us not ten minutes before the game was due to start yeah you ve got to watch out for that sun fred muttered you never know when it going to light up george added in the same fashion me lic and ange were barely able to stifle a small laugh but either oliver didnthear them or chose to ignore them ground fairly hard good that ll give us a fast kickoff oliver continued now studying the grass and dirt rather than the sky locker rooms he said as the front doors of the school opened and all the students made their way to the pitch and it seemed like in no time oliver was ushering us out into the field we re going to do great guys he said tensely almost hoarsely as he held the locker room door open for each of us just fly you re best oliver i said as i came out i was the last one calm down calm down he repeated he seemed slightly jumpy ok maybe more than slightly why would i need to calm down i fine i cocked an eyebrow at him you re practically jumping out of your robes try taking one big deep breath i added happily or as happy as i could muster we are going to win i said as we walked towards the entrance where we always fly out onto the pitch from oliver letting out his breath it a good thing you never lie he said giving me a small grin as the banner in front of us was lifted and we flew out into the pitch i beamed at all of the griffindor supporting banners a bunch of go griffindor and lions for the cup ones and that littered the stands as lee commentated us in and here are the griffindors lee yelled into the magic mic potter bell johnson spinnet weasley weasley and wood widely acknowledged as the best team hogwarts has seen in a good few years i beamed at our new found title as the slytherins booed at one end of the field and here comes the slytherin tea led by captain flint scum bag sorry couldntresist he made some changes in the lineup and seems to be going for size rather than skill the slytherins continued to boo and i glanced over to ange and lic who were nodding in agreement along with me scumbag flint had put together a rather hulky team malfoy was the smallest one there but size never made any difference to us though i swear oliver and flint were trying to break off each other fingers when madame hooch made them shake hands if it wasntso serious i would ve laughed but i allowed myself a fleeting smile soon after madame blew her whistle for us to mount and kickoff it was easy to tell that this would be the dirtiest game in hogwarts history i donteven think i could tally up all the fouls and it griffindor in possession lee said after lic came up with the quaffle after the toss alicia spinnet of griffindor with the quaffle heading straight for the slytherin goal posts looking good alicia argh no quaffle intercepted by warrington i screamed out what at this as warrington had tried to kick me off my broom as he intercepted the quaffle i was slightly confused on wither or not we were calling fouls today warrington of slytherin tearing up the field wham nice bludger work there by fre george weasley warrington drops the quaffle it caught by bell griffindor back in possession bell passes it off to johnson come on angelina nice swerve around montague duck angelina that a bludger she scores ten zero to griffindor and that when the game got dirty flint slammed into angelina after her usual i m punching the air because i just got a goal go me sorry sorry flint said as everyone booed didntsee her didntsee her my ass i muttered to myself i was going to get him back myself but fred beat me to it you see fred kinda hit flint in the back of the head with his bat no not a bludger his bat i sent a lopsided smile at fred as madame blew her whistle and flint nose started to bleed all over his slimy green robes both teams got a penalty shot lic got hers through but of course oliver saved his course wood a superb keeper lee said as flint waited for madame whistle for flint to take his shot superb very difficult to pass very difficult indeed yes i dontbelieve it he saved it of course lee because it is very difficult indeed to pass him oliver passed to quaffle off to lic with a look at me i did it now i m all proud of myself smile plastered on his face as the three of us streaked down the field griffindor in possession no slytherin in possession no griffindor back in possession and it katie bell oh yeah go me katie bell for griffindor with the quaffle she streaking up the field that was deliberate no that was a dozy out of nowhere montague had swerved in front of me and i could ve gotten away too if he went for the quaffle rather than my head and sent me into an aerial cartwheel sure i managed to stay on my broom but i also lost the quaffle c mon madame ange screamed over the crowd blow the whistle lic added just as disgruntled and madame finally blew the whistle and after a second of forcing myself to see straight and put my head back on right i took my penalty shoot and it sailed through courtesy of the nazi back breaking work thirty zero take that you dirty cheating truer words were never spoken jordan if you cantcommentate in an unbiased way apparently mcgonagall and i werenton the same page i just telling it like it is professor the game went on and at one point i saw the two slytherin beaters crash into each other confused by flint odd tactics i shrugged it off and continued down the field ha haaa lee yelled as the beaters untangled themselves from each other holding their heads too bad boys you ll need to get up earlier than that to beat a firebolt and it griffindor in possession again as johnson takes the quaffle flint alongside her poke him in the eye angelina it was a joke professor it was a joke oh no flint in possession flint flying toward griffindor toward the griffindor goal posts come on now wood save but damn flint scored i sent oliver a just shrug it off crooked grin as the slytherins cheered and lee swore you god damn son of a bitches sorry professor sorry lee said so quickly after his mouthing off that i doubt mcgonagall had yet to say something wonthappen again soooooooooo griffindor in the lead thirty points to ten and griffindor in possession and and what the hell is that i had signaled to ange and lic to do that tornado play thingy that we never really properly named and it went perfectly i figured oliver needed some cheering up after that shot i knew he could ve gotten not that i worry about things like that though the keeper had no idea what was going on he was looking at lic as i casually sent it through on his other side with not recognition by him it was pretty funny i laughed as fred and george had high fived each other with their bats and oliver punched the air down the field while the three of us congratulated each other with huge smiles but after that things got even dirtier lic got hit in the head by bole bat him claiming that her dark haired heard was a bludger with a ponytail or something like that and then george elbowed bole in the face for no doubt messing with his girl actually sweet if you think about it each team got a penalty shot and as a superb keeper who is very difficult to pass never going to let lee live that down especially the voice he put on it saved the goal while the slytherin keeper is obviously much easier to get by so by then the score was forty ten us in the lead and after i scored shortly after it was fifty ten and in fear of me getting knocked off my broom or something the twins were circling me with their bats raised like vultures guys i fine i said firmly to the two of them not taking chances george replied just go watch everyone else but by then both slytherin beaters had pelted both bludgers straight at oliver they got him right in the stomach one after the other and he rolled over in the air trying to catch his breath back after all the wind in his body had been knocked out of him how the man actually stayed on his broom is still a mystery to me what is this i screamed as oliver regained his composure play dirty day the twins stared at me well it takes two to tango buster i waved my hands in the air going down field where ange was taking the penalty shot for oliver ange made the shot and we were up sixty ten after that fred had pelted a bludger at warrington who dropped the quaffle which practically landed in lic hands adrian pucey was marking her closely and i feed my large need for retaliation by swooping down on him literally i had came from above alicia and bashed down onto pucey with my shoulder and guess what it was all legal no matter how long pucey screamed about it as lic made another goal 70 10 it was clean that what i thought and not to mention the fouls that were actual fouls that madame didntsee like punching flint in the face elbowing montague in the stomach so hard he doubled over and madame thought he was sick and let please not forget almost castrating flint like i had promised that one time i was blocking him with the nose of my broom so new rule it only illegal if madame catches you meanwhile the whole griffindor supporting crowd was screaming hysterics and i wontbe surprised if three houses wake up tomorrow with laryngitis we were up by 60 if harry caught the snitch now we had the cup i turned and looked at harry to see the most ridiculous thing harry reaching for the snitch which was not twenty feet above him i was going to scream with joy at winning and then malfoy hurtling himself onto harry broom causing the snitch to get away i think everybody swore to the high heavens at that moment in time especially lee you cheating scum i saw him dancing away from mcgonagall who was swearing herself i saw you filthy cheating son of a bitch and a bastard i almost laughed but that thought went away as lic missed her penalty shoot i was just so mad she said obviously disappointed at herself dontworry about it i said encouragingly giving her a strong pat on the back we ll get it right back i know it she smiled and we went back down the field but the slytherins seemed to be fueled by malfoy damn foul slytherin in possession slytherin heading fro goal montague scores lee groaned along with the rest of the crowd 70 20 to griffindor angelina johnson gets the quaffle for griffindor come on angelina come on i was cheering her on herself not 5 brooms lengths behind her but then i realized every single slytherin player was heading towards her even the keeper just to block her ange heads up i screamed i dontknow if she actually heard me but practically my brother harry came streaking out of no where and scattered all of them for her to score that child is a god send or so i thought as he skidded to a halt right at the base of the stands until i saw malfoy pelting down the field with the snitch not far ahead of him harry i screamed he snapped his head towards me and i pointed without looking go i would like to say one thing before i go into excruciating detail on how he caught the snitch that firebolt is fast it went from nothing to about a bagillion miles and hour in two seconds flat now to the good part harry go me ange and lic screamed urging him on as he laid flat on his broom somehow they ended up on either side of me harry got more and more level with malfoy who had his arm stretched out to catch the snitch harry took both hands off his broom swatted malfoy hands away and caught the snitch oh my god i cried out first we won eeeeeeee lic squealed as well as ange howled yes howled with joy and i threw the quaffle straight up in the air as we pelted towards harry along with the twins we were all hugging each other and i saw oliver streak down the field towards us with his arms held open all teary eyed towards us i think he was strangling harry as he practically sobbed into the poor kid shoulder somewhere in the crowd i saw a huge flash as we yelled our self hoarse and sank to the ground in a many tangled armed hug after that everyone in the stands who was clad in scarlet poured onto the pitch i couldnttell you how many people slapped me on the back honestly all i remember was running up to oliver jumping on him so my legs were wrapped around his waist and kissing him oliver wood i said looking at his teary face after i slid off him are you crying no he shook his head tears rolling down his beaming face are you no i shook my own head as he wiped a tear away with one of his thumbs i practically threw myself on him as i kissed him my arms around his neck people around us were ooooooooooooooooooh ing but who gives a damn oi wood someone said grabbing oliver by the back of his robe and pulling him away from me c mon let go get that dman cup already ange said me and professor mcgonagall werentthe only ones crying along with oliver as he passed the cup to harry who lifted that blessed silver thing up after that all seven of us were instantly lifted up onto everyone shoulders and carried up to the common room where a party instantly began instantly excellent job bell way to cap the season off knew you d get them snakes katie here here jeez guys i said winding my way around the packed common room with a butterbeer in one hand and my broom with my pads strapped on it in the other thanks a bunch but it was a team effort you know couldntdo it without them when have i ever received so much attention you might ask the answer n e ver kates i instantly found myself in a twin sandwich and i was in the middle ugh guys i groaned trying to keep my butterbeer upright and my broom from snapping in half c mon leggo of our favorite chaser george asked dontyou two have girlfriends good point they both said letting go at the same time oi katie ange screamed from the couch twisting and craning her neck so she could see me i was somewhat behind the couch where out freaking scottish kilt wearing son of a bitch captain oliver i took a quick scan of the common room i have no idea well that nothing new i heard lic yell from next to ange on the couch by the way she added turning around too could you throw my broom in our dorm before i could answer the two of them both tossed me their brooms which also had their pads strapped on them well since you gave me so many choices i laughed before running up to our dorm and putting our brooms on my bed now where the hell is oliver i muttered to myself scanning the common room again as i came down the stairs check his dorm someone said quickly from my left i looked where the voice came from and realized it was percy who was currently lip locked with penelope next to the staircase i was standing at the bottom of i shuddered before walking by to get to oliver dorm oh and percival i said as i walked by he opened one eye to look at me and i gave him and exaggerated thumbs up and fake smile he glared at me with one eye over his glasses as i walked away and up the boys dorm stairs oliver i asked knocking on his dorm door and opening it slightly you in here i peeked my head inside thank god he was there otherwise i would ve lost complete track of him not like that new or anything though he was sitting on the edge of his bed still clad in complete uniform without pads like me and had his head in his hands which was propped up on his knees ol i asked concerned shutting the door not quite all the way behind me are you are you oka within those three seconds he had took three long strides from his bed to where i was standing in front of the door and pressed his lips against mine pulling my hair out of the ponytail it was in i smiled faintly against his lips as he shut the door behind me and pushed my back flat up against it as i heard the handle lock click into place he pushed my long scarlet robe off my shoulders leaving me in the rugby shirt pants and shoes while keeping his lips on mine and grinding his hips lightly against mine and of course i returned the favor and then without breaking the connection i somehow ended up beneath him on his bed kat he said breaking apart positively beaming from ear to ear and eyes shining his voice dry from screaming himself hoarse earlier we won i noticed i giggled wait a second i giggled giggled i slapped my hand over my mouth before i giggled again did you giggle oliver chuckled i shook my head furiously i think you did he said grabbing my hand and intertwining his fingers with mine i never giggle i pointed out still shaking my head mmmhmm he murmured against my lips kissing me again and he sent shivers up my spine as he pressed his finger against my stomach beneath my rugby shirt it was like a spine shivering massage as his thumbs traced circles pressing hard then soft hard then soft all in these circles on the sides of my stomach it was not fair so i had to get him back i slid my hand down the back of his shirt and i lightly pressed down on each bump of his vertebra starting from the base of his neck to as far as i could reach his chest rumbled in a growl and i smiled for finally being able to do something to him hey are you two in there someone who sounded very much like george weasley screamed banging on the door of course they re in there someone else who just might be fred said after what was no doubt a thump on his twin head oliver and i broke apart to look at the door for a moment maybe they ll go away i suggested hopefully i can hear you katherine ann bell stop snogging our captain and get out here so i guess lic had followed george up ugh i groaned he started it oliver looked down at me quizzically well you did hurry up god the collection of the people outside the door just keeps growing oliver and i both groaned as we got up and straightened up hurry i rolled my eyes and opened the door to find ange lic george fred and even harry in the doorway do you want something come downstairs they all said pulling me and oliver downstairs what the rush i asked nothing in particular harry said we just couldntimagine you snogging our captain for another minute lic offered up because that was exactly what you were doing ange finished pfft ugh err he started it it takes two to tango oliver called from behind me true enough but you did start it now to the party in the common room it was the best ever i have never seen so much candy and butterbeer in my whole life obviously it was just starting when i was down there before and it lasted for e ver no really it did ok so maybe until at least three in the morning isntforever but if felt pretty damn close not that i am not happy about winning the cup mcgonagall had said when she marched into the common room clad in sleeping gown night cap bathrobe slippers and all in the early morning but sleep certainly sounds like a good idea dontyou agree no someone muttered here here fred said suddenly jumping on the couch and chugging his butterbeer after a slight toast mr weasley mcgonagall groaned please spare me no dontmake me give you detention darson mcgonagall said tiredly apparently darson decided to shut up very good she continued i going to need my rest for when i going to have a little chat with severus and i suggest you all do the same we all groaned as we trudged up the stairs to our dorms i got into my pajamas and was about to fall asleep when ange and lic jumped on me oi vey i groaned beneath them what do you two want we won they squealed oh god ok peoples that the big chapter i hope you all loved it and since i know you all loved it i need long reviews this was a freaking long chapter even if i wasntso sure how to end it there but katie pep talk donteven ask where that came from and i expect reviews from everyone even the people that only review once every five chapters you all have to review for this one ok and same thing as last time long and with a quote now go press that damn periwinkle button and give me a long review jeez i love you all i just have to clear a few things up 1 you all seemed to think that the last chapter was the last chapter which it obviously wasntbecause i am writing this i promise i will give you a heads up when the end is coming up which will be the day oliver graduates which is a decently long time so no worries 2 jeez i write one little scene and half of you go all haywire on me guys this is rated teen not mature now say it with me teen and i can barely keep up with the current rating with my rare and mild cursing so get your minds out of the gutters you silly silly reviewers may 21 sunday noon well all seven of us are in the most euphoriatic state ever visited by man kind we have absolutely no idea what to do with ourselves but write letters to every household in our families telling them in excruciating detail how we won honestly that all we ve been doing lazing around under the oak tree by the lake writing letters and basking the in the glory that our back breaking work finally paid off to and not to mention that we keep repeating what happened over and over and over and over again in our heads i think the game is still going on may 22 monday transfiguration ok so you know the deal yup after four of back breaking work we have finally won the quidditch cup and no the euphoria probably will not wear off for a good month and do you know what else the seven of us are considered in every room through out the castle well with the exception of the slytherin common room i suppose but that such an unimportant spot on in the castle so i really dontgive a damn hey katie you got a quill i could borrow i ve got a charms test er yeah just gimme a second jeez ol i laughed the last bit within the two seconds i had taken to stop in the hall during the class switch between charms and transfiguration to lend roger davies a quill oliver had ambushed me i was just minding my business rummaging through my bag trying to find a quill when oliver came from behind me quite out of no where wrapping his arms around my waist and nestling his mouth and nose into my right collar bone from behind hey wood how you doing these days roger eh got a charms test how bout you no complaints here you go roger i said giving him one of my better aka longer quills as he laughed thanks bell he said thankfully and congratulations again he called over his shoulder as he walked towards his class now if only i could get to mine on time that would be a plus but since we are talking about me here and my normal day luck ran out years ago the bell rang and the few students left in the hall sprinted to their classes except me oliver oliver you know i have mcgonagall now and he murmured into my collar bone still holding me close to him aaand it mcgonagall so cut it mcgonagall and i know you have dada what your point i sighed half heartedly oliver not that i didntenjoy him holding me so my back was flush up against him or that he was planting kisses on the base of neck but we are talking about mcgonagall here i know he never been happier and that he would stare at the cup that officially has his name along with ours on it for ages but c mon oliver we re talking about mcgonagall here she the freaking headmistress oliver i really have to get to class do you have to he was swaying side to side slightly damn him yeeees damn classes please don t damn him but it transfig damn classes but you re good in that class damn him what your point damn class you dontneed to go oh damn him i slumped a bit oliver i cantcut and now i really late somehow i managed to squirm out of his arms that took a lot of will power oliver moaned as i gave him an apologetic smile i almost forgot how good he made the school uniform look he was just wearing the dockers buttoned shirt and gray vest with his tie loosened and his hair was messy as always and he was giving me those big brown eyes with his shoulders dropped an attempt to make me stay oh c mon i said giving him a hug and wrapping my arms around his neck you re going to see me at lunch but i going to miss you he said mocking a little kids voice on they re first day of kindergarten snaking his arms around my waist jeez ol it only like three periods i laughed but you could i not cutting i said firmly giving him a kiss now i really have to get to class i added once we broke apart alright he sighed exasperatedly i guess i ll try and survive for three more periods kat less i sure you ll be fine i laughed heading towards my certain doom miss bell how nice of you to show up mcgonagall said as i slinked in and sat next to lic i sorry professor i gave her an apologetic smile as i took out my books funny though i didntget detention or points deducted oh wait that right i a god that what i though oh snap ok i admit it i have been owling back and forth to my cousin joe you remember him at the ball remember long curly brown hair and brown eyes who goes to that italian wizarding school the one my grandma wanted me to go to for a week or so and apparently he taken a liking to american slang honestly though every letter i get from him starts with gurl cuz i love him and all but there is a limit joe after dinner jesus joe i laughed after classes as i read joe most recent letter i was sitting on the couch in the common room wearing a pair of jeans one of the quidditch warm up tee and barefoot oh and for a change i had my hair in pigtail braids and i was wearing a scarlet griffindor cap that had a gold lion on it obviously i have no idea what urged me to wear pigtail braids and a baseball hat because normally i look terrible in both but it seemed to work with my random spur of griffindor pride and joe letter was hysterical to the only member in our oversized family who can understand my school troubles katherine ann bell you sometimes i think you are the only one who ever understands me gurl cuz try to tell something to mom just do your homework and you better get good grades your owls were not up to par last year and you know how her voice gets all whiny and high pitched try and tell something to dad i suuuuuure you ll be fiiiiiiine just do what your mother says thanks for that fatherly wise advice pops lance joe you should know by now that if it not quidditch i have no clue what a great older cuz lemme tell you that no offense but how come lance is such a dud he your brother do something about it but i guess i should tell you the real reason for pestering the whole of our family with letters and owls there is this one whack witch who will not leave me alone for the life of me everything was freaking fine we were friends we hung out after my quidditch practice she explained transfig to me we laughed with the rest of our friends next thing i know it joe this and joe that and joe come over here i ve tried shaking her off i ve tried hiding i ve tried being really annoying which is not too hard for me but she keeps following me katie i need your help oh and the random american slang phrase of the letter sup home fry king of god help me get rid of camellia and your fav boi cuz joseph ricardo rizzatti aka joe i dontknow why but i found this particularly funny poor joe he finally getting some unwanted attention from the italian witches and he has no idea what to do with himself he probably pulling out his curly hair not that he hasnthad girlfriends or something he has but they ve always been nice and cot clingy or anything but this one is obviously getting on his nerves it actually quite fun to watch read joe lose it what so funny oliver asked sitting down so he was behind me and holding me close to him so my back was flush against his chest again joe i said through light laughs letting him read the letter joe sent me joe your cousin oh wait your boi cuz he asked repeating what joe had wrote the one and only i laughed american slang he chuckled reading over the letter yeah i continued to laugh lightly leaning back against him more go figure hey captain fred and george said as they bounded in ooooooooh waaaaaaaaaait fred said obviously realizing something he cantboss us around anymore which means captain rights just flew out the window george said triumphantly sooooooooo fred said innocently ollie how things ollie oliver asked you two haventcalled me that for two years they chorused we know but we figured we better get some mileage out of it fred started seeing as your leaving at the end of the year his twin finished ouch that hit home nice to remind me guys very nice everything was hunky dory until they came in and practically shouted the g word and the whole castle knows that that word is just as touchy to me as owls is i sighed as the two of them bounded to their dorms what wrong oliver asked concerned nothing i said not sounding convincing at all as i shook my head ka at woodsie kinns where are all these nicknames coming from he asked exasperatedly flopping down so that he was laying down quidditch seasons past i supplied moving around so that i was laying on top of him must be he chuckled with a sigh putting his hands on my waist what wrong i asked cocking my head to the sigh nothing he sighed again ok something is definitely wrong i concluded what makes you think that he asked with his brow furrowed you just sighed twice in 10 seconds i stated quite bluntly something is wrong it just that that he searched for words the only way i ll be able to talk to you next year is the same way your cousin is now what do you oooohhhhhhhh i said finally understanding it not so bad as long as i get one everyday of my school life i think i ll be able to manage i smiled and see you every weekend at hogsmeade he looked at me critically at my demands and i poked him in the chest once or twice hey you choose this relationship too buddy he laughed at this and i have no idea why i know his laugh dying down and i wouldnttrade it for any other i smile as he pulled me down to him and kissed me how many times do we have to tell them that there are first years running around more than your current record i smiled cheekily looking up at ange and lic as me and oliver sat up and they re upstairs before you ask it was true both of them had their mouths open about to talk but they closed them and smiled before going to find fred and george yes i can read my friends like a book just as easily as they can read me oh snap take that booyah joe has really got to stop telling me more american slang may 23 tuesday 7 30 pm how the twins managed to survive school this far i will never know where have to two been oliver asked as the twins came into the common room after not showing up for dinner oh we had detention fred said smiling you see george said with an identical smile without your constant threats we have more leeway with our lives what do you mean by that lic asked from the couch looking up from her book me oliver lic and ange were all sitting around in the common room when the twins bounded in oliver was sitting in one of the arm chairs as i leaned against his legs from the floor as i tried to beat ange who was sitting at one end of the coffee table at a game of chess and lic was sitting on the couch reading a book it your turn katie yeeeeeeaaaaah ange agreed looking up from our game what do you mean by that ladies ladies fred said in his oh so smooth voice that he hopes will calm down ange what we meant is that we no longer have to live in fear of getting detention since when have you two been worried about detention i asked staring pretty much blankly at the chess board in front of me as the pieces shouted directions at me just move the damn rook my black king shouted at me well it aaaaaaall about you isntit the rook challenged well we do lose with me gone we re going to lose anyway with this numskull giving out directions i think we should listen to the fair maiden one of the knights offered oh stop being a goody two shoes will the lot of you be quiet i said in an angry hushed whisper to my pieces what we mean kates dearest fred continued is that we no longer have to live in fear of the aftermath of detention or rather george picked up oliver rage when he finds out we are going to have to miss practice so where is this all going oliver asked trying to hide a smile well i pretty sure it leads us up to why we got detention fred said and it is funny george said so we decided to share it with everyone will all members of the greatest quidditch team in the school in centuries please assemble near the coffee table george bellowed suddenly standing up on the coffee table sending me and ange pieces flying but we re all here lic said obviously confused by her boyfriends actions harry isn t george said matter of factly harry fred shouted now standing next to his brother on the coffee table dontthink we dontsee you hiding in that corner over there you canthide behind hermione hair forever what going on harry asked as he sat down on the couch next to lic we have something we would like to share fred said proudly what is this harry asked show and tell the twins looked proudly at him with his witty comeback basically they chorused now george said the whole reason we got in detention is because we were writing something very funny up very funny fred agreed and we decided to share it with our dear friends friends of at least five years because we know you will enjoy it very much obviously we did it george looked at his twin do you mind fred pretended to look hurt and george sighed before going on what we were writing in mcgonagall class before we got detention was profiles for all of us what do you mean ange asked here we ll show you we ll do yours first fred said pulling out a piece of parchment i angelina sarah johnson griffindor chaser he read you can try and wake me up in the morning but dontbe surprised if you get a bloody nose or if i not really up after all i famous for giving out shirts with snappy sayings mainly because i in awe of such master minded genius which maybe why you can almost always find me in a broom closet with a certain dashingly red headed weasley twin we all cracked up hysterically due to the truthfulness of it all what mine lic asked through laughs read mine i alicia marie spinnet griffindor chaser fred read off a different piece of parchment i may look all innocent with my big dark eyes but dontthink i have a collection of my choice words i think that anyone who has ever been in the pitch at fucking 3 in the damn morning with us knows what i mean but i do love moonlight walks on the beach with a candle lit dinner harry turn george said over our laughs pulling out another profile well i harry james potter griffindor seeker sure i may the the boy who lived but many know me as that scrawny seeker guy with the firebolt mcgonagall probably doesntknow that i made lee advertise my firebolt aka my claim to fame but what the hell right and according to hermione someday i going to end up as a boring book on a dusty shelf sounds like a nice quiet life after oliver army like training regimen kates turn fred bellowed i katherine ann bell griffindor chaser but god knows i have several nicknames such as katie kates kat bell and on special occasions katie kinns i may be a damn good chaser but mainly i known for two things 1 biting me quills to a stump people have told me i did this because i had built up anxiety of not being able to snog oliver senseless for the past three years but i still do it and now they say it because he not around to snog senseless and 2 putting oliver in the hospital wing which i deathly afraid of for a day with my superb beating skills i pride myself of my quidditch aptitude do oliver ange shrieked through her laughs as oliver pulled me up off the floor and into his lap do oliver oh yes george said pulling out a final piece of paper our dearest captain would you like to do the honors my dear twin oh no fred said i think we should do it together fair enough fair enough i oliver wood griffindor quidditch team captain and keeper i obsessed with winning i d donate my own mother to science if it meant i d win the quidditch cup my insane desire to dominate the game bugs the hell out of the people around me and i have been called a quidditch nazi on several occasions by my loving team but hey i want to see my name on that damn cup other than that i pretty damn cool yeah the twins chorused so is that how we won harry asked oliver could only shake his head no because he was laughing too hard to speak so what yours he asked the twins ask my twin they chorused 10 pm where do you two come up with that stuff lic asked later you know we canttell you our sources george said slipping an arm around her waist on the couch we were sitting in the same spots as before and me and ange had started a new game of chess why do i even bother with this game i sighed as ange rook took my bishop leaning against oliver legs well maybe if you listened to us the knight snapped well what happened to fair maiden i asked that was before you made us lose our queen who was my devoted lover i blinked a few times number 1 merlin knows that was the last thing i wanted to hear and number 2 dontmake me sacrifice you why you little knight to f2 what you are completely i smirked at the pieces of my snappy knight as ange queen bashed it your turn again katie ange laughed at my previous fight with my knight i just stared at the chess board biting my bottom lip i would like to use one of my life lines regis who regis never mind i said shaking my head and thinking of that muggle show joe had told me about that he had heard about from his friend who was muggle born move your bishop to c5 oliver whispered in my ear he had bent over to scratch his ankle i looked at the chess board bu but then her queen ll take it i muttered oh alright bishop to c5 ok to make a long story short even though ange let oliver talk to me directly without having to scratch his ankle we still lost but we did get her queen damn it woman i laughed as i knocked over my king admitting defeat and check mate why the hell are you so good at chess i really cannot beat her at chess for the life of me it like me trying to get a good grade in potions aka physically impossible ok i would write more but i ve got this volleyball tourney in baltimore i have to get to today thursday so i figured i would throw you guys a bone and give you this chap before i left hope ya like and review the same way as last time haha haha oh god your reviews make me laugh i glad you all loved my famous renditions of american slang and i a new yorker represent holla lol jk jk so it alright for those people who werentsure if i was from the grand ol us of a because i am ok time to stop rambling and start the story again may 24 wednesday 8 pm yeah so i attempting to write a letter back to joe about his girl problems god that sounded weird and so far this is all i got to my fav boi cuz and king of god help me get rid of camellia joseph ricardo rizzatti i would love to be that one kind warm hearted smart person to tell you to just sit down and have a talk with this camellia person tell her the truth and say i would just like to be friends but god knows i could never pull that off so my advice is either completely ignore her give her the ice cold shoulder you pulled on me that one time you got mad at me when we were abandoned at auntie rina for the weekend or be as unattractive as possible you know how to do that burp yawn talk too much and then too little scratch yourself dontbathe as usual you know what i mean and if that doesntwork which means this girl is probably the witch almost every guy dreams of hex her and leave her in a closet if she doesntget the message by then she a bumbling idiot love one of the current seven gods of hogwarts and why in the name of grandma s cooking did you ask for my advice of all people katherine ann bell why do i think this is going to do more harm than good i muttered to myself looking over my letter after i wrote it up in my dorm sitting on my bed in the fifth year girls dorm in the griffindor tower on the seventh floor of hogwarts which is located somewhere in england and if i have to give any more description on where i was sitting i might scream i just groaned and flopped back on my pillow it was after classes and i hadntgotten much sleep last night and it had just dawned on me how comfortable my pillow was at that moment so to make a long story short i stretched out and fell asleep only to be waken up an hour later than none other by our endearing captain i nearly jumped right off my bed oliver yes he pulled that stunt on me again you know the one where i sleeping peacefully minding my own business and then he goes and puts his face about an inch from mine so when i open my sleepy eyes i instantly awake i knew you remembered what he asked in a would be innocent voice what do you think i rebutted still flustered from my wake up i think that you have the prettiest eyes he said his face still inched from mine completely ignoring my somewhat rhetorical question i just gave him a puzzled look well from a distance your eyes look brown but then up close you realize that they re really a dark green with a brown flower around your pupil he explained very pretty oliver i laughed looking into his own shiny chocolate brown eyes what he asked as he flopped down next to me i love you i muttered as i nestled into him damn he comfortable may 25 thursday 4 pm and as you all know you re owls are on june 12 and mcgonagall rambled on there i was sitting in transfiguration doodling nonsense things in my notebook when she drops this bomb on us i instantly sat as straight as a board dropped my quill and my eyes went as far as to bug out katie lic asked in a hushed whisper snapping her fingers in front of my face katie are you in there the owls are in 18 days i said shortly days i said snapping my head towards her what your point ange asked as she continued doodling herself days ange days not weeks not months not years days you re losing it lic said observantly good call i said loudly enough for mcgonagall to take five house points away 9 pm kat so what if i was currently nose to grain with our favorite table in the library right after classes so what if i missed dinner in order to study for the ever growing presence of the owls that i didntnotice until today so what kat oliver asked sitting in the chair next to me and pulling on my shoulders lightly so i was sitting upright god i must ve looked a mess i had been studying for four hours i was still in my uniform which was probably the most disarrayed this castle has ever seen and my hair probably looked like a lion mane peachy aintit are you alright he asked softly a look of concern on his face i bite my bottom lip and grabbed the collar of his robes pulling him so his nose was not even an inch from mine the owls are in 18 days i croaked oliver chuckled and gently pried my death grip of his robes and held my hands him his kat you re going to be fine how do you know i asked skeptically my eyes narrowing a bit i did decent enough on them he smiled warmly and if i can do that so can you really of course you re a much better student than me thanks ol i smiled faintly but but what 18 days oliver laughed before moving his chair closer to mine and helping me thanks ol i said giving him a hug across the shoulders at 8 when we were getting ready to finally leave i really owe you one donti know it i laughed before giving him another hug and a peck on the cheek you know you re the best right he gave me an exasperated sigh yeah i know may 26 friday after dinner i want to have practice the majority of us stared up at oliver blankly it was after classes and we were all sitting in our shorts and tees on this freaking hot day of may and in waltzes oliver telling us he wants to have a practice no lic and ange said never looking up from the magazine they were sharing sitting next to each other on the couch but look at the words he uses fred said across the chessboard from me i want to have practice not we are having practice i want to have practice which means we can say no with out fear of death or disembodiment george said from next to me on the floor we teamed up against fred because he had beat both our butts on several occasions no wonder him and ange are together they re each others only real competition in this game and therefore no the twins chorused kat i was staring at the chessboard biting my bottom lip god knows i suck a chess and that my only strategy is to make random moves and try try not to get killed so my point is i didnthear oliver in my extreme state of thought but i vaguely remember oliver practically picking george up by the collar of his shirt and dropping him in the near by chair and i do remember him basically getting on hands and knees and begging on my right where george just was kat please suddenly aware of his presence and the fact that his left hand was resting on my shoulder and gripping my patriots tee and his right was on my bent knee i snapped my head towards him and damn it he was giving me puppy eyes puppy eyes do you know how unfair that is and he has chocolate brown eyes that is such an advantage oh ol you know puppy eyes is cheating i moaned as his eyes got even bigger or as i imagined them to get bigger he moved around so he was sitting behind me with his legs on either side of me and wrapped his left arm around my waist as the other mysteriously found it way to my lower back under my shirt and for no apparent reason started tracing little circles with the tips of his fingers and he didntstop i tried to ignore the fact that this was sending my nerve endings racing around and sending signals to my brain to stop playing chess and just snog the man senseless but merlin knows i cantdo that how do you ignore something like that ooooohhh i groaned in defeat everybody go get your damn brooms and get out to the pitch i said as i myself stood up and went to go get mine why dontyou just snog her into doing everything wood i heard ange say half heartedly that was cheating the twins chorused i refuse fred said fifteen minutes later as i handed him his beater bat i blatantly refuse fine i said placing my hands on my hips still holding the bat i guess i ll have to be a beater no six voices instantly yelled from where ever they were in the pitch kates just give me the bat before a bludger comes fred said in a what would be coaxing voice nice and easy now just take it fred i said thrusting it into his stomach so exactly what are we going to do harry asked scrimmage i offered 3 v 3 and i guess you can just grab the snitch for who ever is winning at the moment ok ok ange said but i get fred and i get george lic called as she came over yeah but i m oliver started was the twins chorused smiling innocently at the glare oliver sent them i the captain so i get to he continued you dontget to make the teams we all shouted at once so i get katie ange said quickly not fair lic cried then i stuck with oliver what do you mean stuck with me oliver asked practically fuming you re the one who wanted to have practice i pointed out yeah he asked his features and voice softening as he whispered in my ear as ange and lic still bickered well you started it damn him i hate it when he puts on that voice it makes it just short of impossible to snog him so hard that he cantwalk straight be strong katie be strong and resist the urge resist no no i said softly i believe you were the one who started it it amazing how they can make any sentence suggestive fred commentated to his twin i know george agreed will you say spoon suggestively for me oh just get in the air oliver yelled getting on his broom and taking off and let just start this already ange and lic stopped their bickering why are his boxers all in a twist lic asked because they re not the quidditch ones i said without missing a beat smirking like there was no tomorrow no they re not and what if they are oliver yelled down at us too much information lic shrieked great ange muttered as she got on her own broom now i have perfect mental images of wood in quidditch boxers just great you cheated oh please we did not yes you did you cannot just handle the fact that we beat you three times in a row only because you cheated three hours after playing against each other i bet you ll be surprised to know that me and oliver werentthe ones fighting for a change yup that right it was lic and fred going at it but because the fact that they re not a couple doesntmake it nearly as interesting personally i kinda glad it wasntange and fred going at because they seem to fix these things by suddenly eating each other faces off speaking of which ange literally came out of nowhere and started eating fred face off so i guess it her fault these things happen my eyes lic shrieked her hands instantly finding a secure place clamped over her eyes i sent oliver a look of confusion currently we were standing in a state of shock with him using me as an arm rest did that just happen i asked him my brow furrowed no he said looking back at them before turning back to me it still happening i laughed with him when someone cleared their throat from behind us and we both snapped around god knows when this woman showed up she was wearing a pair of jeans with a gold tank top and royal blue robes that had gold trim she was about my height and she had wavy chocolate brown hair and the most piercing blue eyes i think i have ever seen my guess she was around 31 oliver wood she asked formally holding out her hand er yes that me he said shaking her hand macy grains she nodded letting her hand fall i the manager of puddlemere united i think my jaw promptly fell to the ground i sorry she said turning to me smiling kindly i didntcatch who you were oh is the manager of puddlemere united talking to me i better bring my jaw back to it normal location i katie bell i smiled shaking her outstretched hand very nice to meet you but do you mind if i borrow mr wood here for a moment oh no not at all i smiled take all the time you need she smiled a thanks before leading a very uncertain oliver over a few feet who the hell was that george asked suddenly standing behind me i turned around and slapped him on the shoulder what was that for he asked pouting you know not to do that i said sternly ok jeez i sorry mum he laughed holding up his hands in innocence i laughed too you really canthold a grudge against him for too long ok so you canthold a grudge against him at all but that beside the point that marcy grains i said nodding my head to where oliver was still talking to her completely out of earshot i might mention in english would be nice the manager of puddlemere united i sighed smiling so he s most definitely wow yup i smiled he deserves it hell he barked we deserve it i mean we re the ones he wakes up at 5 no correction 2 in the morning i laughed and i not even the one sleeping with him i punched him in the shoulder still smiling ok that force was a tad unnecessary i thought it was completely called for what going on lic asked wrapping a hand around george waist our well kat s woody kinns is moving on to better and bigger things george explained with a mock hint of awe in his voice with a sigh what do you mean lic asked as marcy and oliver started walking back up to the castle as oliver sent me a look over his shoulder absolutely beaming he currently getting recruited lic punched his shoulder playfully no way why does everyone feel the need to punch me ange unglue your mouth from fred for like two seconds what she called sounding rather annoyed oliver getting recruited no way moving onto bigger and better things better than what we have here bigger maybe but better this made me bite my lip furrow my brow and think about how plans for tonight just changed and when i mean change i mean go sob into my pillow oh my god i so sorry for this disappointing update i promise i ll continue things better on in my next chap and i so sorry for not updating for so long i had a huge advanced placement european history test which is

there is something seriously wrong with me i katherine ann bell have been crying into my pillow for practically an hour i do not cry i dontcry when i get hurt i do not cry when someone teases me i do not cry when i have a test i didntstudy for i do not cry when snape takes away 50 points i do not cry when we lose a game i do not cry when something is bothering me i fix it except this time i cantfix it not an excuse to cry especially for me but i have been crying for the past hour i do not think i have ever cried so much the only other time i really cried this year was with the whole flint fiasco but then i literally had oliver shoulder to cry on but this time i cantdo this he getting recruited to puddlemere not only is this the best thing that could ever happen to him it was also a huge slap in the face for me so there i was crying in my opinion senselessly into my pillow while oliver and marcy grains were probably filling out papers in dumbledore office katie katie what wrong lic asked obviously concerned sitting doen on the edge of my bed with ange you can tell us katie ange added rubbing my back i think they were just as shocked as me to see me crying i sat up rubbed the tears out of my eyes and gave them a pathetic excuse for a smile nothing wrong i fine oh please katie lic said sternly we re not blind deaf and dumb how about just dumb i said making an attempt at a joke which no doubt sounded absolutely horrible no ange said as she and lic sat on either side of me c mon what is it oliver sleavingrightafterhegraduates how about a little louder and clearer lic smiled oliver leaving once he graduates i sighed sadly i more than happy that he getting recruited by his favorite team he wanted this longer than he wanted that damn cup just not as vocally but he still not going to be here next year or the year after that and i still am oh katie lic said as she and ange both gave me a hug completely sandwiching me i canteven fathom not having george here or fred ange added and i laughed at they re snogging session that we were all present for so i not sure what to tell you lic finished but i glad to hear that you re not so wound up in yourself that you overlooked how happy oliver is about this thanks guys i sniffled wiping my eyes of the last remaining tears as they pulled away you know you re really great right we know they chorused as they stood up and dragged me to my feet now go wash up and we ll go down to the kitchen and get some chocolate covered strawberries for a bit lic smiled ok i said and laughed as ange literally pushed me into the bathroom jesus christ what is wrong with me i sobbed 15 minutes later i had made it to the kitchens ate one chocolate covered strawberry and broke into tears again oh katie lic cooed why do i keep crying i sobbed merlin knows i overwhelmingly happy for him so why am i crying so much because you know how much you re going to miss him next year ange said softly placing a comforting hand on my shoulder i had my arms crossed over each other on the table top and i buried my head in them i hate being like this i muttered katie ange said i know you re not one to cry but everybody does eventually you saw me when jake finn broke up with me that was a lot of tears lic smiled but that was over something bad i moaned this is something good and i sitting here crying because he wontbe here next year i feel so i dunno selfish shut up katie i looked at lic the last time she told me to shut up was last year when i said i should probably cut back on the junk food so i lose a pound or two a pound or two you would ve thought that i had decided to get liposuction or something when lic just meet me with a hard stare ange spoke up everybody has to look out for themselves first at some point katie she wisely pointed out but a good majority of the time you watch out for us first i not following i said blinking a few times remember when george and lic were snogging in the locker room that one time and you and oliver were still going at it cantreally forget about that and you jumped on his back so the love birds wontget caught does this have a point lic asked as i nodded well he got even madder at her just so he wouldntget mad at the both of you too lic gave a little laugh but i still wasntconvinced so that one thing i said what about the time i dragged you to the shrieking shack even though i know you re scared out of your mind about it lic laughed harder so that one thing too ange said waving it off what about that time you spent nearly two hours helping me fix my star chart which i had ruined to almost disrepair or the time you lent me your only quill in potions when we had a tes and said that another failing mark wouldnthurt your grade as it would hurt mine li added or that whole week after i broke up with jake you were my personal look out or when george had spilled orange juice all over my blouse and you lent me your robes for the day or when you told oliver off for us last year and he refused to talk to you for that whole month or how you always make sure there plenty of chocolate around incase one of us has a terrible day or how you always volunteer to take a shower last so do you see lic asked placing an arm around my shoulders as i gave another sniffle you re allowed to be selfish at times but those are such little things quills and robes this is huge i protested this is about oliver how he been given the greatest opportunity of his life and how i still sitting here crying sure those little favors may be little but they mean a lot ange said firmly imagine the trouble we would ve had to go through if you didntstep up and help and you re not upset that oliver ahs been given a great gift but how you just want him to stay here with you lic added and i sure he would stay here if he could he loves you katie i gave another sniffle at my own pathetic ness maybe you re right of course she right ange smiled she at the freaking top of our class even snape cantdeny that so just eat some more chocolate covered strawberries so i did what she basically ordered me too and willed myself not to think about how i always made oliver chocolate covered strawberries when ever he got too worked up over a bad practice let go find the twins and go down to the lake ange said once i had eaten a dozen of the beautiful things it ll be fun and we ll tell someone to tell oliver we re down there may 27 saturday noon it was fun though the rest of yesterday i mean fred and george played cards with us that muggle one called b s the one where you have to lie so basically i was losing like no other but i still had a lot of laughs with them sure things wouldntbe the same next year but i knew my four friends wouldntlet me have a miserable life until we graduated i would look out for them and they would do the same just like always and then there always the weekends where we can catch up with oliver in hogsmeade and get a butter beer and visit the shrieking shack and whatever else we felt like guess who some said as they placed their hands over my eyes right when i got a new pile of cards oliver i said without missing a beat oliver who oliver wood be more specific oliver alban wood alban fred muttered a little more specific oliver said his hands still over my eyes oliver alban wood griffindor seventh year quidditch captain nazi and obsessive no oliver alban wood griffindor seventh year quidditch captain nazi and obsessive and the new reserve keeper for puddlemere united he yelled taking his hands off my eyes and giving me a back breaking hug from behind ol i laughed as everyone else sent him their own congratulatories squirming around so i could give him a huge myself that great isntit he beamed as i gave him a peck on the lips yes unlike ange and fred i refuse to eat his face off in front of them at least ok fred said standing up now it absolutely mandatory that we go to hogsmeade right now why are you still sitting there george said as he jumped up and started tugging on lic hand let go already so we all made our way back into the castle down through the statue and back up into the cellar of honeydukes by then it was 6 30 and we were all hungry for dinner and wandered over to the three broomsticks tell us exactly what happened ange demanded of oliver once rosmetta left after taking our orders so of course oliver told us all about how marcy grains told him why they had chosen to take him on their reserve team how she watched him play in the finals and even found the booking board for the pitch and saw the amount of practices we had including the dawn practices she saw the plays he came up with and how well we performed no doubt from his supreme captain skills she had told him she wanted me to go and practice next week oliver concluded as rosmetta placed my cheeseburger and fries in front of me but i told her i couldntleave early and get out of taking your newts fred confirmed what wrong with you george demanded which one of you two got the steak and potatoes rosmetta asked the twins that d be me fred said a real man meal you know george is the one who likes chicken i should ve known rosmetta laughed lightly giving him his dinner by the way did you get a hair cut fred asked putting on his look at me and how smooth i am even though my girlfriend is sitting right next to me voice it looks great really she asked giving her hair a little flick it was just a trim well it really makes a difference why thank you fred she laughed before walking off in her glittery heels ange punched fred in the shoulder what was that for he asked you know full well what that was for she snapped would you mind clearing it up for me fred asked after a slight pause and ange just humpfted aw baby you know i love you ange gave him a half hearted glare before laughing i told you no one can be mad at the twins for long leave early how did marcy grains even put an offer like that on the table if he left early i wouldntget to kill him because his mom would get to him first for not really graduating i was quiet really quiet and everybody who known me for even half a second knows that quiet is not normal katie bell behavior i think everyone was catching onto me it might be because i was uncharacteristically quiet and that my brow was furrowed and i was biting my lip thinking but you never know my friends can read me like a book so they probably were onto to me from the very beginning kat it was eight by the time we were walking back up to the castle it was really nice out and since were pretty sure filch would be in the castle harassing first years by then we decided to walk back to the castle outside like normal people instead of breaking into honeyduke cellar like usual hm kat are you ok oliver asked as he stepped into pace with me looking down at me concerned hu oh yeah i fine i smiled kat you re lying to me says who i asked forgetting how easily he sees through my pathetic lies your face oh right i said furrowing my brow and biting my lip as i looked at the pebble i started to kick with my foot kat what wrong he asked putting his hands on my shoulders forcing me to face him as lic ange and the twins were still making they re way back up to the castle it nothing really i smiled even putting a little laugh in my voice which instantly faints and dies away at the look oliver is giving me and damn it i hate him and his damn looks and this one really got to me lemme tell you that it was a freaking rainbow of emotions he was concerned and worried but just as damn stern as he was in the pitch and all of this was rampaging into me through his eyes his damn big beautiful wrapped in eyelashes i sometimes wish i had always shiny chocolate brown eyes oh alright i moaned i dontwant you to graduate he looked kinda shocked i guess he was expecting it to be something worse i dontwant you to leave me here for the next two years i sobbed tearlessly or what i hoped was tearlessly but i want you to go and play for puddlemere i want you to take this amazing offer and run with it and i dontwant to sound this selfish damn it i yelled as i realized a few spare tears were running down my cheeks he instantly gave me a hug a huge oliver copyrighted hug those things are the best he just held me there tight up against him and i really did try to stop crying but it seemed the more i tried to stop the harder i sobbed kat he said softly in my ear rubbing my back truth is i dontwant to leave either i slapped him dontlie to me oliver alban wood he chuckled a bit but it the truth and another truth is the only reason i didntleave early was because i promised myself i wouldnttake anymore time i had with you for granted and if i left i had no more time so you would ve left if this didntexist i asked waving my hand from me to him referring to our relationship yeah he said giving me a weak smile as he scratched the back of his head i guess i would ve oh great i yelled now i hold you back oh damn it i m he cut me off it seems i can never get what i need to say out when he has these constant urges to kiss and cut me off dontever say that again he said softly as he wrapped his arms around my waist continuing to kiss me hmm deal i murmured against his lips oh damn him nothing ever gets done like this not that i complaining or anything though but then it started to rain yes that right rain i hate england weather sometimes it like you cantgo a week with out it raining and it always starts when i getting to enjoy things and yes things includes oliver i groaned up at the sky as it let huge raindrops fall on us in a downpour i hate england when it gets like this oliver chuckled and kissed me again but then it started to thunder and lightning so it was thundering and lightning out and i was trying to get a good kiss in so it really wasntworking oliver hung his head in mock defeat before grabbing my hand and we started to run back up to the castle the one time we dontgo through the cellar oliver trailed of laughing as we stood in the entrance way dripping wet honestly i was just glad i went for the green tank top today vs the white one but then i realized i was also wearing kaki shorts but i checked and all was clear but my cons were soaked through and through and made a thoroughly unattractive sound as we made our way back up to the tower look who got caught in rain lic laughed in a sing song voice as i shalomped in shalomp being the sound my soaked low rise cons made and with our captain maybe ange asked an eyebrow cocked maybe i shrugged my shoulders smirking as i took off my shoes leading to an ocean of rain water spilling out of them say spoon spoon yeah she definitely was ange confirmed how do you know lic asked well where else would she be she not crying i threw her a look and she just said spoon suggestively no i didn t i protested my nose scrunching up maybe but you wanted to she pointed out no i didn t i protested again as she and lic cracked up i dontget it just get into some dry clothes before you get sick lic said her laughter dying down ok mom i laughed as i picked up some red athletic shorts with white trim and a patriots shirt tirade name on the back you look like a wet dog oliver laughed as he messed up my still wet hair as i sat down next to him on the couch in the common room oh wow what a compliment i said sarcastically knowing that he was kidding i touched he laughed and i messed up his hair which was still wet too but i could say the same he laughed as he slid his arm around my waist and pulled me closer to him until i was completely flushed up against his side and placing a kiss at the tip of my nose how did he pull that off too much pda ange cried as she came down the stairs with lic this castle really isntsafe anymore oh speak for yourself i shoot back what are you talking ab look lic shouted pointing to some random 4th year who was sitting at a table out of ange line of view it fred where she asked frantically turning her head left and right trying to find the red headed weasel fred where over there lic said pointing in another random direction and she bounded off in search of fred who wasntover there good work soldier i said to lic as she sat down in an arm chair i try sergeant she laughed giving me a salute was somebody calling me just a few minutes ago fred asked his head popping out from the stair way freddie fish angie apple pie and then there was much rejoicing and pda and they were the only two who lived happily ever after the end mercy mary mother of god george said as he came down the stairs and gingerly walked past ange and fred i canteven walk down a staircase these days without getting scarred for life there too much pda these days he muttered sitting down in front of the arm chair lic was in hey pumpkin pasty he cooed craning his neck to look up at lic hey sugar quill she answered just as suggestively pushing his hair back from his face i looked from them to oliver where we shared a mutual concerned and confused look and back to them i dontthink i ever going to eat candy again i said blankly and i being serious which is pretty damn scary considering we are talking candy here oliver chuckled as he gave me a tight squeeze and a peck on my temple we stayed up late talking about random things ange argued that she and fred were far not the most pda ish yes that a word now couple in the school and that in fact roger davies and abbey montrion were i think it a close match who was better at chess ange or ron whether snape once upon a time sit on his wand or did he always have a stick up his ass and other teenage things that i have no idea how the conversation started but i do think that i started to drift off because oliver started to nudge me and say my name yeah i was definitely asleep because remember choosing not to respond and just lay there like a load an do vaguely remember getting slung over oliver shoulder oliver i yelled just realizing that i was hanging over him upside down yes kat dearest he asked innocently as he walked over to the girls dorm staircase why am i hanging upside down and in one swift motion i went to the bear hide over the shoulder style to newly wed style and of course the later is more enjoyable i mean do we really have to ask better obviously we do have to ask much i murmured now if remember correctly he said as we came to my dorm your bed is the pne with the griffindor quilt way to make me feel good ol i yawned didnti tell you that i liked it he asked as he laid me down and subsequently million galleon word that is himself as he laid on top of me that was ages ago i said groggily so he gave me a long kiss well he knows how to wake me up well enough so things change i pointed out hmmm he murmured against my lips but not me well thank god for that he chuckled before giving me a long kiss and quietly walked out the door or at least he tried to be quiet and was quite successful until he hit that creaky floor board that right in front of the door i smiled to myself i hope things never change ha ha so i actually finished this the day after i posted the last chapter but i had to wait because god knows if i didntpeople wouldntreview for the first chap i put up and i canthave that i need full review stamina keep it up peeps you re doing great and i sure by now you know my whole review demands with the quote and to make it long and all that jazz that i know you want to do so go press that pretty periwinkle button oh

of my sorrys way to stick with me here may 29 monday charms ok as you know yesterday was mine and oliver s february march april may four month anniversary and by eleven the man was still not up not naturally i crept up into his room by then he was the only one still asleep god how does he sleep with all those posters looking at him apparently in an old griffindor tee shirt i smiled to myself he freaking adorable when he sleeps he was on his side facing me and he was snoring lightly and he had terrible bed hair i wonder if he knows that he makes snoring cute oliver i said softly pushing his hair off his forehead oliver wake up he just mumbled in his sleep ok ol it noon get up hu he asked groggily running his hands over his eyes and through his hair it nearly half past eleven oh what day is it sunday the 28th you know our anniversary what he yelled sitting bolt upright he swept his hand across his nightstand flinging everything in front of his clock to the floor argh he groaned when he saw the time laying back down with a flop what i asked obviously confused in my pajamas you know the ones the red athletic shorts with white trim and patriots shirt i had the whole day planned out he moaned propping himself up on his elbows well i said trying to right whatever he did wrong it only eleven thirty we would ve been out of here by then he said looking rather dismal he looked so adorable and helpless with his messy bed hair so helpless that if i suddenly jumped him and snogged him so hard he wouldntbe able to walk straight for a week he wouldntbe able to do anything about it it was quite tempting i ve got an idea i said walking around to the other unoccupied side of his four poster bed and slipping under the covers next to him let just sleep it in and make the best of it sleep it in oliver asked an eyebrow cocked it almost noon so let not sleep it in and say we did i smiled damn it we would have a good time if it killed me like a bed and breakfast or something or something oliver repeated as he slipped an arm around me well by now it would really be a bed and lunch i pointed out which made him laugh but merlin knows pancakes and whatnot are ten times better than peanut butter and jelly sandwiches so how are we going to get these pancakes that you re so bent on having oliver asked laying back down with my head on his shoulder eh it sunday i said sooner or later a house elf is going to come passing by and voila pancakes or eggs or whatever else you want and sooner or later a house elf did come passing by and you could hear that granger girl screaming something or the other about the rights of house elves and why on god green earth were three carrying large trays of breakfast foods to the seventh year boys dorm and yadda yadda yadda yadda ok i got one i said thirty minutes after the house elves left with our food my head still on his shoulder the russian national team or the australian national team we were playing who would win basically you name two random quidditch teams and who you think would win you see this is a game i can win it involves no lying and the key to winning is being stubborn which i practically have a phd in you cantcompare those two oliver said between bites of his bacon it like comparing apples and oranges no it not i rebutted they re both national teams it not like i saying the chudley cannons and the irish national team what ever you say kat just decide already i smiled elbowing him in the ribs jokingly ummm the russians what no way and you re going to be on a league team i laughed as he jounced his shoulder unbalancing my head the aussies would win oh so now we re calling them aussies they ve always been called aussies captain oliver chuckled before turning on his side to face me resting on his elbow what are you going to do next year what do you mean i laughed lightly mimicking him same as i always do push through potions and pretend like i actually know what i doing that not what i meant he said with a faint smile before it disappeared oh i paused well then i have no idea what your talking about i mean next year it not going to take the guys around here too long to realize that i not coming back he said softly tuck a lock of hair behind my ear oh i said well i sure ange and lic can fend them off well enough not like i need they re help or anything but what are you going to do next year besides have tons of fun playing on a professional team while i still sitting in binn class i he smiled obviously relieved that i didntsay that i was going to go off and have a wild snog in a broom closet with the first guy that walked past am going to come an visit you every weekend how are you going to pull that off i asked with a lopsided smile you ve got games then and then a party after the game celebrating your ridiculously good playing he laughed before he bent over and kissed me and that basically how my day went yesterday talking kissing talking kissing all in all it was a very good day so good that i actually fell asleep in his bed later that night you can imagine what i went through when i woke up kat kat i heard oliver in a way off distant place nudging my shoulder kat wake up oliver i moaned burying my face into one of his pillows even more you re not allowed to have dawn practices anymore but kat the damn season over already ok i mumbled into his pillow and his pillow seems really good by the way it smells like oliver to be exact i think i described that as a just cut lawn right after it rains yeah i think that what i said but kat it monday he said still nudging my shoulder no it not it sunday wow i even more stubborn than usual when i have to get up no kat it monday and we have classes no we don t katherine ann bell didnti tell you that the season over now lemme sleep and dontgo middle naming me oliver alban wood you re sleeping in a seventh year boy bed which so happens to be in the same dorm as percy weasley who is oh fine i up i m i said sitting up and then just realizing where i was i sleeping in your bed yes oliver said he was standing next to the bed already in his uniform in the seventh year boy dorm i analyzed further yes in percy dorm wow so i can think in the morning after all yes and percy the head boy isnthe right again he smiled as he did up his tie now go get dressed everyone already down at breakfast ok captain next time wake me up a little earlier why don cha and with my uncaffinated and stubborn self i marched out the door back to my dorm and got dressed morning oliver said i nearly fell down you see i had just opened up the door and make my way down to the great hall and there he was oliver just standing there holding coffee i gaped staring at the mug in his hand does that have milk and sugar just the way you like it he smiled sugared up to the max oliver you re a god i laughed in my state of decaffeination making a swipe for the mug damn him being a damn keeper with damn keeper reflexes donti get a kiss hello he asked smirking i rolled my eyes and planted a peck on his lips but merlin knows oliver has got to make a big deal out of everything a quickly turned it into something more than a little peck oliver i half growled as his one free hand traveled up the back of my shirt alright alright he sigh smiling here your coffee good thing he forked it over too it also a good thing that i actually made it down the breakfast no scratch that it a miracle a god send a wondrous thing that i made it down to breakfast even if oliver had to make a pit stop and when i say pit stop i mean snog stop oh so that were you were all yesterday how are you two so proper what are you talking about well you ve only been together forever try four months still a record for you katie normally the relationship would ve been down the pipes a month ago well let just rag on katie just a little more why dontwe ok why are you always biting your quill i dontalways bite my quill look at you you re doing it again no i not well your definitely in denial says who you so i didntlet her finish her sentence nothing good could ve come from it i know it you know it they know it everybody knows it and who cares if i bite my quill every two seconds and i not in denial just relentlessly stubborn there a difference i swear 8pm ol do i always bite my quill oliver craned his neck to look at me yes what oliver had been sitting on the couch in the common room reading a book when i stood at the back of the couch putting my head next to his and asked him a simple question well it was suppose to be simple he was supposed to say no what oliver chuckled at my reaction before returning to his book you do well you didnthave to be so blunt about it i pointed out climbing over the back of the couch and sitting cross legged next to him what did you want me to say he asked leafing through the pages could ve been nicer about it i said you could ve said only when your working or only when your writing something down which would be just as true as your blunt answer just not as blunt it the truth he said continuing to read the truth hurts i muttered staring blankly into the empty fireplace as oliver chuckled what are you reading anyway he held up the cover of the book so i could read the title he was that engrossed with it ha no but he was he brow was all furrowed and i think he was actually reading it why am i so shocked i have never seen oliver reading a real book other than quidditch throughout the ages which he borrowed from me for the past three years i know by now that he never going to give it back so i donteven know why i bother taking the newts by hurman farrifoot who got all eleven newts i read aloud i know i can read it a miracle pfft sounds like a good read sarcasm oh yeah i looked at the author name again hurman fairrifoot did you realize his first name practically has the word hair in it and his last name almost is fairy foot so he real name might as well be hairy fairy foot oliver looked at the cover of his book and the author name before cracking up hysterically jeez ol i said with a cocked eyebrow as he buried his head in my shoulder and his body shook with laughter it not that funny yes it is he rebutted through laughs looking back up with me and only you would come up with that yeah i one in a million i said rolling my eyes and smiling crookedly i always bite my quills and i come up with weird names wow merlin really blessed me well he blessed me oliver said ok we ve been over this i sighed exasperatedly you re a freaking bloody great keeper i know that not what i meant he said what i was going to say is that i was lucky enough to be the guy wrapped around your little finger he corrected me giving me a peck on the cheek ah i said in a somewhat small revelation well arentyou the lucky one now why didntyou cancel those dawn practices when i asked you too i just as stubborn as you he said giving me a wink before turning back to his book ah hey may 30 tuesday 5 48 and 7 seconds on the dot you have got to love how the closer the owls are the more homework our teachers give us you would think that they would think that we would study but we dontand maybe they re onto that so they just make up for it with mountains of homework i seriously think i onto something here katie i would personally like to know how you come up with these ideas c mon ange it makes perfect sense i rebutted after classes apparently she disagreed with me after i told her about my homework conclusion no it doesn t ange disagreed again as she flopped down on her bed and whipped out a magazine because lic is studying hey lic called from her bed where she was leaning over several books just because i am going to ace these things calm down lic i laughed as her brow began to furrow and i plopped down on my bed it not even like you need to study you re the smartest one in our grade true she mused liking the way that sounded i am the smartest a flipping hermione granger ange muttered i dontwant to be the smartest anymore good i said come join us on the average gpa side of life lic laughed before getting back to her potion homework which i still have yet to start yeah i should probably get on that 10 pm remind me why you wait for the last second to get things done oliver please i begging you here i moaned sitting on the couch next to him where he was reading that newts book two hours after dinner i was currently begging him to get him to help me with my potions crap yes it is crap with his robes in my fist as he tried to act invincible to my persuasive ways i dunno kat fine i said standing up and walking towards the portrait hole see if i ll snog you anymore i was kidding he said standing up as well go get your potions stuff well if you want to be all demanding about it i said in a mock gruff voice as i went and got my potions stuff i mean crap so is it that big of a deal if i just refuse to take this owl i asked an hour later in the library i mean it not like i going to pass it anyway oliver chuckled from next to me and slipped a hand around my waist while the other scribbled some stuff on the parchment in front of me yes you have to take it oliver smiled crookedly or else you wontget the credits i not going to get the credits anyway i sighed i was doomed to fail this test after the first minute i spent in that dungeon snape practically spelled it out for me when he said i was the bane of existence a prime example of a failing potions student when i couldnttell him the distinct differences from wolfsbane and bane of wolf i sighed again idiot was right dontbe all melancholy oliver demanded still scribbling away you haventfailed it yet yeah but even treawlney predicted it well then you know it not going to happen i love you i laughed as i gave him a hug around his waist before glancing at the parchment in front of me what are you writing anyway a list of legal cheats why does that sound illegal it not he assured me it just simple things like sugar will thicken and stuff like that i stared at him and why didntyou tell me this like oh i dunno 8 months ago you mean i didn t he asked looking all sympathetic as he scratched the back of his head well i meant to i just cocked an eyebrow at him isntit the thought that counts i smiled a bit before looking back at the laundry list of legal cheats this is great and all but it not getting my homework done well if you want to be all demanding about it he imitated me smiling slyly as he planted a kiss on the side of my neck as i took out my homework oliver i said trying to concentrate on the homework in front of me and not the fact that he was placing kisses all along my neck line oliver oliver wood oliver alban wood katherine ann bell he murmured against my skin you know i never going to get any of this done with you doing that he laughed before he sat back up slipping his hands back around my waist and placing me in his lap i know oh so you know this isnthelping either i asked as his hand ran up and down my thigh i dontknow what you re talking about he said stopped what he was doing and putting his arm back around my waist and resting his head on my shoulder that wrong what i asked looking back at my work no it not yes it is he persisted the answer bane of wolf not wolfbane oh i said crossing out my answer that was my next guess anyway mmm hmm he said still resting his chin on my shoulder no doubt looking over my work and number 32 is wrong too he said pointing to it it a goat gallbladder not a sheep gallbladder that a universal poison remedy i knew that one too i said changing my answer i hate potions i muttered under my breath around 9 30 as we finally left the library finally done trying to get me to understand potions i can personally say that was a big waste of time considering the fact that i still dontget half of it well at least you get the other half oliver said brightly slipping his hand back around my waist he was also carrying my bag much to my protests it not that big of a deal quidditch boy i said angrily first years know more than me about potions quidditch boy oliver repeated and then in a lower voice added i think i like that the next word out of your mouth better not be spoon i threatened catching the suggestiveness in his voice and rolling my eyes spoon oliver i said punching him lightly in the shoulder admit it he said in the same voice you cantresist me oh i think i can i said stubbornly smirking a bit i dunno oliver said pushing me up against the wall somehow he had subtly guided me over there without me noticing i really have got to get that slow motion machine mental note watch out for oliver subtleness he rested his forehead against mine i dontthink you could manage no no i said as he dropped my bag on the floor next to him and put his hands on my hips i pretty sure i could manage you re going to die next year without me he teased as his right hand found it way underneath my shirt and on my lower back where he started to trace all these different patterns since when did you get more persuasive than me i asked cocking an eyebrow as my hands traveled up towards his shoulders guess you rubbed off on me yeah i tend to do that a lot i mused before he captured my lips in his i kinda forgot that we were just randomly standing in the middle of a hallway only partially hidden by the knight of armor and snog each other senseless you see he started tracing designs on my lower back and it was driving me up the wall insane i sifted my hand through his hair and pulled him down on me even more which was a damn big feat considering the fact that he was already pushed flush up against me eventually his hand left my back and started to run up and down the side of my leg ok i get it i breathed i need to shave oliver laughed against my lips as i made yet another mental note to shave at the first opportunity ok so i ve been slacking off in that department i sorry i have some subtle ok i sorry oh lookie what we got here a voice cackled above us two quidditch losers playing tonsil hockey how romantic we instantly broke apart expecting to see filch or somebody else but it was only peeves go away peeves oliver said demandingly sorry but i not on your team am i peeves cackled i dontplay no quidditch so you cantboss me around ahahaha oliver gave him a gruff look before picking up my bag grabbing my wrist and pulling me along the corridor so uh yeah i said scratching the back of my neck as we stopped in front of the fat lady that was a top notch study session oliver smiled at me before the fat lady started screaming at us to just say the password so she could just let us in and she could live in peace or something of the other by the time we were actually back in the common room it was around ten an none of our friends were milling about at the base of my staircase oliver gave me a good night kiss actually it was a great night kiss yeah i know get my head out of the gutter i on it before i trodded up the stairs still on cloud nine katie there you are ange said hugging me the second i was inside the door jeez i said giving her a small hug back rather confused on what was going on i was only gone for a couple of hours lic had a fight with george ange said quickly unwrapping her arms from me but now holding my shoulders in a death grip she been bawling her eyes out and screaming for the last hour so basically i just pushed her into a bubble bath with some of that emergency chocolate of yours i was only gone for a couple of hours i repeated shocked to find out that my all time favorite couple had a fight and one of my best friends was bawling her eyes out and no doubt spilling half of that chocolate into a bubbly abyss can i not leave at all these days ange smiled apologetically as she loosened her grip on my shoulders and i sighed it was going to be a long night of chocolate and tears ok i am a terrible person i know i should ve updated ages ago but i a bad person and i didn t i know i get it but at least it wasntshort and the aussie stuff was for you lady arre yeah thought you would like that i dunno but i have no idea where i going to go with that last part but i need something to get me past this tremendous writer block and a twist that i can fix within a chapter or two sounded like a pretty damn good idea i con go all over the map with this one so yeah i promise promise promise promise i will get the next chapter up sooner so sorry again and i swear lady pup you will get that review oh my god i actually have nothing to ramble about it got to be an apocalypse or something run for cover may 31 wednesday sometime during first period which i not at obviously last night was one of the longest nights of my life no scratch that it was the longest night of my life minus my birthday where we spent at least an hour wandering in a sewer it was a long night of tears and lots and lots of chocolate and that much chocolate cannot be healthy katie lic asked as she came out of the bathroom from her bubble bath last night around 11 wearing a bathrobe and on the verge of tears i spilt the chocolate in the bathtub and i dontworry i smiled kindly i ll get you some more no lic said shaking her head well yes please but i uh she sniffed kinda ate it anyway didntthat taste bad ange asked sitting next to me on her bed and scrunching up her nose i mean you were taking a lilac bubble bath lic bottom lip started to stick out dangerously far tears about to flow i mean go get her some more chocolate katie well if you say so i muttered so only she could here before climbing off the bed and wandering towards my nightstand here i said as i placed a whole bar of fudge on alicia lap as she sat down next to ange she started bawling what i asked shocked it nut fudge you love fudge with nuts george always got me nut fudge she bawled throwing it off her lap and onto the floor i stared at the chocolate the once perfect bar of fudge that was now splattered on the floor of our dorm perfect fudge gone and wasted i was about to start bawling jeez lic ange sighed before charming the chocolate away as my eyes started to tear up you re not broken up yet you just had a fight but still she sobbed ok i sighed sitting down on her other side and putting an arm around her shoulder what happened i want it word through word lic nodded before sniffling again as ange passed her a box of tissues well he got all mad that i was studying too much sniffle so i said well maybe you should study a bit instead of whining i exchanged glances with ange behind her back and he said that maybe i should stop studying so much and i said well maybe you need to calm down and then he said maybe i need a break and i said fine take one she gave another sniffle and then i stormed up the stairs oh lic i cooed giving her a large hug and ange joined in too katie you and oliver fight a lot what do you do we fight a lot i asked ange you have slight quarrels over stupid things see we dontfight and he normally wins you just had to add that in pretty much lic gave a small laugh from beneath our arms before letting out another sob as we pulled away well ange said standing up and walking to her nightstand i believe this calls for ice cream and celebrity bashing she said pulling out several thousand old weekly witches magazine i here the lead singer in the weird sister has got a wart on his wrist ew lic said through a sniffle around 12 30 later on he does have a wart on his wrist we had changed into our pajamas and we were all squished onto ange bed shoulder to shoulder and looking at the same magazine with lic between me and ange i laughed as ange flipped the page of the magazine we were looking at oh look the drummer has been single for five years i think he gay but this dollie girl claims otherwise because apparently she had several night stands with him and he s i not reading the rest of this me and lic laughed again as she flipped to the back oh this is my favorite part what is it lic asked oh just ridiculously embarrassing stories from teens read one ok ok ange laughed skimming through them oh here one i had this date with the most amazing guy in the whole school he took me into hogsmeade and we went to the shrieking shack we started making out but then something started howling i peed in my pants i was so scared but my date ran out screaming like a little girl ange was laughing so hard she couldntread anymore and i fell off the side of the bed cracking up hysterically katie lic asked looking off the side of the bed at me are you alright that was betty and flint i laughed what ange the gossip queen asked how do you know i heard betty telling abstice how her date ran off on her in the shrieking shack i laughed oh my god ange said looking back at the article it from captain rider oh my god she shrieked chucking it across the room and i thought you and oliver were bad i picked up a pillow and threw it in her face and that were it all went down hill we wound up having a pillow fight almost all night and eventually it went down into the common room were we all fell asleep at around two in the morning kat kat what are you doing go away i mumbled swatting away the hand the was gently nudging my head kat what i asked sitting up on the couch which was rather hard considering ange legs were on top of me i pried open my eyes and saw that it was oliver who was waking me up oliver what are you doing in our dorm you re not allowed to have dawn practices anymore oliver smiled down at me before planting a kiss on my hair line you fell asleep down here i looked around and saw that we were in the common room i was on one side of the couch while ange was on the other with her legs draped over me and lic was curled up in a ball on one of the armchairs oh i mumbled you going to come to breakfast oliver asked already in his uniform probably not i sighed settling back down it ll be a miracle if we can even get lic down to first period what happened oliver asked squatting down next to me lic and george had a fight i yawned i think they re on a break and she not taking it well that so he whispered tucking a piece of hair behind my ear i ll talk with george dontbother i said shaking my head they ll have to figure it out on their own that true he murmured as he stood back up i ve got to get some breakfast do you want me to bring you up some nah we ll run by the kitchens alright he smiled as he gave me a kiss on the cheek i ll see you later mmm hmm love you love you too he smiled before walking out of the portrait hole jeez ange yawned about an hour after oliver had left what time is it it like 8 10 i said coming out of my stupor and looking at my watch we ve got to get to class she shrieked jumping up lic she said nudging her awake we ve got to get to class class she mumbled then her eyes snapped open george there goes niagara falls so we re not going to class ange asked me over her shoulder i guess not i murmured standing up and going over the help ange lunch i can t yes you can lic no i can t you ve got this lic no i don t lic but george is in the same class as me now ange and i rolled our eyes after we had gone down to the kitchens during first we were able to get her to put on her uniform that was easy enough but getting her through the portrait hole right before the bell was going to ring to get to third period was proving quite a challenge you ve got to go to class i said sternly yeah ange nodded and i thought you were the smartest in our year i am lic nodded i study a bunch and and and that what got george upset will you close up niagara falls already i asked you cannot let george stop you from doing what you have to do when me and oliver were in a fight i still went to classes i still went to practice you ve got to be independent lic i added softer i know you you dontlet people get control over you now get out that portrait hole ange said sternly pointing to the exit as the bell rang and get to class and damn it get good grades lic smiled at us as she wiped a few spare tears away ok guys good we chorused as we pushed her out the door before she could change her mind all throughout the morning me and ange have walked on either side of her protecting her from the outside world seriously though ange practically volunteered us to be her body guard no one talked to her unless we gave them the ok it was actually pretty weird but it made alicia feel better so what ever floats her boat and currently we re eating lunch outside under the oak tree so why cantwe eat lunch in the great hall like everybody else i asked as i came back from the great hall with lunch for the three of us ange threw me a look at my question oh yeah that right i so mad lic mumbled not sad no mad oh thank god i said sinking down next to her because i running out of chocolate the chocolate you throw on the floor every two seconds the perfectly good chocolate that you we get it katie ange said from the other side of lic as she bit into her sandwich what gives him the right to say i study too much she said her brow furrowed i am allowed to study but you haventbeen paying him that much attention since well he could study with me he should be able to do good on the owls too i never stopped him from joining me he cantget up the stairs oliver only got permission because he was cap i dontcare she shrieked i was in the library loads of times george in a library i asked oh please lic well lic i said you can bash him all you want it not going to change things i know she sighed i just i i know ange said hugging her and i joined in it hurts maybe we should just break up she sobbed shut your mouth me and lic looked at ange that does not work me and fred tried that but then you have all this unresolved sexual tension flying around and then god knows you and him are so meant for each other that you ll go have a wild shag me and lic just stared at her is that what happened to you i asked cocking an eyebrow at her and desperately trying to keep mental images out of my head but the more i looked at her the more i saw thea little two of them running around in my head towards a broom closet and stoooooooooop oh hell no little ange and little fred are no longer running to a broom closet bliss so why are you telling me this lic asked blushing ah ha ange cried pointing to her face you see you re blushing you still love him i told you that you two were good for each other so what if i blushing it just like katie and oliver and the word spoon dontbring me into this i said across lic wondering where she was going from this i should bring this up with george ange mused his ears ll probably turn as red as his hair angie lic scolded no way are you bring this up ever again let alone with george it would be funny though i mused imagining george ears going as red as his hair it was quite a funny sight stop stop stop lic yelled i dontcare about george at the moment and i dontwant to hear about this anymore alright ange cooed i ll stop thank you now can we please have a nice meal you sound like my mom i smirked which got a good laugh out of alicia so it was worth the snide comment 10 pm oliver ka oof you know i really missed you i can tell oliver chuckled trying to re steady himself as you know i have not seen the man since 7 am this morning and by the time i was returning to the tower from the bathroom after dinner which lic wouldntlet us go to the great hall for it was around 8 that is 13 hours oliver less 13 hours hours so it makes sense that i jumped his bones where were you all day oliver asked turning around as i slid off his back well it took two periods to get lic to step outside the tower she currently has a phobia of the great hall and she and ange are probably sitting in our dorm wondering where the hell i am i summed up so yeah been pretty busy i missed you too he chuckled pulling me into a hug so alicia is a handful you have no idea i was her captain for you have no idea i repeated looking up at him critically she threw my chocolate on the floor oliver laughed before lacing his hand with mine and leading me back to the portrait hole do we really have to go back in i asked ignoring the fat lady comments yeah oliver smiled you ve got owls and i have newts and we both know we both need to study strangely i could keep up with that i smiled crookedly oh my god the owls are in ten days oliver laughed before giving me a kiss will you two hurry up and just say the password already the fat lady said but we didntbreak apart hello stop playing tonsil hockey and say the password the password oliver muttered before continuing to kiss me i laughed against him as the fat lady face went red and i broke apart fizzing wizbees i told the fat lady smiling sweetly and she swung open you realize i probably wontsee you tomorrow either oliver said i know i sighed but she would do the same for me how angelina doing without fred actually she meeting him periodically i said leaving the fat lady hanging open much to her complaints i think it working out decent for her but terrible for me i said as we climbed through she gone forever sometimes oliver laughed as we entered the common room hey i need to go up to the pitch tomorrow go there after classes sure i smiled as he sat down on the couch but why do i need to clear out he said with a sigh mcgonagall told me today i was stalling too long already and wants it done by tomorrow evening come with me oh ol i moaned sitting down next to him and putting my arms around him you know i will thanks kat he murmured into my hair as he hugged me back god knows how hard that going to be for him four years as captain in there and it going to be killer to clean it out it going to take forever to clean out too katie uh oh i said sitting up that lic katherine ann bell and that ange i sighed standing up i gotta go i gave him a peck on his temple before slowly walking back up to my dorm june 1st thursday second period hey guess what we were actually able to get all three of us to class on time it a miracle i know and oliver keeps rampaging through my mind i keep seeing this sad oliver face as it cleaned out his captain office imagine though if this is hard on me it must be tearing him apart he accomplished so much only to have to leave it when you think about it what the point i guess the point is leaving something behind something everyone will remember he left the cup with our name on it behind for the first time in seven years too did i tell you there even a team picture of us on a plaque in the trophy hall it great lemme tell you he did do what he set out to do though he was captain for three years three years most are only for a year or two at most and that only if you re lucky and now he going to puddlemere straight after school that something i honestly have no idea where i going with this maybe i only writing this down because it needs to be written or because it give me an excuse not to listen to binns and it looks like i actually taking notes so lic doesntwant to rant to me because she thinks i studying it actually quite lic i am going to eat in the great hall but but nothing i said hands on my hips as lic begged me to eat outside with her and ange again oliver is leaving in 18 days and i didntsee him at all yesterday so i am going to eat lunch with him damn it oh ok she said meekly and i gave her an apologetic smile before giving her a quick hug and running into the great hall are you actually in the great hall oliver asked as i sat down next to him and grabbed a sandwich it a miracle i smiled i know oliver laughed and so did fred who was sitting across from us with his twin who of which looked rather downcast oh buck up george i said smiling at the red head it can only get better george gave me a pathetic excuse for a smile is she still crying her eyes out nah i shook my head taking a bite out of my roast beef sandwich she misses you though she say that he asked looking rather hopeful well indirectly i shrugged my shoulders oh ange had a good point which got her blushing good and red and she still loves you you know i dunno he mumbled lemme tell you what ange said just donttell lic i told until she in a really good mood i told him knowing that lic would kill me but what she doesntknow wonthurt her george nodded well she said that you two were good for each other and if you two break up there will be so much unresolved sexual tension flying around and since you two are so good for each other you ll eventually go and have a wild shag and get back together anyway so spare us and just go kiss and make up the three guys stared at me and george ears did go as red as his hair it was her words i said not mine and she was actually talking about her and you fred she said that basically what happened minus the wild shag oliver laughed before putting his arm around my waist thanks for the mental images thank freddie fish girlfriend i said motioning to fred and it not my fault sugar quill over here cantkeep pumpkin pasty happy the twins glared at me as oliver laughed again and i smiled apologetically and shrugged my shoulders at the twins they eventually started laughing too eventually who knew i was so funny yeah figured i should end it here i know it not that long but i had to drag this little conflict out for more than a day ok so it not that little but still i going to reinstate my review demands just the usual quote and all that good jazz c mon people it not that hard i do it for the half of you well it seems like everybody likes the pet names and i must say as corny and wrong as they are i love them love love love love love and yeah oliver only has 18 story days left sob i know and once he gone so the story just a heads up but i do plan to do a sequel so no worries june 2nd friday 8th period katie ange what are you doi george slam door lock door slip key into pocket at all times check check check lock alicia spinnet and george weasley together in a broom closet mission accomplished me and ange exchanged high fives outside the closet door panting as we slid down to the floor who knew lic had that much fight in her skinny frame but let me tell you how this all came about so do we both agree that this thing between the two of them cantgo on any longer well if i think that and you think that i think that we can safely say that we both agree drop the sarcasm we need to get them back together do you realize that i never see freddie fish anymore these days this has got to stop we should just lock them in a broom closet katie you re a genius what can i say i try what do you mean that what we re going to do you mean lock them in a broom closet exactly george will come out without a head on his shoulders only because lic will have snogged it off by then werentyou listening to my unresolved sexual tension lecture the other day it has a name katie okay okay jeez no need to get all defensive i like it but i still think that this still has certain risks to sugar quill hahaha i know i a funny genius whatever katie well do it during lunch wait what we are going to lock lic and george in a broom closet during lunch why didnti think of that katie leave me alone it third period i have no idea what binns is talking about it probably going to be on the owls and i didnthave any coffee and lic kept me up all night while you snuck off with freddie fish no comment so that was during third period where me and ange schemed for the whole time and then come lunch we put our plan into action oh damn it i cursed under my breath as i accidentally spilt my cranberry juice on my blouse jeez will you guys come with me to go get some cleaner stuff i asked innocently enough cleaner stuff lic repeated as ange got up to come with me yeah i said grabbing her wrist and tugging on it i ll be quick promise bu she stammered as we pulled her out of the great hall why do you need cleaner stuff she asked as ange put her hand on the closet doorknob and i stood behind her ready to push her in why dontyou just charm it off because you i said as i pushed her forward and ange opened the door are going to snog george senseless you see fred had planted george in there earlier when he told his twin that filch had some great stuff to use as a prank and now lic was in there too along with a crap load of pent up sexual tension lic pounded on the door screaming bloody murder and took full advantage of her vast vocabulary of curse words as ange held the door closed and i locked it before we both slid to the ground and that how we ended up where we were during lunch what going on we looked up to find oliver standing over us with his newts book in his hand well george and lic are locked in the broom cupboard i answered hitching a thumb over my shoulder at the door my back was against you are a damn bi that spinnet alright oliver said smiling at the door before lopsidedly a us took you guys long enough he said offering each of us a hand up so now it eighth period and they are still in there it been an hour and a half and if they haventsnogged each other senseless yet then then then i dunno what because we all know they have they better be oh hey fred so about this double potions that we re in what about it do you have any idea what we re doing is that code for let me copy your homework before snape comes around and collects it yup pretty much are you sure i mean this is my homework you re not going to get any credit for it and it ll look unconspicuous and he wontsee anything different from the norm take it muchas gracias chica caliente freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed you speak spanish i know what chica caliente means donttell oliver dontprank me for one whole year one whole year kates oliver is only around for 16 more days not counting today but i cantprank you for one whole year that wrong and you know it i refuse suit yourself you were never going to tell our dear deranged captain were you no freddie fish it gets out once and now i cantget away from it this petnames are freaking ridiculous so when oliver is snogging you senseless what does he call yo ok pushing my chair over was quite unnecessary just go off and snog angie apple pie or something i would except for the fact that we re sitting in double potions snape is walking around collecting homework i donthave my homework and you still haventgiven me yours to copy here i sighed handing mine over and then he did this neat little spell that made a copy of it but changed the handwriting into his and you could see the words on the page moving around and rewording it nice i said impressed teach me someday maybe he said with a wink as snape took both of our homeworks or rather my homework plus it reved up clone before dinner now have you snogged each other so hard that when i open this door you wontbe able to walk straight i asked leaning against the boom closet door after classes fiddling with the key as everyone else smiled around let me tell you one thing first it was freaking hot in that corridor actually it was hot all over the castle so all day i had been walking around with my blouse un tucked my socks down at my ankles my sleeves rolled up as high as i could get them and my tie unloosened just enough so it would just stay on and two buttons undone it was freaking hot and just to clarify it was freaking hot so i can only imagine how hot it was in that small little closet and not to mention all the resolving of sexual tension and the heat created by that so yeah sorry lic katie lic groaned just let me out alright i smirked as she sounded rather tired as if she had been snogging for the past three hours either that or she had been taking advantage of her vocabulary for three straight hours i shrugged my shoulders weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeell kates george said in a would be reasonable tone if it makes you happy i ll tell you that ange theory on unresolved sexual tension was right and we had a i swear to god ange said threateningly as she stalked up to the door and pointed an accusing finger at it if you say that you had a wild shag i will personally knock down this door and strangle you george weasley well if it gets us out why you calm down ange fred said coming over and pulling his girlfriend away from the door in fear that the prementioned object would be bashed the splinters and his twin would be no more my good brother did not have a wild shag with alicia did you george why i say not my carbon copy george said and i could see his trademark smile in the dark on the other side of the door that would be completely irresponsible and uncharacteristic i added sarcastically my shoulder still against the door not the word i would use george mused but whatever floats your boat or whatever you want to float now will you please let us out so we can snog each other senseless near a fan or at least an open window with a nice breeze coming through lic giggled inside and i laughed as i put the key in and let them out alleluia lic gasped as she staggered out her attire looking even more disheveled than mine fresh air you re the one wearing a skirt george said as he clambered out too say wood lend me a kilt of yours sometime alright it d be nice to get a little breeze now and then oliver punched him in the shoulder lightly as everyone else laughed and finally everything was right once again in our little castle the end ok not really the castle is huge snape still has a wand up his ass so everything is still not right and this is not the end so yeah that part was an over exaggeration or an under exaggeration if you want to take in the size of the castle but whatever 10 pm i am so sorry i said running into the griffindor captain office were oliver had already started cleaning up i had promised i would be there at 7 but i lost track of time and was half an hour late dontworry about it oliver smiled standing over a box which had a bunch of papers stuffed inside you want the desk or the posters desk i said walking around and pulling open several draws god knows if he did it we would spend half the time looking over old plays around nine we were done everything was packed up into three boxes and the room was left bare it looks so strange oliver sighed looking around his bare room i dontthink i ve ever seen it so empty i sighed too it going to be a lot different without you i said looking up at him and smiling a bit i mean think of all the sleep i going to get oliver laughed before nudging into me as he reached down and picked up two of the boxes leaving one for me i laughed and picked up my box which must ve been like twenty pounds of paper stuff and walked out the door outside oliver turned around and shut the door locking it behind him and we walked back up to the castle in silence merlin along with everybody else knew what he was thinking about three years of captaincy were left back in that room that is a lot of memories if you think about all the practices we ve had over the years things really wontever be the same around here without him it ll be even harder on him though think about it we have each other while he leaving granted he officially playing for puddlemere but still that a whole team of people he doesntknow so yeah it going to be weird you realize we could ve charmed these boxes back june 3rd saturday 9 pm mercy mary mother of god i shrieked before i ran out of the owlery it like i canteven send a letter any more these days so i got this letter yesterday from joe yeah here it is to my darling cousin katherine ann bell who is probably the only other sane one in our family i ve decided that everyone around here is completely bonkers off the wall in la la land insane you probably have noticed the reference to our family did you know that grandma sent me a howler the other day a howler from grandma you off all people must know how wrong that is it is beyond wrong it way wrong it not just toeing the line it sprinting miles over the line and even lines after that and it was about girls yes i kid you not apparently a family friend passed on the message that i had gotten together with this girl heather siumon she actually very nice you would like her and eventually grandma found out about this and decided it would be appropriate to send me a howler why couldntit be a nice italian girl why did you have to go like a siumon girl you re in an italian school pick an italian girl it not hard joseph can you even imagine the look of horror on my face when i heard grandma shrill voice screech through breakfast i want to hex myself please please please help this italian homefry your italian homefry slice dog who is currently hiding under his bed in fear of flying tomatoes and ridiculing laughter after today breakfast joe so naturally after receiving this rather disturbing letter i wrote back and headed to the owlery in hopes of being able to send my letter except a certain little couple was having a snog session so i think it makes perfect sense that i fell back down the stairs and landed on my butt when i saw alicia and george going at it like there was no tomorrow katie alicia cried worriedly from the top of the same staircase are you alright i d be a lot better if i didntsee that i moaned rubbing my back as i sat on the floor with my legs spread out in front of me remind me why i got you two back together george chuckled before coming down and giving me a hand up you want me to mail that for you he asked looking at the letter in my hand yes i cried i dontknow if i ll be able to tie it correctly with you two eating each others faces off the whole time george laughed before climbing back up the stairs where lic was waiting and giggling and as he shut the door behind him i practically sprinted away you do realize our tests is six days away say what you forgot didntyou ange asked sitting cross legged on the couch when i came back in no i didntforget i said stubbornly it just happened to slip my mind for the moment same difference ange laughed lightly no big difference i said as i sat down next to her so ange we are going to study together arentwe i flashed her my most brilliant of brilliant smiles go get your books she sighed pretending to sound reluctant i love you ange i said as i got up do i look like oliver she called as i sprinted up the stairs to go get my books so from after dinner till now i have spent the past three hours studying just straight studying ok so maybe i ran into oliver on my way to the bathroom and maybe i went missing from the common room for a few minutes so what and when i say a few minutes i mean fifteen to twenty minutes june 5 monday charms i hate the owls i am about to personally kill them scratch that i am about to kill the genius who had the brilliant idea for them and then hide his body at the bottom of the lake uh oh katesie is getting rather close to homicidal behavior yes katie my bella kaite my bella where did that come from my undying love for you now why wontyou have me damnit you know it wouldntbe fair if i had both of the very dashing weasley twins touche i taught you well what can i say i learned from the best well i not going to argue that point so what do you want fred now that you got me in a rather good mood i want you katie fred ok i was actually wondering if i could help in your murder plot well i think that would be highly acceptable i could use your sharp witted mind you know it sad that i can actually read the sarcasm in your voice well that when i burst out laughing very good mr weasley professor flit wick praised in his squeaky voice what an excellent cheering charm i do say i rather glad i choose to review ten points to griffindor did i just earn points fred asked me in a hushed whisper sounding like a little kid who wasntsure if had done something wrong i know it a miracle i whispered back looking at flitwick practically waiting for him to turn around and say he was joking mark the time and date ok ok i know this is rather short i know so no need to bash on me about it okz i got i would like all of you to review and i would love it if you did the whole quote thing and now this is the part where i make several advertisements for reviewers who send me long reviews and have rather good stories the theory by ladypup it has such a nice little twist on it and i really like it but i am not going to tell you anymore because i refuse to ruin it ok and this one isntreally an advertisement but a rather good story your kiss is on my list i forget who it by but whatever it katie fred i know i know shocking that it not kbow but whatever and it really good the title sounds corny but forget it after reading it i cam to the conclusion that katie fred is actually a really cute couple i almost inspired to write a one shot on it gasp i know but either way go and read it it got like 17 chapters or something but most of them are short so it wonttake too long by the way but please read you ll like it i swear now go and give me a nice review and please go read those stories and remember that i love you all people people people just because i say that katie and fred could make an adorable couple does not mean i will make them one i would like to point out that this story is officially more than one year old and if you think that i about to twist things around now you are on something wow i sound really mean i dontmean to i tend to tell people off while smiling so i not really telling them off it like i joking but getting my point across yeah that what i doing but they could be a cute couple in other stories at least not mine and they have been friend flirting all through out the story i dunno why it suddenly came as a shock last chapter oh and before i start no offense to english rain i sure you re not diseased you ll see what i mean june 6 tuesday 10 pm i hate the rain i really do and flipping england apparently likes to rain every other day it a disease that what it is england rain is like aids it never goes away wow i really need to come up with better analogies what are we doing out here again meditating medi say what meditating ok i got that but why you realize it raining out the light precipitation is cleansing light precipitation i would hardly call this light you re ruining my concentration and you re wasting my time with this mystic voice of yours i said uncrossing my legs and standing up you have officially lost it ange i added looking own at her her legs crossed with her hands resting on her knees and her eyes closed in concentration mmmmmmmmmm i rolled my eyes before walking back down the small hill i heard from a seventh year that meditating helps you on the owls i heard her say i stopped in my tracks walked back up the hill and resumed my spot next to her in the english down pour mmmmmmmmm you re soaking wet oliver said as i splaloshed back into the common room an hour later his eyebrows going into his hairline god damn this rain and god damn angelina leanne johnson do you know we sat out there in the downpour for an hour after classes still in our uniforms i know i groaned as i flopped down next to him on the couch soaking wet i personally was just glad i had a halter tank top underneath my blouse like always so my wet shirt didntwork against me too much i cantsay the same for angelina and she still out there in the rain oliver sighed before standing up well i that horrendous to look at you could at least tell me i looked up at him he laughed before grabbing my hand and lifting me to my feet go get some dry clothes on you know the seasons over i smirked you cantboss me around anymore cap n well it not my fault you manage to do what i say anyway he smirked back putting his hands on my hips you can be every persuasive i agreed wrapping my arms around his neck hmm he rest his forehead against mine remind me how i did that again i think you remember he let out a small chuckle before kissing me he wrapped his arms around me tightly and my hands shifted through his hair oliver officially has the best hair in this whole damn castle by the way oh yeah and we re bad we broke apart to find lic and george to have just come in through the portrait hole and it was no surprise that both of them were smirking while lic used george as an arm rest at least we didntfall down any stairs lic commented and george smirk first off i scowled at them as oliver arm snaked around my waist again i thought i was in charge of sarcasm around here and second of all it not my fault there just happen to be a staircase there alicia just shrugged her shoulders and george smirked before saying well knock first for the owlery when do i need permission for that why are you soaking wet lic asked as if suddenly noticing brilliant mind you have i smiled sarcastically before trudging up the stairs to my dorm and so i finally got out of my soaking wet clothes but now that i think of it i could ve just charmed them dry oh yeah these owls are going to be f u n fun so yeah i changed into a pair of maroon shorts with white trim and two stripes running up the leg and then a deep royal blue long sleeve shirt which said puddlemere on it that i rolled up to my elbows before putting my sopping wet hair into a messy bun wow i could ve charmed my hair dry too damn i need to get more on top of these things i bounded back into the common room to see that oliver had changed out of his school uniform and into a pair of royal blue sweats and yellow tee shirt sitting on the couch and reading his newts book both either saying puddlemere on it or having the logo or both these new i asked as i hopped over the back of the couch and landed next to him what do you mean he asked cocking his head to the side damn i love it when he does that then that little bit of hair falls in front of his face and control katie control must not snog senseless big breaths in out bigger in out in better in out in so where was i oh yeah these i said tugging lightly on the shoulder of his tee shirt did you get them while i was sleeping or something no he smiled lopsidedly puddlemere sent them over for some reason or another so other teams dontsteal you away i smiled back i hate his smile it so contagious they re winning you over by showering you with gifts well they ll be upset to hear that i ve already been won over he said going back to reading his book what do you mean i asked confused you oliver i sighed smiling that was just about the corniest thing i have ever heard he let out a large laugh but also immensely sweet i added sincerely i try he smiled closing his book and giving me a peck on the cheek wanna go for a walk he asked sure i smiled as he got up and lent me a hand up soooo i dragged out as we walked down the corridor lacing my fingers with his where are we going i honestly have no idea he smiled down at me giving my hand a small squeeze the kitchens maybe sounds good i smiled back so we walked down three floors tickled the banana and went inside the kitchens were the house elves barraged us what would the mr and miss like to eat so very nice to see you again mr wood what can i get you ms bell strapples me and oliver chorused together i looked up at him and found him looking at me and we both cracked a smile god we re sappy so australia vs russia again with this yes ka at you just dontwant to admit that my buds down unda would kick your russians sorry asses i said back in the common room a while later sitting on the couch next to oliver that not true oh c mon i groaned kate everson could fly circles around jim john gladstone if she wanted to i dontknow why she would oliver said putting an arm around my shoulders she a keeper and he a chaser why would she be flying circles around him you and your technicalities i mumbled folding my arms across my chest stubbornly katie and oliver oliver shut his mouth as he was going to say something and we both craned our necks to look over the back of the couch ange and lic were coming down the stairs and ange hair was still wet i need to play chess ange said coming over and fish the board out from beneath the coffee table care to explain oliver asked as he eased back down when i was meditating i felt an urge to play chess she explained as if it was nothing out of the ordinary as she placed the board on the table and started setting the pieces up so i need to play and hopefully the two of you combined will be a good match for me getting a little high on our podium are we ange lic asked as she sat down in one of the arm chairs no not really ange mused for a moment as i eased myself down to the floor and oliver moved behind me his feet on either side of my hips they always lose to me anyway maybe if i play both of them we ll get past five turns hey i said sharply pointing a finger at her that only happened once and that was only because i was sick and high on whatever the hell medicine you gave me siu what does that mean oliver asked from behind me suck it up i rolled my eyes as she started the game and moved her pawn checkmate what no way i said twenty minutes later looking over the chessboard again no way in hell siu shut it up oliver added what i asked my brow furrowed as i turned around to look at him shut it up siu he explained shrugging his shoulders he so damn cute i mumbled to myself happily as i settled back down except i thought i thought it but i didn t i said it thanks kat he said cheerfully as he reached over and messed up my hair i knew i had some wires crossed june 7 wednesday transfiguration katie are you getting any of this not one ounce told you you should ve meditated more my brain soaking in everything like a sponge shut it ange you shut it the both of you i the dumbiest one on this note dumbiest isnta word katie my bella katie my bella what the hell does that mean fred absolutely bloody nothing angie apple pie oh

chair spill my ink on me and put gum in my hair all at once that was gum right fred fred oh i hate you all 9pm do you even know what you re looking at not in the slightest well maybe we should meditate i mumbled plopping into a chair next to oliver in the library what he asked shocked and confused as he looked up from his book to me forget it i sighed and taking out my own books after classes i dontknow how i going to do this i moaned 45 minutes later i never going to make it through this test oliver wrapped his arms around my slumped shoulders and pressed his cheek against mine you ll be fine trust me i sighed and looked at him that what you said about the hufflepuff game and look what happened you know i was just starting to get over that he said and now you ve just ripped open the wound i smiled at him crookedly well i sorry cap n i figured since it happened more than five months ago you would ve gotten over it by now i like an elephant he said resting his chin on my shoulder i never forget than why are you having so much trouble studying i smirked with an eyebrow cocked ok he said after a pause i have no witty comeback for that one i let out a laugh as he let his arms drop and leaned back in his chair either that or my brain is too fried to think up one in such short notice i ll give you the benefit of the doubt thanks kat that what i here for i smiled crookedly fixing the little things anybody else could fix but they re the little things that no one thinks or cares to fix he pointed out sincerely have you been reading poetry or something lately i asked shocked what he seemed even more shocked that me you know william shakespeare poe robert frost no he interrupted me shaking his head why do you say that because lately you ve been coming up with these insanely adorabe corny one liners i smiled thanks that swhat i here for he smirked leaning over and giving me a kiss well that no reason to mock me i said once we broke apart june 8 history of magic ok so i know that the owls are in two days no need to tell me yeah i perfectly fine freaking peachy a ok wonderful b e a u tiful i good so can do this and by writing in this stupid notebook to

have a very important question for everyone who has the decency to review puddlemere united is just a team right i not sure and i gonna need it for later november 1 sunday 10 am i woke up from sleeping on my stomach my head facing the right or rather facing oliver i forgot that we were all sleeping in the great hall so you can imagine my surprise to find oliver sleeping face inches from mine my eyes shot open and i slowly remembered what happened last night my eyes relaxed an i almost fell back asleep instead of letting my self have the much needed sleep i rubbed the sand out of my eyes and looked around the floor was covered with hundreds of purple sleeping bags some empty from earlier risers i looked at my watch 7 16 i groaned and looked at my friends alicia was asleep on her side her sleeping bag neat compared to mine which seemed to move almost a foot to the right oliver was asleep on his side facing me sleeping peacefully snoring softly angelina was talking softly something about lee fred was asleep on his stomach drooling on his pillow as his twin seemed to run in his sleep slightly i stretched on my stomach my arms and legs reaching as far out as possible and yawned i probably would ve fallen asleep if oliver hadntput his hand on my shoulder he startled me and i think i jumped 6 inches off the floor morning sleeping beauty he said sleepily too bad i still not asleep i laid my head back down on the pillow facing him oliver smiled his eyes only half way open what time is it he asked trying to stifle a yawn but failed i looked back at my watch almost 7 20 i didntwake you up did i he rubbed his eyes not at all he looked around why are we in the great hall in purple sleeping bags i smiled he completely forgot guess he not a morning person either well lets think yesterday sirius black broke in and destroyed the fat lady and they brought us here i remember now he yawned again am i still wearing the sweater i wore in hogsmeade he just glanced at his arm that was still holding my shoulder and dropped it i suppose since they didntgive us time to change i ran a hand through my hair which came loose overnight and realized how much knots i had boy do you have bed head oliver smiled slyly dontstart with me this early in the morning oliver wood i warned besides you should talk i reached over and tugged lovingly at a lock of hair that was sticking almost straight up oliver laughed and swiped my hand away lightly lee you angelina groaned in her sleep i looked over at her and i had to shove my fist in my mouth so i wouldntlaugh i looked over at oliver and he was trying not to laugh too i rolled on my back and looked up at the enchanted ceiling it was cloudy out but the sun still shone through with a morning light of yellows and blues you hungry oliver asked softly leaning over me so all i could see was his brown eyes and bed head i shrugged my shoulder and rolled back onto my stomach shouldntwe wait for them i asked indicating to a drooling fred and everyone else they ll meet us there soon enough he crawled out of his sleeping bag and slipped on his shoes after i did up my converse he offered me his hand and helped my up come on he whispered why do i think we re gonna step on someone i heard oliver laugh lightly in front of me as he stepped over a fourth year in ravenclaw we finally made it out of the great hall managing not to step on anyone i straightened out my sweater same as the white one but red and fixed my jeans oliver did the same they didnteven let us change i moaned once we were done you re fine oliver said as we headed up the stairs to the second floor you dontthink they ll be mad at us nah fred and george ll bring them up here anyway we reached the huge painting of the fruit bowl and oliver tickled the banana the painting swung open and revealed the kitchen full of house elves as soon as they saw us the house elves rushed us hello mr wood and miss bell are you hungry can we get you something what would you like to eat we just finished a batch of pancakes yes the pancakes there ll still hot and fresh well what would you like oliver asked looking at me smiling umm pancakes would be perfect i answered the house elves went into motion half went and got the pancakes syrup and everything else while the other half pushed us over towards a large circular table in the corner they sat us roughly in to chairs and then they went to go help the others in five minutes there was a breakfast for a king in front of each of us jez i said looking the twenty pancakes stacked in front of me up and down i never gonna eat all this so don t oliver said taking three pancakes off the top of his stack and putting them in a separate plate in front of him i shrugged my shoulders and did the same except i took two pancakes instead of three the pancakes were superb i took one bite and fell in love with the things they were a perfect golden brown on the outside and inside it was light and fluffy heaven pure heaven the house elves eventually brought out eggs and bacon too and just squeezed orange juice to the cup oliver held up his glass i sighed smiling and tapped my glass against his and we both drank half of our o j do you think we ll do it no i was being sarcastic but he didntquite catch the huge huge huge hint if it i put in oliver eyes widened in shock and disbelief i rolled my eyes he could pick up the slightest itsy bitsy mistake with your flying but was oblivious in the real world sometimes i rolled my eyes of course we will what if we don t well you ll go to puddlemere and be the best damn keeper they ve ever seen it was really quite simple but i just want to see your name on the stupid cup i know oliver sighed i thought we had it in the bag for the past three years with harry he a great seeker i paused but he also the boy who lived and has obligations to save something or an other oliver smiled so saving the school and the world isntgood enough i pretended to think a bit no oliver just laughed and started eating his pancakes i smiled and was about to take a bit when everyone else ran in there they are i told you they d be here where else would they be are those pancakes alicia angelina fred and george ran over to us bed hair and all they grabbed separate plates on the way over and started piling some of our pancakes on their plates well good morning to you too i said as i watch the twins shovel food down their throats morbin fred said cheerfully melso george said smiling through a mouth full of pancakes yeah if they actually swallowed that would ve helped november 3 tuesday potions 4 days till the match i hate my life hate it hate it hate it so maybe i was singing it but i still hate it snape is going on about how important his class is and blah blah blah and that we all have to get e s on the o w l s yadda yadda yadda and how useful potions is in the real world gibber gibber gibber and that he will only take the brightest students next year

singing i just handed in the project that me and flint did and yes i clearly like in big bold letters marked which subtopics he did and which ones i did i am not flunking because of his stupidity i

right of course i am 3 days till the match my god you re turning into oliver am not yes you are because i love quidditch just a little too much look you wrote how many days to the match in your diary it not a diary then what is it a stupid notebook my parents gave me before school started to write all my teenage thoughts in which are stupid well coming form you of course they are shut it interesting stuff we talk about hu and way to put me down alicia thanks for your support and this is just a stupid notebook after dinner in the library 5 45 you do realize we have practice in an hour oliver sat down across from me at our favorite table do you realize i have a mountain of home work i was breaking down i had yet another potions essay i didnteven start due friday thank god i changed into jeans because i would be dead on the floor by now if i had to wear a skirt i can never really think in those things i think snape is trying to beat me into the floor before we can play slytherin probably he paused so only three days i know oliver he just smiled you donthave to yell and you re in a library i dontgive a damn i slammed my head on the table i doomed i not going to get any of my stupid homework done and if i do it ll all be crap because i ll i can think about is this stupid game and my stupid nerves kicked in this morning oliver walked around the table and sat next to me he placed a comforting arm around my shoulders and gave me a hug so that his mouth was right next to my ear there there kat turning into me isntall that bad hu i turned my head and glared at him he knew that wasntmaking me feel any better oliver wood when they find your lifeless form hanging from the middle goal post there wontbe any question about who did it because i will hang a huge banner that ll say oliver wood rightly and justly murdered for the pain he caused his team mentally and physically and under that it ll say by a very proud katie bell and under that the whole school will be cheering he wasntphased at all i went back to being face to face with the grain of the table as oliver put all my books back in my leather messenger bag come on kat and he pulled lightly on my arm just leave me here i dunno if he could hear me because i was practically talking to the grain seeker i had found in the wood he was about to catch the snitch as the chasers and everyone else watched i was turning into oliver dontmake me carry you he threatened he couldntsee it but my eyes shot open you know i will i instantly got up and almost ran down to the quidditch pitch oliver close behind november 6 friday 8 00 tomorrow deep breaths katie deep breaths i hyperventilating here tomorrow is the match at ten i know i not going to get any sleep at all not one wink besides from the game tomorrow i really tense about something else marcus flint asked me out where the hell did that come from i was walking in the hall all shaky because of you know the game and he stops me out of no where and asks me what i doing tonight the game is tomorrow remember i was edgy because of nerves alone i probably shouldnthave been talking to anybody at all oh yeah i think a very small and dim light bulb went off somewhere in that deep cavity where you re supposed to have a brain well how about after you know what i was going to be as kind as possible the last thing i need right now is something else preoccupying especially a boyfriend so when will you want one i took a deep breath dunno i guess that wasntkind enough because he walked away in a huff oh well i was going to tell oliver but he even worse than me and i dontwant to have that on his mind when he playing tomorrow right reviews please oh and if you could tell me if puddlemere was just a team or a team and a school that d be great once again thanks for your reviews you guys are the best november 7 saturday something after the match we lost we were cheated and we lost we all tried to eat breakfast but no one really ate anything that ok i like to fly on an empty stomach during a game we headed to the pitch and changed into our scarlet robes and waited for oliver to give us one of his usual pre game prep talks that we all know and love but it never came so we followed him onto the field it was raining like you would not believe we went out onto the field and by the time the captains shook hands we were soaked to the bone you could barely hear the crowd the thunder and wind covered most their cheers we kicked off splattering anyone nearby with mud us chasers formed the circle above madame hooch she threw the quaffle up and by chance alone i came up with it we streaked down the field angelina and alicia flanking me somebody started ramming me and i passed it off to angelina but this stupid hufflepuff was still ramming me i guess they didntsee me pass i dunno so i kicked them off and they went flying and almost hit the stands oppsie the first bolt of lightning light up the sky and oliver called a time out i dunno how long we had been out there it could ve been three hours for all i know we all huddled underneath a huge scarlet umbrella by then we were up by fifty and i had almost been hit by a bludger twice harry was saying something about his glasses but me alicia and angelina werentpaying attention do you have any idea how much strength it takes to throw a quaffle to your team mate when it raining like there was no tomorrow and every gust of wind could take it away i dontthink so we had been flying against the rain more than half the time and let me tell you it like trying to fly through a solid wall our faces were red from the rain whipping our faces and muddier than anybody else our nice little break was over in five minutes and we were kicked out of our nice umbrella and back into the tormenting rain twenty minutes in we had scored another three goals and up by 80 we were heading back towards the hufflepuff goal posts when we heard oliver scream harry harry behind you everyone turned around and watched as cedric sped down the field a small hint of gold not 15 feet from him the world went quite as they raced towards the snitch i thought it was just me and then we realized a whole fleet or whatever of dementors came onto the field everyone in the pitch froze players stopped dead and the crowd was as silent as the grave if it was possible the air got even colder and the quaffle i was holding started to get frost on it we all watched in horror as harry looked down at the dementors and fell off his broom almost 50 feet as cedric caught the tiny snitch in his fingers it was the scariest thing that i ve ever seen then dumbledore came running out onto the pitch he did something to harry and he fell a lot slower and then he i dunno threw some white hex or something at the dementors and they left by then we had all raced towards harry who was underneath a layer of mud 2 inches thick his glasses laying unbroken next to him we took him to the hospital wing and in thirty minutes he woke up we were completely cover from head to toe with mud harry friends were there too they were lucky to just be wet fred and george brother ron and hermione granger fred was the first one to realize he woke up harry how are you feeling poor harry falling 50 feet what happened he asked in a daze you fell off what like 50 feet fred explained we thought you died alicia said shaking you would ve thought there was an earthquake but the match he was so pale what happened are we doing a replay no one answered and harry grew even paler as the truth sunk in we didn t lose diggory got the snitch just after you fell george explained he didntrealize what happened when he looked back and saw you on the ground he tried to call it off wanted a rematch but he won fair and square even wood admits it it was defiantly not fair and square harry would ve beaten him to the snitch i know it we would ve won where is wood harry asked guess he didntrealize he wasntthere till then and poor oliver he last chance to win it not over though we wontgive up we ll come back i refuse to blow the cup on our first game that we lost because of some stupid dementors still in the showers fred answered we think he trying to drown himself i hope he doesn t then fred and george got into a bunch of statistics that someone has to lose by a hundred either way i dunno i was too bummed then madame pomphrey came over and told us to leave let harry have some peace i was really bummed as you can see and wound up punching the door and hurting my left hand 5 30 after we went and saw harry everyone headed up to the common room where hot showers were waiting instead i went in the exact opposite direction to the pitch what i had to make sure oliver didntkill himself that my job i was walking up to the locker room and a flight a stairs away i could hear the shower still running boy i really hoped that fred was wrong and he wasnttrying to drown himself oliver i reached the locker room and opened the door oliver you cantdrown yourself over one stupid game could he hear me over the shower i sat down on one of the benches closer to the shower before anybody asks no you cannot see into the shower so dontwaste your breath oliver it just a stupid game we can still win the cup i was screaming over the water we can still win you can still have your name on the stupid cup my voice had finally cracked after screaming on the field over the rain plus now you have no idea how many times i tried to organize the team play but i couldntyell loud enough for everyone to hear i gave up screaming rubbed my face harshly and leaned against the lockers how did this happen i thought we had it i know we did those stupid dementors no one else fell off their broom why did harry ok i ve got to stop pointing fingers i ve just get angrier i dontthink that possible i banged my already hurting hand against the lockers and cried out i didntthink it would hurt that much i guess oliver heard me because next thing you know he standing in front of me in a towel around his waist a towel if only his fan club knew about this but then again they probably have thousands of pictures of him naked bad thought bad bad thought just stop thinking katie give your brain a break and stop thinking i instantly slapped my good hand against my eyes and screamed will you go put something on when i opened my eyes he was going over into the next aisle to get changed but boy i never knew he had all that muscle under those robes 5 years of quidditch would do that to you i suppose i guess i never realized was because it all lean muscle not that kind that bulge out of random spots katie stop thinking he came back thankfully in jeans and a red sweater which looked really good on him has he worn that before i said stop thinking you know your face is covered in mud he said sitting down next to me i looked down at my quidditch robes and back at him i covered in mud how harry i sighed i knew this was coming ok from falling 50 feet i mean he still shocked not from falling well probably from falling too but more about that match well maybe more from falling i took a deep deep deep breath he alive i said not to sure if that was a right answer oliver smiled or at least as much as a guy who thought they lost the cup could smile out of the corner of his mouth i should defiantly give up thinking all together it wasntfair i mumbled under my breath yes it was oliver said softly harry fell off i stood up i was so angry i could ve breathed fire not it wasntfair harry has a thing with the dementors they shouldnthave been there it has to be an interference or something no it wasn t kat yes it was we would ve won harry would ve beaten diggory and we wouldntbe depending on a hundred points difference i know he would ve beaten him i trailed off and plopped back onto the bench i know it isntthat what counts that we know that we re better i just stared at him who the hell are you and what have you done with oliver oliver laughed and dragged me off the bench and onto my feet come on you better get into something clean and dry he looked at me up and down in all my muddy glory and then i realized my clothes were sticking to me everywhere i slapped him across the face and walked out he followed me smiling cockily with a red hand on his cheek november 8 sunday 11 am ugh i didntget a wink of sleep last night surprise surprise i wonder why i wound up waking up at five in the morning i tried to get back to sleep and by six i was down at the lake skipping stones stupid dementors if they only caught black before he escaped this would ve never happened and he did get in and they didntcatch him or anything what are they good for anyway so basically i spent a cold morning skipping rocks across the surface of the lake one time the giant squid came up to the surface and got in the path of one of my skipping rocks i heard a dull thump against it head and winced as it raised one of it tentacle thingies and brought it down hard near the shore so now i was spending a cold morning soaking wet and i forgot my wand so i couldnteven dry my clothes off i was wearing a scarlet turtle neck sweater same fit as my white with a burgundy and gold scarf yes the school one and jeans you can imagine my discomfort or maybe you cantbecause you re a book i really need to give up thinking did you go for a swim some one said and i spun around you know it november dontyou it was oliver smiling he was wearing a denim jacket and a green sweater really i asked smiling too i didntrealize it was 40 degrees out oliver took out his wand and dried me off god bless that man so does it help he asked after he put his wand away does what help throwing rocks does it help at all as long as you donthit the squid oliver laughed and joined me it was really nice we were the only ones outside and it was really peaceful with the leaves in all different colors and a few birds that still hadntleft yet but oliver of course ruined it so at the end of november hufflepuff plays ravenclaw oliver i groaned what you ruined it ruined what it was so peaceful and perfect i almost forgot about yesterday for a second oh i guess i did too for a second he added sorry hold up did oliver wood the oliver wood just apologize to me oh i got to rub it in or i should ve but i didn t so since i ruined the moment when were you going to tell me flint asked you out he wasnteven looking at me when he asked boy he was mad about that after the game i said looking at him with a guilty face he asked me friday for that night i was going to tell you then and normally i would ve but we had the match and you didntneed anything else on your mind i was going to tell you tomorrow why not today he still wasntlooking at me because we lost the match yesterday and i figured you didntneed anything else getting you upset besides i figured you needed time to cool off i was starring at the floor kicking a small pebble into the lake i sorry the next thing i knew i was in oliver arms yeah wasntexpecting that you know you can tell me anything he said softly in my ear no matter what is going on i wanted to melt right there and i probably could ve but he my captain for god sake and so what if i saw him only in a towel it was only once no biggie right come on he let go of me let go back inside 5 pm ugh marcus flint asked me out again so i was wondering if you werentdoing anything tonight if does this boy ever catch a hint marcus yeah he makes me call him marcus not marc marcus i still really bummed

his mouth i know how that fells he said i bet he does we whooped their asses last year that was around 3 30 around four he brings me a box of chocolates ok this was going way way overboard before you told me that you d just like to eat chocolates so i went and found you some i must ve dazed out there for a second because he called my name katie i snapped out of it i hate being mean but there no other way he gonna leave me alone i looked at the box of chocolates and handed them back to him marcus i sorry if i ever sent you the wrong signals but i dontwant a boyfriend but all those times in the library you were so close to me what the hell was he talking about marcus you were the one getting closer to me i explained he just looked at me like i had three heads i tried to send you hints but you never caught them so every time you got up i moved your chair farther away so you never liked me i took him really off guard but i a chaser i supposed to i sorry i was well normally i would ve i hate being harsh like that but it marcus flint we re talking about he scowled at me and walked away hall way down the hall he shoved the chocolates in a first years hand at least somebody got something out of it i sighed and went to find oliver he what did you know that oliver has this vein on the right side of his neck no well lemme tell you it came to life when i told him what happened er he asked me out again i said i was bummed out and wanted to eat chocolate so 30 minutes later come comes and gives me a box of chocolates i summed up what exactly did he say it was like 4 15 and we were standing under the big oak where alicia and everyone else was was beyond me exactly exactly i took a deep breath and told him exactly what happened word from word that little vein looked like it was going to burst out of him and start dancing on his neck i going to kill him oliver said sinking down to the ground his back against the trunk legs spread out in front of him oh dontgo and do that i said sitting down cross legged to his left my body facing him and why not because you ll expelled our team will crumble and you ll never see your name on that stupid cup oliver smiled yeah i guess you re right i know i am but when we play them you can play as foul as you want his vein almost disappeared once again thank you all eruaphadriel armr4sleep16 bubbleishness bri007 and book lover 990

have practice i mean everyday i don t i have only some small thing to do when i do have practice i have a mt everest of homework they hate us all he couldnthave been more right i laughed and pulled out his herbology book and opened to the marked page what do you have to do draw some kind of plant i cocked an eyebrow and why couldntyou do this because i dontknow which plant paying attention would help no she gave us a list of clues or some thing and we have to find out what plant and draw it ah i never get neat little assignments like that here were the clues i hate the sun and live in dark dank places get in my way and i ll kill you harsh much i have no flowers and no thorns wow i think he got the easiest thing in the world oliver you dunce it the devil snare oh my god he never gonna

picture of it in his book now help me with potions little bit after midnight i dontthink practice could ve run any later it was our first practice since the match and oliver is working us harder than ever unfortunately harry broom was totaled and had to use one of the school brooms a comet 1 that thing is ancient i think it older than me oliver already gave him tons of magazines and is pressuring him to buy the most expensive broom out there a firebolt i told him off already harry is not going to empty out his vault for a broom why not because he still has to get through school not to mention afterwards but just think i am thinking i thinking what the hell will harry do when he has no more money because you told him to go empty his vault on a broom he ll get a job oliver get your head out of the clouds and back down to earth he 13 who gonna hire him so he can pay for school i would but you dontown a business the team was watching us fight and laughing at the same time what is so funny we both snapped at once you two fight like a married couple fred said laughing what once again we snapped at the same time then glared at each other and then back to the team do not they just flew away laughing hysterically get back up there bell when oliver uses someone last name it normally not a good thing i glared at him before flying off to the other side of the feild i was cooling down when oliver started up again around eight harry the firebolt is i was hovering next to george i snatched his bat out of his hands oliver wood if you dontstop harassing harry i swear to god that you ll what hit me i did a bludger came buy and i swung it at him i honestly didntthink that i would get him but it did it hit him right in his torso and he got knocked off his broom i was just lucky that he was only 20 feet from the floor and that it had rained the other day so the ground was soft i think my eyes completely took over my head and i dropped the bat which fell to the ground nice shot george said softly oliver i screamed as i pelted down the field all i could think was i killed my captain i killed my captain i killed my captain i killed oliver i knocked him off his broom and i killed him it seemed to take forever to reach the other side of the field to the bottom of the goal post where oliver was laying i sorry i sorry i sorry i landed next to him i shook his shoulders oliver nothing oliver boy i had really done it i thought i killed him then his eyes fluttered open for a second as the team landed next to me oh thank god you re not dead oliver smiled cockily before closing his eyes again that was a good shot fred said maybe we ll get off tomorrow i grabbed his robes by the collar and shook him roughly is that all you can think of i almost killed him alicia laughed i guess you re forgetting all the times we got hit in the chest but we didntfall off our brooms i did once angelina said as an after thought i think we should bring him to the hospital wing harry said good idea and the twins carried him up there the rest of trailing behind so madame pomphrey put him in one of the beds and did all this nurse stuff they were all going to stay but i wouldntlet them i the one who almost killed him i ll stay are you sure angelina asked positive you guys have homework and i almost completely finished go and they left after 15 minutes oliver still hadntwoken up and i once again came under the assumption that i killed him he never going to wake up he dead he dead and i killed him so you can imagine what i was like when after and hour he didntwake up i killed my captain i killed oliver wood my freaking kilt wearing son of a bitch captain i gonna have to switch schools like any school would take a murderer i gonna have to move back to the states my grandparents are still there but will they still love me no i ll live in the country and off the land i ll have this nice little burrow and i ll share it with some rabbits maybe a few prairie dogs and gophers too do

hope they understand that i leaving because i killed him maybe they ll send me some food i hope they have a nice burial service for oliver they should defiantly bury him with his broom he d like that why did i have to kill you oliver i asked aloud moaning and i put my hands back over my face who did you kill i dropped my hands and looked around besides me and the so thought dead oliver i was the only one hear over here genius i looked at oliver who i still thought was dead and realized that he was propped up on his elbows eyes wide open and smiling oliver i threw my arms around him i didntkill you you thought you killed me well you fell off i pulled away and i really really really really really really reaallllly sorry i threw my arms around him and he held me tight you thought i was dead he asked astounded your shot was good but not that good he couldntsee it but i was smiling from ear to ear i shoulda known oliver would never be brought down by the game he loves but my shot was good he pulled away how long have you been here since we brought you here at eight what time is it i looked at my watch almost 11 you ve been here for 3 hours i thought he was going to go into shock i told you i thought i killed you i was about to get out of the country oliver laughed it not funny i really thought i killed you can i get out of here i shrugged my shoulders i hate the hospital wing i leaving he was getting out of his bed but i pushed him back down you re staying here what if you have a broken rib it could puncture your lung or something he sighed well where madame

pomphrey concluded so he not going to die i asked hey i had to be sure heavens no madame pomphrey laughed i suppose you re free to go mr wood she drew up a pass if filch catches you she explained so you really thought you killed me oliver asked as we headed back to the common room well you were out of it for three hours you didntsee me breathing i was a little preoccupied with the thought that i did kill you and i was planning to live in a burrow in the country with gophers oliver laughed and placed an arm around my shoulders let go get something to eat and he steered me towards the kitchen we each got a bagel i got sesame seed with cream cheese and oliver got egg with butter we finished our bagels in the kitchen and headed back towards the seventh floor oliver i said softly the third floor maybe i sorry i sorry too hold up oliver wood apologizing to me again i starting to like this habit i shouldnthave snapped at you we had stopped in front of a portrait of some old guy sleeping

friday under the big oak 6 it snowed and still going no one was paying attention in any of my classes all of our eyes were transfixed at the white flurries only a pane of glass away some of my teachers completely gave up like professor flitwick he taught us a charm that would make it snow inside with out the disadvantages no cold and it doesntmelt into a watery mess professor lupin was nice about it too but snape would die before he let us off the hook even though the snow had completely covered the windows to the small dungeon we still pressed on bastard as soon as classes ended we ran up to the tower got changed and meet under the big oak we built a snowman which we built in oliver likeness a broom and a sour face fred and george pretended that snowman oliver was yelling at them what that oh dear captain of mine fred asked the mute snowman you think i the greatest quidditch player ever thank you he squealed and walked over to the real oliver who was sitting under the tree why arentyou ever that nice to me oliver laughed before standing up and throwing a snowball at him that when all hell let loose fred jumped on oliver and tried pushing his face in the snow george threw a snow ball at angelina so i jumped on him then he started giving me a piggyback ride and that was fine and dandy until he accidentally fell on his back angelina pulled him off of me so i could breath and alicia threw a snowball at his face and it went on like that until we all fell down in the snow under the oak tree that was the best fred said breathing heavily running around in a foot and a half of snow for a hour is not an easy task hey lets make snow angels angelina offered and like little kids who just got a snow day we made snow angels the worst part i said in the midst of making mine is when you get up and there is a single hand right in the middle here oliver being a too cool for snow angels seventh year had finished quickly and offered me a hand he helped me up and guess what no hand perfect i said softly as we admired my handiwork that could ve been mistakened for a two year olds after two hours of messing aroundin the snow we headed inside and went up to the common room not before stopping at the kitchen and grabbing butter beer a thermos of hot chocolate and bags of cookies to bring up with us we all got changed into warm dry sweats and sat on the couches in front of the hearth which had a huge fire going so what cookies do we got fred asked looking in his i ve got raisin uck oat meal oliver checked his bag i ve got butter scotch angelina offered peanut butter here haha i got my favorite george what do you have fred asked ummm blueberry george asked aloud holding up one of his oh i got the chocolate chip alicia shouted of course we shared though what are we barbarians not including fred and george that is that not very nice katie besides fred is the real barbarian not me maybe but you re the perv in the family i think you re forgetting percy no percy the prick well what did you say i was perv oh my god i cantget up for one second with out the twins vandalizing you november 22 saturday 8 am i would ve slept in later but i had this bizarre dream and i couldntget to sleep after wards here i ll tell you after i finish up about last night we stayed on the couch in the common room until like 11 at night around ten oliver brings up what else quidditch so only 5 days until ravenclaw plays hufflepuff he said in what he wanted to be an off hand way we all groaned then a little light bulb went off in my head hey let make a pool why do we need a swimming pool right after a snow storm fred asked no a betting pool i explained like we all did at the world cup they were all game and i drew up the chart now no skipping out when you have to pay oh and the minimum is 5 sickles i warned and 5 heads nodding in agreement i ll put in 10 sickles and 5 knuts that ravenclaw kills hufflepuff oliver said writing his name and amount down holding a grudge alicia said smiling no for the record oliver is a terrible terrible liar eventually we filled up the chart so oliver angelina said what do you want for your birthday like we all dontknow i said mumbling loudly everyone laughed and oliver playfully punched my shoulder he probably wants us all to empty out our vaults pitch in and get him a firebolt george said o liver almost spat out the butter beer he was drinking donteven bring that up he laughed then george passed me a beaters bat i just stared at it we re waiting on the bludger he explained we all cracked up hysterically so how marcus flint doing these days alicia asked did he get you anymore chocolates angelina added or is he popping those pimples of his the butter beer in my mouth sprayed across the room at that last one i instantly placed a hand over my mouth laughing before i did anything else the room burst into laughter once again scourgify alicia managed through laughs and cleaned up the mess sorry i said meekly at least you didntalmost kill anyone angelina laughed what is this i asked standing up make fun of katie day it always make fun of katie day fred and george said together ok so i set myself up for that one i plopped back down on the couch next to oliver laughing with everyone else around 10 alicia and angelina went to bed and fred and george soon followed were they leaving me alone with oliver on purpose i dontneed a boyfriend for crying out loud i hope ravenclaw kills hufflepuff i said softly starring at the fire so why didntyou bet on that oliver asked because just because i want it to happen doesntmean it will i sighed oliver arm somehow made it around my shoulders when did that get there who says it won t the facts what facts well the ravenclaw chasers are better than the hufflepuff but the ravenclaw keeper is weak on his left hoop so that would be everyone right and mostly stronger hand i looked over to oliver and he was starring at me what isntit simple why hasntanybody else pick that up you mean you haven t if he said yes i dunno what i woulda done no i have but no else i know how d you figure it out i shrugged my shoulders i always shoot lefty before righty it was harder to get a shoot by him lefty normally it the opposite he was still starring gosh you know i have a brain under all this blonde hair right oliver laughed yeah i know i also know it doesntkick in during potions no that when it goes for a walk around the grounds he laughed again so what do you want for your birthday he thought for a second nothing nothing nothing not even a firebolt that not fair you cantget me that i wontlet you get me that i just asked what you wanted not what you wanted from me i smiled slyly gotcha so we talked for 45 minutes and i headed up to bed night oliver night sleeping beauty he called softly as i climbed the stairs which is really weird now that i think of it not him saying that but how it relates to my dream i think i was sleeping beauty i dontknow alls i know is that i was running around in a floor length gown and i think a tiara on my head i can tell you i was not happy and i was watching oliver fly above me in a kilt a kilt how bizarre hu can you understand now why i couldntget to sleep november 27 thursday after dinner haha ravenclaw flattened hufflepuff no really ravenclaw was up by 50 and then they caught the snitch haha i wanted ravenclaw to win i a sucker for grudges and so are fred and george they threw a small in their dorm for the team celebrating the conquering of our enemy i so glad they lost though plus we re about a gillion times better than ravenclaw and therefore it just proves the pint that we are at least a ga gillion times better than hufflepuff so there and they did cheat with us and now we re not out of the running for the cup hufflepuff is though we can still have our name on the god damn thing i canttell you how happy oliver was when that cho girl caught the snitch i thought he was going to jump off the stands and kiss her he was so happy later in the common room you had a dream about me oliver asked reading my diary and i was wearing a kilt we were all in the common room sitting on the couch and chairs in front of the fire attempting to do our homework i swiped you out of his hands if you dontlike my bizarre dreams dontread it it was simple enough for him to understand or so i thought i started doing my potions or rather tried doing my potions again and you were running around in a gown and tiara he was reading you again oliver i snatched you out of his hands again and hit him over the head with you before stuffing you back in my bag sorry oliver rubbed his head you didnthave to hit me you didnthave to read my notebook you mean your diary no i mean my notebook to write down all my teenage thoughts i explained rolling my eyes at what my mom had said 3 months ago eventually alicia finished and went to the library to find a book oddly enough george went with her george read something he doesnthave to please and angelina and fred went to go play chess leaving me and oliver on the couch i know what they re up to oliver isntmy boyfriend they can leave us alone all they want nothing is ever going to happen so what else happened in that dream of yours he asked pretending to help me with potions i guess he caught on to what everyone else was doing too didntyou read about it already pretending to write something down yeah but how do i know that it because i say so and i an honest person your point i sighed and really wrote something down i still have to finish that stupid homework now that i think about it so am i in any other dreams of yours he asked after a while sure why not this was getting annoying so i in all of your fantasies of course oliver what ever inflates your ego oliver laughed lightly and dropped the subject so what if in another dream he was chasing after me like a madman playing the bagpipes it meant absolutely nothing right hell like i would believe anything else november 28 friday 2 so what is everyone doing for christmas alicia asked gosh lic i said it not even december yet oh and lic is pronounced like lease i know but that the only other word i could relate it too oh that reminds me fred said mum says you re all invited to spend christmas with us his twin finished and of course we all accepted like i would turn down a week and a half of mrs weasley cooking i mean my mom and dad are great cooks but mrs weasley could ve opened up a restaurant if she wanted we were outside in one of the courtyards brilliant fred said
