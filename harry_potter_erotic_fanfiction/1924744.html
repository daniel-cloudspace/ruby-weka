 disclaimer i do not own or claim to own any of j k rowling characters places ect i am merely a fan writing fiction fanfiction chapter 1 no news is good news harry lay on his bed at the dursleys and stared sullenly at the ceiling he glanced at his clock to find that it was 6am he heard a tapping on the window and looked it was pigwidgeon ron owl sirius gave him that owl he thought with a pang he let pig in and briefly felt like stuffing the owl in the trunk in the back of his closet along with everything else that reminded him of sirius pig was blissfully oblivious to harry inner battle and flew around his head at annoying speed harry yanked him out of the air and pulled the letter off his leg then he practically stuffed the owl in to hedwig water bowl pig looked at harry particularly reproachfully before taking a drink and zipping out the window harry looked down at ron untidy scrawl and wondered if he even wanted to open the letter so far they had all been filled with things like i know how you feel harry but it not your fault it wasnthis fault they said but sirius was dead he had come to save harry and died harry pummeled his fist into the bed fighting back the familiar feeling of tears threatening to spill finally more out of curiosity than anything else he opened the letter harry how are you mate you haventwritten back for the last two weeks except to lupin and the rest to tell them you re all right we want to know what going on with you hey guess what the adults all have something they re guarding and it not you harry was half indignant half curious on one hand they should be guarding him because what was that reason again oh yeah lord voldemort was after him but on the other hand this new thing they re guarding had to be pretty interesting he wondered if it was another weapon snape goes ballistic when he not allowed to guard it you see they re supposed to take shifts one person for the day and another for the night they apparate to wherever they re going last time snape went he was gone for two days now we know that weird but guess what weirder tonks accidentally gave out that it alive or at least that it moves you see snape and moody were arguing about who got to go and tonks burst in and said well one of you had better go because it been fifteen minutes and who knows where she looked at us it is now so then snape told moody to go wash his eyeball and disapparated it really weird harry thought about this for a while snape desperately wanted to guard something that kind of made sense but not if this something was alive since when had snape wanted to be around other living creatures he glanced back down at the letter oh yeah lupin is coming to get you the 1st of july at 3 i was supposed to tell you in your last letter but i forgot we ve all been pestering dumbledore to let you come down here and he finally agreed i bet with all of us together we can find out what that thing they re guarding really is even fred and george dontknow and every time somebody mentions the words guard or duty they completely explode saying they should have a chance to guard whatever it is anyway mate please write back this time ron with no intention of writing back harry carefully stored the letter in a drawer of his desk and looked eagerly at his calendar suddenly he jumped up not caring if he woke the dursleys or not today was july 1st he sank onto his bed suddenly overcome with relief he wouldnthave to stay in this prison much longer only eight more hours he decided to try and keep busy but found it to be harder than he thought he was packed in half an hour and had successfully made eaten and cleaned up his breakfast in another hour six and a half more hours he chanted to himself as he finished washing his dishes he turned around to see uncle vernon and aunt petunia giving him suspicious stares what are you doing his uncle demanded harry had half a mind to reply with what does it look like i doing you stupid rhinoceros but decided against it washing my breakfast dishes he replied oh and later today a werewolf is coming to pick me up around three so i wontbe back for the summer he smiled sunnily at them as if he had just announced he was having a tea party with the king and queen and then ran upstairs nearly bursting with laughter the look on their faces had been priceless ah the magic words at a quarter til he was downstairs pacing around the whole house he paced the entire downstairs and then went upstairs and paced that too he had no idea if lupin was going to apparate use floo powder or if there was some other magical means of traveling which he had never heard of what are you doing boy his uncle growled as he paced the living room where he aunt petunia and dudley were all huddled i dontknow how he going to get here harry replied absentmindedly as he left the room he suddenly heard a large crack behind him followed by a shrill scream although which member of the family it came from he couldnttell he ran back into the living room to see lupin standing in the middle of it uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley scurried to a corner furthest away from lupin ah harry lupin said brightly not acknowledging his other family all packed yes harry replied my stuff is just upstairs the smile was wiped from harry face as he trudged upstairs followed by lupin lupin reminded him of sirius he felt a familiar lump rising in his throat as he walked into his room however something hit him lupin was the last of the marauders he had lost his best friend in the world when harry had died two of his best friends had died and his other had betrayed them all lupin understood harry turned to lupin to find that he was looking at him with an odd gleam in his eye harry found that he couldntstop himself he stepped forwards and threw his arms around lupin at the same time lupin enveloped him in a hug lupin held harry tightly and harry thought that this might be what it was like to be hugged by a father harry couldntstop the tears from coming but when lupin released him he brushed them away embarrassedly lupin did the same it not your fault harry he said simply suddenly harry believed him harry felt a bit childish for running into lupin arms like that but it had taken a huge burden off his shoulders to do so he finally felt that it wasnthis fault harry and lupin surveyed each other for a second until lupin spoke harry lupin said i not your father and i not sirius harry cut him off i dontcare he replied you re enough more than enough lupin looked genuinely touched and seemed to be refraining from enveloping harry in another hug harry wished he wouldntrestrain himself so much although he felt childish he still rather liked the feeling so ah how are we going to get there harry asked awkwardly breaking the silence we re just going to apparate lupin replied if we hang on to all the stuff we want to bring with us it should come with us oh harry said lupin was looking at him with that odd gleam in his eye again but harry tried not to get too hopeful harry lupin said may i yeah harry replied lupin hugged him again and this time it was briefer but tighter than mrs weasley s harry found that he didntmind when lupin released him he smiled down at harry and harry smiled back at him well got all your stuff hanging on tight want me to hold that cage for you want to go say goodbye to your family didntthink so yell down at them anyway lupin directed reluctantly harry yelled a bye down at the dursleys and after waiting about a minute with no response he shrugged at lupin right lupin said looking annoyed at the dursleys let go he put a firm hand on harry shoulder and they disappeared with a pop they reappeared in a hallway of the black house harry temporarily thought he was going to be sick everything cried out sirius name lupin squeezed his hand on harry shoulder i know harry he said looking as if he himself were about to be sick everyone in the living room you can come in when you re ready and until then you have the house to yourself harry smiled thankfully at lupin he couldntsay anything but he knew lupin understood lupin smiled down at him ruffled his hair and walked off towards the living room harry dragged his things up to his room and set them at the foot of his bed on his bed lay chocolate frogs bertie bott every flavor beans sugar quills and various other candies some which bore the label of fred and george new joke shop he turned and walked out of the room not really knowing where he was going until he got there sirius room he turned the knob and entered the bed had been made and it looked as if most of his things had been put away but other than that sirius mark was everywhere pictures of harry lay on the nightstand the dresser and in various corners of the room harry picture selves were looking worried and sad but when he walked in they put up a good show of waving and smiling also lay pictures of his father and his mother and of the marauders of course peter had been blasted out of these suddenly harry noticed that one of his pictures was trying to get his attention his picture self was flying around on his broomstick and waving his arms harry walked over and his picture pointed excitedly behind itself he peered behind it but saw nothing his picture self shook his head and pointed behind again harry reluctantly took it out of its frame and turned it over there was a note on the back sirius yes i have finally gotten you a picture of your godson do you see what an excellent flyer he is just like james in many many ways now you have no excuse to threaten me at wandpoint every time we meet to get a picture of harry for you i assure you i will get more i wouldntrisk your anger by not doing so now please stop sending me owls every five minutes threatening to hex me if i dontget you a picture sincerely albus dumbledore harry grinned he could imagine sirius threatening dumbledore to get pictures of him for the first time in weeks the thought of sirius didntmake harry feel like breaking down into a wreck instead he felt oddly empowered by the fact that sirius had loved him so much lestrange will pay he told himself the thought of sirius killer sent an electric wave of hatred through harry he wanted to kill her himself but he wouldntcare who killed her as long as she died a painful death he put his picture back in the frame and thanked his picture self before exiting when he walked into the hallway he nearly had a heart attack right in front of him was snape snape looked just as surprised to see him and if harry didntknow any better he would have sworn that snape jumped potter he snarled as if he had been waiting for an opportunity to corner harry but suddenly he looked thoughtful good afternoon he said slowly i sorry to have gotten in your way he looked as if every decent word he spoke towards harry was causing him pain he turned and headed down the stairs in the direction of the living room harry stared after him in shock he sat on the top step of the stairs listening to the chatter going on in the living room behind the partially closed door he couldntcatch any particular conversation but he heard laughing and happiness how can they be happy when sirius is dead he asked himself he felt anger rising up in him and nearly burst in there to start screaming at them but stopped himself when he caught sight of lupin through the door lupin was standing with a forced smile on his face harry couldntsee who he was talking to but he knew that lupin felt the same way as him and he felt himself relax once more lupin suddenly turned as if he sensed harry eyes on him and smiled at harry harry smiled back and suddenly felt ready to leave his stair step he walked down the stairs and pushed open the door to the living room every mouth stopped moving every eye fixed on him just as suddenly cries of harry back and he here filled the room as nearly every person in the room ran forward to give him a hug the first person to reach him was hermione and his vision was temporarily impaired by her hair but she was soon pushed out of the way by the others he lost track of who was hugging him at what time finally everyone backed away looking at him with concern the room was completely silent he knew everyone was wondering if he was going to break into tears over sirius or begin yelling at all of them for no apparent reason he realized for the first time that dumbledore was in the room as he looked into his sparkling blue eyes he didntfeel as mad at dumbledore as he had over the summer although he was still debating just how much dumbledore fault it was that sirius had died he decided that for now he was okay with him hi he said to everyone grinning a bit sheepishly the room filled with cheers as everyone shouted their hellos back at him ron hermione ginny fred and george surrounded him and began to tell him of what had happened while he was gone fred and george even filled him in on what they were planning for their joke shop various adults including tonks moody mr weasley and dumbledore himself came to become filled in on harry happenings finally mrs weasley made her voice heard above the chatter children she said time for bed at their protesting looks she rambled on harry had a long day and so have you you all need to get to bed now fred and george that includes you as they went up the stairs fred grumbled they just want to talk about who having tonight guard duty while we re not there definitely george agreed but let see if some extendable ears wontdo the trick grinning everybody followed fred and george and grabbed some extendable ears soon they were listening to dumbledore call everyone to order may i have your attention please dumbledore requested immediately there was complete silence now is there anybody who is particularly interested in tonight duty after a second he said now severus i really dontthink you ve gotten enough sleep yet to everyone surprise snape argued i have headmaster he protested i feel fully rested a pepper up potion wontfool me severus dumbledore replied snape made no answer arthur i believe you could do it you took a rather long nap this afternoon didntyou yes sir mr weasley replied very well then arthur you may go as soon as kingsley returns at that moment there was a loud crack ah kingsley welcome back dumbledore said how did it go very well kingsley deep voice boomed respectfully good good dumbledore replied arthur we shall see you in the morning he was answered by a small pop as mr weasley disapparated lupin voice was the next to be heard i believe i going to retire a bit early tonight he informed the other adults very well dumbledore replied we shall see you in the morning severus you would do well to accompany him you guys had better go fred and george said suddenly quickly everyone reeled in their extendable ears and ran to their respectful rooms nobody wanted to be caught eavesdropping by snape so what do you reckon harry ron asked as they slid into bed what are they guarding that snape of all people wants to be around so bad i dontknow but it cantbe alive harry replied i mean snape hates humans ron snorted that for sure he agreed actually harry said he was almost decent to me today he related to ron what snape had said to him in the hall yeah ron said thoughtfully i suppose he has been pretty decent to everyone lately dumbledore probably told him he would never get guard duty again unless he was nice to people at this they both began to laugh suddenly the doorknob turned they quickly shut up lupin poked his head in harry dumbledore wanted me to remind you to practice your occlumency tonight he said and he wanted me to remind both of you to get a good night sleep he added eyes twinkling as he looked at their guilty faces that werentcompletely wiped of smiles they both nodded as lupin shut the door harry realized how tired he really was g night he mumbled sleepily he was answered by a huge snore from ron he weakly tried to clear his mind and wasntquite sure if he had succeeded when he fell asleep disclaimer i do not own or claim to own any of j k rowling characters places items and so on chapter 10 trust new responsibilities harry gazed at silver from across the table as the foursome ate lunch she was talking to ron about something tossing her hair back and laughing her eyes dancing he felt a bit jealous that he wasntthe one sitting next to her making her laugh harry hermione exclaimed sounding annoyed huh he answered blankly turning to look at her hermione looked from him to silver and back to him again for heaven sake will you try and concentrate on what i trying to tell you for one minute she not going anywhere you know silver glanced over having heard hermione comment and she smiled and winked at harry he grinned at her but quickly returned his attention to a very exasperated hermione i listening he assured her looking into her eyes to prove that he was finally she muttered shaking her head so anyway harry didnthear a word she said because at that moment neville came running into the great hall from what it looked like he kept saying i late i late he continued to push past people at a dead run just as silver stood up from her seat saying i ll be right back she turned and gave a small shriek as neville nearly collided with her to prevent that from happening however neville grabbed dean neck and slid spectacularly past silver as dean choked and fell backwards onto the floor s sorry neville apologized profusely to both silver and dean dean was clutching his neck as he lay on the floor moaning and neville was sitting up and wincing silver still looked a bit shocked at the whole event soon the whole gryffindor table was doubled over with laughter and the other tables were looking to see what had happened my neck dean mourned rubbing it and glaring at neville sorry i really sorry neville repeated gazing fearfully up at silver it alright neville she assured him helping him up and then dean just dontgo running around like that again dean seemed to have instantly healed when he took her hand for her to help him up and neville started stuttering worse than ever as well as blushing profusely silver looked down at ron looking confused now what was i going to go do she asked him ron shrugged i dunno you may as well just stay here he replied frowning silver sat back down the bell rang and they headed for defense against the dark arts on tuesday class had been a disaster because tonks had tripped over seamus bag as she walked down the aisles and set off his box of fred george spectacular but hard to get rid of fireworks therefore other than her introductory speech which she seemed to have worked very hard on the class was spent getting rid of them they entered her classroom with smiles and sat down in the front she gave them a thankful smile once everyone had sat down tonks began although she looked a bit apprehensive welcome to defense against the dark arts everyone she said beaming i sorry about last class i well it over with now she trailed off and seemed to search very hard for her train of thought before beginning again oh right one of the things we will be concentrating the most on in here is concealment this is the ability to blend in with your surroundings and it can save your life in tough situations yes dean dean was waving his hand in the air wildly are you really a metamorphmagus he asked excitedly well yes she said looking as if this was not where she had wanted the conversation to go can you make your hair pink lavender squealed excitedly um sure tonks agreed as her hair changed from curly and blonde to pink and long ooh parvati exclaimed tonks looked dismayed and harry raised his hand determined to get the class back on track harry she asked timidly how are we going to be studying concealment he asked dontyou have to use disillusionment charms and stuff for that she beamed at him yes exactly in fact we re going to know how to do those by the end of term immediately the class became interested in concealment tonks began by showing them how to change their appearance unfortunately the spell she showed them was one to make their hair color black so it was no use to harry and it didntmake much difference with silver sorry harry she apologized as she fixed ron hair which he had somehow turned green we ll be doing blonde next though great harry murmured although not loud enough for her to hear silver giggled after class they went out by the lake and began throwing a crumpled ball of paper around at each other but ron accidentally threw it a bit too far and it hit professor flitwick on the head as he passed putting an end to the game then they went to the library and finished their homework together getting in trouble numerous times for talking too loud finally it was dinnertime i starved ron complained and according to my divination homework i d better hurry and eat because i wontget a chance tomorrow morning i going to trip and crack my head open on my way to breakfast landing me in st mungo for a year hermione rolled her eyes but silver and harry burst out laughing tomorrow i finding unexpected treasure silver said smugly professor trewalney had taken a liking to silver and often predicted small pleasantries in her future too right you are ron smirked harry someone demanded harry looked behind him to see professor mcgonagall um yeah he asked trying to swallow his food before he talked when you re done with dinner i d like to see you in my office she announced oh he replied she turned and walked away and harry turned back to his friends desperately trying to remember if he had done anything wrong in her class he thought he had transformed his cat into a very acceptable music box although it might have given off a faint meowing sound along with the music i put designs on my box and everything he said disappointedly i wonder what i did wrong i dontknow mate ron said i thought it was great mine still had claws at each corner dontbe silly you two hermione said in a bossy voice that not why harry getting called in there why then ron asked puzzled oh honesty you two silver said isntit obvious no but please fill us in harry replied no i think you should find out for yourself harry hermione replied although she sounded disappointed that he hadntfigured it out harry frowned and finished his dinner in a hurry see you guys in the common room he said heading for professor mcgonagalls office he knocked lightly on the door and she replied with come in potter he obediently went in and sat where directed now harry professor mcgonagall said i daresay you know why you are here harry responded with a blank look oh really now you have no idea she asked disbelievingly not really harry answered feeling embarrassed she sighed but looked vaguely amused harry you are this year quidditch captain she replied i what he asked jumping up yes it all very well professor mcgonagall said i would have told you sooner but i have no time the only days you have to run tryouts are either next wednesday or next friday harry almost yelled out wednesday but figured he would be cutting it close with his occlumency lesson and he certainly didntwant to be tired while trying to fight an invasion on his mind friday he replied reluctantly i have occlumency wednesday very well then harry you will be holding tryouts next friday from four to six she replied scribbling a note down in a worn blue planner can you remember that yep harry replied confidently not knowing how he could possibly forget it okay then off you go she said harry walked out of her classroom and then broke into a run he wondered if hermione and silver had really known why he was going to her office he turned a corner and collided with something very solid he staggered backwards but didntfall and looked up into the eyes of an angry looking professor snape watch where you re going potter he snapped sorry he mumbled how many points should it be from gryffindor snape mused none sir harry supplied because it wont happen again snape looked at him with a mixture of loathing and amusement he looked around as if checking for witnesses very well but mind you keep your eyes open from now on he said yes sir harry replied he walked quickly around the next corner and broke into a run again knowing full well that snape could still hear his footsteps rubies he panted to the portrait the fat lady gave him a once over and apparently decided she didntwant to know as she swung open harry dived through the portrait hole and announced loudly to the whole room i quidditch captain he was overtaken by a sea of cheering people but finally made it to hermione silver and a shocked looking ron you knew hermione he kept saying you knew and you didnttell me hermione just grinned then she turned to silver do you play quidditch she asked yes a bit she replied i thinking of trying out for the team what your position ron asked wait and find out she replied with a smile when are tryouts harry ron asked next friday four to six harry recited aww that way too long come on silver just tell me he begged nope wait and see was her reply hermione giggled good teach him patience she told silver ron complained about not knowing the whole way to bed and a few minutes afterwards harry fell asleep with a smile on his face gold snitches invading his thoughts the next day harry was fully appreciative of the fact that they got friday afternoons off after charms they had the weekend to themselves he and silver walked out of the class and turned to wait for ron and hermione where d they go silver asked peeking in and confirming that they were not there i dunno harry replied looking around for a sign of them maybe they went to the library she suggested at his look she added it the sort of place hermione would drag ron to they searched the library but no ron and hermione they also searched the common room the quidditch field hagrid hut and the great hall but to no avail where could they be silver asked sounding a bit frustrated i dontknow harry replied truthfully they were standing in the great hall very confused oh well silver said i guess they had something important to do i guess harry agreed so what do you want to do now go to the common room i suppose silver replied they walked to the common room together and when they entered it was nearly empty a group of first years sat studying in a corner and harry heard one of them complaining about hover charms they chose a couch by the fire and silver looked intently into the flames as harry looked intently at her she turned to him and smiled what she asked you re beautiful he replied truthfully is that the only reason you like me she inquired i didntsay you were only beautiful on the outside he answered she smiled at him and he leaned closer to her she closed her eyes but at that moment they heard hermione voice echoing through the portrait hole they do too they do not ron answered angrily harry glared at them not really caring what they were arguing about why couldntthey have waited just a few minutes more before barging in like that ron looked angry and his face was red from trying to hold his temper in where were you harry asked not able to bring his voice to a completely civil tone we told you we were going to the kitchens hermione replied did you know that dobby took all of the hats and scarves i made last year she scared the poor thing to death ron exclaimed told him they were for all the elves and when he explained that they didntwant them she went ballistic and started raging up a storm until they kicked us out they want to be free they just dontknow it hermione said they do not ron roared hermione made an impatient noise and then turned on her heel and stomped up the stairs to the girl dormitories ron sat down angrily next to harry and silver why wontshe admit that i right he asked furiously why cantshe just accept it it can be hard for people to accept things they dontwant to hear silver said wisely if i were you i would break it to her a bit more gently ron looked up at her you know she prompted with a bit more compassion consideration love love ron echoed what do you want me to do kiss her first and then tell her it might work silver replied ron looked at her in surprise for a moment before stammering well i was joking totally missed the point kiss her the idea still stammering he walked off in the direction of the boy dorms silver sighed he should just kiss her and be done with it you know harry couldnthelp but agree i think he afraid she still likes krum he answered she still writing to him you know silver snorted she d give him up in a second for ron he really needs to just pluck up some courage and tell her how he feels so hermione fancies ron harry asked surprised well she never stops talking about him silver said and then in a high pitched falsetto ron says i dontthink ron would like that would look nice on ron try telling that to ron harry laughed ron would go nuts he wontadmit it but he fancies her silver smiled and began to gaze into the fire again looking preoccupied what wrong harry asked you ve been like this the whole week like what she asked surprised you ll be talking and then you ll get this look in your eyes and you ll drift off somewhere harry finished lamely i dontknow she said it just all seems too good to be true i dontthink this will all last much longer all what harry asked trying to understand being safe she replied in a small voice i ve never been safe for so long i ve never felt safe for so long nobody going to take you away harry said you dontknow my mother she answered who is your mother harry asked she looked up at him her eyes bright and then back at the fire minutes passed and she didntanswer you dontwant to tell me harry asked harry i can t she said quietly you wouldntunderstand what is there to understand he answered feeling a twinge of anger i just want to know her name no she replied her voice barely above a whisper why not i thought you said you trusted me harry prodded she looked up at him and he knew what he said was a mistake she burst into tears i do trust you harry i do she sobbed he reached out and pulled her to him i know he comforted i never should have said that i sorry she didntstop crying but she clung to him and he knew that he was forgiven he felt a lump rise in his throat he felt like a total jerk he had tested her trust something he never should have done but now he knew she trusted him enough to let him hurt her and still trust him just as much afterwards i do trust you she sobbed i know he said quietly i really sorry you donthave to tell me i shouldnthave asked her sobs quieted after a few minutes harry had a feeling there was a lot more going on than just her concerns about her mother but he didntask because he didntwant to push her any further long minutes passed and she didntpull away harry stroked her hair a bit awkwardly but he had a feeling it was what he was supposed to do finally she sat back gazing up at him with pinkish eyes she was still beautiful you should get to bed he informed her sensing how tired she was thanks harry she said hugging him night he replied night she murmured as she headed up the stairs harry wished she werentso complicated he would have liked to know who her mother was he sank into bed and had to force himself to stay awake for a few minutes until he felt his mind was safely cleared he sank into a dreamless and satisfying sleep disclaimer i do not own or claim to own any of j k rowling characters places items ect although may i compliment myself on my own character silver riddle chapter 11 unhealed scars harry silver ron and hermione had scarfed down their lunch and were in the library finishing the potions essay they had forgotten to do it was the wednesday after quidditch tryouts and ron still had not gotten over silver secret cantbelieve you didnttell us he muttered as he worked silver smiled she had turned out to be the best beater harry had ever seen she had a nimbus two thousand and one but she made it perform almost as well as harry firebolt she had offered to coach the other beater during practice because harry had a feeling that if she succeeded they would have one of the best teams in history ron was keeper again and their three other players chasers were the seventh year alicia spinnet katie bell and angelina johnson who had previously been captain of the team but given up the position due to the workload of the seventh years the bell rang causing the smile to be wiped from each of their faces except silver s come on guys it not so bad she said as they walked towards the dungeons it is too ron replied snape a git is not was silver reply is too is not is too is not ron grumbled is too under his breath but not loud enough so that silver could hear harry and hermione exchanged grins silver still stuck firmly in saying that snape was not a git no matter what evidence ron gave her that he was they walked into potions and took their seats at the back after the first lesson silver had decided that the back was after all a very good place to sit especially since malfoy usually sat in the front as usual harry sat beside her they took out their homework from the previous lesson and set it on top of their desks snape glared his approval although he couldntquite manage to give them a rightful sneer when he looked at silver smiling face they looked at the board and were disappointed to see that snape was not easing up on their workload it was complex potion after complex potion this time it was a multiplying potion although harry had actually gotten an e the last time he turned one in he felt he deserved an o but he figured snape always gave him one grade down about fifteen minutes into the class a small explosion came from crabbe cauldron snape strode over quickly to look at crabbe burnt face five points to slytherin for giving an example of how not to add your lacewings he announced ron snorted and snape instantly turned to glare at him with an if you don t shut up i ll deduct points look silver gave a small but audible hmph which snape chose to ignore crabbe left to go see madam pomfrey and they continued to make their potions suddenly harry potion turned a sickening shade of yellow while it was supposed to be dark red silver looked over and groaned harry she complained sorry he said innocently switch she mumbled i on line six and dontmess it up she and harry switched cauldrons and he very carefully finished her potion he only had to do two more lines one which only involved stirring as she nursed his back to an even shade of red best i can do she apologized now keep it going harry groaned he was only on line two how could she make such a complicated potion so fast suddenly she gasped and clasped her hands to her mouth harry she whispered urgently i just remembered i supposed to do something professor mcgonagall trusted me specially to do it what he asked i had to go and deliver a letter for her at lunch oh harry i have to go now are you crazy please cover for me harry looked into her deep brown eyes and then up at snape he was very engrossed in one of the books harry had checked out of the restricted section for him a week before okay just hurry up he might not even notice he said although he felt queasy thinking of what might happen if he did thank you harry you re the best she exclaimed moving swiftly for the door he watched as she opened the handle with painstaking precision and slid out the door leaving it open the tiniest crack snape didntnotice a thing harry was on the second to last line of his potion and it was growing steadily darker to his delight when suddenly snape voice cut across the room potter harry jumped and accidentally dropped a full container of dragon claw clippings into his potion it returned to its former yellow state yes professor snape he asked politely where is miss riddle harry considered for a moment looking beside him and gasping saying she not here he knew however that he was very bad at acting and so went with his next worst talent lying she thought she was going to be sick and ran to madam pomfrey s he lied when snape looked disbelieving he added she knows how you dontlike people throwing up in your room as innocently as he could snape looked as if he didntknow whether to believe him or not and why didnti hear her leave he asked she didntwant to disrupt the class harry exclaimed as if it were unthinkable he heard ron snigger from beside him but stop with an ouch when hermione punched him in the arm snape raised an eyebrow your potion is yellow potter he informed him is it harry asked with great mock surprise i d better get to work then ten points from gryffindor snape replied without saying why harry looked up as if he were shocked snape would do such a thing dontmake it twenty snape advised and harry dropped the sarcastic attitude suddenly the door opened snape eyes shot toward the door at the same time as harry s where were you miss riddle snape demanded i was just at the bath madam pomfrey s she replied as she saw harry waving his arms and mouthing nurse nurse behind snape snape turned to look at harry who had his hands raised in the air harry immediately turned it into an indignant gesture see he asked throwing his hands into the air with more exaggeration nobody believes me he gave his arms one final toss above his head and returned them to his side knowing that snape was about to deduct a hundred points from gryffindor he heard stifled laughs coming from his classmates ron looked as if his ribs were about to break he dared to meet snape eye and saw amusement there along with the usual loathing ten more points from gryffindor and detention for you and miss riddle after class he replied and you re running out of time i really suggest you get to work on that potion ten more silver groaned as she took her place beside harry sorry harry replied i a bad liar what did you do to your potion she hissed i dropped a plastic container of dragon claw clippings in it he replied helpfully standing aside as she began tending to it harry she groaned for all we know this could be poisonous i do have a flair you know he told her i positive everybody in this room could try and not get it that fluorescent after a few minutes his potion was a bright red which was more than he had expected silver insisted on being allowed to keep working with it though and soon had it a very admirable shade that was close to the perfected color just hope he doesnttest it she told him as she bottled her own sample and donttouch it when you bottle it comforting harry said pleasantly and what if he asks me to drink it leave me your firebolt she replied he laughed causing snape to look up and sneer at him harry was surprised he didnttake fifty points from gryffindor on the spot he certainly looked as if he wanted to he and silver went up with their samples silver went first as harry always allowed her to do and snape tested hers on his pencil as soon as a drop of the potion touched the pencil another one began to be formed on top of it and after he added just one more drop a perfect replica of his pencil rolled off the top o he told her grudgingly not surprising harry thought silver and hermione were the only ones in the class capable of earning o s snape gave a few out to his prized slytherins but harry knew none of them actually earned them as much as snape wished they did harry stepped forward and offered his potion he saw surprise register on snape face as he observed the nearly perfected color and odor let try it shall we he asked smirking at the look of dread on harry face he poured a few drops onto his pencil and it was as if an explosion occurred snape actually had to stand up and back away from the desk as the pencils multiplied at a rapid speed they were all bright green and in the end harry suspected there were about two hundred of them in all just then the bell rang leave your samples on my snape began before realizing that his pencil laden desk wouldntwork on the front desk he finished giggling students placed their samples on the front desk before leaving harry and silver alone with snape well snape said looking at the pile of pencils just for effect one more suddenly popped up causing the whole pile and snape to jump harry waited for snape to rip him to shreds but snape didntfinish his sentence harry looked up to see him shaking his head how did you manage the green potter he asked finally harry gaped in shock snape didnteven seem mad behind him silver giggled how did you manage the green she asked harry shrugged smiling all right now take a pencil and get to your homework snape growled trying to be menacing harry grinned at him as he took a bright green pencil and walked to an empty seat snape tossed one to silver as she sat down beside him and then he vanished them all with a vanishing charm as usual silver finished in record time harry was shortly behind her and snape looked over both their work correcting them each a couple of times before he was completely satisfied with it harry glanced at the clock it was nowhere near only four they had an hour and fifty minutes to go snape sent them on errands for half an hour and finally harry was left to listen to snape and silver talk silver gave snape a blow by blow account of their day including the near catastrophe with neville clumsy boy snape muttered but not in a particularly mean way after a bit of probing he managed to get silver to tell him where she had really gone during class and didntseem angry at either of them in the least when she told him he glanced over at harry who was watching snape have a normal conversation with disbelief how your occlumency going potter he demanded looking as if he hoped harry had gotten sick again better harry said truthfully the book helped a lot how many times have you blocked dumbledore he asked two harry said which to him was an amazing feat but i ve been coming really close all the other times snape gave him an approving sneer good he commented which was the biggest compliment harry was sure any student had ever received from him i going to have to use occlumency myself tonight snape commented offhandedly for a moment harry didntknow what he meant but silver gasped what you didnttell me you were meeting with voldemort tonight she exclaimed snape jumped and glared at her for saying his name i knew you d overreact and wouldntbe able to concentrate in class he replied harry figured he was right oh so you werentgoing to tell me silver replied indignantly i was going to tell you during potter occlumency lesson snape answered silver looked very upset dontcry snape told her i ll be fine what if you re not she replied in an emotional voice what if tonight is the last time i ever see you she ran up to him and hugged him and he looked half annoyed half pleased women he muttered under his breath as he met harry gaze harry nodded his agreement he couldntbelieve how human snape seemed he didntknow how silver had done it but she somehow turned on a parental mode in snape mind he knew she came to talk with him every monday and wednesday during his occlumency lesson but it had never occurred to him that snape actually talked back to her but now here was snape casually informing them that he had to go lie to voldemort that night but not to worry because he would be back the following morning silver had snuck her way into his lap and he now looked extremely confused harry had a feeling it was the closest snape had ever gotten to anybody in his life dontgo silver said suddenly dontbe foolish was his impatient reply but he ll hurt you she said and if i dontgo he ll kill me snape said harry thought it made sense silver sighed i suppose she agreed finally snape looked preoccupied as he patted her back in what he supposed was a comforting way harry thought it would have been rather nice of him to stroke her hair since she seemed to like it when harry had done so but he didntdare inform snape that he had ever been in such a close proximity with her i need to read my occlumency book snape informed them so you two can go so i cantcome back during harry lesson silver asked sounding disappointed snape looked into her disappointed eyes and harry thought he saw snape firmness crashing down you can come for the last hour he said and a half she bargained the last hour and a half he agreed halfheartedly she beamed at him come on harry she said jumping out of snape lap and talking to him as if he were lagging behind right behind you harry replied as he gathered his things bye he told snape and good luck wontneed it snape answered but harry thought he appreciated it anyway he and silver headed toward gryffindor tower and silver seemed very upset over something wanna talk harry offered yeah she replied let go for a walk they threw their things through the portrait hole and headed outside it was already a bit dusky outside and everything was bathed in a pink orange glow silver sighed as they walked along the edge of the lake he shouldnthave to go to voldemort she said finally he doing it for dumbledore for the order harry reminded her i know but everything changes when he comes back silver answered sounding frustrated what do you mean harry asked he not the same it puts him in a mood she said i feel sorry for the class that has him tomorrow and friday he absolutely terrible he blows up over the littlest things why harry inquired well isntit obvious harry she asked looking over at him as they took a seat underneath a giant oak tree he answered her with a blank stare the only reason he is ever horrible to people is because of the abuse he received as a child silver explained and then he goes and reports to voldemort and when he doesntbring him you and dumbledore head on a platter voldemort hurts him abuses him it makes him bitter all over again you d think he d get a break now that he hasntseen his parents in years but he still being abused his scars have never had a chance to heal harry looked over at silver with a mixture of sympathy and admiration it must hurt her as well when snape was in a horrible mood he realized i sorry he said quietly for me or snape she asked bemusedly both of you he replied she leaned against him and he put his arm around her it just horrible she said quietly horrible horrible harry agreed with her even though snape had previously made his life miserable silver had turned him into a complete human being and no human being deserved to be abused especially by voldemort he stroked her hair and she relaxed into him harry hadntkissed her since his birthday by the fire he wanted to then but on the other hand he didn t he wanted to kiss her when she was thinking of him not snape he settled for drawing her closer and putting his other arm around her that night at eight thirty harry sat in dumbledore office eating ice cream with the headmaster he had successfully deflected dumbledore the last three times in a row out of about twenty but who was counting and dumbledore thought it was an occasion for a treat so harry when are quidditch tryouts dumbledore asked interestedly as if he planned on trying out for the team erm they were last friday harry replied oh well very good then dumbledore said contentedly i daresay you were happy to get on a broomstick once more uh huh harry managed through a large mouthful of ice cream dumbledore gave him a look of pure amusement as he himself took a rather large bite at that moment tonks came in looking a bit flustered oh no she exclaimed as she looked at harry i forgot it was wednesday well dumbledore said as you can see we arentparticularly busy at the moment so you are welcome to stay we can get you a bowl of ice cream if you wish i ve had lots of ice cream already tonks replied brightly sitting down next to harry in front of dumbledore desk understandable dumbledore said agreeably tonks looked at harry for a while harry she said i dontsuppose you ve ever thought about a career as an auror harry smiled actually that what i want to be he informed her she looked absolutely delighted that wonderful you are absolutely one of my best students she replied causing harry to blush if harry had to give tonks classes a rating he would rate them much higher than professor umbridge the previous year but a bit lower than lupin or moody s concealment wasntnearly as exciting as battling a boggart or grindylow but it was still interesting it was an easy o for harry dumbledore tonks said suddenly as if she had just remembered what she came in for are we having an order meeting next weekend no dumbledore replied that is the weekend afterwards severus remus and myself will be absent from it remus tonks echoed yes the weekend after next is a hogsmeade weekend and he will be visiting harry oh tonks replied well that all i wanted to know really really harry asked a bit too excitedly lupin coming dumbledore smiled kindly at harry he wouldntmiss it for a full moon he assured harry harry grinned at dumbledore almost funny sense of humor tonks suddenly jumped out of her chair causing numerous objects on dumbledore desk to fall as she banged it with her knee ouch she exclaimed nearly slapping harry as her hand flew to her newly injured knee she then proceeded to trip over the chair knock over dumbledore lamp and ouch herself out of the room dumbledore chuckled i believe she could do with some dancing lessons he commented harry wondered what it would be like to dance with tonks he imagined it would be very painful when silver came to get him harry told her very proudly how he had deflected dumbledore three times and she kissed him on the cheek right in front of an amused dumbledore he had left the room blushing and grinning a bit stupidly nearly running into the door as he waved goodbye to dumbledore that night he fell asleep itching to get onto the quidditch field the next day he was so anxious that he didntclear his mind before falling asleep and his already weakened mind jumped at the opportunity to torture him for his decision at first he was walking down the hall to snape classroom ron and hermione were beside him but when they reached the door silver was weeping outside of it harry poked his head in to see what was wrong and was sucked inside of a cold dark room in front of him snape was bowing at the foot of a throne my lord he said i am close very close to luring dumbledore away from the castle and the boy voldemort demanded i have tried to get close to him my lord but it is hard he has withdrawn after the death of that old fool black i want the boy voldemort said impatiently and i want to present him to you my lord snape replied but i need time time for him to begin trusting me with his grief human emotions are yes i know voldemort cut off a very complex system very well i will give you more time yet again but you have not forgotten what happens to those who fail me no my lord there was desperation in snape voice let me remind you voldemort whispered snape didntplead or beg with voldemort instead he bowed his head quietly accepting his undeserved punishment crucio voldemort cried raising his wand snape body contorted and his face was etched with pain but he did not cry out being strong are we snape voldemort asked his voice full of cruel amusement donteven try crucio snape gasped in pain but didntsay a word voldemort continued to point his wand at him determination in those cruel lifeless red eyes scream snape scream he urged you know you want to do not resist scream snape gasped again and let out a stifled yelp remember snape voldemort cried his voice full of intense hatred remember your father your father made you scream remember suddenly a scene appeared on the wall of the cave a tall man pushed a skinny greasy haired teenager into a corner and kicked him three times in succession each time the boy screamed in pain a nasty cracking noise could be heard snape let out a yell that was not quite a scream but very close to it voldemort relinquished his hold on snape pain and snape although it must have hurt him with every movement he made put himself back into a bowing position you are loyal snape voldemort said approvingly let that never waver you may go you are good master snape breathed snape turned and harry caught sight of his eyes they were filled with pain resentment and hatred harry scar seared with pain as he caught sight of them and he awoke immediately this time he hadntwoken ron gasping for breath as if it were he who had just been punished he knew that he had just seen snape meeting with voldemort he suddenly understood why snape was bitter disclaimer none of this stuff belongs to me with the exception of silver riddle chapter 12 apologies harry by the goalpost silver said exasperatedly as she batted a bludger away from him huh he asked blankly the snitch she exclaimed oh goalpost he repeated as he realized what she was saying he had been watching her swerve around players batting the bludgers away and complimenting the other players as she did so better not lose concentration like that during a game harry thought as he sped toward the goalpost for the elusive snitch his firebolt readily put on speed for him and although it was just practice harry felt a competitive urge driving him to fly at top speed the snitch veered over the top of his broomstick to the left and harry after it he reached out his hand and caught it by one wing got it he announced two bludgers came racing toward him and silver appeared out of nowhere she hit them both with the handle of her broomstick and sent them speeding toward the ground nice move he complimented her same to you she replied easily the team landed and headed for the locker rooms did you see me block that shot alicia sent my way ron asked excitedly uh no harry answered oh that right you were gaping at silver ron teased harry glared at him but it turned into a smile when he realized ron was right when he arrived back outside silver and hermione who had been watching their practice were already headed off towards the castle hey ron yelled after them thanks for waiting your welcome hermione replied sarcastically over her shoulder grumbling ron and harry jogged to catch up to them the foursome walked through the halls discussing the upcoming gryffindor ravenclaw match when snape appeared in front of them twenty points from gryffindor he snapped as he brushed by without even looking at them see ron hissed after snape was out of earshot he is a git harry glared at ron he had told them about his dream and he expected ron to be a bit more sensitive toward snape especially considering the fact that silver was staring after him with a very hurt expression on her face ron immediately looked abashed he still in a bad mood silver said in disbelief well he had a pretty trying meeting with voldemort harry replied comfortingly i sure he ll be fine in class tomorrow silver didntlook too sure and harry had to admit that he wasntso sure either snape had visited voldemort on wednesday and it was now sunday afternoon and he was still as angry and irritable as he had been on thursday harry put a hand on her shoulder and steered her toward the gryffindor common room ron and hermione were silent and harry knew ron was silently beating himself up for his comment silver looked frustrated and upset as they climbed through the portrait hole he didnteven say hi to me she said biting her lip he ll warm up harry reassured her she didntlook convinced and harry desperately hoped that snape would miraculously be in a good mood the next day for the rest of the day silver moped although occasionally she would laugh at something particularly funny but harry saw the brooding in her eyes as she walked up the stairs to bed he sighed as he and ron headed for their own beds snape needs to lighten up okay so he just had a meeting with voldemort but he must realize that when he brushes her off like that it hurts her ron shrugged hopefully he ll realize it by tomorrow mate he replied unhelpfully harry tried to clear his mind but was still a bit frustrated as he fell asleep for once his mind didntjump at the chance to torture him and he slept fitfully the next morning silver seemed in a slightly better mood throughout all their morning classes but at lunch harry knew she was thinking of snape just relax he told her as she picked at her food she nodded and forced a smile onto her face harry and ron did their best comedic act to cheer her up but it only served to get a slight chuckle out of her before she dropped back down into despair for some reason hermione was looking at them disapprovingly so they followed her lead and were quiet for the rest of lunch when the bell rang they proceeded to the dungeons in silence another complex potion was on the board much to harry disappointment this potion was particularly hot and harry found himself backing up often to wipe his face of sweat before continuing soon the dungeon began to heat up uncomfortably which only seemed to make snape more irritable ron who didntfare well in the heat kept dropping things which would make everybody jump when he accidentally knocked his stool over as he was backing away to wipe sweat off his face snape lost it twenty points from gryffindor and the next person to drop something from the blasted house loses them fifty points as he said it there was a particularly nasty glint in his eye that he didntmanage to wipe before he looked at silver harry glanced at silver who was biting her lip determinedly and looking close to tears he could tell that snape harshness was affecting her concentration as well as the heat she was very flushed and seemed to be breathing hard as she slaved over her potion are you okay he asked her concernedly you look sick i fine she replied stubbornly he noticed however that she was working progressively slower and her grip seemed to be failing her at times please dontlet her drop something he prayed silently she ll have a heart attack if she loses gryffindor fifty points almost as if on cue a porcelain cup filled with crushed cockroaches slipped from her fingers and crashed to the floor snape looked up menacingly fifty he began but suddenly silver collapsed into a heap on the floor abandoning all dignity snape rushed to her side as harry picked her up what he hissed at harry happened i think she sensitive to the heat harry answered dumbly snape gave him a withering look and disappeared into his private storage room whispers broke out around the classroom harry sat down on the floor and leaned her against him snape returned holding a vial of liquid that was either a dark shade of green or black he gently eased it into her mouth and trickled it down her throat her eyes fluttered open momentarily she sat up away from harry looking a bit dazed are you okay snape asked her trying to mask his concern her eyes landed on the smashed cup she began to cry i lost fifty p points she sobbed snape rolled his eyes you haventlost any points child he said impatiently b but i d dropped it she protested pointing to the shards of porcelain you haventlost any points he repeated she continued to sob sighing snape grasped her arm and helped her to her feet he led her to the door and before he exited he turned back around and stated fiercely when i get back each of your potions had better be perfected he then proceeded to exit the chamber and close the door behind him surprisingly everyone began to work on their potions once more nobody dared to disobey snape harry was amazed at the fact that his potion was coming along nicely it was nearly as good at hermione s and he thought that if he kept it up he might be able to convince snape to give him an o for once the door opened and snape came in followed by a much happier looking silver the moment she came in she returned to work on her potion although harry noticed that she stopped at times and went to stand in the coolness of the back of the classroom she didntsay a word but she looked much more content when the bell rang she completely ignored it the bell rang harry informed her i know she replied snape said i could stay afterwards to finish my potion he said you could stay with me if you want alright harry agreed i ll turn in my potion and wait for you she nodded and continued to tend to her potion harry confidently took his potion up to snape desk snape sneered at it for a few moments before announcing well done but it not quite dark enough you ve earned an e harry knew that his handsomely colored purple potion was o material but didntsay anything instead he turned a bit dejectedly back to his desk now that the room was not full of broiling cauldrons it was cooling down nicely done silver announced proudly harry looked at hers and was disappointed to find that it was a tad darker than his so snape had an excuse for giving her an o sure enough that was her grade when she took it up to his desk be back at six she reminded snape as she turned to leave looking forward to it snape replied although he didntsound all too eager harry decided that it was hard for snape to express his true emotions because he was sure that what snape said had been sincere as they worked on their homework silver was particularly cheerful did you and snivelly make up ron asked raising an eyebrow as she happily pulled out her quill for a history of magic essay dontcall him that she replied as she began to write did he apologize ron probed she looked up for what being a git ron said truthfully she sighed yes she relented but it not as if he didnthave a reason i know ron answered sincerely soon they were done with their homework and all doing something of their own harry was reading the occlumency book snape had given him silver was writing a letter hermione was stubbornly knitting new clothes for the house elves and ron was tutting at her insistently will you stop it ron she asked impatiently well i ron began but he cut himself off as he got a glimpse of silver reproving face you what hermione asked dangerously harry glanced up to join silver in observing them nothing ron mumbled sorry i accept your apology hermione replied in a dignified voice suddenly without warning ron reached over pulled hermione toward him and kissed her then blushing furiously he told her the house elves dontwanna be freed and walked off to the boys dorms hermione looked dumbstruck well i well was all she said before getting up and going up to the girl dorms blushing almost as much as ron silver burst into giggles harry couldnthelp but laugh with her that what happens when you give people advice he teased i didntknow he would take me literally that was kinda cute did you see the looks on their faces she replied her eyes sparkled as she looked into his he sat up and pulled her closer as was commonplace by then they were interrupted harry was furious he looked at ron and hermione who had exited their dorms at the same time and glared come on harry silver said pulling on his arm i dontwant to go anywhere he replied they need to talk she hissed reluctantly he allowed himself to be pulled off the couch and led out of the common room it was five forty five they headed towards dumbledore office and harry was still mad that their kiss had been interrupted it always happened without fail they reached the gargoyle and harry glared at it and when he fixed his gaze on silver she was smiling what he snapped nothing she said innocently putting her arms around his neck and smiling mischievously grinning he slid his arms around her and pulled her closer to him amazingly there were no interruptions their lips met and harry felt his stomach do cartwheels as fireworks exploded in his mind she tightened her arms around him and he was about to do the same but suddenly something hit him on the side of the head knocking him away from her ouch he exclaimed grabbing his head and ready to curse whatever had interrupted his resolve to curse failed however when he found himself looking into snape flashing eyes silver seemed at a loss for words get up to your occlumency before i rip you apart potter he threatened why would you rip me apart harry challenged because you were you were snape looked as if he could not find words terrible enough for what harry had just done as he gestured to silver kissing her harry finished yes snape hissed looking angrier than harry had ever seen him so what he challenged why is it any of your business well she didntwant to kiss you snape yelled she did too ask her harry told him snape turned to silver triumphantly harry realized that snape actually thought he had forced silver to kiss him actually i did she told snape meekly snape looked from her to harry and back at her are you telling me you went along with him he asked yes she replied snape looked as if his eyeballs were going to pop out he looked at harry suspiciously what do you think i forced her to put her arms around my neck harry challenged snape didntreply he just looked at the two of them again and then turned and stormed off toward the dungeons silver was smiling what so funny about that harry inquired rubbing the side of his head he going to kill me silver sighed he just a bit protective is all and he wont be so mad after i talk to him did he punch me harry asked in amazement i think so she replied walking up she took her head in her hands and gently rubbed over the spot where snape had hit him does it hurt she asked concernedly depends harry replied his eyes flashing with mischief will you kiss it and make it better if it does she smiled i think i might she replied well he got me right here harry said pointing to his lips she giggled and stepped closer to him but suddenly the gargoyle sprang open harry dumbledore said delightedly just the man i was looking for harry did his best not to glare at the headmaster but he couldnthelp it dumbledore smiled brightly at him in response silver giggled again see you later harry she said as she headed off toward the dungeons harry sighed and followed dumbledore up to his office once there he proceeded to rant to dumbledore about what had just happened dumbledore chuckled when he finished well well severus is recuperating quite nicely i see he said oh yeah harry said i had another dream i think i saw snape meeting with voldemort he told dumbledore all about his dream and this time included the fact that he hadntcleared his mind before he went to sleep are you sure harry dumbledore asked are you absolutely positive that it was actually what happened yes harry said miserably i mean what else could ve happened to put snape in such a bad mood mind you this is snape we re talking about so he in a bad mood to begin with dumbledore looked on the verge of smiling but only his eyes gave away his amusement professor snape harry he reminded him yeah yeah harry muttered still angry with snape for the blow he had given him it only took harry ten tries to block dumbledore and he successfully did that five times before dumbledore let him have a rest very nice harry dumbledore complimented i think soon we will be able to start without the use of the pensieve harry sighed do we have to add that memory he asked yes harry i afraid voldemort might not be so courteous as to let you use a pensieve before he invades your mind dumbledore reminded him alright harry grumbled they practiced again and harry was elated that he blocked dumbledore successfully on his seventh try as was dumbledore well he exclaimed we re out of the two digit numbers that something harry couldnthelp but laugh at nine o clock while harry and dumbledore were discussing harry current victory of success on the fifth try silver entered dragging snape behind her harry eyed the professor suspiciously hi harry professor dumbledore she beamed they said hello back and she continued professor snape just has something he d like to say to harry harry looked into snape eyes and snape glared back at him sorry he mumbled ah no problem harry said snape quickly changed the subject headmaster i ve come to discuss something with you very well severus i have until breakfast tomorrow morning dumbledore said cheerfully snape looked at dumbledore in disbelief before sitting down in one of the fluffy armchairs in front of dumbledore desk well off you go snape ordered harry and silver he smirked as harry tripped while turning around but refrained from making fun of him see silver asked harry delightedly as they headed for the gryffindor common room he not that bad yeah he totally wanted to apologize harry said sarcastically well the point is that he did silver answered not letting his sarcasm get the better of her good mood i suppose harry agreed but i bet you anything he gives us a really hard potion wednesday silver laughed and harry was content disclaimer i do not own or claim to own any of j k rowling people places items ect ect ect reviewers wow you guys are so awesome your compliments make me happy and your criticism helps me a lot as you can see i am by no means j k rowling oh and i am absolutely delighted everyone is so interested in silver parents making them up was the hardest thing about creating her and i glad to know my hard work paid off oh yes and as far as apparating goes i thought it would be nice if the adults could apparate the underage wizards by holding on to them while they themselves apparated sorry if this bothers anybody and sorry i haventupdated in a while well a day but my weekends are very busy whereas my weekdays leave me free to add stories chapter 13 hogsmeade the weeks at hogwarts flew by smoothly for harry gryffindor won its first quidditch game against ravenclaw but the really anticipated match between gryffindor and slytherin would occur only after christmas and after they played hufflepuff snape was almost civil to harry most of the time but he still hadntgotten his o in potions which he fully intended to earn by the end of the year he was sure that he had produced o material several times but snape never gave him that particular satisfaction he hadntbroken his record in occlumency with dumbledore which was five tries so he was saved from being plagued by sirius memory every monday and wednesday whenever he felt the least bit down silver was next to him cheering him up by hugging him or occasionally kissing him on the cheek finally it was the friday before the hogsmeade weekend harry was bursting with excitement he wanted badly to see lupin again to tell him everything that had happened harry sprang up the hallway to the gryffindor common room after clarifying what days quidditch practice officially was with professor mcgonagall he entered the common room to find silver staring at a bright red ron with an amused look on her face what up he asked plopping down between the two i asked hermione to go to hogsmeade with me ron said in amazement dontyou always go together harry asked no stupid on a date ron replied annoyed oh harry said exchanging a mischievous glance with silver what will i wear ron asked clothes harry replied firmly he turned to silver you going to come with me and lupin he asked fully expecting her to say yes of course not she exclaimed causing him to do a double take why not he asked because you two need to talk she answered firmly well it not like you give us a speech impediment he said alone she finished he sighed what are you going to do then she going to come with us ron replied isntshe absolutely not why would i come with you on your date she demanded well where are you going to go then harry asked i not sure yet she replied harry sighed you ve got to come with one of us he told her i do not she answered sounding shocked he would suggest such a thing well what then you re just going to go wandering around alone yes you do realize there is a rather large group of death eaters after you yes you re crazy she sighed and began to move away but harry reached out and held her wrist and she lingered come on lupin and i wouldntmind your company at all he coaxed harry she said exasperatedly you two need to talk alone well we can be alone with you harry answered he saw annoyance in her eyes no harry just drop it she warned he fixed her with a pleading look but i wanna be with you in hogsmeade he fake pouted fine she said but you and lupin are spending at least half the day together alone i think that an oxymoron harry informed her together alone you know what i mean she replied eyes beginning to flash dangerously he could see that she was still annoyed but he thought it was cute okay let say we meet you in the three broomsticks around noon he suggested one thirty she replied stubbornly one thirty he relented what are you going to do the whole morning i dontknow she sighed maybe i ll hang out with ginny and her friends wontginny be with dean he asked confused harry they broke up ages ago she replied as if this were common knowledge oh he said he could tell by looking at ron that ron hadntknown either well i suppose that will be okay he relented i didntneed your permission she informed him haughtily course you didn t he replied purposely getting on her nerves she made an impatient noise not unlike the one hermione often made and headed out of gryffindor tower isntshe cute he asked ron adorable ron replied sarcastically harry threw a pillow at him the next morning harry awoke with an excited feeling in the pit of his stomach it was early but he got dressed anyway and went out into the empty common room he sat on the couch impatiently and twisted around when he heard a door open silver was grinning at him from the top of the stairs she was wearing a light blue tank top and black pants and her hair poured over her shoulders and down her back in large ringlets harry remembered how excited she had been to visit diagon alley and realized that this must be a big event for her i had a feeling you d be getting up early this morning she told him he grinned i excited he admitted good she replied coming and sitting down beside him so are you going to hang out with ginny today he asked um yeah she replied looking in the opposite direction harry studied her closely he knew she would never tell him a direct lie but there was something she wasnttelling him really he asked really she replied turning to look at him he studied her eyes intently trying to make out her emotions trust yes he knew that determination of course unease she turned away before he could verify dontdo that she murmured why not he challenged because i dontwant you to she answered sorry he apologized halfheartedly he still felt she was hiding but he figured it couldntbe that important however she had always allowed him to read into her emotions before just not right now she replied he felt a bit better another door opened and hermione came down she was a bit dressed up but not too much she had a white sweater and beige pants on and her hair was drawn back in the front and tied back with a beige ribbon go wake up ron she told him or we ll be the last ones to eat breakfast grinning he left as ordered he helped ron pick out something to wear and then they walked back into the common room which now had a couple more people in it let eat hermione announced as ron blushed at the sight of her he pulled harry well behind the two girls to talk to him i canteven look at her he whispered to harry how am i going to get through today ron it just hermione harry reminded him just be yourself taking a deep breath ron sped to catch up with the girls and began to talk to hermione blush free silver looked over her shoulder and then stopped and waited for him to catch up they walked to breakfast in companionable silence the great hall was filling up as they sat down and ate harry noticed snape watching the foursome with suspicion as if at any moment they might jump up and start a riot silver glanced up at him and smiled and he relaxed a bit harry became uncomfortable as snape eyes stayed on them all during breakfast what his problem he finally muttered what does he think he is a hawk what silver asked from beside him nothing he answered he probably worried about her harry realized even harry was worried about her although he told himself there was no need to be because she would be with ginny when everyone was finally crowded at the exit of hogwarts silver informed him that she was going to meet up with ginny alright he replied see you at one thirty when they arrived at hogsmeade he looked every direction he could for a sign of lupin then he saw him searching the crowd just as eagerly for harry some students greeted him as they walked past remembering the year he had taught at hogwarts he thanked them but his eyes continued to search the mob harry jumped up waving his arms and lupin caught sight of him and smiled eventually harry reached him how are you harry he asked warmly good harry replied you excellent lupin answered where to first well i want to make sure silver is with ginny harry replied dutifully explaining the ron hermione predicament lupin nodded and helped harry look finally harry spotted silver walking beside ginny chatting he felt an incredible relief although he could not explain why i told her we d meet up with her in the three broomsticks around one thirty he told lupin works for me lupin replied harry looked around hogsmeade wondering where they should go first wanna go to zonko s he asked sure lupin replied i haventbeen there since my hogwarts days while they walked through zonko s lupin reminisced about the marauders one day your father and sirius set off all the dungbombs in the store he said chuckling the whole street smelled harry felt a pang when lupin mentioned sirius name if sirius were here he thought miserably before forcing his thoughts in another direction sirius wouldntbe here he reminded himself seeing as everyone thought he was a mass murderer sorry harry lupin said i didntmean to well it okay harry said it not your fault lupin didntlook so sure so harry tell me about what been happening he suggested harry filled him in on recent events which included silver fainting during potions to his surprise lupin chuckled that girl lupin said smiling what harry asked very emotional isntshe lupin inquired well yes harry said not seeing what it had to do with anything dontyou think it an odd combination her and snape it like two extremes very emotional and non emotional harry smiled yeah it is he agreed good for snivelly sorry snape though lupin said thoughtfully i suppose i dontreally see why she chose him to bond with harry answered lupin didntrespond harry didntknow why the sudden silence had occurred but it was a bit awkward um do you want to go to a different store he ventured sure lupin said agreeably they went and visited the shrieking shack for a while and harry could tell lupin was remembering the days the marauders had spent there harry realized that it was already half past noon he looked up at lupin to see that lupin was gazing off in a distracted manner did you say silver was supposed to be with ginny all day he inquired yes harry answered why well unless ginny has turned into a teenage boy with blonde hair i believe she needs our help he replied as if he were commenting on the weather blonde hair harry groaned inwardly as he spun around sure enough draco was interestedly talking to a slightly scared looking silver silver began to back away but draco reached out and grabbed her wrist harry and lupin whipped their wands out and began to run toward the two drop her malfoy or you ll pay harry threatened as he neared draco looked up surprised and then smiled at them as he grabbed her and held her in front of him making it impossible for them to cast a spell without hitting her first donttake another step draco advised them harry and lupin skidded to a stop a few feet away from them silver stepped on his foot and harry saw him wince scowl and tighten his grip on her ouch she exclaimed dontmove and it wonthurt he replied he looked at harry and lupin with satisfaction do i have something important to you he asked in mock surprise let her go lupin demanded draco sneered are you going to make me he replied because i really dontthink you should try it if you scare me i might accidentally snap her wrist harry watched as he tightened his grip on her wrists silver bit her lip her eyes watering suddenly hermione and ron appeared from the trees on either side they stuck their wands into draco back draco stiffened drop her malfoy ron spat you gonna curse me weasley draco replied no because i could make a much cleaner job of it than he could or should i say dirtier hermione replied draco eyes widened you have until the count of three draco hermione informed him three draco released her and she practically flew behind harry you alright harry asked still pointing his wand at draco threateningly yes she replied in a completely unconvincing voice harry and lupin exchanged glances and draco began to run away stupefy ron yelled and a beam of light shot out of his wand towards draco draco had shown some intelligence however and ran into the trees making it nearly impossible to aim a curse at him harry began after him but lupin stopped him he gone harry harry stepped back disappointedly he had wanted a good reason to curse malfoy for some time he turned to silver who was pointedly hiding her wrists behind her back let me see he told her i fine she told him he raised his eyebrows and held out his hands reluctantly she put her hands forward there were reddish marks around her wrists which harry was sure would turn into bruises let get you back to hogwarts lupin suggested a visit with madam pomfrey should heal you right up she looked as if she wanted to protest but she looked down at her wrists and nodded harry knew they must really hurt for her not to be arguing ron and hermione fell into step beside them as they headed back what a bloody bast ron began before realizing that lupin was there lupin looked mildly amused as if he had found it funny but didntwant to say so when they arrived at hogwarts silver walked right past madam pomfrey office um silver it right here hermione said pointing at the door i know that she replied exasperatedly without so much as a glance over her shoulder lupin harry hermione and ron looked at each other and then jogged to catch up with her where are you going then hermione prodded suddenly ron let out a disgusted snort she going to snape s he said in a voice that made it obvious he didntthink it was necessary silver didntsay anything which meant that he was right cantyou tell him about it after you go to madam pomfrey s hermione asked you must be in pain silver just shook her head and continued to walk harry was utterly shocked that she refused to argue with anyone and agreed wholeheartedly with hermione you know she right he told her if you re hurting what makes you think i hurting she snapped well for one you haventraised an argument since draco ran away harry answered she looked back at him eyes flashing angrily and quickened her pace so that he had to jog to stay by her side dontwalk so fast he pleaded it only true she gave him a withering look as they turned down into the dungeon corridors sighing harry dropped behind a step or two and followed her resignedly she a stubborn one isntshe ron commented silver gave him a venomous look over her shoulder when they reached the door to snape classroom she burst in without knocking the rest of them were right behind snape nearly jumped as they arrived he was brewing some sort of potion on his desk silver ran up to him and held out her wrists look what happened she said as long held in tears began to stream down her cheeks snape snapped his fingers and the lights in the room brightened he held her wrists in the light and looked back up at her who did this to you he demanded draco she sniffed snape looked as if he might lash out and overturn his desk at any moment he glared up at them why didntyou do anything he spat looking pointedly at harry we did ron answered that why she here right now well you were a little late werentyou snape sneered back looking as if he d like nothing more than to rip ron head off and use it for a potion ingredient as soon as snape turned back to silver ron made a face at him have you seen madam pomfrey snape demanded well not yet silver replied why not he answered his eyes boring into her i wanted to see you first she said rather sweetly in harry opinion hogwash you should have seen her the instant you arrived snape told her silver looked slightly hurt see hermione said i told you snape gave her an icy look and she began to study the floor very intently go see madam pomfrey and then come up to dumbledore office he instructed he seemed to notice lupin for the first time you will come to dumbledore office with me he ordered lupin looked slightly offended at being told what to do by snape but he nodded curtly in agreement madam pomfrey nearly went into hysteria when she found out how silver had gotten the bruises she muttered consistently as she healed silver and the words insufferable and malfoy were distinguishable they headed to dumbledore office with a slightly more content silver i hope he gets expelled ron raged i hope he gets suspended then when he comes back he ll have to face everybody knowing what an idiot he is hermione answered no expulsion would be better that way we d never have to see him again no suspension would teach him a lesson that would last a lot longer than expulsion but why would we want to have to see his ugly face in classes again it ll be worth it if he constantly embarrassed no it won t yes it will they argued all the way to dumbledore office and harry practically had to yell sugar quill for the gargoyle to hear the password over all the noise it will not ron hissed as they headed up the staircase will too hermione answered in a low voice guys silver complained touchy are we ron asked sounding offended that anyone would interrupt his and hermione argument hermione seemed to agree for once dumbledore swept the door open for them as they arrived at the top ah miss riddle he said harry thought he detected a spark of amusement in his eyes as he said her last name i hear you had a run in with mr malfoy today please tell me about it well silver said i was walking towards the shrieking shack and he kind of appeared out of nowhere and asked me if i wanted to go back to his dorm with him i told him i d rather drown myself and i think i got his temper up a bit harry couldnthelp but grin malfoy had gotten rejected badly he noticed that dumbledore eyes were twinkling lupin was attempting to hide a grin and even snape had a flicker of amusement in his eyes well now miss riddle may i ask what you were doing walking alone dumbledore inquired harry sat up what was she doing walking alone silver shot him a nervous glance before answering well i ve always enjoyed taking walks but i haventgotten to take one since i was about nine and i thought today would be the perfect time ah but there you see miss riddle it wasn t dumbledore answered you are very lucky it was mr malfoy that found you and not a death eater you do understand that there is quite a number of death eaters after you dontyou dumbledore was giving silver a piercing stare and she averted her eyes yes she murmured quietly i see dumbledore replied so you are telling me that you purposely endangered yourself so that you could take a walk yes she replied her voice even quieter than before that was not an intelligent action miss riddle which disappoints me greatly because your teachers tell me you are a very smart young lady dumbledore said i sorry silver said looking up to meet his eyes with desperation i wontdisappoint you again just please let me stay at hogwarts surprise flashed in dumbledore eyes miss riddle i was never considering even allowing you to leave hogwarts he informed her but you said you were disappointed with me silver answered looking confused why would you still keep me you will find miss riddle that not all people are as unforgiving as voldemort and his followers dumbledore answered and you will also find that i have no intention of surrendering you anytime soon you re going to keep me after i ve failed you silver asked in amazement her voice barely above a whisper you haventfailed anyone snape said his voice oddly harsh dontthink that silver turned her surprised eyes on him oh but i have she said mournfully no you haven t snape answered he managed to sound annoyed and reassuring at the same time i must agree with severus dumbledore said kindly silver looked from dumbledore to snape and back to dumbledore again thank you she said fervently harry wouldnthave been surprised if she had bowed she looked so thankful children you should get down to the great hall for dinner dumbledore replied the students from hogsmeade should be arriving shortly bye harry said to lupin lupin smiled see you soon harry he replied as the foursome walked down to the great hall silver was practically skipping what up with you ron asked dumbledore forgave me she replied jubilantly you didntdo anything hermione pointed out silver gave her a pitying look i disappointed him she said reprovingly oh for heaven sake he didntmean it like that hermione replied silver looked at hermione as if she were something of great interest you dontunderstand she told her reproachfully understand what exactly hermione replied harry rolled his eyes did hermione have to know everything forgiveness silver answered you take it for granted hermione looked as if she were about to reply but harry elbowed her shooting him an icy look she held her tongue silver good mood kept up she smiled to herself and everybody else she saw as they walked to the great hall soon all of the hogsmeade students were there except for draco ron found this extremely amusing and commented on it all through dinner ron will you shut up about malfoy hermione said finally ron blushed sorry he said immediately hermione looked surprised but gave him a smile before she returned to her food causing him to blush even more as usual they were the last ones left in the common room at night harry had begun to wonder how they were always the ones who stayed up the latest and woke up the earliest harry suddenly noticed that silver was giving him a pointed look i going to bed she announced uh okay he replied confused she rolled her eyes dontyou think you should go to bed too harry harry didn t but he knew better than to argue uh yeah he replied unconvinced he really didntfeel too tired but he got up anyway she beamed at him night everyone she said pleasantly night mumbled ron who was blushing for some reason unknown to harry good night hermione replied briskly uh night harry said still confused it wasntuntil harry got to bed and wondered why ron hadntcome in yet that he realized that silver was getting him out of the room so ron and hermione could be alone together i wonder what going on between them anyway he thought he decided to ask ron when he came in but after waiting what seemed like forever to harry his eyelids began to droop he had to make more of an effort to clear his mind than usual since he was busy thinking of ron and hermione but finally he managed to do so and drifted off to sleep immediately disclaimer i do not own or claim to own any of j k rowling people places items or anything else that she made up confession i made up a spell in this chapter aperio specialis it means reveal secret in latin now that i ve confessed nobody can complain about me using a fake spell chapter 14 the locket harry yawned sleepily and stretched he had just had a very good night sleep his eyes flickered to the clock on his bedstand and then widened it late he realized he hurriedly got out of bed and dressed realizing that even ron was already gone it only took him a few minutes to get ready and then he headed down to the common room almost everyone was down in the great hall eating breakfast but silver was sitting peacefully on the couch in front of the fire waiting for him morning sleepyhead she greeted he grinned morning he replied he plopped down beside her and looked around where ron and hermione he asked they went down to breakfast about a half an hour ago she informed him ron was really hungry why d i wake up so late harry wondered aloud you were tired she replied sensibly come on let go down and eat wonder if malfoy got expelled harry said mischievously as they adjourned to the great hall she giggled i dontthink we ll be nearly so lucky she told him well we can always hope he answered ron and hermione were arguing over something when they arrived did not did too morning silver greeted they looked up at her as if she had just interrupted something very important good morning hermione greeted morning ron echoed silver smiled so anything interesting happen yeah malfoy hasntshown up yet ron answered happily i bet you he expelled i bet you he not came a voice from behind them they spun around to look into draco sneering face ron looked highly disappointed but thanks to you filthy half blood he continued looking at silver with loathing i on probation for a month he spat on the ground near her causing her to jump and then grinned at her reaction see you around he said in a way harry was sure he didntlike draco turned and walked away probation ron echoed he only allowed to go to classes and meals the rest of the time he has to go to his dorm hermione answered he wonteven be allowed in the slytherin common room ron sniggered serves him right suddenly silver stood up did you hear what he called me she asked a half blood rather than looking offended she looked as if her dreams had all come true and you re happy about this ron asked he knows who my father is silver exclaimed joyfully and without another word she turned and began to run after him immediately the remaining trio vaulted from their seats and followed her draco silver called malfoy draco draco turned around and looked surprised to see silver running after him calling his name draco she panted as she caught up with him you called me a half blood yeah so he answered harry ron and hermione caught up with their wands drawn out just in case draco she said why you dontknow what a mudblood is he scoffed of course i do draco it because of my father isntit isntit she asked excitedly yeah your father a mudblood draco said looking confused what his name silver asked eagerly what draco replied looking even more confused his name draco his name what is it she asked her eyes dancing with anticipation draco looked into her eyes suspiciously and thoughtfully harry knew he was wondering if he wanted to keep those eyes focused on him for a while or just get it over with and tell her you dontknow who your daddy is he finally sneered understanding dawning in his eyes draco just tell me she replied impatiently a smile spread onto his face and harry inwardly groaned you wanna know he asked well i ll tell you at a price anything she replied harry immediately wished she hadntsaid that draco pointed to his lips your lips right here he told her smugly silver backed up a step looking revolted what no never absolutely no she told him shaking her head well then i guess you dont really want to know do you he sneered turning on his heel and beginning to walk away draco silver called after him please draco turned with a smile if you re really nice to me and i mean really nice he smirked maybe with that he turned and walked in the direction of the slytherin common room silver was frustrated and upset her eyes welled up with tears he didnttell me she whispered shocked well he wouldn t harry answered sounding a bit like hermione not when he wants you to keep looking his way harry this is my father we re talking about it not something to play around with like like that she said sounding outraged i know it you know it and he knows it but that not gonna change his mind harry answered silver bit her lip trying to keep her tears in harry she moaned he knows who my father is i know harry said comfortingly he ll get bored of playing eventually she didntlook very convinced that he knew anything much less anything about her father i going to the library for a while she said and i want to go alone she looked at the three of them accusingly at this last part and they knew she was serious alright hermione said kindly we ll wait for you in the common room harry was about to protest but hermione gripped his arm tightly as she steered him away what d you do that for he asked grumpily she needs to be alone harry hermione replied they all sat on the couch in the common room trying to figure out what to do it would be a lot easier if we found out who her mother is hermione commented harry snorted fat chance we have of getting that out of her he answered you ve tried hermione asked yeah and it turned her into a human water hose he informed her like cho always was he added to himself hermione sighed well doesntshe trust us ron asked incredulously dontask her that harry replied she ll just start bawling when she ready to tell us she will hermione gave him an approving look i agree with harry she said alright i wontask her anything ron agreed after a half an hour silver joined them fingering the silver locket around her neck what is that ron asked curiously well it the only clue i have as to my father really silver replied looking down at it he left it for me and put a spell on it so my mom canttouch it without burning herself i think he knew how she is it beautiful hermione said may i see it hesitantly silver lifted the locket up off her neck and handed it to hermione hermione studied it very closely this is very valuable she said at last how do you open it she was trying to force it open and it was not budging i dontknow silver answered sadly i dontthink he ever wanted my mom to see whatever in there i think it may tell me who he is even where he is but i ve never figured out how to open it i think he wanted me to though have you tried magic on it hermione asked yes and i ve tried talking to it singing to it begging it everything silver answered i always hope one day it ll just spring open hermione handed it back and silver fingered it lovingly for a moment before replacing it around her neck for a moment everybody sat in silence wrapped in their own thoughts it was hermione who finally spoke sensible to a fault well what are we doing inside on a day like this let go for a walk or something they all agreed and by the time they got outside they were all wearing smiles they talked gleefully about draco punishment ron was hoping he would get kicked off the quidditch team but silver protested that she desperately wanted to hit a bludger at him and knock him off his broomstick silver hand strayed to her locket again and hermione simply couldntresist i sure there has to be a spell to open that she exclaimed how many have you tried well not many silver admitted just the basic ones that i could find in books lying around the house and that was probably all dark magic hermione said what do you all say we head to the library and find a way to open it even harry and ron wanted to help the foursome headed back inside to the library and began collecting books uh would melting it work ron asked as he looked through uncommon spells to solve common problems hermione glanced over ron do you really think that trying to open a magic locket is a common problem she asked it could be ron protested i suppose hermione said dubiously hey what if we gave it a brain harry asked mischievously that just what we need hermione said sarcastically a necklace with a personality knowing our luck it would run away harry and ron snickered and the girls shot them reproving looks after a few minutes hermione glanced over and demanded ron what are you reading ron attempted to cover the title of his book which was take revenge on your enemies hexes and jinxes they wontbe able to endure i really wanna hurt malfoy he protested dumbledore already handled the punishment now are you going to help us look or not hermione asked yeah ron grumbled turning back to his other book ooh silver said how about the secret summoning charm it supposed to reveal a magical item secrets try it hermione replied excitedly silver took the locket off her neck set it on the table pointed her wand at it and said clearly aperio specialis for a moment the locket quivered but then it lay just as still as before hmm hermione mused your dad must have put a countercurse on it for that charm so that your mom couldntopen it he was a very gifted wizard silver beamed and put the locket around her neck once more as they continued their search you know that spell could come in useful in a lot of situations ron said we should remember it hermione gave him a rare surprised smile you know ron you re right she exclaimed ron blushed and harry knew that was no spell he d be forgetting anytime soon uh harry said here one that supposed to rip something in half but we canthurt the locket silver exclaimed i ve had it for forever and i like it she added stubbornly okay it was just an idea harry mumbled turning back to his book in three hours they had only come across a few more possible spells none of which had worked whenever the locket refused to open hermione became more delighted she gushed about what a good wizard silver father was to have blocked the secret from so many spells well i wish he wouldnthave silver said frustrated as she slammed spells to solve any problem closed i just a kid how did he ever expect me to figure out how to open it that just it though hermione said he must have known that you d try and he must have made it something so obvious that we cantfigure it out silver sighed well it dinnertime now so maybe we ll look some other time she said maybe we should just think about it for a while hermione suggested it has to be so easy that we re overlooking it harry was doubtful and he wasntthe only one silver looked very put out about the whole thing and he was certain that she just wanted to forget about the locket secret for a while ron however was hanging on hermione every word nodding as she spoke maybe hermione continued he did something else too like the secret can only be revealed on a full moon or in winter silver groaned in that case how did he ever expect me to open it i telling you it something simple hermione insisted over dinner ginny came up to them beaming silver you are absolutely brilliant for what you did to draco she exclaimed how did you know about that silver asked surprised the whole school knows silver ginny replied you re a hero except for with the slytherins of course truthfully enough the entire slytherin table was glaring at silver making her cringe uncomfortably whilst the gryffindor table was shooting her awed looks and hufflepuff and ravenclaw were giving her encouraging smiles great silver sighed and we have double potions with them tomorrow they wontdo anything to you ron answered especially in front of snape silver didntlook to sure and personally harry wasnteither but he didntsay anything halfway through dinner silver announced that she was no longer hungry and was going to the common room harry watched her carefully as she made her way out of the great hall making sure no slytherins were following her but nothing eventful happened they re really bugging her arentthey hermione asked the way they re looking at her well slytherins are always like that ron replied they ve just directed their sour faces in her direction they walked into the common room to be greeted by complete silence neville put his finger to his lips as they walked in and motioned towards the couch harry smiled as he looked over to see silver sleeping peacefully on the couch her hair cascaded over the edge of the couch and he was compelled to go and give it a tug she was clasping her locket tightly in her hand exchanging smiles the trio sat down near her and whispered to each other waiting for her to wake up the hours passed by however and silver didntawaken we should wake her up hermione suggested as she stifled a yawn i ready for bed me too ron agreed standing up with her no i ll wait a while longer harry answered glancing at her hermione raised her eyebrows i ll wake her up in a half hour if she doesntwake up he promised hermione and ron went to bed and harry looked over at silver who didntlook like he was waking up anytime soon he then looked into the fire watching as the flames danced higher and higher it was mesmerizing harry he heard he turned in his chair not wanting to wake up he heard silver laugh wake up harry she urged he opened his eyes and looked up into her face she was smiling down at him i was supposed to wake you up he informed her groggily she giggled sorry she apologized harry realized that it was very dim in the room and discovered that the fire was almost out night he murmured as he made his way toward the boys dorms night harry she replied sweet dreams he smiled but was too sleepy to reply he fell into bed still smiling without bothering to clear his mind he had a dream that he was out on the quidditch field about to play slytherin he couldntseem to find silver and the whole team was in an uproar look angelina cried there she is she playing for slytherin today harry looked over to see silver in green and silver slytherin robes her locket was hanging down over the robes and she was hanging on malfoy arm he stalked over to her what are you doing he asked malfoy wanted me to play for him she replied smiling up at malfoy sickeningly and how could i say no you re in gryffindor though harry protested i ve switched to slytherin she replied but you cantdo that he said harry just go away she snapped my father doesntlike you anyway what he asked but who your father crabbe and goyle began to carry him away he kicked and fought but couldntget loose as he watched silver turned to malfoy smiling and malfoy bent down to kiss her harry woke up before their lips touched thank goodness he wouldnthave been able to live with that picture in his mind he rolled over so that he was facing his pillow reminding himself that it was only a dream he didntrealize that for once he had had a normal dream one not remotely concerning voldemort he drifted back off to sleep thinking about the locket and it secrets there had to be a way to figure out what it was hiding there just had to disclaimer i do not own or claim to own any of j k rowling characters places items ect reviewers i just love you guys reviews make me so happy lol chapter 15 advancing in occlumency harry today we will be practicing without the use of the pensieve dumbledore announced what harry asked looking around the room to make sure the pensieve wasntthere yes harry dumbledore said you ve been very successful lately and it time you gave it a try harry inwardly groaned it was only a month and a half until christmas and dumbledore was choosing now to plague his mind cantwe wait until after christmas he pleaded no harry dumbledore replied firmly harry slumped in his seat the last thing he had wanted when things were going so well was to be tortured by the memory of sirius come harry let get started dumbledore told him cheerfully harry reluctantly followed him to the empty section of floor hard floor that they always practiced on on three dumbledore announced one there no way i going to be able to do this two i dontwant to do this three legilimens memories flashed before harry but he saw dumbledore figure before him and sought to get to it quick he thought before i have to see it but just when he thought he could manage to evade it he saw it sirius was grinning at his cousin taunting her is that the best you can do no harry thought ruefully as dumbledore faded away it wasnt sirius began to fall and a thousand emotions overcame harry sirius he bellowed running forward toward his godfather as if he were really there sirius his legs suddenly failed him as guilt and sadness coursed through him and he fell to his knees and watched as sirius fell through the veil the smile had not completely left his face harry was plunged into darkness harry dumbledore was saying harry wake up harry rolled over and pressed himself against the floor hoping to somehow fall through it to get away he didntwant to see it he didntwant to realize that it had been lurking in the back of his thoughts for a long time now he didntwant to know that he had been stubbornly avoiding the fact that sirius had ever existed he didntwant to go back to having a constant pain in his chest a hole in his heart if he could just forget about it just not have to think about it harry dumbledore said you cantescape it it doesntwork that way harry didntmove if he just lay there long enough he could forget about it dumbledore just needed to stop talking to stop reminding him of it think of something else he told himself anything else but he saw sirius again and again heard his words echoing in his head harry groaned and clutched at his head as he rolled back over to face dumbledore i dontwant this he told him i want to forget no harry dumbledore said gently you cantthink that way harry felt the familiar feeling of a lump in the back of his throat not tears again he thought not again but they flowed over and harry rolled back over once more to face the floor he didntwant to get up getting up would mean he would have to do this again and again get up harry dumbledore said come sit down sirius would want me to he thought sirius would do it if he were me slowly he got to his feet letting the tears pour down his face without actually crying but he didntgo and sit down he was sure sirius wouldnthave he sucked up his grief and remorse again he said forcing the word out to him it didntsound like his voice he had to conquer this memory for sirius sirius he thought this is for you dumbledore didntargue or even question harry one i ll make you proud sirius two i wontlet you down watch me see what i can do three legilimens this time harry anticipated the memory rather than running from it he boredly let his other memories flash by without paying them any notice suddenly there he was harry smiled as he watched his godfather battle is that the best you can do he taunted bellatrix goodbye sirius harry thought sorry i cantstay and be with you he saw dumbledore figure and concentrated on it sirius began to fall backwards almost in slow motion dumbledore became clearer and clearer sirius head touched the veil and suddenly the whole memory vanished something came out of the tip of harry wand and aimed itself at dumbledore something that harry had not purposely wanted to do suddenly he was consumed by dumbledore memories he watched as a much younger dumbledore got teased by a group of very pretty girls for being a bookworm loser one of them giggled and the rest echoed her harry felt a bit angry at them for thinking of dumbledore that way the scene began to change harry recognized the outside of the hogwarts building and began to see a crowd of students but suddenly he was pushed backwards he landed on a rather hard wooden box ouch sorry harry dumbledore said i wasntexpecting you to take over like that well i didntmean to harry apologized it just kind of happened dumbledore looked slightly ruffled that was excellent harry more than i had ever hoped for are you alright harry knew dumbledore was asking about his mental state rather than his physical one i think i just made sirius proud harry answered truthfully he didntknow whether he was alright or not but he felt a bit of satisfaction knowing that sirius would have been elated for him at that very moment indeed you did dumbledore agreed solemnly harry didntanswer he felt as if he had just recovered from a dementor attack and his butt still hurt from landing on that box so hard he then remembered what he had seen of dumbledore memories he felt a bit sorry for dumbledore but was too busy being mad at him for taking away the pensieve to feel too much pity he stretched in his chair it had felt kind of good to be able to step away from the memory dumbledore harry said quietly yes harry dumbledore answered attentively how do i get past this he asked referring to the constant pain he felt when he thought of sirius my dear boy dumbledore said kindly you have already made great progress harry glanced up in surprise how had he made any kind of progress he had just broken down in tears at the memory of sirius death that was called progress dumbledore seemed to read his mind harry you had a painful past even before sirius had died last year you were withdrawing into yourself not facing what you knew was true but now look at you harry heard distinct pride in dumbledore voice you ve let lupin into your life you haventshut out your friends your teachers are all reporting that your work and concentration is excellent you are handling your duties as quidditch captain very responsibly you are beginning to master occlumency and here you are talking to me about the very thing you think you ve made no progress in harry you do not know what great progress it is for one to open oneself up harry supposed dumbledore was halfway right but i pushed the memory away he protested i haventbeen facing it ah but harry you just did and you overcame it dumbledore reminded him but doesntovercoming it mean it wontmake me break out in tears every time i think of it harry asked first of all i would like to let you know that tears are nothing to be ashamed of dumbledore answered and secondly i saw no tears this last time around harry realized that dumbledore was right yeah he said quietly you re right so what do i do now keep practicing occlumency for one dumbledore answered other than that keep doing exactly what you are right now harry nodded it sounded doable so are we going to go again he asked do you feel ready to go again was the kind reply harry nearly replied with a defiant yes but he knew in the pit of his stomach that he wasn t no he replied i suppose i should just rest a while very good dumbledore said approvingly we ll give it half an hour harry fell into silence he felt the nagging pain in his chest he wanted sirius to be there sirius he moaned inwardly why did you have to go why he closed his eyes and memories of his godfather overcame him he thought first of the picture of the handsome and haughty young boy he had seen in snape memory the last year and then of the man in his parent wedding picture whose eyes had been so alive so full of life and happiness then he thought of the ragged sirius with a laugh like a raspy bark and those haunted eyes the sirius sailing away on buckbeak with a smile on his face compared to the one that had stormed through the black house frustrated at not being able to do anything for the order and then sirius in battle the only place he was truly alive in his godfather last moments the haunted look he had acquired from azkaban had faded and true happiness and anticipation had taken it place he never would have been happy harry realized not unless he could get out of that blasted house and do what he wanted to do and that wouldnthave happened unless he was proven innocent harry closed his eyes and pressed his hands over them there were so many what if s and many more if only s they kept his mind tossing and turning recklessly but he knew that he shouldntbe dwelling on them he glanced up at the clock twenty five minutes was close enough to half an hour i ready he announced dumbledore nodded and they stood up and walked to the center of the room it took harry two tries to block dumbledore but then he successfully did it three times which was three times more than dumbledore had wanted to try after the third time he sank down to the floor feeling as if all the energy was drained out of him permanently you ve done very well harry dumbledore praised better than i ever would have expected we will be done for the day but you can stay here for as long as you like to regain your energy i will be summoning professor snape into the room to discuss some possibilities for your occlumency lessons in the future you may give us any suggestions you wish harry mind reeled was he going to have to have snape give him occlumency lessons again he looked up at dumbledore earnestly no harry dumbledore chuckled professor snape will not be giving you occlumency lessons again but he is a talented occlumens greater than myself i might add and he will have some good suggestions for you harry personally thought that snape wouldntwant to give him and his occlumency lesson the time of day but didntsay anything as dumbledore threw some floo powder into the fire knelt down and stuck his head in harry couldnthear the conversation but it was relatively short dumbledore emerged looking excited professor snape and miss riddle will be joining us shortly he announced um since when does snape have a fireplace in his room harry asked it is in his storage room dumbledore replied i require all the teachers to have a fireplace so that i may get ahold of them whenever i wish most of them are hidden however harry was too tired to question the whereabouts of them he leaned back in the fluffy armchair and prayed for energy professor snape will also be bringing you a potion that should give you energy and help you to focus dumbledore told him and i suggest you thank him for bringing it in since the particular potion takes a good while to brew and he did it without being ordered to silver probably told him to harry thought he just couldntsee snape going to any lengths for him of his own accord soon enough he heard footsteps coming up the stairs silver laugh could be heard ringing clearly and sweetly through the corridor harry felt a bit more awake when he heard it soon snape and silver arrived silver gave him an encouraging sort of smile and snape grudgingly held out a vial of glowing purple potion the same one he had given him after harry had thrown up in his classroom harry drank it eagerly the cold fruity taste awakened his senses he felt electricity flowing through his body and both his vision and hearing sharpened thanks harry said feeling much more alive than he had previously snape observed him emotionlessly is he always that tired after lessons he asked dumbledore oh no dumbledore assured him we just practiced without the use of the pensieve today and i believe it was a bit trying on him silver gave him a worried glance but he smiled reassuringly at her how d he do snape asked he was overcome three times but blocked it four dumbledore replied he even managed to turn the tables on me his second try snape looked surprised he looked at harry appraisingly as if wondering whether dumbledore was lying or not so severus as it seems that after christmas sometime harry will be ready to move up to the next level of occlumency practicing the spell on others harry looked surprised and he was not the only one snape did as well but headmaster he will not be able to successfully enter into either of our minds he replied yes exactly dumbledore agreed i was wondering if you knew of any students and their parents who would be willing to volunteer for harry to work on preferably they will have had a little or no experience in occlumency before but are strong willed enough to block him if he does not perform the curse strongly enough snape looked deep in thought molly would never agree to it he said perhaps granger parents would agree since they do not know the extent of what it will be getting her into no severus i do not want to take advantage of anyone dumbledore replied we need someone like me silver interrupted both adults and harry turned to look at her speechless what you dontthink i strong willed enough she asked eyes flashing dangerously well miss riddle dumbledore replied i do not think that at all but you have a particularly painful past you do realize that occlumency yes i know all about occlumency from what harry and professor snape have told me she replied snape and dumbledore exchanged glances well miss riddle i will allow you seeing as you re so determined and you re the only student whom i think fits the description on one condition dumbledore said you will practice occlumency with severus so that you have the choice of blocking harry if the memories become too painful or too private snape nodded his agreement and then harry will attempt to break into our minds dumbledore finished both adults looked at harry neither of them looking particularly anxious of the day harry would try to see their worst memories snape looked as if he intended to kill harry before that happened so dumbledore said rather suddenly making the other three jump does anyone feel like ice cream ooh silver replied yes please sure harry answered erm snape began severus i really insist you stay dumbledore interrupted before snape had a chance to refuse yes please stay silver echoed snape looked resigned alright he said looking none too happy about it dumbledore reached over and picked up a small silver bell he made sure it rang exactly four times and then set it down almost immediately four house elves appeared carrying bowls of ice cream dumbledore had a cherry on top oh i see you get a cherry silver teased once the house elves left yes it is one of the many perks of being headmaster actually it is the main reason i took the job dumbledore replied silver laughed and harry grinned he wouldntput it past dumbledore to be telling the truth snape looked mildly amused harry watched as silver took a polite sized spoonful of hers and watched in amusement as harry and dumbledore took the biggest scoops they could fit into their mouths snape didnttouch his arentyou going to eat yours silver prompted guess so was snape reply he reluctantly spooned some into his mouth as harry and dumbledore continued to compete to see who could fit the biggest scoop into their mouths and still manage to swallow it in the end both of them had headaches goodness dumbledore said as he rummaged around in his desk drawers that really can be a painful game cantit harry yeah harry grunted holding his head dumbledore offered him some red potion in a small cup and harry gratefully accepted it it made the headache go away immediately i find that happens quite often when one eats ice cream so i always have a supply handy dumbledore informed them much to silver amusement after silver had finished hers dumbledore glanced at the clock well children it time for you to be getting to your dorms he instructed alright harry agreed bye bye professor dumbledore silver said cheerfully she then threw her arms around snape neck and gave him a sweet bye bye snape grumbled trying to look as if he hadntliked the hug in the least he didntsucceed harry and silver ran down the stairs racing each other silver jumped off the fourth to the last one and landed at the same time as him although she insisted she had landed first harry argued playfully with her all the way back to the common room where she left him with a hug and a night harry this time he managed to reply with g night sweet dreams he walked to the dorms still savoring the sweet smile she had given him when she turned around at the top of the stairs disclaimer i do not own or claim to own any of j k rowling characters places or items or anything else that she may own that i do not chapter 16 home for christmas harry harry jumped at the sound of his name he and silver were in the library finishing an essay for history of magic harry silver look ron bellowed waving a sheet of paper in the air as he ran toward them he thundered into the library and handed them the paper yelling look look the greatest thing ever madam pince however promptly appeared at their side looking furious i will not have this in my library she screeched out out ron silver complained we were doing our homework in there so what it doesntmatter nothing matters read it he replied excitedly rolling his eyes harry looked down at the sheet of paper in his hands he held it slightly to the side so that silver could read it as well attention all students due to some changes in school policies this year christmas break will be extended it will now last from december 19th until january 8th please make arrangements in advance for this a letter has been sent home to each of your parents students staying at hogwarts this christmas harry didntread the rest an extra week he exclaimed that makes christmas break a month long professor mcgonagall told hermione that it had to do with some stuff for the order ron replied but she wouldntsay what not that it matters we get a whole extra week off for break harry grinned at the thought of keeping lupin company in the old black house he couldntwait to see how much they had gotten it fixed up order stuff silver echoed i wonder what it is let go see but what if we interrupt dumbledore ron asked we can just wait until harry next occlumency lesson with him no that next monday and i wasnttalking about dumbledore anyhow silver replied not the old git ron groaned he not a git and you donthave to come silver answered setting off toward the dungeons ron followed her and harry anyway cantwe go see mcgonagall or something he insisted you can go see whomever you wish silver answered smartly ron rolled his eyes but kept quiet harry grinned he knew there was no way they could talk her out of going to visit snape silver pushed the door to snape dungeon open and harry saw a look of disappointment cross over her face he not here she said a pout beginning to form on her face ron tried not to look too happy suddenly silver began to walk further in where are you going ron hissed silver walked up to the board and tapped it three times with her wand before muttering something that harry couldnthear immediately glowing red words appeared on the board reading gone to dumbledore office the new password is fizzing whizbee be back at six well looks like we re going to have to go to dumbledore office anyhow she announced how d you do that ron asked stunned at the message that had appeared on the board silver tapped the board with her wand again and the words faded he just put that there so i would know where he was if i ever needed him she replied as if this were the sort of thing snape would normally do harry and ron gaped so whenever he goes somewhere he changes that just for you ron asked silver glared at him well i see how important you think i am she said haughtily and yes as a matter of fact he does harry and ron exchanged astonished glances before they realized that silver was heading off down the hallway toward dumbledore office they had to run to catch up with her so he thinks of you like all the time ron gathered nothing gets past you silver replied sarcastically as they arrived in front of the gargoyle fizzing whizbee the gargoyle sprang open and the three headed up the stairs where hermione silver inquired writing a letter to her parents about the longer christmas break ron replied silver knocked on the door at the top of the staircase after a moment dumbledore swept the door open for them and beckoned them in snape and professor mcgonagall were there and both looked surprised by the interruption hello students dumbledore greeted cheerfully what can i do for you today we wanted to know why the longer christmas break silver answered if it had anything to do with the order dumbledore and professor mcgonagall smiled snape looked as if he could not fathom why they would come up just to ask such a simple question silver walked up behind snape chair and put her arms around his neck he looked embarrassed surprised and pleased yes miss riddle dumbledore replied his eyes twinkling as he watched her hug snape as a matter of fact we were just discussing that silver straightened and backed up a step listening intently you see the order will be working on plans this christmas so we decided to give the extra week for personal business the week before christmas will be the only week during break the members of the order will be at their respective houses and attending to their personal business and the only week i have to prepare you see i will have to stay here during christmas break so i will only be sending a list of things to be covered to the members of the order oh silver answered slowly the smile fading from her face i suppose i staying here the first week too then on the contrary miss riddle dumbledore replied brightly silver looked up at him hopefully we were just discussing the matter of appointing a guardian that is a member of the order to take you to their respective house during christmas break they will bring you back to headquarters with them at noon on christmas day dumbledore looked up at a very hopeful looking harry and added yes harry you will be staying with remus harry was elated he really hadntseen lupin in a long time the hogsmeade weekend hadntcounted he hadnteven gotten to say goodbye to lupin properly then so who taking me silver asked well we re not quite sure yet dumbledore answered slowly harry exchanged glances with ron they had both assumed that she would be going home with snape in a second all of the eyes in the room were focused on snape he glared back at them seeing as severus canttake you dumbledore began what silver asked no silver dumbledore said gently severus wontbe taking you home why she asked looking confused well it doesntfit in to his personal schedule to dumbledore began but silver interrupted once more she was staring at snape accusingly and sadly you you dontwant me she asked him in a small voice it it not that snape said i just i not i can t you dontwant me silver confirmed her eyes filling up with tears silver snape said almost reprovingly he stood up but she backed away from him shaking her head she turned and fled past harry and ron out of the room harry saw tears pouring down her cheeks as she went he and ron stayed put both of them too astounded to go anywhere snape looked frustrated why wontyou take her severus dumbledore inquired curiously because snape snapped his patience lost when silver left the room i not a parent i cantbe a parent she drives me crazy as it is worrying me half to death all the time dumbledore observed snape piercingly for a moment before replying so you wonttake her because you re scared you wontbe able to take care of her he said finally i not scared of anything snape hissed eyes flashing with anger oh but severus you are dumbledore said and i wonthave it not in this situation dumbledore sounded oddly stern snape gaped at him for a minute what he said finally i absolutely wonthave it you will overcome your fear and take the girl home dumbledore answered sounding angry i donthave any fear snape sneered in response oh but severus you canthide it from me no not me dumbledore answered talking faster than harry had ever heard him talk before snape gave dumbledore a venomous look i wonttake her he declared she will go with someone else and have a better time than she would have had with me severus listen to me dumbledore commanded that girl chose you i never would have believed that you who knows her situation better than anybody would push her away when she is so openly pouring her heart into you she is not pouring anything into me snape roared i an old git and it times like this i believe it dumbledore replied his voice rising as well however the girl does not dumbledore voice quieted back down at his last statement snape glared at dumbledore but appeared unable to say anything severus it simple really dumbledore continued just as you yes you have the power to open up her future it is she that has the power to unravel your past deny it you may but you belong to each other i dont belong to anybody snape hissed back he spun on his heel and left the room dumbledore sighed and dropped into his chair after all the fuss he put into being with her every waking moment during guard duty you d think he d jump at the opportunity he commented his blue eyes half angry half amused he glanced up at ron and harry please go get silver and tell her i wish to have a word with her right now do not leave her until she comes he instructed the two nodded and walked out of dumbledore office where do you reckon she went ron asked well she wouldntgo to the common room or to the dorms harry said carefully because she wouldntwant to be seen or bothered i bet she hiding in the library somewhere what an old git ron said angrily he had to have known he was going to hurt her he had to have harry agreed but didntsay anything he was wondering why snape would do something like that the two made their way to the library where madam pince gave them several suspicious looks as they walked through the racks suddenly they heard a sniffle coming from the corner of the room exchanging glances the hurried over silver was sitting with her arms around her knees and her head resting on top of them sniffling hey harry said sitting down beside her harry nobody wants me she sobbed yes they do he soothed she shook her head and continued to cry come on he said taking her arm dumbledore wants to talk to you she stubbornly resisted snape not there ron told her she reluctantly allowed herself to be led back to dumbledore office when they arrived professor mcgonagall was gone harry gently pushed her down into a fluffy armchair silver dumbledore said she refused to meet his gaze silver i need to know that you are listening to me dumbledore said nonthreateningly she began to sob anew no nobody w wants me she sobbed silver please look at me was dumbledore patient reply silver sniffled up her tears and looked up at him severus does want you my dear dumbledore said holding out a tissue but he scared of what she sniffed not using the tissue well to put it frankly you dumbledore answered m me she repeated he doesntthink he ll be able to take care of you dumbledore explained silver burst into sobs once more as she replied w well he c can she cried i ll b be r really good i know dumbledore told her believe me i do silver continued to cry for a good ten minutes before quieting down to random sniffles harry put his hand on her shoulder but she didnteven seem to realize it was there silver dumbledore said gently i sorry it not you she replied her voice and gaze distant it me nobody is ever going to be able to love me are they silver dumbledore chided there are many people who love you no she replied still sounding as if she were in some other world they re just saying that waiting until they can hurt me but it okay i dontneed anyone nobody i dontwant you thinking that dumbledore scolded because it not true silver didntreply she seemed to be drawing herself in leaving only a shell of what she had been just an hour ago silver harry asked hesitantly yes she replied her voice oddly hollow she didntsmile but neither did she frown her face was utterly emotionless this is what i was afraid of dumbledore said quietly suddenly the door burst open snape was standing there looking as if he might bite all their heads off at any moment silver he said she looked up at him and her essence came pouring back rather than looking emotionless she now looked as though she were going to burst into tears i ve changed my mind he announced you will be coming home with me for christmas he turned to dumbledore any other plans you ve made for her you will just have to cancel he announced as if he had been cheated out of getting a chance to take her home a smile spread over dumbledore face silver looked up at snape questioningly and he looked back down at her the menace gone from his face because i do want you he admitted looking as if he were trying very hard not to show how attached he was to her slowly a smile lit her features she jumped up from her chair and threw her arms around him thank you she breathed i promise i ll be really really good and i wontdisappoint you or disobey you and i ll do anything you want me to i promise snape looked as if he were about to reply but he glanced briefly up at them and then said we ll discuss it later he then looked up at ron and harry as if daring them to repeat what they had just witnessed to anybody alright she replied breathlessly squeezing him so tightly harry was surprised he could still breathe off you go now he told her trying to sound annoyed she nodded and walked down the stairs followed by harry and ron she didntsay anything until they passed the gargoyle somebody wants me she sounded amazed and happy at the same time yeah ron sniggered but he d never admit it in public did you see the look on his face harry he totally didntwant us to see what a softie he is harry couldnthelp but laugh now you two dontgo she began dontworry we wonttell anyone how parental snape can be ron assured her except for hermione ginny fred and george silver rolled her eyes and harry laughed so he teased are you actually going to be good her eyes widened am i really that bad all the time she asked worriedly he laughed i was just kidding he exclaimed she looked relieved good because i already try hard to stay out of trouble she replied harry and ron both burst out laughing doesntwork very well does it ron asked whether you re sneaking out of snape class or going for a casual stroll through hogsmeade you somehow end up in trouble all the time silver glared at him then she suddenly looked worried all over again i haventbought him a christmas present she exclaimed alarmed i dontthink he used to getting them anyway ron replied which earned him a venomous look from silver why dontyou make him one harry suggested i cant make anything silver answered but you said you knew a secret way to hogsmeade didntyou no harry answered firmly you are not going to hogsmeade and risking your neck just to get snivelly a christmas present dontcall him that and yes i am she answered stubbornly fine go ahead and try he answered but you re not getting any information out of me she scowled at him and refused to look at him the rest of the way he ignored her he was not going to tell her how to get into hogsmeade he knew it would only result in trouble if not danger her good mood returned when they arrived in the common room where hermione was waiting for them hermione i have a home for christmas she exclaimed happily before bouncing off in another direction while ron and harry filled her in after they had finished explaining harry looked over to see silver folding up a letter i going to go down to the owlry to get this delivered she informed them innocently i ll be back in a few minutes they all dismissed this as normal when suddenly ron asked wait a minute who does she have to write to when silver returned that was the first thing they asked her just somebody she replied what does it matter it matters because you have a knack for getting into trouble nearly as bad as mine harry answered harry i wouldntgo doing anything dangerous she informed him in a voice that was too full of sugary sweetness he regarded her suspiciously for a moment and then suddenly heard snatches of ron and hermione conversation i ll well really miss you ron was saying that so sweet ron i ll miss you too hermione gushed back in a voice most unlike her own i ll write you every day i ll write you twice a day and you ll try and come back to headquarters the last two weeks of course is it just me or are they not arguing harry asked silver silver grinned let just say somebody cantwait to stand under the mistletoe together she replied ron never told me anything harry said feeling a bit left out well have you been telling him every little thing that happens between you and me silver inquired harry remembered that as far as ron knew he and silver had only hugged once and stared at each other a lot he was sure ron suspected something had happened between them but he didntreally know uh not exactly he admitted well there you have it she told him he frowned guess i ll talk to him tonight he muttered good you two need to talk silver replied almost as much as i need to get some sleep i going to bed night sleep tight he replied playfully she giggled dontlet the bedbugs bite i forget the rest he informed her she grinned how about a sweet dreams then sweet dreams silver he obliged eagerly she beamed at him sweet dreams harry she replied leaning over and kissing him on the cheek before walking up the stairs harry grinned long after she disappeared into the girl dorms disclaimer i do not own or claim to own any of j k rowling characters places items ect the only thing i do claim rightfully as mine is my character silver riddle chapter 17 going home students were in a complete uproar the last week at hogwarts the fact that they were getting out a week early was reason for celebration which meant many dungbombs fireworks and the like filch could be seen giving out detentions for things like looking suspicious or whispering too quietly hardly anybody showed up for their detentions however and there was nothing he could do about it harry and ron had already been presented with two detention slips for laughing suspiciously when they looked at filch and silver was quick to present to them the fact that she hadntgotten one yet see i am good hermione had even received one for looking curiously at filch one day when a lot of dungbombs had been set off near him and he smelt rather bad harry ron and hermione were in the common room playing exploding snap where silver hermione asked suddenly uh said ron concentrating on the game she said she was going down to the owlry like an hour ago didntshe an hour ago hermione and harry echoed in unison they exchanged worried glances let go look for her harry suggested yeah i thinking it takes less than an hour to deliver a letter hermione agreed maybe ron admitted they crawled out of the portrait hole and began to walk towards the owlry no sooner had they turned a corner than they came across a happy looking silver she immediately attempted to hide a bag behind her back hi guys she said innocently what that harry answered suspiciously nothing she said evasively attempting to squeeze past them they stood in her way however and she frowned at them well let see it then ron prompted she reluctantly took the bag out from behind her back how d you get a hogsmeade bag ron asked curiously well it was kinda just handed to me she said doing her best to tell the truth over the counter when you went shopping harry inquired maybe you went to hogsmeade hermione exclaimed silver just really quick she said hurriedly i had to get christmas presents for everybody oh so you got some for us ron asked as if that made it all right yep she replied smiling so will you let me through now no harry answered i dontcare about any dumb presents when you just risked your life no i didn t harry this time i really did go disguised she protested i put a scarf around my face so only my eyes were showing and i wore my dress robes so nobody would know i was from hogwarts how d you find out how to get there harry replied you didntsteal the marauder map did you of course not she replied i just sent a letter to fred and george asking them how to get in ron snorted what a bunch of idiots he commented shaking his head hermione giggled what were they thinking she asked harry scowled they wanted to get her killed he replied i sure they werentthinking of that harry silver said now please move so i can go put your presents away reluctantly harry stepped aside and followed her back to the common room with ron and hermione drop the attitude harry hermione told him she fine yeah but that was a dangerous thing to do not to mention stupid harry answered once silver had disappeared into the girl dorms she probably never had a proper christmas before harry ron told him you cantblame her for wanting to go get presents harry wondered what christmas with death eaters was like i suppose he relented put on a happy face for her harry we re going home tomorrow hermione urged alright alright he grumbled it wasntthat hard to smile when he saw her coming down the stairs her face alight with happiness she sat down on the couch beside him smiling harry i think this is going to be a really good christmas she said wistfully ya think he replied tugging at her hair she grinned at him yes she replied it ll be my first real christmas you know but i ve heard all about what it supposed to be like you put a tree in the house and decorate it and then you put presents underneath it and on christmas morning you open them right i suppose that about sums it up harry answered he wondered if snape was going to actually get a christmas tree somehow he could not imagine him doing so how your occlumency going he asked curiously well okay i suppose snape says i doing really well but i dontknow if i really am she answered he nodded and leaned back in his chair yeah same here he replied the memory of sirius always brought him a fresh wave of grief but also a new wave of determination he was able to withstand it most of the time but it drained the energy completely out of him so that he was nearly unable to move the rest of the day was spent relaxing and in the end packing he was very excited about seeing lupin the following day and found it hard to clear his mind once he had he wasted no time falling asleep the next morning he awoke early and excited he jumped out of bed and woke ron up wassamatter ron mumbled we re going home come on harry replied nearly pushing him out of bed i comin i comin ron answered sleepily harry vaulted down the stairs and into the common room where hermione and silver were already chatting on the couch he sat down next to silver and gave her hair a playful tug you ready for christmas he asked she smiled i think so you very ready he answered grinning breakfast in the great hall was a riot hufflepuff and ravenclaw had a food fight ron was convinced that the slytherins were drinking firewhisky and the gryffindors were the loudest bunch of the lot soon the whole school had taken up the chant ex tra week ex tra week harry managed to steer silver to the exit without getting either of them pelted by scrambled eggs toast bacon or the like she burst out laughing when they arrived in the hallway wow i didntget any food on me he grinned thanks to my expert steering he reminded her they regarded each other silently for a moment then unexpectedly she threw her arms around his neck and enveloped him in a hug he slid his arms around her wondering what had inspired this sudden wave of emotion i really going to miss you harry she murmured i ll miss you too he replied realizing that it was the truth will you come and visit me she asked hopefully course i will he answered she didntrelease or tighten her hold on him she simply stayed right there much to his delight he tugged on her hair and she released him smiling up at him he grinned back down at her and bent down to place a gentle kiss on her lips as he pulled away he looked down at her her eyes stayed closed for a moment but when she opened them they were dancing happily he heard dumbledore calling everyone to order back in the great hall well she said i wontbe taking the train with you he nodded he had expected as much snape would never want to be trapped in a small box with students all around him but i can walk out with you she continued please do he encouraged smiling she walked with him out to the threstral pulled carriages that were ready to take them to the hogwarts express harry noted that snape was keeping a very close eye on them ron and hermione said goodbye to silver and then left the two of them outside the carriage they had chosen bye harry she said as if she werentgoing to see him for a year bye he replied looking down at her and wondering whether to kiss her again or not she put her arms around his neck stood on her tiptoes and placed a sweet although short kiss on his lips answering his question for him he was grinning uncontrollably as he got into the carriage harry ron crowed you should have seen the look on snape face when she kissed you he definitely wasnthappy hermione agreed ah well he ll get over it harry replied he looked from ron to hermione ron had filled him in on their relationship just as harry had filled him in on his and silver s harry thought they made a good couple when they werentbickering of course he figured that arguing was just their way of showing that they liked each other he noted that ron had somehow slipped his hand into hermione without her objecting in the slightest as they boarded the train ron and hermione didntlet go of each other hands and harry caught them sending each other mushy looks he sighed supposing that he would have to watch them the whole train ride in that manner he managed to get ron to participate halfheartedly in a quidditch conversation once they had found an empty compartment but it was obvious that ron was more focused on hermione wow it really beautiful outside isntit hermione commented immediately ron dropped the conversation about quidditch to look out the window and witness the beauty for himself yeah it is he agreed hermione smiled warmly at him and he blushed harry squirmed in his seat it was kind of weird watching his two best friends gush over each other he lay down on his seat and closed his eyes sleep didntcome but he was able to successfully block out most of ron and hermione conversation which had to do with how much they would miss each other he suddenly jumped up at the sound of a familiar snicker echoing through the hallway hermione and ron finally quit their mush having heard it as well just as harry had suspected their compartment door slid open to reveal a smirking draco whom amazingly didntseem to have crabbe and goyle with him although harry was sure they werentfar so potter bet you think you re hot stuff dontyou draco asked uh sure harry answered confused dontbe dense potter she kissed you draco said impatiently oh right that harry said realization passing over his face after a moment he added you came here just to let me know that she kissed me ron sniggered draco sneered at him sarcastically very funny i just wanted to let you know that next time she ll be kissing me harry snorted yeah sure she will harry harry harry draco said in mock thoughtful tones you re forgetting that i have something you don t while you may have a scar on your forehead that not why she kissed me harry exclaimed indignantly sure it isn t draco smirked anyway while you may have a scar on your forehead i have a piece of information that seems to be very valuable to her her father identity shove off malfoy harry told him angrily the day she kisses you is the day crabbe and goyle pass a class ron sniggered again and even hermione giggled draco sneered at them just you wait potter he said just you wait he turned and left and harry mimicked just you wait potter in a high falsetto what a load of hogwash ron said shaking his head harry felt slightly uncomfortable what if draco was right silver did seem to really want to know her father identity harry you dontbelieve him do you hermione asked having been observing him no harry replied in a very unconvincing tone silver wants him to shove off as much as you do harry ron chimed in dontlet him get to you he not getting to me harry replied angrily turning and facing out the window they didntdare argue with him ron and hermione were silent for the rest of the way and harry was thankful for it when the train finally stopped neither of them got up but harry gave them a quick bye and practically ran off the train the first person he saw when he stepped off was lupin he smiled and began to walk toward him but mrs weasley ran forward and enveloped him in a hug how are you dear boy you look so nice where are ron and hermione uh saying goodbye to each other i think harry answered straining to see lupin over her shoulder oh how sweet mrs weasley replied beaming you have a good break now alright okay harry replied as he stepped past her to meet lupin harry lupin greeted as harry walked up to him hi harry replied happily lupin smiled down at him as if he wanted to hug him but not there harry was glad he could only imagine the comments malfoy would make if he saw harry hugging their former professor let go get your luggage lupin suggested harry nodded uh how are we getting home he asked as they walked to a deserted corner how else lupin replied the good old knight bus of course you may be disappointed now that silver isnthere lupin eyes twinkled amusedly and harry blushed lupin raised his wand and in the blink of an eye the purple bus was in front of them hey neville arry whoever you are where your girlfriend stan asked peering hopefully over harry shoulder calm down harry replied dryly she not coming stan looked disappointed as he took their tickets seats that looked somewhat like bus seats on regular muggle buses adorned the first floor it was almost full but harry and lupin managed to find an empty seat hedwig hooted concernedly the knight bus was definitely not her favorite way to travel the bus lurched into motion pressing harry back against his seat and then throwing him forward as the speed settled he reached out and caught himself before he hit the back of the seat in front of him you okay lupin asked as he braced himself with one leg uh i think so harry answered the bus turned and he would have fallen off the end of the seat if lupin hadntgrabbed his arm and yanked him back up thanks he said sheepishly anytime lupin replied smiling after a few stops the bus pulled up in front of grimmauld place harry and lupin gratefully got off wait until you see what we ve done with the house lupin said rather excitedly as he and harry walked up to the front door lupin pushed it open and harry could see the difference the moment he walked in the walls had been painted a pleasant looking tan ish color and they seemed to sparkle the heads that used to line the walls were gone although sirius mother portrait still hung covered up a bit further down most of the furniture had been replaced and the hardwood floor was now cleaned and shiny wow harry said impressed as he saw that the staircase had also been fixed up the stairs were now sporting brand new beige carpet and mahogany wooden railing we ve only done the hallways the staircase the living room and the kitchen lupin explained but when you go back to school we re going to start on the study and all the upstairs rooms it looks great harry said honestly the upstairs was carpeted and the walls had also been painted a sparkly tan all of the pictures that had been upstairs were gone harry opened the door to his and ron room and the change was remarkable the walls were dirty and grayish and the carpet of the floor was black adding to the gloom the beds looked old and worn down and the whole room looked rather gloomy makes a big difference doesntit lupin asked surveying the room distastefully yeah harry replied looking around the room with the same dislike well you must be hungry after your trip lupin said hopefully harry grinned yeah i am he agreed it turned out mrs weasley had made sandwiches for them in the morning and left them on the counter with a freshness charm to wait until they got home so harry lupin said after he swallowed his first mouthful how are things harry told lupin about everything that had happened including draco ron and hermione silver snape and his disturbing dream about draco and silver lupin grinned at his dream well harry at least it was a normal dream and not one about voldemort he said i sure it was just your teenage mind working up a tall tale nothing that would happen in real life yeah well it wasntpleasant harry answered i would almost rather have the voldemort dreams lupin chuckled she that important to you is she harry didntanswer he supposed so which only made him feel worse about the dream do you get lonely here all by yourself harry asked changing the subject well not really lupin replied i have company very often and i at the weasley a lot so when i stay here on weekends it a pretty good relaxation time when i do get lonely i have plenty of people to go visit harry nodded he was glad that lupin wasntbored out of his mind how re you doing in your classes lupin asked gotten an o in potions yet no harry grumbled snape ll never give me an o no matter if i deserve it or not and i know i ve earned it lots of times well a few times at least lupin chuckled well maybe he ll come around by the end of the school year doubt it was harry dubious reply lupin looked highly amused so feel like going shopping for a christmas tree this week lupin asked harry grinned i d like that he answered good lupin said i was thinking maybe we d go on sunday or monday what about tomorrow harry asked we have plans tomorrow lupin replied they re having an open market at hogsmeade at harry blank look he quickly explained it where people are free to market anything they want on the streets of hogsmeade from food to magical creatures they breed there are stands and booths set up everywhere it really very interesting sounds fun harry replied yes but you do have to be careful around the magical creatures i once picked up a friendly looking kitten who proceeded to breathe fire on me the breeder said it was what it was supposed to do and i must say i lost interest in cats completely afterwards harry laughed i ll be careful around the cats he promised teasingly lupin laughed good he replied um do you think we could invite silver with us tomorrow harry asked she wanted me to visit her already taken care of harry lupin replied snape and i have been in touch as of late and they will both be joining us tomorrow both of them harry groaned be nice to snape harry lupin warned he already promised to be nice to you yeah that probably means he ll refrain from punching me when i look at silver harry answered sarcastically lupin laughed harry i know it doesntseem like it to you or really to me but dumbledore is convinced that snape is changing and i trust dumbledore yeah me too harry said but he can be wrong sometimes yes he can lupin agreed but i dontthink he is in this case do you have any reason to believe so guess not harry replied he still shoots me death looks all the time though yes well i afraid that cantbe helped seeing as you bear such an uncanny resemblance to james lupin answered his eyes sparkling with pride but he has been a bit more decent to you hasnthe i suppose harry sighed it just hard to be nice to him when he looks at me like he wants me dead you know lupin chuckled i know harry he said just remember that silver loves him and she would want you to be decent to him at the very least yeah harry responded i ll try good then lupin answered they sat in silence for a while harry aware of lupin stare the whole time harry lupin said at last i very proud of you harry glanced up in surprise very proud lupin repeated why harry asked wondering if he had done anything particularly good lately well it a bit complicated i not sure if i could explain it lupin answered i just wanted you to know that i proud well thanks harry replied feeling special for no particular reason there was another comfortable silence but lupin broke it once more come see what we ve done with the living room harry harry followed lupin into the living room the change was astounding the fireplace gleamed it bricks no longer covered in soot and grime the walls were the sparkly tan of the hallways and the kitchen and the floor was the beige carpet that lined the stairs the old tattered couches and armchairs had been replaced with comfortable looking ones that were a deep shade of brown there were a few of the old pictures on the walls but also newer ones which included a waterfall in which a unicorn was currently drinking out of the small pond at the bottom and a picture of a peaceful old farmhouse i like the new pictures harry commented watching as the horses in the pasture of the farm began to gallop around causing the cows to look up in surprise me too lupin said they re really very interesting new animals walk into the waterfall one all the time and occasionally the farmer comes out of the house to feed the animals harry watched as the unicorn pranced out of the waterfall picture and the horses returned to grazing in the farmhouse one he felt he could watch either of them for a very long time and not get bored in the least so harry lupin said suddenly i never really got to say hi well i did but harry turned and grinned at lupin and accepted the hug he felt he had been deserving since they arrived home lupin tousled his hair as he released him you re something harry he informed him yes you are harry smiled he liked how lupin could make him feel special for no reason at all he liked the fact that grimmauld place was starting to feel more his his and lupin s he felt very content and happy for no reason other than these exactly the way sirius would have wanted it to be disclaimer i do not own or claim to own any of j k rowling characters places or items chapter 18 open market harry woke up to a soft knock on his door he grunted as he rolled over sleepily up harry lupin called harry fumbled for his glasses and opened his eyes as he slipped them on he heard lupin retreating footsteps he sat up in bed and his tiredness melted away he got dressed and opened the door to be surprised once more at the changes that had been made in the old house it was like walking out into a completely different house he ambled downstairs feeling very hungry lupin was standing over the stove when he walked in uh are you cooking harry asked trying to conceal his amusement just whoops eggs lupin replied a small explosion issued from the frying pan and harry saw a lump of burnt eggs within it he snorted i not eating it he declared i insulted lupin replied in a mock hurt tone as he dumped the eggs into the trash can yeah well get over it harry teased back lupin grinned looks like we re going to have cereal he informed him let see what molly left us lupin rummaged through the cabinets let see we have urg no not that it definitely been in here too long or no that looks pretty old too harry laughed corn flakes lupin exclaimed triumphantly holding up a box they re frosted sounds good to me harry answered after they had finished with breakfast lupin told him much to his disappointment that they would be traveling by floo powder harry would almost rather have taken the knight bus alright you first lupin directed holding out a pot of floo powder for him harry took a bit and threw it into the fire he stepped into the green flames and said clearly hogsmeade he began to spin around at an undesirably fast rate and finally was deposited in zonko s he grabbed onto a nearby shelf to help keep his balance and nearly knocked it and it contents over whoops he said apologetically with a glance at the shop owner who was glaring at him from the counter after a few seconds lupin arrived stepping out of the fireplace much more gracefully than harry had although he was a bit wobbly for a second afterwards right then lupin said a bit dazedly we re meeting them by the shrieking shack he and harry walked out of the store and harry found himself surrounded by what looked like a carnival or a festival of some sort millions of booths lined the streets and quite a few people milled past them come on harry lupin beckoned from a few steps away harry hurriedly caught up with him and they made their way towards the shrieking shack the crowd dimmed as they got closer and closer and as they walked through the small path that led to the clearing in front of the shrieking shack the crowd vanished completely soon harry caught sight of snape and silver silver was leaning against the railing that separated the shrieking shack from the rest of hogsmeade with her back to them and he heard her voice although he could not make out what she was saying snape was leaning the other way against the rail but he hadntseen them he looked both menacing and harmless at the same time something only snape could achieve harry watched as he said something back to silver that he could not make out then he saw them he practically launched himself off the rail as if embarrassed to be caught in such a vulnerable position silver turned to look at him questioningly and then followed his gaze to them she turned around beaming at them harry grinned back at her snape glared at him suspiciously hello silver severus lupin greeted as they neared hello silver replied happily hi snape grumbled well it already a bit crowded lupin said turning back towards hogsmeade but not nearly as bad as it will be later today snape nodded curtly and began to walk with lupin toward the festival silver fell into step beside harry a bit behind the adults you didntsay hi to me she chided yeah well snape nearly bit my head off for looking at you harry mumbled hoping snape couldnthear him no he didn t give him a chance she coaxed i ve known him for six years you think he hasnthad chances he asked she giggled well another one then she urged he smiled for you he relented they arrived in a slightly more crowded hogsmeade and lupin became interested in one of the first booths the owner declared that he had made a fruit that was half grape half strawberry it looked like a purple strawberry to harry lupin harry and silver each sampled one to find that they were quite good it actually did taste like both a grape and a strawberry which was odd but pleasant snape looked disbelieving of the whole thing after a while of sampling different foods all which were very bizarre they stopped in the middle of the road well where to next lupin asked brightly snape looked as if he would like nothing more than to go home hey look there a cross between a tomato and an avocado harry exclaimed lupin wrinkled his nose i hate tomato he answered well then silver and i will harry began but he was interrupted ooh silver exclaimed and she promptly began to walk towards one of the stations the three exchanged glances and then hurried after her she had picked up something from a cage and she turned to them with a misty eyed look isnthe adorable she asked harry did a double take at the creature in her arms it was a baby hippogriff roughly the size of a golden retriever puppy and black in color uh sure adorable he said watching as the tiny creature squeaked in excitement when she rubbed his forehead actually more like bizarre he thought to himself behind her the other babies ran up to the cage and began squeaking jumping up and down and fluttering their wings they want to be held she said handing the one she was holding to lupin lupin looked surprised and as he patted his awkwardly on the head it squeaked and cuddled up to him silver handed another one to harry and yet another to a disgusted looking snape harry began to lick him which he was not sure he liked and snape began squealing in protest as snape held it at arm length glaring at it silver looked over and smiled at the sight no she told snape you have to hold him like this she managed to bend snape arms into a suitable holding position and his hippogriff cuddled up to him happily as he glared at it the keeper of the hippogriffs who introduced himself as davie was tending to a feisty looking one who kept swiping at him with his beak it feathers were a metallic silver and it body was dark gray with a black tail it hooves were a very shiny black and it stomped them impatiently as it continued trying to bite davie silver was absolutely taken by it i love her she exclaimed the baby looked over as if she had heard silver and then pranced up to her silver held out her arms and it jumped into them now watch it davie exclaimed looking concerned that one bites claws kicks you name it she does it but she wontdo it now silver insisted petting the now docile baby in her arms finally she turned to look at snape with a pleading look in her eye no snape said firmly but she so sweet silver persisted that a right match too i d say davie informed snape that little one has tried to destroy everyone else who wanted to touch her cept me and i suspect that cause i feed her no snape said handing his palomino hippogriff back to davie come on now harry and lupin handed theirs back as well but silver was reluctant to surrender hers please she pleaded with snape i ll take really really good care of her do you have any idea how big those things get snape answered annoyed yes but she chose me silver insisted give it back snape told her firmly silver eyes were dangerously bright as she handed the hippogriff to davie once it was out of silver arms it began to squeal loudly in protest biting kicking and scratching at a wincing davie they began to walk away when silver stopped listening to the hippogriff near screams she wants me she told snape desperately i cantleave her you will snape answered firmly putting a hand on her back and steering her away silver eyes were still bright as they walked away the hippogriff calls didntcease instead harry could swear they got louder you all go in there and get an ice cream snape told them once the calls had faded away pointing to a pleasant looking shop i have to go get some potions supplies he disappeared and they went up and ordered ice cream lupin treat silver moodily stabbed at hers taking a small bite and putting it in her mouth and then playing with the rest in her bowl harry and lupin exchanged glances silver lupin said sensibly hippogriffs are a lot of work especially babies i know she said sadly but she needed me somebody will take her and give her a good home lupin told her so you just cheer up and start enjoying yourself and your ice cream silver gave him a smile alright she agreed as she began to truly eat her cup snape returned with nothing in his hands couldntfind the supplies lupin asked curiously what oh no they were out of stock snape said quickly really must ve been pretty rare for them to be out lupin commented oh yes very rare snape agreed taking a seat beside silver want some ice cream severus my treat lupin offered no thanks snape answered harry was surprised that snape had made such a polite reply when they walked back out into hogsmeade the crowd was considerably thicker it was hard to take a few steps without bumping into someone and as a result a lot of whoops could be heard they looked at a few more booths before the crowd became too thick let go back to the shrieking shack lupin yelled amidst the noise snape nodded and they began to fight their way through the crowd back silver looked pointedly ahead when they passed the hippogriff cage but the silver one who had been trying to kick down the cage saw her and began squealing excitedly silver blinked hard and continued through it didnttake long to lose the sound of the hippogriff calls this time thanks to the thick crowd but harry was sure that it hadntstopped calling when they finally reached the shrieking shack silver looked very upset the baby will be fine lupin reassured her dontworry she nodded but didntlook convinced snape looked exasperated but he didntsay anything to her come severus lupin beckoned let talk snape grudgingly followed lupin a distance away harry joined silver who was leaning against the rail like before you okay he asked yes she said i just really felt connected to that one i suppose lupin right though i probably couldntproperly care for a hippogriff harry agreed with her but didntwant to say anything he felt the need for a change of subject how snape house harry asked interestedly big she replied i ve nearly gotten lost once already harry chuckled he rich isnthe i suppose she answered both of them were thinking back to what they had seen in snape vault the pictures in his house talk she commented they dontlike me but he says it because they donttrust me yet weird harry answered trying to imagine suspicious pictures and annoying they start whispering to each other whenever i walk into a room and they accuse me of trying to steal things she answered harry laughed sounds interesting a bit she replied he looked down at her she was looking at the shrieking shack with curiosity you know that an interesting place she said quietly if it could talk i bet it would tell us about the days of the marauders you know about the marauders harry asked oh yes whenever remus was on duty with me he told me all about them she replied oh was harry response he felt a presence behind him and turned around to see lupin looking at him we should be going harry he said alright harry said turning to silver bye bye harry she replied looking as if she wanted to hug him but didntdare do it whilst snape was watching he and lupin traveled back to zonko in relative silence when they passed the hippogriff cage the silver one took no notice of them it was attempting to fly but couldntmanage it with it baby wings and as a result looked very annoyed it quite a character that one lupin commented looking at the silver bundle of energy yeah harry said i think it would suit silver though no doubt you re right lupin agreed but there nothing we can do about it unless we bought it for her harry prompted lupin looked down at him thoughtfully i not sure snape would like it he said finally but snape wouldnthave to take care of it harry protested well let just go see how much it costs lupin said reluctantly they walked over to davie oy lupin called how much are they going for depends on which one you re interested in davie replied that one there lupin answered pointing to the silver one sorry mate that one taken davie replied now this red one here he looks like he would suit you no thanks lupin said quickly we re not interested in any other one davie looked disappointed alright well have a good day then he said lupin and harry resumed their walk to zonko s well it not so bad is it lupin asked somebody going to give that little one a good home i suppose harry answered disappointedly they arrived at zonko s and harry went first once more this time he fell upon landing in the black house fireplace but quickly got up before lupin came well lupin commented as they brushed soot off of themselves that was fun wasntit yeah harry agreed it was i had no idea people could mix up so many foods lupin laughed yeah it pretty amazing he agreed harry took off his glasses and wiped them on his shirt they were so dirty he could hardly see out of them so we re going to visit silver and snape again on wednesday lupin informed him at snape house harry asked yep lupin answered silver says it big harry commented oh the snape mansion is very big lupin agreed his father was very rich what happened to his father harry inquired lupin looked a bit sad as he replied he at st mungo for insanity issues he wants to beat every human being he lays eyes on right now he locked up in solitary confinement and they have to feed him his meals through a cat flap wow harry said softly yeah unfortunately snape had to suffer through his father condition for many years until it got to the point that he was violent outside of the house as well lupin said messed him up for life it did but you ve seen that so that why snape is so well snape ish harry asked no other reason for it harry lupin replied could ve been a fine kid he could have but he was just pushed too far the dark side was the only place that accepted him lupin eyes were clouded over with some unreadable emotion for the first time harry felt sympathy for snape so why isntsilver you know like him harry asked finally well dumbledore looked after her ever since he began to tutor her and that helped her a bit i suspect but that girl is just special to begin with never seen so much determination in a person before never it what kept her from getting the dark mark it is harry agreed silver did prove herself to be unreasonably stubborn often he wondered how many would have been able to resist the urgings and punishments of death eaters for as long as she did it a good thing we got her when we did though lupin added suddenly because she couldnthave stood it for much longer was just at the breaking point when we got her harry wondered what would have become of silver if they hadntgotten her would she have turned to the dark side as well why didntyou get silver sooner if you knew about what her mom did he asked well dumbledore knew from the get go but he wouldnttake her until she admitted it she was too proud too stubborn to admit what happened to her dumbledore saw right through her though that man sees through everybody yeah he does harry agreed she knows when she needs help though lupin said not until she desperately needs it but the important thing is that she recognizes it she came to him and he rescued her right away didnthesitate one moment harry knew that there was no way dumbledore would have left her in that house even a second after she told him he felt a new appreciation for dumbledore lupin sat on the couch and stretched back gazing at the picture of the waterfall intently look at the picture harry he said finally harry looked over at the picture and saw a beautiful silver hippogriff not unlike the baby silver had been so in love with it was fully grown however and drinking out of the pond every so often pausing to look up suddenly a girl walked into the picture harry couldntsee her face but he saw beautiful dark reddish brown hair and a familiar slim figure and he had a feeling he knew who it was she walked up to the hippogriff patted it and climbed onto it back the two took off soaring up into the air and out of the picture lupin and harry looked at it for a long while more before turning to look at each other it was silver harry said indeed lupin replied they turned to look at the picture again i had a feeling that picture was special lupin commented finally do you think it the future harry asked maybe lupin answered carefully or maybe it just shows things that could happen depending on the choices we make harry nodded and the two studied the picture for a while longer a group of centaurs wandered in and splashed through the pond but nothing else of interest happened harry turned behind them to look at the picture of the farmhouse one horse was trotting around the pasture looking very lively while the rest were grazing the cows were grazing as well and it seemed a breeze was blowing that made the door to the farmhouse open and close periodically harry had a feeling that had there been sound the door would have creaked suddenly their fire turned green and mr weasley head appeared in it harry remus mr weasley exclaimed happily just where i wanted to find you lupin grinned hello arthur he greeted molly and the children were wondering if you two wanted to join us for picking out a christmas tree tomorrow mr weasley said i think we d like that lupin replied turning to harry would we harry yep harry replied happily good then mr weasley said looking very happy indeed come to our house around eleven tomorrow and molly will make lunch before we set off will do arthur lupin agreed right then see you tomorrow mr weasley replied harry and lupin echoed him and he disappeared both of them turned to look at the waterfall picture suddenly as if something important had happened while they werentlooking the picture remained empty however with no sign of a silver hippogriff or a girl harry couldnthelp but wonder what exactly the picture had been trying to tell them disclaimer i do not own or claim to own any of j k rowling charcters places or items comments alright i did it i put silver point of view in i thought it would help to understand her character a bit better but if it didn t oh well consider it a mystery lol anyhow enjoy review chapter 20 the torch part 1 silver point of view silver heard a small thump and inwardly groaned it was too early in the morning to be woken up she opened her eyes prepared to scold esperanza but she froze as she saw what had woken her up snape was in the room his back to her looking intently through all the potions books that lined the bookshelf of the room she was staying in she didntmove a muscle for some reason not wanting him to know she was awake good morning he greeted a hint of sarcasm in his voice she frowned how did he always do that he seemed to know at any given time exactly what she was thinking and feeling she supposed it came from being an occlumens morning she replied sleep well he asked trying to sound as if it were some offhand question she grinned even if he could read her mind he certainly didntsucceed when he attempted to act as if she werentimportant to him yes she replied no nightmares she watched as his figure relaxed visibly his hand suddenly shot out toward a navy colored book he turned as he pulled it out and she saw satisfaction in his eyes as he looked at it she knew it wouldntbe long before he looked up at her and waited a bit eagerly sure enough his eyes traveled to hers and she beamed at him although he tried to mask it she could see that he clearly cared for her it was something she was not used to seeing in anybody eyes first thing in the morning or any time of day for that matter and it was definitely something she could get used to after a moment he turned shaking his head and left the room shutting the door behind him she wished he wouldnthave left but then she knew he couldnthandle being open for very long esperanza she called to her owl who was soundly sleeping at the foot of her bed perched on the footboard the owl opened it eyes and hooted sleepily oh come on it a perfectly beautiful morning you know you want to stretch your wings she coaxed as she stepped down onto the hardwood floor it felt cold against her bare feet and she quickly rummaged through her things until she found some socks esperanza stubbornly attempted to go back to sleep as she showered and dressed in the bathroom that was joined to her room she ran a comb through her wet hair and left it to dry she wasntgoing for anything particularly fancy that morning come on esp you need to get up she urged as she made her bed esperanza immediately woke up from his feigned sleep and hooted indignantly i can call you whatever i want she said especially if it wakes you up esp she grinned as her owl defiantly turned it back to her alright i sorry esperanza she apologized i just wanted to get you up she pulled the small bundle into her arms and he snuggled with her contentedly she carried him to the window and opened it he gave an excited hoot i told you it was pretty out she said gazing out at the mansion backyard which was terribly overgrown but overwhelmingly beautiful at the same time her owl flew out the window and she felt a bit lonesome she sighed and walked over to her bedstand where she picked up her locket and clasped it around her neck she opened the door and sighed as she tried to remember where to go turn right she directed herself and now left and then another left and then right or was it three lefts in a row she heard whispers and looked up to see two very old men in a portrait looking pointedly at her could you tell me how to get downstairs from here she asked meekly and why would you want to do that asked one of them who was terribly wrinkly well because i hungry and the kitchen is downstairs she explained oh you think so do you asked the other she nodded she thinks so the wrinkly one scoffed to the other she sighed please wontyou tell me she pleaded under no circumstances do we give directions to the enemy the smoother skinned one yelled down at her no circumstances the wrinkly one echoed oh shut your trap you blasted idiots came a very welcome voice from behind her she turned to see snape walking up looking at the two portrait men in rather a frightful way immediately the two men straightened up and saluted him as you say captain the wrinkly one said at once we will not argue with orders sir the other one added snape rolled his eyes and turned to her the menace suddenly gone hungry are you he asked as he swept in front of her showing her the way okay so it three lefts in a row silver thought and then another right and there the staircase yes she admitted as she followed him downstairs you let the owl out he asked she smiled she hadntlet esperanza out her first day there and he had soared out of her room his hoots echoing through the halls and refused to be caught for an hour of course she said innocently she couldntsee him but she knew that he was grinning when they arrived in the dining room breakfast was on the table still giving off steam snape stood for a moment by his chair trying to look as if he wasntexpecting anything she smiled as she walked up and wrapped her arms around him he hugged her back only halfheartedly and she glanced around to see who was watching only a house elf she didntsigh outwardly but she felt a bit saddened as she dropped into her chair was he really too embarrassed to hug her in front of a silly house elf it not like the stupid elf was going to go out and announce it to the world she met his eye as she looked up and saw his silent apology she smiled at him reassuringly and began to eat her breakfast truthfully she missed her friends and the others in the order whom she had befriended while they were there on guard duty she knew that she loved snape but it was so hard to get him to show the affection she knew he felt for her she thrived on positive attention she had ever since she had learned that it existed true when dumbledore had come to tutor her she had suspected he might be a bit friendly but she had thought that he was merely a light wizard someone whose job was to defeat death eaters when she had learned that he actually cared about her well being she had been both astounded and suspicious but as time went on and he continued to mentor her she found herself unwillingly opening herself up more and more and discovering that it was a relief to do so anyone who dumbledore told her she could trust she did with the exception of most women she blamed her mother for her prejudice against the female population but with the exception of some younger girls she simply didnttrust them when snape had first come to guard duty he had intimidated her greatly until he randomly informed her that he too was a victim of abuse ever since then she had been able to ask him questions she couldntask anyone else questions only he would understand but it was a bit trying sometimes when he refused to surrender his public image as cold hearted even to his house elves for heaven sake what re you thinking about he grunted from across the table eyeing her curiously you she answered innocently and honestly hmph he replied trying not to look pleased she smiled as she cleared her plate of her eggs sometimes it was amusing to watch his reactions to her open show of affection harry coming over tomorrow right she asked suddenly as she remembered that it was tuesday he gave her a glare which could only mean yes oh come on he not so bad she protested potter is an arrogant selfish he began hotly i think you re thinking of the wrong potter she interrupted coolly we re talking about harry not james one of these days you re going to have to admit that harry is a perfectly nice person no i not he answered stubbornly she smiled triumphantly and it took him a moment to figure out why i mean no he not he corrected himself you re supposed to be the cunning one remember she teased head of house for slytherin funny he told her dryly very she giggled as she finished her breakfast he finished his as well and got up to walk away you re leaving she asked disappointedly sagging in her chair he turned to look at her with a mixture of amusement and annoyance dontget so excited child i never said you couldntcome she beamed at him as she jumped out of her seat and bounded to his side has anyone ever told you you re too emotional he asked curiously as she followed him to his study no she answered worriedly am i he merely shook his head harry point of view back to normal harry awoke to the sound of a large bang his room shook as if a small bomb had gone off downstairs he quickly grabbed his glasses and hurried downstairs he walked into the kitchen and suppressed a laugh with great difficulty lupin was pouring water over a frying pan that was on fire you really should give it up he told lupin lupin glared at him fine if you like having frosted flakes every morning well not really but honestly cooking isntyour thing harry said lupin frowned down at the frying pan in front of him which was now giving off thick gray steam you could just get a girlfriend harry suggested lupin glared at him again much to his amusement just a suggestion he said defensively lupin shook his head and got out two bowls a box of cereal and milk harry grinned as he poured himself some cereal they had no sooner sat down for breakfast when they heard tonks voice from their living room remus harry hello they exchanged glances and walked into the living room to see tonks head in their fireplace their christmas tree began to shake all over at the sight of them nearly bouncing out of it pot hi she greeted them harry smiled his hello and lupin gave a rather feeble hi anyhow remus moody got some very valuable information on you know who voldemort harry interrupted causing tonks to take in a huge mouthful of ash stop saying you know who it stupid tonks merely looked at him in amazement while lupin chuckled anyway she continued moody says he not a very happy camper now that he has no clue of harry or silver whereabouts and there a good possibility he going to summon severus so we wanted to make sure in advance that you d be ready to take silver if that should happen harry had a feeling that if voldemort summoned snape chances wouldntbe high on snape having a very good christmas sure i would lupin replied has she been told the news yet silver tonks asked no according to severus she d go emotional if he told her so he just going to wait it out lupin frowned i dontknow if it such a good idea to shock her when and if the news comes harry could tell from the way tonks head bobbled that she had shrugged maybe he ll tell her she replied dumbledore says it up to him say what up with your tree their tree was still trying frantically to get their attention it s erm friendly lupin replied looking at the shaking tree skeptically morning tree harry greeted it quivered excitedly and then stood still tonks laughed leave it to you two to get a tree with a personality she teased lupin smiled and looked about to say something when tonks began to look worried shoot she muttered they re here there was a small pop and her head disappeared lupin and harry exchanged glances who there harry asked death eaters would be my guess lupin answered they re extremely intent on finding silver there has to be something she knows that she hasnttold dumbledore yet voldemort too panicky about her being gone harry frowned why wouldntsilver tell dumbledore something so important come on let finish our breakfast lupin said i sure tonks will come back to let us know that she fine in a little while harry reluctantly followed him so are we doing anything exciting today he questioned depends on if you call sitting around the house exciting lupin replied i have to go over some things in the study before we clean it out so you have free reign in the house today alright harry said i suppose if i get lonely the tree will keep me company lupin laughed suppose so he said and you re welcome to use the floo powder to talk to your friends as long as it only your head harry didntfancy the idea of kneeling down on the hard fireplace with his head in the fire just to talk to his friends uh i think i ll just entertain myself around here he replied lupin smiled good then you know sirius mentioned something about secrets in this house a few times i bet they re worth finding harry grinned he fully intended to find them i ll look he assured lupin lupin nodded and stood up as he finished his breakfast well i ll be in the study if you need me he said harry nodded and wondered what to do first look for secrets there really wasntmuch else but where to start and what to look for he wandered upstairs to sirius room the pictures of him waved at him and his broomstick picture did a very accurate impression of catching the snitch although there wasnta snitch in sight his mother blew him kisses from her picture and his father waved at him and then ran his hand through his hair much in the same way harry did sirius grinned at him and winked as he always did harry smiled and began to search the walls for loose boards he stepped into the closet and pressed against all the boards nothing happened frowning harry reached up to run his hand through his hair and as he did he hit a clothes hanger the floor underneath him moved he glanced upwards in surprise and turned the hanger sideways nothing happened he gave it a tug and the floor began to move again he stepped off of the bit of moving floor and pulled hard on the hanger four of the floorboards began to slide back and finally they clicked in place revealing a long dark stairway i wonder if i should go down there without telling lupin harry thought looking down at the forbidding looking tunnel wait a second am i scared definitely not with that in his head he began to walk down the staircase wishing that he was of age so that he could light the tip of his wand it felt very damp as he walked down and he briefly wondered if he was walking down into a well the little light that had penetrated the first few stairs faded away as the staircase spiraled and harry was left to feel his way down suddenly his hand hit something on the wall tentatively he felt it could it be a torch um i cantuse magic because i not of age he explained to the maybe torch so could you just light up for me at first nothing happened but suddenly the hallway burst into light the torch lit up but instead of fire at the top it held a small ball of bright white light thanks harry said wondering why he had been talking to non human objects lately as he took the torch and continued to head down finally he came to a circular opening the staircase that he had just come down was to his back but there were many more going back up surrounding him suddenly he heard two women voices i know that old fool dumbledore has something to do with it one of them was saying i dontdoubt it the old fool made his first mistake protecting that potter boy and now he making another well we ll find her for certain the other one said confidently how far can a fifteen year old get with the help of a feeble old man the first one began to laugh and harry mind reeled where had he heard that second voice before suddenly the laughing ceased is that a light the familiar voice asked harry looked at the brightly shining torch beside him and began to feel dread bubbling in his stomach disclaimer i do not own or claim to own any of j k rowlings things so dontsue chapter 21 the torch part 2 harry stared at the torch for a moment listening to the quickened footsteps headed his way he had no idea how to turn it off he didnteven know how he had turned it on off he hissed turn off if anything it seemed to shine more brightly please torch just go off please harry begged it shut off plunging him into darkness except for a faint light that was growing brighter coming from the bottom of one of the other staircases he frantically backpedaled up the staircase he had come and once the spiraling staircase had turned a corner he stopped breathless and stayed as still as he could there no light the first one was saying narcissa listen i saw a light the other one replied narcissa harry thought draco mom he frowned okay so one of them was narcissa but who was that other one that achingly familiar voice oh hogwash who would be down here and anyway only our kind know about these passageways narcissa replied i suppose the other one replied dubiously harry was thinking so hard his head hurt whose voice was it why was it so familiar so what did we come down here for anyway narcissa demanded it the only place nobody will hear us the other voice replied let get to the point we need to find her the dark lord grows impatient and he will have our heads if we donthave the dratted girl the next time we are summoned ha narcissa replied her strange laugh echoing i doubt it he got bigger fish to fry he lost track of potter the other woman snorted how can he lose track of him in hogwarts that just it he not there anymore he must have gone somewhere for christmas and he not at his friend houses or his relatives narcissa informed her he probably pining away for sirius somewhere the voice said tauntingly harry felt a rush of anger both at how she said sirius name and how he could not for the life of him figure out who she was he considered peeking around the corner but his stomach churned in protest when he thought of what they would probably do if they saw him there take him straight to voldemort no doubt well whatever he doing he doing a good job of hiding narcissa said sounding rather annoyed harry grinned little did she know that he was right around the corner at that very moment i bet snape going to be in for it the other one said sounding mildly disappointed no doubt sometimes i wonder about him he seems like a smart fellow but how dense can he be to have just let potter slip through his fingers like that well it not like he can just abduct potter at any random moment the dark lord needs him at hogwarts to keep up to date on dumbledore plans as well the other one informed narcissa in a know it all voice i guess narcissa agreed harry began to silently backpedal up the stairs the two women conversation faded out and his own thoughts consumed him who had the second woman been why should snape be in trouble for the fact that he disappeared it wasntas if snape could know what was happening if dumbledore didntwant him to know voldemort had to realize that and this girl they were talking about he was certain it was silver he bumped his head on the ceiling or rather the floor and fumbled to find a knob or a handle anything to open it with the torch was still in his hand and almost as if he had summoned it light a faint glowing emitted from the tip he spotted a small handle and yanked hard it creaked softly as it opened he emerged into sirius closet feeling both relieved and annoyed wondering if the two women had heard the creak he shut the floorboards and dragged a trunk over from the corner to sit on top of it the words of the mysterious yet familiar second woman echoed in his head he probably pining away for sirius somewhere then it hit him he gave a half yelp half gasp as he realized that he had just been listening to a conversation between narcissa malfoy and bellatrix lestrange still clutching the torch he stumbled out of the room and down the stairs he entered the study wordlessly and sat down in front of lupin lupin looked up with a smile but it faded when he saw harry face harry what happened he asked quickly lestrange he croaked waves of hatred pouring over him what about her lupin asked confused is this about sirius harry shook his head i found a passageway he said his voice sounding hollow to him and then lestrange i should have killed her a passageway lupin echoed confusedly harry took a deep breath and gathered his thoughts together then he proceeded to explain to lupin what had happened he repeated narcissa and lestrange conversation word for word and then waited lupin looked positively stunned harry suddenly stood up and made for the door hatred had overcome him and he felt a reckless urge to go and shout at lestrange for a while harry lupin said sharply where are you going i going to kill lestrange he said simply want to help you re not going to kill anybody lupin told him yanking him back down into his chair you are not going to go down that passageway again what is that harry followed lupin gaze down to the torch in his hand it was a deep brown and the shape of a small but long ice cream cone it glinted in the light and managed to look dangerously beautiful a torch he said it lit up and went out when i asked it to he turned it over in his hands thinking but not speaking of how it had given off the perfect amount of light to help him find the small handle on the bottom of the trap door light it up lupin told him harry looked at the torch light he tried nothing happened please light he tried hopefully same response he concentrated very hard i need light he thought staring at the torch i need light a small ball of bright white light suddenly came from the bigger end it seemed to rest just above the surface put it out lupin commanded harry concentrated again staring at the torch intently go out he whispered immediately the light vanished he looked up at lupin who was studying the torch intently may i try lupin asked harry almost said no he felt suddenly as if the torch belonged to him as if nobody else should be able to even touch it he held it out to lupin and forced his fingers to let go when lupin reached for it light lupin commanded the torch did nothing lupin squinted his eyes in concentration and even closed them for a moment still nothing light lupin ordered again concentrating so hard harry thought he would break it with his grip the torch didnteven give off a flicker of light light harry told it a bright ball of white light seemed to burst from within it making lupin jump and drop it instead of falling it sailed straight into harry hand harry surveyed the torch for a moment i think it likes me he finally commented lupin looked a bit put out harry found that he could adjust the brightness not so bright he thought i dontneed so much just a bit like in the passageway immediately the ball of light shrunk so that it was smaller than a marble more harry thought brighter the ball expanded so that it was bigger than the torch causing harry and lupin to shut their eyes out harry yelled out the light vanished harry thought he might have been blinded by the excruciating force of the light but after blinking a few times things almost looked normal ouch lupin commented rubbing his eyes can i keep it harry replied smiling at the torch lupin grinned well i not sure what it is so we ll have to show it to dumbledore i going to go see if we can go visit him now promise not to try and kill lestrange while i gone yeah harry replied i ll come with you they walked into the living room harry experimenting with the torch the entire time lupin threw some floo powder into the fire and stuck his head in leaving harry to play with the torch in his halfway absence lupin knelt in the fire for a long time while harry discovered that he could make it blink or bounce up and down on the torch finally lupin emerged come now harry he wants to see it immediately lupin said harry nodded and threw some floo powder into the fire wondering why lupin and dumbledore were getting so worked up about a little torch sure it was cool but wasnthis meet up with narcissa and lestrange more important he stepped into the fire and said clearly dumbledore office he clung tightly to the torch as he spun around and finally got spit out in dumbledore office he would have landed on his feet had he not tripped over a chair ah harry so nice to see you dumbledore greeted as harry struggled to his feet lupin arrived soon afterwards and took a seat next to harry he and dumbledore exchanged significant glances and then dumbledore turned to harry who held the torch up figuring it was what dumbledore wanted to see and there it is dumbledore commented squinting at the torch will you demonstrate what you can do with it for me harry harry turned it on so that it was of medium brightness and made the ball of light bounce up and down blink grow extremely bright and then vanish he then made it appear at the size of a marble and roll around on the surface of the torch very interesting dumbledore said as harry stopped yes and you are doing all this with mindpower harry nodded would you mind giving me a turn dumbledore asked politely harry felt the same reluctance he had with lupin but he surrendered it to dumbledore all the same dumbledore stared intently at the torch for some time and harry didntknow if he was trying to make it work or simply thinking about it interesting dumbledore said but i think that with just the right amount of force dumbledore pointed his wand at it and a small ball of light appeared dumbledore wand quivered and his face was etched with concentration as he forced the ball to grow bigger and bigger however it simply refused to grow past the size of a tennis ball dumbledore put his wand down and the light vanished well well that was a very stubborn torch he commented as he handed it back to harry i do believe it wants to be yours harry and who are we to stop it harry grinned he felt as if dumbledore had just told him he could keep a friend now harry tell me about your encounter with bellatrix and narcissa dumbledore requested harry repeated almost word for word what he had told lupin absently playing with the light on the torch as he did so when he finished dumbledore didntsay anything for a while then he sighed and sat down and harry realized that dumbledore was very old it seems we are fighting quite a battle dumbledore said at last i simply wish that miss riddle would tell me whatever she is hiding so that we may proceed with our plans why dontyou ask her to harry asked he was sure silver would tell dumbledore if she was asked wouldntshe no harry i afraid that would be an unwise course of action dumbledore replied harry looked at him questioningly you see miss riddle is very sensitive to what she perceives as forcefulness and she is very stubborn if she thought that i for any reason was trying to force information out of her she would take that information with her to the grave no she must come to me and i trust that she will eventually and hopefully before it is too late harry was silent he knew that silver would eventually come to dumbledore but he didntknow when the night before voldemort was planning something terrible when it would be too late to stop him did she realize the seriousness of the situation she must he thought she ll tell him before it too late however he wasntquite sure if he believed himself harry dumbledore commented i have an idea of what that torch is if i am correct you may have yourself an extremely valuable weapon i would suggest that you keep it with you at all times and do not let anybody else know that you have it harry nodded looking at the torch with newfound respect he supposed that if he made it shine brightly enough he could blind his enemies with it are you two hungry dumbledore asked suddenly harry stomach grumbled um yeah he said a bit sheepishly yes lupin agreed dumbledore smiled picked up his bell and rang it three times harry wondered how the elves knew when to bring what kind of food soon enough three house elves appeared and one of them gave an excited squeal harry potter dobby exclaimed running over and pushing a plate into his hands hi dobby harry said looking down at the overdressed elf with amusement dobby was wearing two huge scarves a badly knit orange and green sweater that harry supposed he had made himself and what looked like five pairs of soccer shorts which were really very baggy pants for dobby on his feet he sported one red and sparkly sock and on the other an old looking black one he also had two hats on his head dobby has wanted to see harry potter for a very long time sir dobby squeaked a very long time but harry potter has come to dobby at this dobby seized harry leg and squeezed it so hard harry thought it might break erm thanks dobby harry said desperately hoping dobby would let go soon one of the other house elves cleared it throat and looked at dobby with it hands on it hips dobby released harry and looked up at him earnestly dobby knows that it is disrespectful to interrupt his master eating so he will leave have a happy christmas harry potter sir with that dobby and the other elves vanished friend of yours lupin asked amusedly yeah harry said smiling a very enthusiastic friend lupin and dumbledore both chuckled after lunch lupin and dumbledore discussed what lupin had done so far with the house and dumbledore expressed absolute delight in the fact that it had been cleaned up so nicely after that lupin and harry went back to the black house via floo powder once they were back harry looked over at the waterfall picture and groaned we didnttell dumbledore about the picture he exclaimed lupin looked disappointed oh well i guess we ll tell him next time we see him he replied harry nodded alright i going to get back to the study and i dontwant you going down any more passageways lupin told him harry smiled okay he agreed lupin left and harry stared at the waterfall picture two unicorns came and splashed playfully in the small pond harry felt mesmerized by their graceful movement even in play finally they frolicked out of the picture leaving harry to wonder about the picture harry looked over at the christmas tree which had been bending sideways to look at him when he turned to it it quickly snapped upright he smiled i think there something special about that picture he told it confidentially the tree nodded harry sighed and stretched out against the couch talking to trees wasntsuch a bad thing he decided disclaimer i do not own or claim to own any of j k rowling characters places items nothing chapter 22 no kissing harry woke up from a knock on his door up harry lupin called why is he waking me up this morning harry wondered as he fumbled for his glasses then he remembered oh yeah today we re visiting silver he wondered what the mansion was going to be like as he wandered downstairs he wondered a lot of things mostly about silver he walked into the living room and sat sleepily on the couch the christmas tree began to jump up and down nearly falling over with excitement lupin looked up from the daily prophet think it wants to say good morning he commented morning tree harry yawned the tree gave its signature quiver and then stood still too tired to go lupin asked teasingly definitely not harry replied but i think i would have slept in this morning if you hadntwaken me if i was up all night playing with a certain torch i d be tired too lupin replied smiling harry frowned how had lupin known are we taking floo powder he asked glancing at the fireplace nah i thought we d give it a break lupin replied we re gonna take the knight bus good harry said he watched as lupin turned the page of the newspaper so what are we waiting for he asked eagerly lupin looked up and grinned well it not like i going to be able to read it on the bus he said but dontyou like a challenge harry teased i dontever seem to remember saying that lupin countered aha that why you and your unregistered animagi friends snuck off to the shrieking shack every full moon harry shot back lupin looked highly amused alright he agreed folding up the paper let go he and harry went out to the curb and lupin summoned the bus they found to their disappointment that regular chairs were all that stood in the interior they each took a seat on one and when the bus took off both they and all the other passengers went flying backwards after they righted themselves they decided that holding on to the sides of the bus was a good way to go at the most their chairs flew out from under them finally stan called out snape manor manor is it lupin asked as they stepped out of the bus makes it sound a bit creepy doesntit if snape lives there it gotta be creepy harry answered lupin chuckled and they both surveyed the mansion in front of them it was huge made out of gray stone the windows all looked dark and forbidden and the door itself was scary it looked like it was made out of steel lupin pushed a button to ring the doorbell and they heard chimes echo throughout the house after a few seconds snape opened the door for a moment harry thought he was going to close it in their faces but he didn t instead he surveyed them distastefully good morning severus lupin said dutifully good morning snape replied stiffly follow me he turned and began to walk away and lupin and harry followed harry heard the door thud shut behind them the mansion was huge stone walls lined the interior and it was a bit cold like the dungeons at the school they finally came to a big room with a huge wooden table that could sit fourteen people please have a seat snape said sounding as if it was killing him to be polite harry stomach rumbled loudly and snape looked at him as if he had committed a criminal offense where silver he asked hoping it sounded as if it were merely a polite question she should be downstairs soon snape replied coolly as if on cue silver voice rang through the house are they here was that them harry smiled at the anticipation in her voice in the dining room snape called back up to her um i slept in i ll be down in a second she called down snape snapped his fingers and a house elf appeared instantly at his feet we have two guests for breakfast today he said brusquely please make accommodations yes master the elf squeaked and then it vanished snape looked up at them with a mixture of loathing and something else that harry couldntquite figure out although it was his own house he looked a bit out of place as if he were missing something harry heard footsteps and within seconds silver came bursting into the room a smile lighting her face she was slightly flushed from what seemed to be a run downstairs and harry thought she looked beautiful she threw her arms around snape with an exuberant good morning and then proceeded to give both him and lupin good morning hugs finally she sat down across from harry and snape sat down at the head of the table the house elves soon appeared with what harry had to admit was a wonderful breakfast silver lupin and harry chatted throughout breakfast and occasionally tried to get a non interested snape involved i heard a rumor they re coming out with a new broomstick silver announced and that they re going to call it a second edition firebolt where d you hear this lupin asked fred and george they said they re friends with the person who owns the broomstick shop near their joke shop really harry asked excitedly wondering why they hadnttold him when well i dontknow they just told me yesterday she replied when did you talk to them yesterday snape inquired suspiciously well we ve been in touch a bit for a few weeks silver replied harry set down his fork silver was writing letters to fred and george in touch about what he accused snape looked at him approvingly as if he were about to ask the same thing well just normal things silver replied evasively such as snape inquired stuff silver answered defiantly harry and snape both sent her accusing glares and she blushed stop it you two it not like we re writing love letters or anything she exclaimed returning their accusing stares harry and snape both relaxed in their chairs a bit harry felt only slightly relieved why are you writing them letters he asked you haventwritten me any lupin and snape both looked surprised at this fact and harry chose to ignore that w well i dontknow how to write your letters she replied flustered what do you mean he asked she only blushed nothing i ll send you a letter tomorrow she muttered taking great interest in her bacon harry looked at lupin who was smiling but looking pointedly away from harry he chanced a glance at snape who looked very happy at the fact that silver hadntwritten him any letters yet for a moment there was silence at the table during which snape harry and silver began to take great interest in their food so ah lupin said how are you doing at hogwarts silver she smiled great she replied i having a lot of fun that good lupin said approvingly and your grades i think they re good she ventured they are harry assured both her and lupin she gets top marks in every class like hermione even divination lupin asked silver smiled yes as a matter of fact she replied even though harry tries to kill me every time he predicts my future well you do the same to me harry protested if i predicted anything else she would fail me silver countered oh so you ll kill me for good grades harry replied in a mock hurt tone she laughed okay sorry harry she said still giggling i ll give you better futures from now on promise he smiled satisfactorily so have you read your horoscope that she made for today he asked i ve already evaded death four times i think today i supposed to get trampled by a raging centaur she giggled i haventeven looked at mine but i ll go get it she dashed off somewhere and harry heard her yell shut up will you as she traveled upstairs the pictures talk snape explained in no time she arrived downstairs with a horoscope chart hmm what today she mused oh yeah she traced downwards with a finger and then began to giggle and blush what harry asked silver stole a glance at snape before replying well today i am going to share a passionate kiss with a handsome young man she answered in a theatrical tone harry grinned and blushed and lupin chuckled is that really what it says lupin asked word for word she replied handing the chart over to him rubbish snape declared not looking the least bit amused he glared at harry who immediately tried to look innocent oh come on it is funny silver coaxed snape still looked as if it were a proclamation of death for silver suddenly the doorbell rang snape snapped to attention damn he muttered under his breath he turned on harry and lupin you two in there he pointed to a cupboard in the corner of the room and dontyou dare so much as breathe harry and lupin obeyed quickly both of them seeing the look in snape eye he turned to silver up in your room close and lock the door and window and put as many charms on them as you can to keep anyone from getting in he directed but i not of age silver protested you will go up there and do as i say and not worry about petty laws designed to keep children from hexing each other snape replied silver nodded and scurried off in toward the staircase snape snapped his fingers and a house elf appeared you will leave no evidence that anyone was here except for me you will act as if nobody but myself has been in this house for years you will not give any clues as to the fact that we have had guests recently he directed and above all you will prevent anybody from getting into the bedroom upstairs where she is staying i dontcare what you have to do just keep everybody away yes master the elf squeaked immediately as he disappeared snape swept off toward the doorway harry and lupin exchanged glances from within the cupboard and opened the doors just a crack so they could hear ah to what do i owe this pleasure snape asked well we just thought you might be lonely a voice responded it only took harry a second to recognize that voice it was lestrange he made to burst out of the cupboard but lupin held him back forcefully harry successfully succeeded in making a lot of racket as lupin struggled for his wand and pointed it at him petrificus totalus he whispered harry arms snapped to his side and he went rigid lupin propped him up against a corner sorry harry but at least i didntstun you lupin whispered harry decided to personally murder lupin once he was able to move freely once more goodness severus what was all that racket asked a second woman harry recognized her as narcissa incompetent house elf snape answered smoothly harry tried to move to do anything to get out of the cupboard but he could not so much as move a muscle he was also in a very uncomfortable position with his right shoulder supporting most of his weight he heard them entering the room and began to get desperate he tried to make his body sway that way if he hit the doors of the cupboard they would open and then he would well he would know what he would do when he got out of there dontdo anything stupid harry lupin whispered like kill you harry thought back angrily because that exactly what i intend to do are you ladies hungry snape inquired politely oh no not much narcissa replied and what about you young mr malfoy snape inquired harry tipped forward dangerously still trying to get out and lupin put a hand on his chest to hold him back malfoy here harry thought if it wasntfor dratted lupin i could kill him and lestrange no thanks sir malfoy replied carelessly so what brings you here snape asked well we were wondering if the dark lord has summoned you yet lestrange replied the potter boy is gone from hogwarts and so are you i left on dumbledore orders and there was nothing i could do to find potter without getting fired snape replied anger lacing his voice yes yes but do you really think the dark lord will find that an excuse narcissa replied almost laughingly snape made a noise somewhat like a growl do you have business here or not he snapped goodness snape dontget so aggravated lestrange teased you ll raise your blood pressure bellatrix narcissa snapped stop it we need his help remember yes yes i sorry lestrange said in a very non convincing voice anyway snape narcissa said in a sugary voice we need your help we re still on the lookout for that girl you know the one i talking about harry knew snape had nodded well yes she managed to hide very well and we really need to find her or we ll narcissa voice became teary well poor draco might become an orphan the dark lord is very upset harry would have laughed if he could have managed it he doubted draco depended on his mother much anyway i dontsee a search party going out for potter snape replied sounding aggravated i do believe the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord is more important than a fifteen year old girl she knows things she should never have known lestrange said her voice harsh and she will be punished i ll keep a lookout snape said not sounding very promising and if i see any suspicious girls i ll let you know her name silver lestrange supplied she wontbe using her surname trust me well may i escort you lovely ladies to the door snape asked i have many potions to brew yes yes come along draco narcissa beckoned harry was unable to move and lupin simply didn t until they heard the front door closed lupin pushed open the cabinet doors and dragged a petrified harry out harry struggled to break free from the invisible force binding him he could still catch up he could still make her pay for what she did to sirius what she wanted to do to silver snape walked back in and looked from lupin to the petrified harry with amusement he pointed his wand at harry and muttered something under his breath and harry was free he ran for the exit but snape caught him by the shoulders and forced him down into a chair harry flailed his legs and arms wildly trying to get away potter snape demanded let me go potter he hissed bringing his face close to harry s harry had half a mind to spit in his face and go after lestrange after a few more minutes of screaming at the top of his lungs and attempting to hurt snape in any way possible he sank into a sullen silence do you really have that little self control potter snape asked his tone menacing she deserves to die harry replied hotly she deserves to you think i dontknow what she deserves snape asked his voice a notch louder than usual harry stopped and stared at snape not comprehending what he was saying snape had hated sirius why would he be upset with lestrange i have watched that woman torture countless innocent people snape said his voice harsh and his fingers digging into harry shoulder including silver do you really think that i dontwant to kill her as much as you do harry considered snape carefully for a moment she hurt silver he choked many times snape replied harry knew that snape cared for silver immensely however much he tried to hide it he also knew that losing silver would come as a blow to snape but would it hurt him as much as it had hurt harry to lose sirius harry doubted it potter listen to me snape said catching his attention once more you need desperately to learn self control has occlumency not taught you anything from what dumbledore has told me of your accomplishments one would think you would be able to refrain from doing something rash at least once in a while why would i want to harry argued she deserves to die now yes snape agreed she does but do you think you a sixteen year old wizard could defeat two seasoned death eaters on your own come now surely you are not that foolish you and lupin would have helped me harry replied we could have killed her she could be dead right now stop it snape snapped shaking him slightly stop being so rash and thoughtless think about the consequences of your actions think about how silver would feel if she came downstairs and saw you dead or injured at the hand of lestrange harry felt rage bubbling up inside of him who was snape to tell him these things who cared how lestrange was killed as long as she was dead let go of me he said i will not let go of you because you still have not managed to gain control of yourself snape answered firmly harry glared at him for what seemed like hours but was really only minutes they sat there snape not relinquishing his hold on him one bit harry felt his anger simmer down only slightly in those minutes maybe snape was right about silver if he had just burst out of the cupboard there was a chance he would have gotten hurt and silver would have been beside herself he suddenly felt heat rise to his face as he remembered that he had been trying to break out of the cupboard while he was petrified that would not have gone over well at all are you ready to go get silver snape asked harry looked up into snape eyes which blinked back at him with evident hatred he doubted his own eyes were much friendlier yes he said rather defiantly snape released him and stood back watching him for a moment as if afraid he might make a dash to the door then he nodded curtly follow me both of you he directed lupin and harry fell into step behind him and lupin placed a much friendlier hand on harry shoulder harry glared at him and pulled away from his hand he was still mad at him although he knew that lupin had made the right decision they stopped in front of a white door and snape knocked potter is here to see you remus and i will be in my lab he announced without another word he strode off lupin following him harry heard the click of a lock being opened and then a flash of blue light and then silver opened the door hi harry she said her features traced over with worry what happened harry explained to her who had come and what they had said leaving out the part about having to be petrified when he finished he looked up at an ashen silver s she came here she asked looking horrified yeah harry replied silver looked as if she were about to faint are you okay he asked y yes i just c cantbelieve she c came here silver replied they were sitting on the edge of her bed and suddenly silver scooted closer to him and leaned against him surprised he put an arm around her i glad you re safe harry she whispered course i am he replied surprised well it just that i thought you might do something hasty when you saw lestrange but i proud of you you didn t he felt a guilty blush rising to his cheeks well maybe i left something out he admitted such as she asked taking her head off of his chest uh lupin had to petrify me he tried she burst into giggles as she laid her head against him once more oh harry she laughed you re so funny he grinned and pulled her closer she turned to look up at him smiling he bent towards her and suddenly they heard a screech from the hallway master master they both looked out the open door in the hallway where a lady in a picture was jumping up and down and pointing at them screaming for snape at the top of her lungs silver rolled her eyes got up and shut the door if harry wasntmistaken he heard a lock click into place as well those pictures are so annoying she said sitting on the bed i dontknow why they re always trying to act like something bad is happening harry began to pull her closer but she hardly noticed you d think after having me for almost a week they d she paused as harry put his hand under her chin and turned her towards him get used to me she finished quietly as harry lowered his lips to hers to harry surprise silver kissed him back with more gusto than usual he nearly jumped from shock but instead decided that it was a good thing she ran a hand through his hair surprising but pleasing him and her other arm took up its usual hold around his neck he only barely heard snape voice outside what in the name of merlin alohomora he didnthear the door swing open and apparently silver didnteither because her hand was still in his hair and her arm around his neck potter that he heard silver didntappear to however he pulled away from her and she opened her eyes puzzled harry she said quietly beginning to lean towards him once more what are you doing snape demanded she jumped away from him as if he had electrocuted her her face becoming a brilliant crimson the lady in the picture outside answered he rough handed her sir and she had no choice but to give in to somebody so much stronger than she he glared at the lady and so did silver snape looked about ready to throw him out the closed window no he didn t silver answered harry thought it strange that snape would actually believe the picture he chanced a glance at lupin who was failing horribly to hide a grin he winked at harry and then put on a straight face as he talked to snape severus surely you could erm see that harry wasnt forcing her to do anything lupin commented snape looked insulted and then angry as he looked at silver who cringed under his glare come he said gruffly turning and walking away the remaining three immediately followed him through the hallways that he seemed to know quite well all the while he muttered things under his breath like cantleave you alone for five minutes dontknow what you were thinking kissing harry thought he sounded a bit like mrs weasley but didntthink snape would appreciate the comment so he kept it to himself they finally arrived in what looked like a very dangerous potions lab snape turned on silver and harry you two sit on couch touch nothing he seemed too angry to speak in full sentences lupin winked at harry as they sat down and harry grinned but they only earned themselves an eye roll from silver as i was saying snape said to lupin having recovered himself successfully i may be able to make you at least half a year worth of supply and by that time i will have more ready for you snape was stirring a thick gray potion carefully adding ingredients to it every few seconds thank you severus lupin replied what do you charge snape head snapped up and he looked at lupin as if he had just slapped him i dontcharge he answered oh come now lupin protested rather boldly in harry opinion that potion requires great effort and an even greater cost for the supplies you want no pay no snape answered firmly and if you insist on paying me i will simply quit making it for you harry and lupin exchanged shocked glances but silver smiled see she whispered he not a git harry smiled well lupin commented suddenly i believe your horoscope came true didntit silver giggled and blushed yep she replied they all chanced a glance at snape who commented i thought it said a handsome boy they burst into laughter even harry snape tone of voice was priceless harry is handsome silver defended putting her arms around him harry grinned a bit cheekily up at snape who gave him a withering look like james lupin said quietly unfortunately however snape heard him and that is something to be proud of he asked cuttingly harry could almost see lupin temper rise yes it is lupin replied why would he want to be anything like that arrogant conceited james wasntarrogant or conceited well you never would have guessed from the way he strutted around like he owned the place putting people lives in danger he saved your life only because he was a coward he was a man of morals and he saved your pathetic hide even though you were a complete slimeball i am not was not a slimeball stop it both of you silver voice somehow managed to silence the two fuming men who were now shooting each other looks of pure hatred remus silver said calmly you have to understand that he doesntknow james the way you do he only knows the way he was treated by james when james was a teenager and please refrain from name calling lupin looked a bit stunned that a teenage girl was talking to him as if he were a very small child who had just gotten in a fight with his friends she then turned to snape and you must understand that james did indeed save your life he showed courage and compassion for his enemies which is something that not all people possess and that harry should be proud to have inherited she paused and shot a smile at harry and also the james you knew was a teenager a prankster who had very different ideals than the man he became later on she looked from lupin to snape who both looked much calmer now i believe apologies are in order she said the two men looked at each other with a glare that was a bit less hateful than the ones they had been previously shooting each other i sorry for insulting you lupin grumbled sorry for insulting james snape muttered back pouring the gray potion into a large jar and holding it out to lupin as a kind of peace offering thank you lupin said looking at the potion very much the two men surveyed each other for a moment and then snape abruptly spoke looking at silver i sure potter would like to be shown around the mansion while we discuss some things for the order he said silver nodded and stood up they had barely walked out the door when snape shouted behind them and no kissing disclaimer i do not own or claim to own any of j k rowling characters places items or anything else her wonderful mind invented chapter 24 blinded part 1 harry a voice called out geroff he mumbled sleepily rolling over silver giggled harry it christmas come on he opened his eyes to see a blurry figure hovering over him she slid his glasses on for him and her face came into view her eyes were alight with happiness and anticipation and she was pulling him up into a sitting position go wake up remus i ll take snape she said pulling him out of bed and then darting out of the room harry walked up to lupin door yawning and knocked hard on it wassamatter lupin called out groggily christmas he replied lupin groaned be out in a sec harry smiled as he wondered what snape was like when someone woke him up out of a dead sleep he began to walk down the hall to see but silver met him halfway he grinned feeling much more awake than he had a second ago he pushed a hand through his hair as he walked downstairs with her letting the realization that it was christmas sink in he was very excited and fully awake by the time he reached the bottom step silver began to walk into the living room but he caught her by the wrist and pulled her back in the doorway uh oh he said glancing upwards at the mistletoe she smiled and willingly stepped forward he pressed his lips gently against hers and she kissed him back with the same tenderness when she drew back he saw out of the corner of his eye that they had an audience snape for once wasntsaying anything which was a miracle in itself suddenly everybody jumped as a box flipped over they all looked at it it was a plain brown box with a rope tied in a bow around it it shuddered and jumped up into the air and began to roll away from the tree well roll the best it could seeing as it was a box the tree quickly pulled it back with its branches but the box jumped and shook in protest they heard a ripping noise come from inside who is that for silver asked finally you snape replied m me she repeated yes you snape answered she hesitantly walked forward and knelt in front of the tree which gladly pushed the box over to her she tugged on the bow which easily came undone and opened the box the next thing harry heard was a squeal of delight although he didntknow if it came from silver or from the tiny silver hippogriff she pulled out of the box the animal whole body was shaking with excitement and silver went into transports of delight she jumped up clutching the animal and ran up to snape enveloping him in a hug at first harry thought snape was going to hug her back but suddenly he jumped away harry had to refrain from laughing as he saw the hippogriff tiny beak clamped on to the front of his robes she likes you silver informed him yes she showed me how much she liked me last night when i tried to put her in that box snape replied eyeing the animal with dislike silver beamed and set the animal down enfolding snape in another hug you are absolutely positively the best she exclaimed thank you thank you thank you snape did his best not to look too pleased with himself you bought it lupin suddenly accused while we were eating ice cream you bought it nothing gets past you snape answered sarcastically lupin grinned not much he agreed the tiny hippogriff had been trying to snap at the tree which was doing it best to defend itself while not sending the tiny animal flying across the room come here sweetie silver called and immediately the hippogriff bounded into her arms and began to snuggle with her you next harry lupin said harry walked up to a tree and it nudged a present towards him very good it gave you mine lupin said sounding delighted it was a small cube shaped package and harry felt a slight vibration as he unwrapped it he paused when he saw it too surprised and pleased to even offer a thank you in his hand was a small glass box with gold hinges and inside was a tiny golden fluttering snitch it not just any snitch lupin informed him i found it in the study last week it was your father s harry harry got a brief flashback of a boy with hazel eyes and messy black hair showing off by catching a snitch in the hallways of hogwarts although he didntplan on using it to show off it was one of the best presents he had ever received it stood right there along with the other two things he would never give up that had previously belonged to his father his invisibility cloak and his father former watch thanks erm um lupin harry said he felt bad about calling lupin by his last name but he had gotten used to it when lupin was a teacher sorry he mumbled feeling heat rise to his face i not quite sure what to call you remus was something he could never get used to but lupin sounded so formal uh lupin replied apparently thinking along the same lines as harry what about moony silver suddenly suggested the two looked at her and then at each other a grin began to creep across their faces moony it is then right harry lupin asked harry grinned right you are moony he agreed silver shook her head smiling honestly i would think you two would have come up with that a long time ago she said lupin chuckled harry met silver eye and they locked together it didntlast long however because the silver hippogriff suddenly squealed and began to jump up and down in protest it nudged her affectionately and jealously harry glared at it but silver smiled and began to tell it what a cutie it was lupin was the next to receive a present and the tree handed him harry first excellent lupin exclaimed as he uncovered a moon chart harry had seen that his current one looked as if it had indeed been used since the days of the marauders so he had taken it upon himself to buy him one your turn severus lupin announced snape looked surprised as he walked forward the tree pushed him a present wrapped immaculately with light blue wrapping paper no doubt from silver he unwrapped it a bit clumsily but when he opened it harry saw gratitude in his eyes he had uncovered a shiny black cauldron and harry saw that it had three heavy potions books inside do you like it silver ventured as snape looked at it with shock yes was all he said and silver looked very happy the rest of the morning was happily spent opening presents snape was so shocked that he had more presents under the tree that he accused silver of giving him too many until he learned that they were from harry and lupin harry had figured it was a good idea to give him a present so that he would let him and silver alone more often finally when they had all finished opening each other presents they turned the subject to silver new hippogriff who was rolling delightedly around in wrapping paper whilst tearing it to shreds it looks like quite a handful lupin commented isntshe sweet though silver replied beaming at the silver ball of fluff as it attempted to fight the wrapping paper into oblivion uh sure lupin said exchanging a glance with harry what are you going to name her harry asked i not sure silver replied i need something that can have a nickname i stuck calling esperanza esp because he doesnthave a proper nickname lupin laughed and she added smoothly although i sure esperanza isntquite as bad as remus lupin you cantshorten that to anything now can you moony lupin grinned whoever said i wanted to he replied moony suits me fine i wontcomment on the fact that it would be easier to shorten remus than silver you just did she replied but she was smiling anyway are you going to help me pick out a name or not how about noel lupin suggested it a christmas name she not gentle enough to be a noel silver replied looking at the silver ball of energy good point lupin agreed how about ornament silver looked at him oddly what lupin asked eyes twinkling it exotic he mimicked silver so perfectly as he said it that neither harry nor silver could help but break into laughter enough teasing a name she insisted uh tinsel harry asked mistletoe he looked around the room ribbon she giggled it doesnthave to be a christmas name she said the tiny hippogriff began to get bored of the wrapping paper and instead put it efforts on trying to fly it squeezed it eyes shut and flapped it tiny wings hard but all that happened was that the wrapping paper on both sides drifted away while harry and lupin smothered laughter silver patted it on the head comfortingly maybe the others will be able to think up a name when they get here she said suddenly she jumped up the hippogriff followed suit oh my goodness she exclaimed the others are all coming and i haventeven showered yet well you d best go shower lupin told her save some hot water for us silver gave him a sly grin yeah you definitely need a shower she teased as she headed up the stairs her hippogriff followed at her heals squealing with the excitement of running through the house at a quarter til noon the four were sitting in the living room hoping that somebody would come early sure enough at eleven fifty the doorbell rang the hippogriff gave a squeal and bounded towards the door they heard the door open and a second later mrs weasley screamed cool fred and george exclaimed in unison silver ran out to retrieve her pet sorry she just friendly they heard silver exclaim lupin and harry held back sniggers both knowing that the hippogriff had probably tried to bite whoever it saw first after mrs weasley was sufficiently calmed that the wild animal as she called it was silver pet she said hello to everyone ron harry fred george ginny silver and the hippogriff all went up to ron and harry room to think up a name for the small but vivacious animal how about rocket fred suggested that too boyish silver answered this coming from the girl who named her boy owl esperanza george teased it exotic silver insisted everyone laughed fireball ron suggested no that sounds more like a dragon than a hippogriff silver replied guess so ron admitted what about charisma ginny asked it means gift in latin and in english it means appeal or personality silver beamed it perfect she exclaimed charisma yeah but didntyou want something with a nickname harry asked well charisma isntthat long she replied in fact compared to esperanza it relatively short suppose so harry agreed lunch mrs weasley called amazing how fast your mum cooks harry told ron isntit though ron replied with a hint of appreciation in his voice mrs weasley gave charisma a suspicious look when she arrived in the kitchen the animal goes out she exclaimed but she ll get lonely silver protested looking shocked that mrs weasley would even suggest such a thing well she ll have to learn to get over it mrs weasley replied silver took the hippogriff outside the door and told her firmly stay as soon as silver went out of her sight however a racket to counter fireworks on the fourth of july went off charisma squealed loudly making everyone cover their ears silver gave mrs weasley a pleading look oh fine mrs weasley relented just make it stop come silver called immediately charisma bounded through the door and bounded onto silver lap mrs weasley decided not to protest harry thought it was rather amusing to watch silver pass the hippogriff bits of meat whenever mrs weasley wasntlooking have you decided on a name lupin asked from a few seats down charisma silver replied lupin looked at the tiny hippogriff with a smile yes i do believe it does he replied silver beamed after lunch silver forced charisma to take a nap and the hippogriff grudgingly obliged harry waited for her in the living room with the others soon she came down smiling got it to take a nap he asked grinning yes it was a bit of a chore she admitted suddenly harry realized that she was smiling rather slyly what he asked she looked upwards and he followed her gaze his grin intensifying as he did sure enough a sprig of mistletoe hung up above them neither of them noticed that every gaze in the room was suddenly on them she put her arms around him at the same time he did her and stood on her tiptoes to reach him the moment their lips touched everyone in the room went wild with whistles and applause harry flatly ignored them as did silver she drew back slightly but not enough so that he couldnteasily tilt his head forward and kiss her again and smiled at him happy christmas harry she whispered happy christmas silver he answered he placed another kiss on her lips and loosened his hold on her allowing her to sink back to her regular height suddenly ron began waving something in their faces haha look what i ve got he said evilly harry grabbed it from him and held it down so silver could see one arm still around her waist it was a photo taken with a wizarding camera of him and silver kissing he smiled wondering if that was how they really looked silver looked so sweet standing on her tiptoes with her arms around his neck can we keep it silver asked ron ron smirked i guess he relented harry grinned and looked down at her not gonna fight me for it are you he challenged not right now she replied eyes twinkling they heard a crash upstairs probably charisma she said dislodging herself from harry arms harry was a bit disappointed at losing her so soon after she had come downstairs hey harry ron whispered yeah harry replied looking down at the picture are we going to go see that passageway or what right now harry asked yes right now when else ron replied dontyou think it a little soon harry asked well yeah but isntsilver staying in that room yeah so i think we should just go down check it out then come back up and have it sealed off so that she safe guess so so what are we waiting for she going to have to walk under the mistletoe to get back in here harry replied grinning oh come on ron said grabbing his arm and yanking him towards the staircase not so fast ginny said suddenly they turned around to see ginny fred and george standing there with smiles on their faces harry heard silver arrive downstairs behind them we want to come too ginny declared ron groaned you listened in on our conversation he exclaimed we sure did fred agreed and we re not about to be left out george added about what silver questioned fixing her brown eyes on harry harry hesitantly explained about the secret passageway and the torch to her by the end of it her eyes were alight with something akin to anticipation let go then she exclaimed what are we waiting for she let charisma hop out of her arms and turned to go back upstairs ron and harry exchanged glances harry grinning that my girlfriend he boasted as they headed up the stairs after her ron rolled his eyes and fred and george chuckled about time harry george informed him kept her waiting a while didntyou fred added harry remembered that she had been writing to them oh shut it he said hopping up the last two stairs and jogging to catch up to silver she had already moved the trunk out of the way but she stood back to let harry open it up he pulled on the hanger and a dark stairway was revealed ginny oohed softly behind them harry pulled the torch out of his pocket light he commanded and a ball of bright white light burst out of it scaring everybody but silver who was watching intently he made it dim so that it gave off a slightly spooky glow and then looked at the others i ll take the lead he offered they all looked down at the stairway wondering what secrets it could hold although harry had been down before a sense of foreboding passed over him silver slid her hand through his as he began the descent he was grateful for not having to go down feeling completely alone he heard the others slip down behind them and then a faint thump told him that the door had closed suddenly they heard a bang and everybody froze ginny gasped only to receive glares from the others harry made the torch even dimmer so that he could only see about a step in front of him and he went to where he had hidden on the staircase on his previous visit it only took a second for them to hear quiet voices coming from the opening below i just dontknow where to look came lestrange voice before harry could even draw out his wand ron and fred dragged him backwards silver pressed her hand over his mouth and george held his legs still he glared at them harry silver whispered promise us you wontdo anything rash please he began to struggle and opened his mouth to yell if he couldntget to lestrange he would get her to come to him silencio george hissed pointing his wand at harry harry tried to yell but no sound came out he scowled at george who was still sitting on his legs should we petrify him george whispered to the others we need to go back silver replied but hang on they all paused and listened for snatches of the conversation suddenly harry looked at the torch in his hand if he made it light up lestrange would come he just had to light it up and he could kill her light he thought staring at it intently brighter brighter suddenly the ball of light seemed to burst a blinding white light filled the entire structure he heard silver scream mixed with others and knew he had made a mistake he stopped telling the torch to light but the light stayed it was so bright that he could not see anything past it it was like being wrapped in a glowing white sheet suffocated with it it was utterly terrifying although he was gasping in air it felt as if he couldntbreathe as if the brightness was closing in on him it was like being blinded and suffocated at the same time he felt himself being dragged upwards and struggled to his feet the handle the handle silver cried where is it then he heard a creak and felt himself being tugged upwards once more at first everything was so dark that he couldntsee but then he began to see shadows all around him panting and crying a small figure with short hair was crying it must be ginny somebody was dragging the trunk back over the hole either fred or george and silver was crying too but he couldntsee where she was slowly things came back into focus fred was sitting on top of the trunk his face ashen white panting george was looking identical laying down on the floor ron was a brilliant shade of red as he gasped for breath ginny was shaking her face in her hands silver was holding charisma tightly her face hidden by the small animal feathers and she was shaking as well what did i do harry thought he looked around at his friends terror written all over them because of something he had done i sorry he croaked fred george ron and ginny looked up at him in disbelief silver began to cry louder harry cringed under his friend gazes and he crawled over to silver feeling too weak to walk i sorry he repeated not daring to touch her i c cantbelieve y you d did that she sobbed h h harry w what were y you thinking i wanted to kill her he said his voice shaky she killed sirius and snape said she hurt you he trailed off t that was s so scary she wailed i t thought y y you were g going to get h h hurt with that she set charisma down and plunged into his arms shock coursed through harry he had just purposely put everyone lives in danger especially hers and she was crying because he might have gotten hurt he looked up at the others and they were looking at silver with similar astonishment silver he just nearly killed us all george pointed out um yeah i hardly think he heeds comforting at the moment fred added giving harry a rather nasty look seriously ron agreed they re right harry said why are you worried about me i just put you all in danger because i cantthink straight silver sniffled as she pulled away from him and glared at the others well it our fault too maybe we should have thought beforehand before just plunging down there to who knows where when we knew that there was a possibility that lestrange would be there and we knew how harry would react for a moment the others just looked shocked but then they surveyed harry quizzically as if trying to decide if she was right i think you re right ginny suddenly sniffled we shouldntbe blaming it all on harry and he didntknow it was going to suffocate us all like that did you harry no harry said i just wanted to get lestrange attention it wasntall your fault mate ron said suddenly i sorry we agree fred and george added thanks harry said i sorry too for a moment they all sat in silence staring at the torch in harry hand although they felt better they were all still shaken from what had happened we should go tell the adults silver said that needs to be sealed off right away harry nodded and struggled to his feet at first a wave of nausea and dizziness swept over him but he breathed deeply and closed his eyes and it passed the others experienced similar emotions as they stood up and once they were all up they stood and headed for the stairs halfway down silver stopped and swayed dangerously but george caught her and handed her to harry they arrived in the doorway and immediately the adults stopped talking and looked at them as if they had all dropped off another planet harry looked at his friends and realized why fred and george were deathly pale ron looked as if another wave of nausea had swept over him and silver and ginny eyes were red and puffy even charisma stood docilely down at their feet harry could only imagine how he looked what happened lupin finally asked disclaimer i do not own or claim to own any of j k rowling characters places or items chapter 25 blinded part 2 harry didntfeel like looking lupin in the eye he stared down at the floor unwilling to speak for what seemed like hours finally he looked up i made a mistake he said his voice dry i was really stupid it wasntjust harry silver spoke up it was all of us we all made a mistake she slid her hand through his and he squeezed it tightly silently thanking her for not making him face this alone he looked down at the torch that was still in his other hand but couldntbring himself to speak as he looked at it visions of blinding whiteness flashed before his eyes and silver panicky voice echoed in his head the handle the handle where is it had he ever seen her that scared before probably not and it was his fault talk to me harry lupin said harry reluctantly looked up at lupin silver gently rubbed his hand with her thumb he took a deep breath and started to talk once he started he found it almost impossible to stop when it came to the part about the torch light however the one that lupin needed to hear most his courage seemed to fail him it was bright so bright he said you couldntsee anything but white like the opposite of being blind i guess and it was hard to breathe because it felt like someone was pressing the light over your face over your whole body ginny began to cry silently giving only one giveaway sob and it wouldntstop not even when i told it to he continued so we just somehow managed to get back up the stairs and in sirius room and then we came down here for a moment everyone was silent harry felt his face burning with shame even if it wasntall his fault it was mostly he was surprised nobody had yelled at him yet but he knew it was coming lupin stood up some unreadable emotion on his face then he walked up to harry harry didntreally want to meet his gaze but he did anyway lupin put his hands on harry shoulders in a reassuring manner it not your fault harry he said quietly so dontbeat yourself up over it harry looked up at him in surprise and lupin smiled yes i know you he told him i know you re standing there feeling like we re all blaming you but we re not thanks harry said his voice barely above a whisper molly lupin said turning to mrs weasley and releasing harry these children look like they could use some hot cocoa wouldntyou say right away mrs weasley replied ruffling harry hair affectionately as she passed on her way to the kitchen you kids sit down on the couch lupin instructed quickly everyone on the couches moved to make way for them they obeyed wordlessly ron sat on the edge and harry sat next to him with his arm around silver who was on his other side george sat beside silver whilst fred and mr weasley comforted a shaking ginny by putting a blanket around her on the couch opposite charisma sat on silver lap sound asleep lupin threw some floo powder into the fireplace and stepped in saying dumbledore office he disappeared and harry wondered how dumbledore would react was that what he had meant about the torch being a powerful weapon and if so it was pretty useless if harry half felt like he was using it against himself he reached into his pocket and pulled out the torch he simply stared at it not daring to tell it to even light up a little he wondered if he would ever be able to light it again or if he tried to would it do the same thing as it had just done he put it back in his pocket not really wanting to think about it he felt silver breathing become deep and regular and knew that she was sleeping he leaned his head on top of hers taking in the scent and softness of her hair before he knew it he too had drifted off to sleep dumbledore wants to talk with harry somebody voice was saying from far away shh said another one you ll wake them up there was a pause in which harry tried to drift back into the wonderful thoughtless world he had been in but he was interrupted yet again cute couple arentthey an amused voice asked i ve got lots of pictures somebody whispered much too close to him silver stirred ever so slightly beneath him and he realized where he was he kept his eyes closed and feigned sleep knowing that if they knew he was awake he would have to surrender silver he matched his breathing with hers not daring to move a muscle the boy awake snape said suddenly shh no he not look at him mrs weasley hissed he awake snape replied potter open your eyes harry ignored him we wontmake you let her go snape tempted harry sprung open his eyes much to the surprise of the people around him what do you want then he asked irritably dumbledore wants to see you lupin answered harry picked up his head and looked down at silver not yet he protested harry lupin answered in a you know you have to come voice suddenly silver stirred unconsciously she put her arms around harry and buried her face into his chest mm she murmured softly harry grinned and gave a gentle tug on her hair she pulled away from him with a start but her eyes softened when she looked at him you scared me she accused sorry he replied still smiling she settled back into his arms and harry began to get comfortable when lupin interrupted harry he said in a warning tone harry sighed i have to go see dumbledore he told her she pulled away from him reluctantly see you later she replied he kissed her on the forehead and grudgingly took a handful of floo powder from lupin muttering under his breath as he did so he stepped into the fire and found that the warmth of the flames was very pleasant dumbledore office he exclaimed and the next moment he was spinning undesirably fast and then being spit out in dumbledore office good evening harry dumbledore greeted cheerfully please have a seat harry glanced behind him isntmoony er lupin coming he asked oh no i wanted to talk to you alone dumbledore replied but first you must tell me exactly what happened today concerning that passageway harry didntreally feel like describing what had happened again but with dumbledore sitting there looking at him with those piercing blue eyes he didnthave much of a choice he took a deep breath and told dumbledore every last detail excepting his friends cold attitudes and silver near hysterics and what have you been doing since this little escapade finished dumbledore asked when he had finished um sleeping harry answered you haventlit the torch again dumbledore inquired no harry replied dreading what he knew dumbledore was about to do you have it with you am i correct dumbledore asked politely harry briefly considered telling him no but he knew that if he did he would just have to go get it yes he admitted would you mind lighting it for me harry thought that dumbledore knew the answer to the question perfectly well yes he did mind lighting it very much however he pulled it out of his pocket and said quietly light for a moment the bright ball of light that appeared frightened him but he relaxed as he saw that it was it normal size very nice harry dumbledore complimented you may put it out now harry was able to shut it off simply using his thoughts he felt a huge relief at the fact that he could still control the torch now harry i think you agree when i say that the passageway should be sealed harry nodded very good dumbledore replied let go wait harry said before he could stop himself arentyou going to tell me about the torch well harry i would love to but what happened today presents an interesting side that needs to be looked into before i can give you accurate information dumbledore replied pleasantly cantyou just tell me what you know harry asked i afraid not dumbledore replied quietly looking harry straight in the eye harry looked back at him for a long moment until dumbledore eyes began to make his burn he turned away feeling frustrated come harry dumbledore said harry grudgingly accepted the floo powder and transported himself back to grimmauld place when he arrived he was greeted by a few tentative smiles but mostly curious looks silver and the others were nowhere to be seen i believe they re waiting in sirius bedroom lupin informed him thanks harry said he began to walk towards the room without waiting for dumbledore he pushed open the door and found that for the most part they all looked better fred george and ron all looked back to normal except for a faint pale tint and ginny although she looked distant no longer had red puffy eyes silver was looking worriedly at charisma who was laying down on the bed blinking sleepily but when she saw him her face lit up harry she exclaimed he made his way over to her and sat down beside her what wrong with charisma he asked i think she just a bit tired from what happened silver replied i sure she ll be fine harry could tell that silver wasntso sure and truthfully he wasnteither as they watched the tiny silver hippogriff closed it eyes and settled off into sleep at first harry wasntsure whether she had died or not but he saw her side rising and falling and knew that she was still alive i think she just needs a lot of sleep silver said trying to sound confident harry felt incredibly guilty silver looked over at him and then enveloped him in a hug i dontblame you harry so stop feeling guilty she admonished gently harry just looked at the sleeping hippogriff wordlessly stupid torch he found himself thinking why did i ever have to find it in the first place the door opened and dumbledore walked in followed by lupin and snape under the trunk harry informed them without being asked pull the hanger and you can see which floorboards move lupin dragged the trunk out of the way and joined dumbledore and snape as dumbledore pulled the hanger firmly the floorboards opened and the entire closet lit up with a white glow harry saw the suffocating whiteness below it you couldntsee a single stair it still there ginny whimpered indeed dumbledore agreed gravely he knelt and put his hand into it it disappeared into the whiteness very powerful magic he commented withdrawing his hand very powerful do you reckon lestrange is still down there ron asked i highly doubt it dumbledore replied my guess is that she and mrs malfoy ran up the nearest staircase they could find if not i sure we wouldntbe hearing silence neither woman is the type to keep quiet harry remembered the screams he had heard when the passageway had been ignited they hadntjust been silver s dumbledore rose as the floorboards began to creak back into place then he lupin and snape withdrew their wands children there may be side effects to this spell that you will not want to be around for dumbledore said i would suggest moving to another room immediately they all rose silver gathered charisma in her arms and harry felt guilty again as he looked at the formerly spunky hippogriff that was now still asleep in it owners arms they went into harry and ron room silver lay charisma down concern in her eyes as she looked at the small bundle harry touched her shoulder and she broke down into tears she turned into his arms and he wrapped them around her ginny began crying as well and ron comforted her awkwardly we never should have gone down there silver sobbed i sorry harry said it not your fault she exclaimed and to his surprise she hit him hard in the shoulder stop thinking that way she said sounding angry uh sorry he said half amused she continued to cry and he held her gently rubbing her back soon her sobs had subsided and she was asleep once more in his arms harry found that fred and george were also asleep against the wall and ginny looked as if she was about to doze off on ron shoulder ron put his head back against the wall and closed his eyes harry watched charisma closely making sure that the tiny hippogriff was still breathing it was oddly soothing to watch it sides rise and fall so rhythmically harry awoke to find that he was alone the last thing he remembered was watching charisma sleep but charisma was gone also ron was asleep on his bed beside harry harry got up out of bed and made his way to ginny room he assumed silver was sleeping there he walked in quietly and walked past ginny bed to the second one where silver was sleeping soundly charisma was in her arms and they were breathing in perfect harmony he hovered there for a moment watching her and then gently brushed her hair out of her face night he whispered he walked out of the room without hearing her almost unconscious goodnight harry he had no sooner lay down in his bed than he fell asleep again although he was not exactly plagued by dreams his sleep was restless and he found himself waking up countless times each time with a flash of white light and silver scream not sure if it could be counted as a nightmare or not disclaimer i do not own or claim to own any of j k rowling characters places items ect chapter 29 headaches harry awoke with a headache on monday as well as having his scar prickle uncomfortably he was a bit irritable as he dressed and immediately the rest of the boys saw fit to leave him alone he stalked down the stairs muttering under his breath about headaches and scars and when silver looked up at him she seemed to be amused headache harry she asked sweetly he glared at her as he sat down on the couch she wasntdoing much to help him stay in his bad mood she had her hair in very natural looking curls today a bit like hermione s and some sparkly stuff on her lips and to say the least she looked very pretty she giggled fine if you re going to give up your good morning kiss because you have want to have a temper tantrum i not going to stop you she said as she turned back to hermione to continue their previous conversation harry thought about it only a second before reaching out and pulling her towards him there were a few stifled laughs around the room from those watching she turned to him with a smile i thought so she informed him as she kissed him sweetly his headache didntgo away but it lessened considerably she smelled so fresh and sweet and whatever was on her lips tasted good his scar however began to feel as if it were heating up they parted and he rubbed a hand over it stupid good for nothing scar he muttered under his breath it hurts silver asked concernedly did you have any dreams last night not that i can remember he replied as it continued to heat uncomfortably it feels like it getting hot silver put a cool hand on his forehead and frowned she traced his scar gently with her finger causing a tingling sensation and then looked him in the eye it feels perfectly cool to me she said he rubbed it again well it really hot now he said as it began to burn she looked at him a moment as if considering what to do he began to rub his scar furiously as it continued to heat up to a very uncomfortable level she took his hand away and took his face in her hands she placed a gentle kiss on top of his scar and immediately he felt relief spreading through his entire body his scar went down to a minor heat level and his headache lessened considerably she pulled away and looked at him questioningly it worked he said in amazement how d you do that she smiled go see dumbledore she replied i ll see him tonight in occ he began but she put a finger to his lips go see dumbledore she repeated slowly alright he agreed reluctantly she smiled he leaned back thinking he would just sit and watch her for a moment but his scar began to heat up again right away ah he exclaimed in frustration clapping his hand to it cantthe stupid thing give me a rest silver gave him a sympathetic smile and stood up with him she gave him a hug and another kiss on his scar which relieved it a bit and he playfully planted a kiss on her lips before turning to go he had barely taken a step before he heard a squeal and was forced to jump backwards as something silver launched itself up at him charisma silver exclaimed immediately charisma stopped trying to attack him and sat down docilely at his feet uh morning he told it charisma squeaked happily and rubbed against his leg leaving him partially amused as he left the portrait hole he didntreally want to go see dumbledore about his scar but he knew silver wanted him to so he did plus it was beginning to heat up again by the time he reached the gargoyle it was broiling rubbing it furiously he exclaimed fizzing wizbee at the gargoyle who didntmove harry groaned and continued to rub his scar as fast as he could listen up he yelled at the gargoyle my scar is about to light on fire and i need to talk to dumbledore i highly suggest that you move your big stone butt out of the way the gargoyle stayed still which raised both his temper and the temperature of his scar he gave a yelp of pain as it continued to heat to what he was sure were unnatural levels cauldron cakes pumpkin juice acid pops he yelled to no avail if you dontopen up my head is going to light on fire he bellowed the gargoyle suddenly sprung open harry gave it a kick for good measure as he ran up the stairs and burst into dumbledore office professor mcgonagall and snape were there and looked surprised at the sudden interruption scar harry yelled pointing to his scar which he was now hitting in an attempt to cool back down hot he did a sort of dance in place as he beat himself over the head in vain attempts to cool it down professor dumbledore walked to the back of his room and came back with a big bowl of water harry plunged his head into it before dumbledore could even set it down anywhere it was icy cold but it seemed to have a bit of an effect on his burning head slowly the scar cooled down and when harry could hold his breath no longer he withdrew his head he groaned as he ran a hand over his face except for his lukewarm scar his whole face was numb from the icy cold water and his headache seemed to have gotten worse dumbledore who had been holding the bowl for harry the entire time set it down on the desk without comment and conjured up another chair for harry who sat gratefully water dripping down his face that bloody hurt he said finally language harry dumbledore reminded him politely sorry he apologized so harry care to describe your morning for me dumbledore asked as if harry was going to tell him a particularly cheerful children story why not harry replied a bit sarcastically well i woke up with a headache and my scar kind of prickled so i went downstairs and sat down and it started to warm up it got really hot so silver he paused remembering that snape was in the room he gave him a half apologetic half smug glance as he continued kissed it for me and that kind of cooled it down a little then when i came to see you it started heating up again really bad and well now it fine he finished he glanced at the bowl of water i didntthink that cold water would help he said feeling a bit dumb sorry oh no apologies harry that not regular water dumbledore replied brightly i doubt regular water would have helped for long oh harry replied staring at the bowl once more and wondering if it was going to cause weird side effects so what is it it a heat relief potion snape supplied so you knew this was going to happen to me harry gathered looking from snape to dumbledore no actually dumbledore replied but i ve always had a supply handy for we ve had a quidditch player or two become overheated and this potion seemed to work particularly well oh harry answered again looking down at the potion it not going to do anything weird to my face is it dumbledore chuckled no no harry it wontdo anything that regular water wouldntdo he assured him harry felt partially relieved so why did my scar heat up like that he asked well harry truthfully i cannot be sure but i suspect voldemort did that accidentally through having a spell or potion backfire on him dumbledore replied which caused him to become extremely hot which transferred the feeling on to your scar it was a potion snape supplied i brewed it for him very well dumbledore said agreeably harry looked at snape in shock you messed up a potion for voldemort on purpose he asked nothing gets past you does it potter he sneered in reply now now severus dumbledore said lightly so now i can feel whatever temperatures voldemort feels harry asked miserably no no only if it in the extreme dumbledore assured him and i assume you were also feeling his anger at having something backfire on him harry sighed great he said next time voldemort gets caught in a blizzard i going to start freezing my butt off this got a chuckle out of both dumbledore and professor mcgonagall who had previously been silent harry then remembered the previous day at the platform and proceeded to tell dumbledore what had happened lestrange professor mcgonagall said in shock surely not she wouldntgo where there are so many people she a wanted death eater and a stupid one at that harry added bella was always a bit overconfident dumbledore mused but i suppose nobody would really recognize her would they i recognized her harry pointed out yes that you did dumbledore agreed but you could not have taken her on yourself harry began to get mad oh so you re saying that the one person who can defeat voldemort canteven handle one of his little death eaters he asked annoyance lacing his voice i am dumbledore agreed because you are not ready harry for voldemort or lestrange what is the boy saying albus professor mcgonagall interrupted the only person who can defeat you know who is harry dumbledore finished but that information is up to him to disclose professor mcgonagall and snape both turned their eyes on him no he said flatly glaring at snape very well then dumbledore said agreeably but back to the subject i do not think you could have taken on lestrange alone at the platform with no prior preparation and your temper getting the better of you my temper hasntgot a hold of me harry exclaimed before he realized what he had just said snape smirked at him and he glared back dumbledore chuckled very well then he said do you wish to discuss anything else with me harry harry looked at dumbledore a long moment before replying not right now dumbledore nodded very well i ll see you tonight he said i doubt you will continue to have problems with your scar but if you do please let me know alright harry agreed but he stopped on his way out what the password he asked ah i ve changed it back to lemon drop dumbledore said eyeing a tray of yellow candies fondly on his desk harry nodded and left he entered the great hall and began to get a lot of weird stares although he didntknow why when he finally arrived at gryffindor table his friends were looking at him oddly he looked at silver who looked halfway between a laugh and concern what he demanded you re all wet honey she informed him bemusedly for a moment he was so happy that she called him honey that he hardly took in what she said then he realized that his hair was still dripping oh he said right i had to dunk my head in some sort of cold potion she smiled at him well are you feeling better now she asked as she tipped some eggs and bacon onto his plate for him yeah he said sinking into a seat and ignoring all the weird looks he was getting charisma silver was saying to something under the table will you please go get a towel charisma bounded out from under the table and towards gryffindor tower are you going to take her to classes with you harry asked in disbelief of course silver said as if magical creatures were normally allowed in class from looking at ron and hermione he could tell they had had this conversation before not surprisingly silver had won good thing our first class is care of magical creatures he answered silver smiled hagrid going to love her she declared harry agreed charisma soon returned with a towel on her back i dontwant that thing touching me after it been on her back harry protested as silver began to dry his hair harry she said hippogriffs dontlike to be insulted remember that oh he said gazing down at an angry looking charisma right sorry charisma i didntmean that i dontlike you or anything he held out his hand in the offended hippogriff direction and after a moment of contemplation she came over and rubbed against it silver smiled as she finished with the towel well it drier than before she said but a tad messier harry laughed and she joined in but the moment was ruined by a familiar sneering voice aw does potty need someone to dry his hair for him silver rolled her eyes and looked pointedly in the other direction what wrong draco teased dontwanna stick up for wethead over here silver spun around fire flashing in her eyes her hair landed in every which direction making her look beautiful and wild go away malfoy she spat you must have better things to do than to insult my boyfriend actually he began but the smile suddenly faded from his face your what boy friend boyfriend silver replied tossing her head parvati and lavender began squealing and giggling a few seats down and dean and seamus looked surprised neville smiled as if he had known all along and to harry surprise draco laughed he laughed too hard to say anything for a few seconds but then recovered himself potter wouldntknow what to do with a girlfriend draco said eyeing harry with amusement and i suppose you would silver asked draco stepped closer to her smirking i can show you anytime he said in a low voice harry opened his mouth to verbally assault draco and everything about him from his friends to his family but silver beat him to it unfortunately for you i not interested she said smoothly not yet draco challenged not ever silver answered draco gave her a sickening smile i like a challenge he informed her wiggling his eyebrows at her then try and be decent for a change should be challenge enough for you silver answered turning back to her breakfast he frowned for a moment but then recovered himself i dontknow why i wasting my time on a filthy little half blood like you he said you should consider yourself lucky your father would have been proud of you for choosing me silver froze draco had said the one thing he shouldnthave she whirled around stood up and slapped him across the face in one fluid movement the sound reverberated across the room and the great hall grew suddenly silent shove off malfoy silver spat and dontyou ever talk to me about my father again charisma growled at silver feet more threateningly than harry had ever heard draco looked momentarily stunned for a moment he stood there looking at silver and in the blink of an eye charisma leapt out from under the table and began to slash at him with her talons draco yelped and began to back up charisma growled and snapped at him until he turned to walk away the great hall exploded did you see that she told him that was a hard slap what is that weird little thing silver sat down shaking with anger harry reached out and drew her to him what a a she muttered something inappropriate into the front of harry robes making him chuckle you did good he told her he had that coming for a long time now i hate him she said passionately he has no right to to i know harry assured her i know she put her arms around him and held him tightly her face against his and he was not quite sure why your hair is still wet she told him her voice slightly muffled by the fact that she was speaking against his neck sorry he apologized sheepishly she sat all the way down and her head only came up to his chest then she pulled away and looked at him for a moment before returning to her breakfast harry was drawn to her hair once more it looked particularly beautiful today for some reason what did you do to your hair he asked curiously she and hermione shot him patronizing looks and ron snickered although he could not figure out why for a few seconds no i didntmean it like that i like it he exclaimed ron guffawed quietly and harry glared at him silver smiled i know honey she said it just not the best way to ask harry grinned at her mention of him as honey once more can i try again he asked of course she said graciously harry cleared his throat and straightened up aware that most of gryffindor table had been watching this exchange why darling he exclaimed widening his eyes and picking up a lock of her hair your hair looks so lovely this morning half the table burst into stifled laughter as they waited for silver response why thank you sweetie she replied dutifully leaning over and kissing him on the cheek the table burst into applause and laughter and harry grinned sheepishly the bell rang and they started off to care of magical creatures on the way people bombarded silver with questions about charisma silver was careful not to say that snape had gotten the animal for her but merely said it was a christmas present from somebody she knew well charisma loved the attention and put on quite a show for everyone as she pranced about by silver feet parvati and lavender thought she was just the cutest little thing and insisted on walking ridiculously close to them the entire way hagrid was delighted at silver choice of a pet when he reached down to pet charisma and the hippogriff bit him firmly in the finger drawing an alarming amount of blood for such a small bite hagrid chuckled and said that one a keeper in history of magic professor binns was a bit skeptical of charisma but after silver promise that she was well trained and very well mannered he allowed the animal to sit underneath silver desk so long as she didntattract any attention charisma seemed to realize that her staying depended on her manners so she used the classroom to take a nap like many of the other students divination was a different story silver had to practically get down on her knees and beg that charisma be allowed to stay and in the end she threatened to leave the class if charisma couldntcome with her of course charisma ended up sitting with silver harry and ron during class harry and ron made a great show of trying to read charisma future which professor trelawny wholeheartedly approved of since they were so excited of the use of the inner eye lunch was spent warding off everyone who wanted to know if silver was really going to attempt to bring charisma in potions or not of course i am now stop asking me so i can eat was silver response when they finally headed to potions silver seemed a bit nervous have you asked snape if you can bring her in ron asked well no silver said playing with the edge of her robes anxiously but he just has to let me ron harry and hermione exchanged glances they all knew that snape was not likely to allow the animal in his class even if he had bought it for her they entered the classroom hesitantly snape looked up at their arrival and his eyes settled on charisma miss riddle may i ask what is the meaning of this he demanded his eyes resting on charisma well professor snape silver said meekly she was a christmas present you see and she just a baby so i kind of like her mother and she cantbear to be separated from me so she been sitting in on my classes all day and she hasntraised a distraction or done anything bad i promise i will not tolerate pets in my classroom snape said firmly please silver begged she needs me i will allow her to sit outside the door snape replied while it open silver asked hopefully closed snape said i really dontthink that a good idea silver ventured miss riddle he said cuttingly silver jumped at being addressed so sharply and led charisma to the door sit she told her stay charisma obediently sat down and stared into silver eyes which were beginning to water dangerously silver began to close the door and charisma became alarmed she let out a small squeak as the door closed and then there was silence for a total of three seconds it then sounded as if a siren was going off outside the classroom charisma wailed at the top of her lungs and seemed to be flinging herself at the door what is this snape demanded above the racket she doesntlike being separated from me silver yelled back her fingers on the doorknob open the door snape answered silver flung open the door and charisma jumped into her arms and silenced at once silver turned to snape awaiting his verdict anxiously snape eyed first silver and then charisma if it makes one noise he said threateningly i never want to see or hear it within ten feet of my classroom again silver nodded solemnly and released a very quiet charisma under her desk the class began their work quickly knowing that snape would make no time allowances for distractions at the beginning of class charisma was very obedient the entire time not making a single peep or even moving other than into a laying down position however snape did not seem to approve of the fact that charisma accompanied silver when she brought her finished potion up to his desk it cantstay under the desk he asked pointedly silver looked down at charisma and then back up at snape she could if you really wanted her to but she likes to come with me she protects me snape simply sighed and held his hand out for her potion silver beamed at him as she handed it over and he glared in return harry couldnthelp but grin knowing that it must be hard for snape to keep a straight face after class harry barely had time to finish his homework before occlumency he was ten minutes late as it was when he arrived panting in dumbledore office dumbledore seemed amused please harry take a seat he offered cordially harry sat down and regained his breath after that dumbledore put him through one of the most rigorous sessions he had ever been through if he had thought that he would ever get used to seeing the memory of sirius death he was wrong he could block it fairly well but it drained him emotionally and in turn physically he ended up sitting in the fluffy armchair once more gasping for breath and trying to hold back the horrible lump in his throat the fact that everything in the room was annoyingly blurry and he had regained his headache from that morning didnthelp much you are doing very well harry dumbledore assured him you face it with courage and skill every time and you will soon master it master it harry croaked i nowhere close to mastering it i can hardly breathe ah but harry the fact is you can you haventpassed out or screamed in a long time now dumbledore reminded him you are only getting better i hate seeing it harry gasped i dontwant to see it i know harry dumbledore said kindly and i am very very proud of you for not running away you are facing this with a courage that many grown men do not have dumbledore words made harry feel only slightly better i believe i will see if snape has any more of that lovely purple potion dumbledore announced walking to the fireplace harry hoped he did he closed his eyes and gasped for breath as dumbledore conversed with snape through the fire but when he opened his eyes it was no easier to either breathe or see they are on their way dumbledore announced as he withdrew from the fire apparently young miss riddle is having much the same problem as you right now so severus has a very handy supply of the potion the same problem as me harry echoed in disbelief it took me a year to get this far and now she at the same level she just started well harry there are a few things you must take into account dumbledore said firstly you started out with professor snape as your occlumency mentor you learned close to nothing about blocking the attacks during that entire time secondly miss riddle is an extremely strong willed individual i have never seen anything close to determination like hers when she sets her mind to something and she has set her mind to helping you i strong willed harry protested dumbledore chuckled that you are harry that you are it has nothing to do with miss riddle being better at occlumency than you harry it has to do with miss riddle being more determined than you to master occlumency harry thought about it for a moment why does she want to learn occlumency so badly he asked finally i would think that would be obvious dumbledore replied eyes twinkling she is doing it merely to be of assistance to you harry felt himself smiling despite the situation dumbledore was right silver was willing to look back at her past as horrible as it may be and overcome it just so that harry could use her as his practice dummy if that wasntlove what was he heard her voice coming up the stairs and wished that he felt better so that he could sweep her off her feet the moment she entered and kiss her but at the moment he couldn t snape entered and presented him with the purple potion that he had grown to appreciate greatly and after drinking it he became much more perceptive to what was going on around him and very thankful that his headache had disappeared so miss riddle we were just discussing the subject of your occlumency dumbledore announced silver looked surprised but nodded her head for dumbledore to continue would you mind demonstrating for me the level you are at dumbledore asked you mean use occlumency against you silver asked yes please dumbledore replied albus snape cut in she just finished with a very hard session i will take that into account dumbledore assured him but i believe the decision is up to miss riddle silver looked up at snape her eyes wide do you think i can do it she asked you can do anything you set your mind to snape answered charisma squeaked her agreement and silver smiled at the small creature that seemed to settle it silver nodded to dumbledore the two stood up and walked to the empty space where harry and dumbledore had been practicing minutes before harry twisted around in his seat to watch as did snape on the count of three dumbledore asked yes please silver replied dumbledore gave a small bow and began one silver straightened and raised her head high looking right at dumbledore two she raised her wand slightly in front of her three legilimens silver staggered backwards a few steps as if hit by some invisible force mom no she cried raising her arms in front of her as if to block some invisible attack snape rose quickly and charisma bounded a few steps towards her silver raised a trembling arm towards dumbledore protego she whispered her wand sparked weakly and she collapsed harry jumped up as she hit the floor and rushed over to her snape moved her into a sitting position and her eyes fluttered open at first she looked vulnerable but her eyes suddenly sparked why did i do that she demanded angrily that was actually very good miss riddle dumbledore informed her she didntlook convinced can we try again she asked no snape answered certainly dumbledore replied at the same time she had enough for tonight snape snarled at dumbledore seeming to completely forget that he was the headmaster very well severus dumbledore said no i haven t silver protested i cantend like that you ve had enough for tonight snape replied you can practice with dumbledore again on wednesday charisma squealed for attention and silver looked at her not you too she exclaimed i want to try again no snape answered and charisma seemed to echo him silver scowled and looked at harry i suppose you think i should quit too she asked harry grinned i think you should do whatever you want to do darling he supplied helpfully but if it were completely up to me i would hold out until wednesday despite her determination she smiled alright then she agreed dumbledore was watching them with a smile on his face and a twinkle in his eyes snape didntlook amused in the least well you two may be dismissed for the night dumbledore informed them very good job to both of you and goodnight goodnight silver replied she hugged snape and headed for the door with harry and charisma close behind her once they got past the gargoyle she gave a long sigh harry put his arm around her and she leaned into him as they made their way back to gryffindor tower i am so tired she murmured i just want to get into bed and sleep until next tuesday harry laughed as they climbed through the portrait hole to an almost empty common room ron and hermione were sitting on one of the couches smiling at each other and didnteven notice them and miss the look on professor mcgonagall face when she sees that you want to take a hippogriff into her classroom i think not he replied as he looked back at her silver laughed but stopped as she stifled a yawn night harry she said hugging him sweet dreams he replied she kissed him on the cheek and trudged up the stairs to the girls dormitories she seemed so tired that harry wasntsure if she would make it so she watched her until she and charisma were safely in and the door was closed then he headed for his own bed being very tired himself he walked in and collapsed onto his bed too tired to change as soon as his head hit the pillow he was sound asleep his last thought before he fell asleep was that he sincerely hoped he was headache free the next morning disclaimer i do not own or claim to own any of j k rowlings people places things ect chapter 3 the visitor a week had passed since harry ron and hermione had found out what the adults were guarding since then they had found it very amusing whenever snape raised heck for guard duty which turned out to be quite often they still hadntfound out where the girl was being hidden although ron had suggested running up and grabbing on to them while they disapparated harry and hermione had found that a bad idea for more than one reason at the moment they were all sitting down in the living room listening to snape roar at dumbledore mr and mrs weasley moody tonks lupin and kingsley the only people in the room other than themselves it my turn snape was saying furiously sounding a bit like a child wanting to play with a toy no it not you big git moody replied multiplying snape fury a hundred fold you ve been going every other day and i didntgo yesterday so that would make today mine snape answered both his voice and his stare cutting be reasonable severus kingsley deep voice boomed you canthave gotten enough sleep i ve slept enough for all of you idiots put together snape roared at this dumbledore fixed snape with a piercing stare sorry headmaster you re not an idiot snape mumbled staring at the floor hermione ron and harry burst into laughter snape turned on them and walked over he towered over them a sneer on his face just what do you think is so funny he asked so angry that he couldnteven bring himself to yell oh nothing just the fact that you re so infatuated with her ron replied for a moment nobody realized the implications of what he had just said except for hermione who clapped a hand to her mouth i am not infatu snape began but suddenly realization dawned in his eyes what did you just say he asked ron face turned a brilliant shade of magenta nothing he muttered really mr weasley i insist you repeat your sentence dumbledore said harry felt truly sorry for ron who cringed under dumbledore stare i said ron whispered that it was funny that he was so ron whisper faded as he finished his sentence but it was enough to let dumbledore know that he had heard correctly so snape roared triumphantly looking as though christmas had come early severus dumbledore said get on duty now looking disappointed that he couldntsee the trio get yelled at but at the same time triumphant about getting duty snape disapparated harry cringed dumbledore stare was now not only directed at ron but at all of them he felt hermione slide down in her seat as well everyone in the room looked shocked and everyone was fixing them with stares as piercing as dumbledore s you know dumbledore said it wasnta question but they all nodded miserably after the talk i had with you they all nodded again harry this time it was lupin voice it was filled with shock harry miserably looked up and met lupin shocked eyes you directly went against dumbledore wishes harry cringed well not directly he said half of him wanted to cry out they told me it all their fault but the other half of him knew that it wouldntbe fair he had soaked up the information and used the extendable ears with them right away why lupin asked all harry could manage was a shrug he met lupin eyes for a moment and saw them fill with something protectiveness although harry hadntsaid a word lupin seemed to have come to a decision about something lupin looked at dumbledore who was looking at the trio gravely and strode to harry side he placed a hand on harry shoulder harry was shocked lupin knew that he had disobeyed dumbledore but here he was ready to defend him sirius would have done the same harry thought he had a feeling his father would have too harry sat up straighter feeling strengthened under lupin hand dumbledore watched the scene with mixed emotions lupin was helping harry heal well he observed he could tell from looking at harry that sirius had crossed his mind but instead of retreating further harry had straightened and now looked more ready than either of his friends to talk to dumbledore what do you know dumbledore asked we know that you re guarding a girl our age named silver and that snape has some weird obsession with her harry replied promptly lupin squeezed his shoulder but harry didntknow if it was out of reassurance shock or a warning not to press the snape matter he decided to take it as all of them dumbledore looked at harry and came very close to telling him that he was proud of him harry had character and boldness that radiated off of him at all times he was so much like james dumbledore knew it didnthave to be said however because judging from the look on lupin face lupin was thinking exactly the same thing harry would probably want to hear it from lupin anyway that is all you know dumbledore asked harry nodded and this time he knew that the squeeze lupin gave his shoulder was meant to be reassuring dumbledore gazed at the trio intently for a moment and saw lupin step protectively closer to harry while looking as though he was going to squeeze the boy shoulder off well it not much is it he asked a familiar sparkle entering his eyes it took a moment for harry to realize that he was teasing them harry smiled with pure relief next to him ron looked at him as if he were crazy and lupin was still trying to break his shoulder off or so it seemed guys harry said he not mad he said it as if it were common knowledge and everyone should know it he felt lupin lighten up his grip on his now numb shoulder and wondered if his hand hurt from squeezing that hard no i not dumbledore agreed although i am a bit disappointed in you for disobeying my orders he turned to harry although what can i expect from james son he added harry grinned ron and hermione gaped and lupin took up his death grip on harry shoulder once more dumbledore looked over his shoulder at the other members of the order who looked as shocked as hermione and ron would one of you kindly close the door he asked politely and please put an imperturbable charm around it as well i think our young sleuths need to hear the full story harry pushed ron into hermione scoot over he ordered well only since you asked so nicely hermione replied sarcastically sorry harry said and then turning to look up at lupin sit lupin smiled in a giving orders mood today harry guess so harry replied truthfully he was feeling good for no apparent reason i have the weirdest mood swings he thought ruefully over the past week he found he was either in a great mood or in tears over sirius sirius bedroom had become his retreat or rather he and lupin s he liked having lupin there though to talk things over with he always seemed to have excellent advice once the door was closed and the spell cast dumbledore turned to the waiting trio now what i am about to explain to you will not leave this room under any circumstances he said they all nodded gravely and he knew that this time they would obey him he flicked his wand and a cushy armchair sped over to him just in time to catch him as he sat down the other members of the order in the room found seats as well some of them looking eager to hear the story from him well this girl that we are guarding silver he explained we are currently hiding there are a number of death eaters after her for a few reasons one she knows much about the dark side but does not have the dark mark for them to call her back to them two her mother is outraged and is among the closest to lord voldemort therefore they will follow nearly any order from her and the order has been given to find her daughter three silver has been blessed with a very special gift the ability to converse with animals both mentally and through normal speech as you can guess this would have come in very handy to the dark side and four they know that hear death would come as a very personal blow to me dumbledore stopped and gauged their reactions they all looked interested miss granger more so excuse me sir she said but what about her father dumbledore looked at hermione with a glint of sadness that he stated is a very personal question and one you would have to ask her yourself for a moment miss granger looked disappointed and then excited so we get to meet her she asked he smiled yes eventually you will but for now we are content with where we are currently keeping her what about snape ron asked suddenly why is he so obsessed with her dumbledore looked at mr weasley for a moment before replying with the same cryptic answer he gave hermione that is a very personal question and one which you would have to ask professor snape yourself although i wouldntrecommend it hmph ron replied harry could only imagine the ideas going through ron head at that very moment well mrs weasley said brightly it time for lunch what do you all feel like for a moment everyone just stared at her she beamed sunnily back at them sandwiches she suggested roars of yes rang out around the room alright then i ll call you all when it ready she said walking out of the room she had barely taken a step out when they heard her yell oh i see harry ron and hermione all ran to the door fred george and ginny had been trying to get the extendable ears to work but mrs weasley had caught them as the three trudged upstairs they heard her yells eavesdropping she was suddenly joined however by sirius mom portrait in the hallway filthy mudbloods scum of the earth this is why i never tell you anything traitors the lot of them cantmind your own business lupin and moody quickly fixed the portrait and mrs weasley yells alone filled the house thought you d just have a listen in did you well ron shut the door with finality as the three entered ron and harry room i surprised she didntyell at us for finding out he said grinning well no she wouldntafter dumbledore practically said it was alright and she wouldntdare yell at harry after those looks lupin gave everyone who looked at harry like he d ever done anything wrong in his life hermione said practically he cool isnthe harry grinned hermione and ron smiled at him i think he ll take care of you ron replied so anyway snape what about him ron hermione asked exasperatedly what about meeting her she sounds so interesting what more interesting is what snape wants to do with any human being ron replied harry stretched out on his bed as the two bickered it out he thought this girl silver sounded interesting appealing even he wondered if she was pretty and he thought momentarily of cho even if she is pretty if she anything like that girl she not for me harry thought bitterly he had had tons of fun with cho in his daydreams but in reality he wasntremotely interested in her anymore he thought it might be nice to have a girlfriend though my lovelife too pathetic to bother thinking about he groaned silently to himself earth to harry hermione was saying impatiently huh he grunted lifting his head off the pillow arenti right she demanded sure he replied laying his head back down what ron exclaimed what about me i reckon you re both right harry replied he heard hermione snort disbelievingly you donteven know what we re talking about she accused no he admitted but all the same i sure you re both right he was rescued by mrs weasley call of lunch come on he said jumping off the bed and hurtling down the stairs two at a time he arrived in the kitchen in a very good mood something lupin seemed to notice he smiled at harry and harry grinned back fred george and ginny who looked in a bad mood saw him and quickly wiped the frowns off their faces they looked surprised and curious what up harry george asked curiously the sky harry replied cheerfully as he accepted a sandwich from a slightly surprised looking mrs weasley he watched as all his friends exchanged glances ron and hermione shrugged fred george and ginny shrugged back he grinned and sat down between lupin and tonks life treating you well harry lupin asked yup for now harry replied you couldntbe anything less than happy when you re in such a good mood he replied sincerely harry grinned at him and then turned his attention back to his sandwich ignoring tonks look of wonder he glanced over at his bewildered friends who were looking at him as if they had never quite seen him before and grinned at them they smiled back and harry distinctly saw fred turn to george and mouth the words mood swings at this george nodded and smiled what he thought was innocently at harry harry finished his food with lupin and mrs weasley offered them seconds almost immediately no thank you molly lupin replied no thanks harry echoed mrs weasley smiled kindly at them and returned to her own lunch i think we should go shopping for school supplies tomorrow she suggested harry glanced up interestedly he hadntrealized it but this house was getting a bit boring no no molly dear dumbledore replied i really think we should wait a bit longer until everybody is ready immediately all the adults nodded solemnly and it took harry a while to figure out that dumbledore wanted to wait until silver came then he too nodded although he ron and hermione were grinning as they did so but we are ready ginny said bewildered right guys no i dontthink i am harry replied best to wait a while longer ron and hermione echoed him at once yes best to wait really dontthink i up to it so soon definitely need to wait a while longer not ready to face that quite yet ginny fred and george looking extremely confused muttered something about fred and george joke shop left the room soon the whole table was doubling over in laughter good one harry never would ve thought of that looks like they re handy after all dumbledore not so quick on the uptake but really very bright once they get the picture lupin teased hey we just found out today harry replied at lupin look he relented okay so technically we found out a week ago but it today that counts more laughs followed this pronouncement and harry was in such a good mood by the end of it that he helped mrs weasley clear the table when he brought in the last dish though her eyes suddenly filled with tears and she pulled him close darling boy she said sounding as if she were about to burst into tears darling darling boy mrs weasley had a knack of putting at least one of her arms right around harry neck making it hard for him to breath he had no idea what had inspired this sudden wave of emotion from her but he figured it had to be a girl thing deep breaths he told himself trying to get either his nose or mouth away from her blouse so that he wasntinhaling it while not wanting to pull away from the hug and hurt her feelings mum you re gonna kill him ron said trying to pull her off of harry molly at least let go his neck lupin said concernedly mrs weasley held him at arm length her eyes looking extremely bright such a good boy she said and suddenly tears began to run down her cheeks and bright and talented and she gave a sob adorable at this she completely burst into tears harry blushed brightly don t um cry he said uncomfortably rubbing his neck she only sobbed harder molly what the matter tonks asked pulling her into a chair she had been given the job of folding up the tablecloth and had been watching just look at him mrs weasley sobbed tonks turned to look at him and harry shrugged but she didntturn away he is adorable she said suddenly looking as if she were going to cry harry was feeling extremely uncomfortable and wished someone would hide him from view honestly lupin said stepping in front of him what is the matter with you two it just that he so tonks paused cute he had to go through so much she now sounded as if she were going to burst into hysterics along with mrs weasley well dont cry about it lupin said reasonably give the boy candy or something tonks lower lip started to quiver and lupin turned to harry come on he said guiding harry out of the room while shaking his head when harry went up to bed that night he saw that mrs weasley and tonks had taken lupin seriously his bed was covered with all different sorts of candy and mrs weasley special homemade fudge there were even some cookies that according to the note on the box tonks had made herself i ll never finish all this he muttered as he tried to stow it in places where people didnthave to walk well look on the bright side ron replied you have me to share it with the next few days passed uneventfully it was eight o clock on friday evening and harry was playing chess with ron while hermione immersed herself in a book entitled are you ready for advanced transfiguration they were in the living room as was everybody else lupin was immensely enjoying watching harry and ron play chess and over in the corner dumbledore was conversing with snape and professor mcgonagall who had shown up the previous day to spend the remainder of her summer with them tonks was changing her appearance randomly for her enthusiastic audience of fred george and ginny the rest of the people were just sitting around talking excepting kingsley who was on duty a loud crack made everyone look up kingsley eyes scanned the room until they locked onto dumbledore s and briefly snape s they ve found her he said breathlessly snape disapparated with a pop dumbledore followed the room was filled with silence for a second before lupin stood up and exchanged glances with moody and kingsley stay here remus mr weasley said i ll go lupin looked as if he were about to protest but mr weasley interrupted the boy needs you with that he moody and kingsley departed stay tonks lupin directed as he sat back down he and tonks exchanged glances and tonks sat down as well well i expect you ll be meeting silver soon he informed the trio why dontyou go tell them he gestured towards ginny fred and george who were still too shocked to ask any questions but looked as if they might start harry ron and hermione quickly filled them in but other than their voices there was complete silence in the room once they had finished they sat and waited like everyone else it was a horribly tense setting suddenly with a loud crack kingsley appeared he was followed shortly by mr weasley right after that came snape and dumbledore with a girl in the middle mr weasley had what looked like a black eye kingsley had a deep cut in his hand and a nasty bruise forming on his cheek dumbledore and snape looked like they had each run a hundred mile marathon and the girl was the only one who looked untouched she was the most beautiful girl harry had ever seen she stood at about 5 4 and had dark brown hair with reddish highlights that shone every time she moved her head even a little bit it fell down to just above her elbow her eyes were dark brown and expressive and untrusting she possessed a certain feminine grace and style that harry had not seen any girl achieve before she held herself in a cool collected manner suddenly she looked at harry harry felt an electric current connect them for a brief moment he looked into her cautious guarded eyes and saw fear and loneliness behind the wall she had put up he felt her looking into him as well and he attempted to hide something although he wasntsure what he knew she had seen it and suddenly felt very vulnerable she looked away and he was suddenly aware that everybody in the room was staring at him he tore his eyes off away from her with difficulty and found himself looking into snape eyes snape was looking at him with five times his usual loathing harry had no trouble breaking eye contact with him dumbledore cleared his throat suddenly causing everyone to jump and look at him for those of you who dontknow her he said his voice quietly commanding respect this is silver she is a permanent resident here for the rest of the summer she will be sleeping in miss granger and miss weasley room i expect you all his eyes flickered over to harry ron and hermione to make her feel welcome he turned to silver you will find you are quite safe here he told her quietly now severus and i must go back and get your things silver looked horrified at the prospect she turned to snape as if to verify we must go snape told her and harry noticed that there was no trace of sarcasm or harshness in his voice she nodded but still looked terrified dumbledore reached out and tugged on a lock of her hair harry found himself wishing he could do the same remus is here dumbledore informed her as well as kingsley and arthur she brightened a bit dumbledore looked over at kingsley and mr weasley and turned back to her however you will stay with remus because kingsley and arthur are wounded they will be being attended to in the kitchen if you should need them mrs weasley tonks kingsley and mr weasley all exited on cue lupin stood and made his way over to the girl he put his hand on her shoulder as dumbledore and snape disapparated come he told her gently steering her back towards the kids she obediently allowed him to guide her harry was half pleased and half scared when lupin sat her down in between him and harry he gave harry a pointed look um harry began she looked up at him and he found that it only took a second for him to lose himself in her eyes i potter he murmured i mean harry potter harry no harry potter he blushed furiously as he spoke but he couldntfor the life of him get anything he said to make sense i m silver she replied harry saw confusion lingering in her eyes although he didntknow why harry briefly wondered if she liked his eyes too he nearly asked her when ron interrupted his thoughts i ron he said weasley harry didntneed to look at him to tell that he was goggling at her fred and george had similar troubles introducing themselves fred practically drooled on george and george got his and fred names mixed up silver regarded them coolly and introduced herself with poise and guardedness i hermione granger hermione spoke up suddenly there was a pertness to her voice that woke harry out of his half trance over her eyes he glanced at hermione to see to his surprise that she wasntsmiling at silver for a moment there was an awkward silence harry looked into silver eyes and saw immediately the hurt hermione cold greeting had given her he nearly punched hermione when ginny interrupted i ginny weasley she offered with a warm smile harry swore he saw a smile in silver eyes as she replied silver lupin was glaring at hermione hermione gave him a withering look and then picked up her book and began to read sorry about hermione ron said loudly she not usually this rude hermione looked up and gave ron an icy look i going to bed she announced getting up and walking out of the room with her nose in the air what wrong with her ron asked nobody in particular i dontthink she likes me silver commented in her particularly breathtaking voice i cantsee why not ginny replied boldly silver gave ginny a shy smile as harry wondered why he hadntthought to say that thank you she said ginny smiled back at her you have a big family silver commented glancing at fred george and ron do you only have brothers silver looked as if she were trying very hard at making conversation and immediately everyone jumped in to help her ginny complained about having so many brothers while fred george and ron complained about having a little sister fred and george were very insistent in saying that harry was somehow ron twin dontyou see the resemblance george asked seriously mischief in his eyes silver looked at harry and ron and laughed her laughter made harry feel as though he had just taken a sip of butterbeer mrs weasley tonks kingsley and mr weasley walked back into the room kingsley sporting a bandage on his hand and mr weasley a patch over his eye that made him look rather like a pirate mr weasley caught silver eye and gave her a well acted arr that made her laugh lifting harry spirits as she did so i think it time for you children to get to bed mrs weasley announced she looked around a moment and then added where hermione harry watched as the laughter left silver eyes and a wall took its place she left ron said awkwardly she wanted to read her book mrs weasley looked surprised but said nothing right then run along to bed now everyone but the twins she said shooting silver a smile fred and george wished them all a goodnight as they left and the four walked up the stairs silver a bit apprehensively when they reached the top harry stopped and turned to the girls who were going a different direction well goodnight he said ron turned and echoed his sentiments night ginny replied cheerfully goodnight silver replied he looked up into her eyes and for a moment they were both silent harry sought to get past the wall she had put up but ginny interrupted come on silver she said i ll show you our room silver quickly looked at ginny right she said turning to follow her harry and ron turned and went into their room what up between you two mate ron asked as they lay in bed i dunno harry replied i really like her eyes ron didntreply well g night ron said finally night harry replied disclaimer i do not own or claim to own any of j k rowling characters places items ect chapter 30 silver memories the rest of the week passed by in a kind of blur for harry quidditch was intense the long awaited gryffindor vs slytherin match was coming up in just a couple of weeks it was the match that would decide who won the cup since slytherin and gryffindor were currently both undefeated harry couldntwait for a chance to wipe malfoy nose in the dirt and silver was dying for a chance to beat a bludger at him she had been practicing her aim lately and had been getting pretty good on saturday both he and silver had to practice an extra three hours of occlumency for on monday harry would be attempting to break into silver mind it was sunday night and he and silver were walking back from some last minute potions homework in the library so are you ready for occlumency tomorrow harry asked i think so she replied i trust you with my memories he smiled at her that means a lot to me he replied just catch me if i fall she said half teasing and half serious you bet he replied snaking an arm around her waist they stopped outside the portrait and silver slid her arms around his neck playfully grinning he bent down to kiss her when he drew away however she looked fearful what is it he asked his brow furrowed with worry kiss me again she replied quietly he obeyed her with no protest but he was still worried when he pulled away she stood on her tiptoes and got one more kiss out of him before drawing back he held her for a moment looking down at her questioningly i a bit scared about tomorrow i guess she admitted i wontdo anything you dontwant me to he told her she smiled i know i just she trailed off uncertainly and he decided the best thing to do would be to go inside and forget about it he turned to the fat lady who immediately pretended she hadntbeen watching the whole thing snow day he said and she sprung open charisma bounded ahead of them and then silver when harry climbed through silver was standing with her hand clapped over her mouth staring at the couch harry eyes widened when he looked ron and hermione were snogging passionately completely unaware that anybody else was in the room he looked at silver who was smiling mischievously get a room she exclaimed ron jumped off of hermione and landed on the floor and hermione clapped her hands over her face as if to hide herself harry chuckled and ron glared dontlook at us like that ron you re in the common room for heaven sake silver reminded him cheerfully how long have you been there he demanded long enough she replied cryptically ron scowled at her hermione was blushing a shade of red that even ron could not often match oh my gosh she said i didn t i silver giggled need to brush your hair she finished harry snorted yeah mione it just a tad mussed he chimed in hermione hair was indeed much bushier than usual blushing she dashed up the stairs to the girls dorms ron still scowling walked to the boys silver burst out laughing as she sat on the couch harry couldnthelp but join in that was priceless he sighed silver giggled poor hermione she not going to want to face you for days me you saw it too harry protested well yes but i a girl so that makes it okay silver answered yeah well fred and george were boys and that didntmake it okay when they walked in on us harry retorted it different with girls silver answered harry sighed yeah more complicated he thought to himself he looked over at her to find that she was looking at him rather coyly what he asked nothing she said blushing slightly he grinned you wanna snog me he said in a singsong voice i do not silver answered stubbornly scooting away from him do too he argued she gave him an evil glare you wish she declared yes i do he agreed reaching for her she scooted away harry this is the common room she protested so he said nobody in it right now and a lot of good that did ron and hermione she answered smartly who are both in their dorms too embarrassed to come out anytime soon he reminded her and what about the rest of the gryffindors she asked we ll hear them coming he said hmph was her reply you didnthear fred and george after they banged the door open it was his turn to blush well if you look at it that way he said as if she were doing him an injustice she gave him a smug look a kiss then he asked a kiss she agreed scooting closer to him grinning evilly he wrapped his arms around her and kissed her with passion she returned the kiss in full and then some surprising him well i suppose it ll be easier than i thought then he thought as she attempted to draw back and failed he pressed his lips over hers again and she only protested for a few seconds before falling into the kiss she tried to pull away and he let her pull him with her down on the couch kissing her all the way harry she hissed anybody could walk in so we d better make the most of the time we have alone he replied kissing her once more she pushed against him as hard as she could but he refused to budge he felt her hesitate for a moment and then she began to return his kisses one of her hands busied itself in his hair while the other attempted to pull him closer suddenly she pulled away he frowned she had been enjoying it as much as he had he was sure of it she couldntpossibly want to stop she turned to charisma who was watching them interestedly charisma let us know if someone comes she breathed charisma obediently hopped over to the portrait hole harry turned back to her grinning broadly i knew you wanted to snog me he said smugly hush up she replied pulling him down to her once more harry hand that was around her waist began to wander as they kissed it found the hem of her shirt and began to creep underneath but no sooner had his fingers touched her stomach than she gave a sharp pull on his hair he pulled away briefly and chuckled as she gave him a warning look sorry he whispered as he kissed her apparently she accepted his apology for the word was hardly out of his mouth before she was kissing him again harry heard a squeal somewhere in the distance but dismissed it it couldntmean anything silver seemed not to hear it at all for nothing changed whatsoever in fact she was still attempting to draw him closer not that it was possible suddenly she drew back did you hear something she asked nope he lied leaning in closer the next second a sharp pain shot through his ear ah he exclaimed jumping away silver suddenly straightened up as they heard voices coming through the portrait hole she ran her fingers through her hair nervously and harry just grinned at her seamus and dean came walking in and they paused when they saw harry and silver who were sitting on opposite ends of the couch and attempting to look innocent tut tut dean said snogging in the common room how would you know harry replied smoothly button your shirt dean replied smugly and comb your hair seamus added then sniggering the two boys ran to the boys dorms harry looked down to find that the top three buttons of his shirt were undone he had absolutely no idea when that had happened how d you manage that he asked her as he buttoned his shirt she blushed furiously causing him to grin what i d just like to know he replied got an extra hand or something hmm very funny she answered dryly he went over and gathered her in his arms harry she protested trying to push him away no wait he said gently pressing his forehead against hers she stopped struggling and looked into his eyes pretend they never came he told her and upon seeing her look i promise i wontstart snogging you again she relaxed in his arms and he smiled at her his face inches from hers i love you he told her she smiled and hugged him oh harry she sighed he waited and finally it came i love you too she said it slowly but firmly he kissed her gently with no greed or hurry and she returned it i going to bed now she said as they parted although he still pressed his forehead against hers sweet dreams gorgeous he replied she smiled sweet dreams harry she answered he kissed her once more and then watched her walk to the girls dorms feeling as if he could burst with happiness telling her that he loved her and hearing her reply was better than snogging any day he decided he headed for the boys dorms with a smile on his face once inside he was bombarded with questions apparently seamus and dean had spread the word about harry and silver ron was particularly smug you just wanted the couch to yourself he accused guilty harry agreed pleasantly as he went to bed ron laughed sneaky he accused harry didntanswer he fell asleep and for once had pleasant dreams all of them of course about silver the next morning at breakfast everybody seemed to know that harry and silver had been caught making out in the gryffindor common room as a result nearly every boy who passed was giving harry pats on the back for no particular reason and many of the girls were shooting silver envious looks harry only had to take one look at snape to know that potions was not going to be a fun class that day uh i think snape knows he informed silver silver glanced up in the direction of the staff table and smiled i think he does she agreed i ll go visit him at lunch and smooth things over good harry replied because i still aiming to get an o in his class one of these days silver laughed good luck sweetheart she replied he grinned as if he had just won the nobel prize he loved it when she called him honey sweetie sweetheart or anything similar it gave him an inexplicable happy feeling charisma rubbed up against his leg and he passed her some bacon he suddenly realized that she was rubbing just below his knee he looked under the table in alarm is she getting bigger he asked silver yes she supposed to have a growth spurt around now silver replied i ll say harry exclaimed that happened overnight silver reached down and petted charisma fondly harry frowned he didntwant to think of the day when charisma would be too big to join them in the hogwarts castle both silver and charisma would be devastated the rest of the day passed smoothly until the lunch bell rang harry walked with ron and hermione to class hoping that snape wasntgoing to skin him alive he walked into the room half expecting snape to begin using every hex he had ever heard of but instead he found that silver was sitting peacefully at her desk already beginning the potion on the board snape looked up at him with his usual bored hatred but nothing more harry grinned as he sat down next to silver i take it he forgives me he said not nearly she replied but i made him promise to be civil to you because you need your focus for occlumency tonight harry snorted earning himself a reproachful glance from snape what does he care if i have occlumency tonight he asked silver looked up at him her eyes bright with something akin to anger he drew back slightly of course he cares harry you re not his favorite person in the world but he doesntwant you to be putty in voldemort fingers she hissed sorry he apologized quickly she just sighed and shook her head you re just as bad as he is sometimes she complained he cringed under her disapproval and got to work on his potion snape gave him an a although he was sure he had earned at least an e if not an o he supposed it was just snape way of letting him know that he wasntforgiven when the bell finally rang he nearly vaulted out of his seat and out of the classroom followed closely by ron where they awaited the girls hermione came out in a few seconds silver wants us to wait for her a minute she informed them harry and ron rolled their eyes but waited nevertheless in a couple of minutes silver came out and smiled at the looks on harry and ron faces oh really you two stop it she said why are you so smiley ron asked curiously he said he would come to watch me play on saturday silver replied referring to the gryffindor vs slytherin quidditch match that was coming soon well yeah he always goes to the slytherin games ron replied but he said he would watch me play silver insisted which means that he not just coming for slytherin ron snorted you think that he told her only to earn himself a reproving glare harry found it hard to concentrate on his homework seeing as his mind was already on his occlumency lesson silver seemed so nervous and yet so calm about it all she would talk about it smoothly as if it were no big deal and the next moment she would be in his arms her eyes big and teary telling him that she was nervous about it it was half annoying half amusing finally it was time for them to go to dumbledore office he noticed that silver was biting her lip nervously but she didntsay anything lemon drop they said in unison as they reached the gargoyle it sprang open and they exchanged as smile as they entered you gonna be okay harry asked as they walked up the stairway yes she replied confidently he saw a determined spark in her eyes and knew that she was speaking the truth they entered dumbledore office to find dumbledore and snape waiting there hello mr potter miss riddle dumbledore greeted you re right on time silver smiled nervously and harry grinned he knew that dumbledore had meant it as a compliment at least to him now harry i need to explain to you what you are about to do dumbledore said miss riddle since you already know you may do whatever you desire in the meantime silver beamed and bounced over to snape charisma at her heels harry watched as she began to converse quietly with him but turned his attention back to dumbledore quickly harry you are about to perform the legilimens curse dumbledore provided you will find yourself watching from the sidelines as some of the most memorable moments in miss riddle life pass by harry was about to protest that only the worst moments showed when he remembered that snape had nearly seen him kiss cho during one practice at the time he hadntconsidered it a bad memory although now he didntthink much of it kissing silver was a million times better he realized that dumbledore was still talking and hurriedly paid attention just remember that you can pull away from the memory whenever you wish all you have to do is think about stepping away dumbledore finished harry nodded solemnly as if he had been listening the whole time good then dumbledore said i assume you are ready harry nodded miss riddle dumbledore called are you ready yes silver replied without hesitating she stood up and walked with harry to the center of the room for a moment they just stared at each other and then harry spoke um count of three he asked she nodded one harry began his mouth feeling dry as he looked at her two he continued watching as she straightened up and gripped her wand more tightly three he paused and took a deep breath before performing the spell legilimens he was suddenly sucked into a bare wooden room a small beautiful young girl about eight years old was sitting in a corner seemingly waiting for something suddenly the door banged open and she flinched and curled up instinctively you worthless little somebody began the girl cringed with every word and then harry was transported to another memory the same little girl maybe a year or so older was crying i didntdo it she sobbed mommy please please a woman stepped into view but harry couldntsee her face crucio was her cold reply the small girl face contorted with pain harry was then taken to yet another memory the silver that he knew now was smiling as she faced dumbledore in a duel for what harry supposed was schoolwork her eyes sparkled with glee as she dodged a spell he threw at her canthit me she laughed happily dumbledore chuckled harry was then ripped from the scene in front of him to face another the same silver that he knew his silver was sobbing uncontrollably while a rather scared looking snape watched silver snape said quietly i know she looked up at him tears running down her cheeks what do you mean she whispered i know snape replied silver began crying again and threw herself at him what is w w wrong with me she sobbed w why didnts she l l love me snape put his hands on his shoulders and held her at arm length silver he said quietly but suddenly harry flew backwards he hit the floor hard and yelped in pain as he did so oh i so sorry harry silver exclaimed as he sat up i didntmean to do that s okay he murmured her face came into focus and he thought of the small girl in the first two memories he reached out his arms and pulled her down to him hugging her for all he was worth she hugged him back finally he drew back and looked her straight in the eye she was so brave to willingly let him see those memories memories that must hurt her you he said with conviction are amazing she giggled thank you she replied he shook his head feeling a bit dazed as he got up would you like a break dumbledore asked yes please silver replied harry had been about to reply with a no and was glad he didnt he hadnteven considered how silver must feel so he said you dueled with dumbledore dumbledore and silver smiled she is excellent at dueling dumbledore said in fact i believe she could give you a run for your money silver blushed at his praise and grinned mischievously at harry so why was that moment memorable harry asked well i love to duel silver replied and that was the first time i beat dumbledore harry snorted and she gave him a patronizing look of course he was restricted to the powers of a very advanced seventh year oh harry said and then wait seventh she smiled smugly yes seventh she replied he wiggled his eyebrows at her making her laugh ready for another go dumbledore asked them they nodded silver this time i want you to repel harry like you did that last time around dumbledore said but that was an accident silver protested make it purposeful dumbledore replied intelligently harry was a bit more on guard this time if silver could duel as well as an advanced seventh year he had better be one he said she smiled at him and he stammered over the next word as a result t two this only caused her to smile more which made him feel a good deal more vulnerable th three legilimens he was suddenly in a cold dark cave where many death eaters surrounded a throne on which sat voldemort for a moment harry thought he was having a vision but then voldemort spoke bring her to me a masked death eater pushed a fighting silver forwards voldemort reached out and took a hold of her wrist come here flower he said enticingly silver spat at him causing him to laugh you would do well not to enrage your master he advised harry suddenly felt himself being pushed backwards again ouch stupefy he yelled pointing his wand where he knew silver was protego she replied coolly harry rolled his eyes as his memories began to take over the both of them he didntfeel like seeing them at the moment expelliarmus he cried pointing his wand somewhere ahead of him the visions broke and he saw that he had aimed badly to the left and silver had kept her wand petrificus totalus silver replied flourishing her wand in his direction he groaned as his arms snapped to his sides and he fell to the floor he would have winced if he could have but he couldntmove his face muscles sorry she apologized performing the countercurse yeah he replied rubbing his shoulder where he had fallen and glaring at her well you tried to stun me she reminded him and failed he answered amusedly you are good at dueling she blushed at the compliment well children i believe you ve had enough for one night dumbledore asked politely silver nodded suddenly looking tired she walked over to snape and practically collapsed beside him i saw the vision of voldemort she said quietly leaning against him you handled it well he replied i scared she answered sounding perfectly calm no need to be snape replied now off to bed no no severus dumbledore said brightly we have time for ice cream snape looked as if he would rather go and visit with voldemort right he said sounding resigned silver giggled just what we need before bed sugar she teased dumbledore winked at her as he rang the bell potter snape said suddenly would you have a word with me on the staircase please harry was not shocked not only that snape wanted a word with him but that he had said please he nodded dumbly and followed snape to the door snape shut it behind them as they left and walked halfway down the staircase before turning to face harry you will not discuss her memories with her tonight snape told him oh really harry asked indignantly who was snape to tell him what he would discuss with his girlfriend listen up snape replied sounding highly annoyed she will have nightmares her nightmares very intense and can result in her passing out for quite some time dumbledore is taking her mind off of the matter very well by having ice cream and you will not ruin that harry was surprised she has nightmares he said finally she would prefer if you didntknow snape replied but i see fit to tell you harry nodded dumbly well um thanks he said snape surveyed him piercingly do you love her he asked finally his voice was cutting and harry suspected that anything less than a truthful yes would result in death yes he replied honestly snape made a sudden movement with his arm and harry was not sure why donthurt her potter he said if you do he didntfinish but harry could imagine snape coming after him in his sleep i won t he replied good snape growled in an attempt to be menacing it didntwork harry knew that snape was trying to protect silver and the thought made snape much less intimidating snape shook his head and headed up to dumbledore office as if he had never wanted to talk to harry in the first place harry grinned and headed back up after him when he walked in silver looked at him questioningly he winked and all through his bowl of ice cream thought of the ways he would use to distract her from thinking about her memories as a result he couldntstop grinning the entire time when they had finally finished their ice cream and he and silver were headed for the door he grinned like a madman distraction plan a he thought evilly as he slid his arm around her disclaimer i do not own or claim to own any of j k rowling characters places items ect chapter 31 the party harry awoke with an excited feeling in the pit of his stomach he jumped out of bed and hit ron firmly on the head with his pillow geroff ron muttered fine but you ll miss the game against slytherin harry replied as he pulled on his clothes ron eyes sprung open and he sat up the game today he yelled i going to shove the snitch in malfoy face harry declared ron sniggered as long as silver doesntknock him out with a bludger first he answered harry waited for ron to get dressed which was surprisingly fast for ron and the two went downstairs silver and hermione were already down there as was most of the quidditch team harry grinned as they all stopped their conversation to look up at him today the day we re going to wipe the ground with those slytherin slimeballs he exclaimed the whole room seemed to burst into applause harry grinned as he sat down beside silver she was smiling ugh i cantwait to wipe that nasty smile off of malfoy face she declared i going to hit him so hard he wontremember his own name this was met by more applause and a kiss from harry the entire quidditch team plus hermione and charisma made their way down to the great hall in a general uproar breakfast was hurried nobody ate much of anything harry glanced down and noticed that charisma was beginning to get cramped under the table uh silver he said do you think charisma getting a little big yes silver replied proudly petting her she grows about two to four inches a night harry nearly spit his breakfast out two to four inches a night he echoed she nodded harry decided that right before the quidditch match was not the time to bring up the fact that charisma would soon not be allowed in the castle any more so he was silent he soon forgot about charisma as they headed out onto the quidditch field they headed into the locker rooms to change into their quidditch robes and grab their brooms harry firebolt was trembling as he reached for it it seemed to know what was coming the team then gathered for harry pep talk which he realized he had not even thought of until then well he said this game decides who gets the cup it gonna be us the team roared their approval and mounted their brooms madam hooch and the slytherin team were already in their positions on the field harry tried listened as a seventh year by the name of devin carver introduced the team but his mind was already focused on the game both gryffindor and slytherin were undefeated meaning that this match would either win or lose them the cup he knew that they could win but he had a nervous feeling in his stomach all the same at the sound of madam hooch whistle fourteen brooms soared into the air he flew high over the game searching for a hint of gold and saw that malfoy was following him closely grinning he flew downwards and malfoy thinking that he had seen something tailed him harry flew in front of silver who took the opportunity to knock not one but three bludgers in succession at malfoy causing him to lose his balance and yelp as he struggled to stay on his broom chuckling harry rose up high once more to search for the elusive snitch spinnet passes to johnson carver voice yelled who shoots and scores that ten zero in favor of gryffindor harry began to get restless as he soared over the field he hadntseen so much as a glimmer of gold the entire time malfoy was now on the other end of the field and harry was beginning to get uneasy if the snitch was there then malfoy would catch it and slytherin would win he listened for carver voice telling them the current score and scores who scored harry wondered that leaves us with a tie of fourty fourty the scores began to rise gryffindor always keeping a ten point lead with no sightings of the snitch that harry knew of he flew around eyes searching the ground but saw nothing harry suddenly saw malfoy shoot off in the other direction he had to do something and fast it only took a moment for him to decide what to do he dived towards the ground as fast as he could and to his surprise and pleasure it worked potter seen the snitch carver roared potter seen the snitch he spotted a perfect white flower growing on the ground just below him and aimed for it he stretched out his hand and heard the gasps of the people in the stands thinking he was a few seconds away from catching the snitch he swooped down and plucked the flower without a decrease in speed and raised the flower into the air looking in malfoy direction malfoy was still flying towards something at a terribly fast speed harry could only hope that he wasntclose enough to catch it potter got the snitch carver yelled gryffindor w malfoy spun his broom around looking confused wait carver said suddenly sounding confused potter hasntgot the snitch but he got a flower suddenly carver burst into laughter potter got a flower it was a diversion he distracted malfoy from catching the sn snitch by the end of his sentence carver was laughing so hard he could hardly finish it malfoy looked angrier than harry had ever seen him and was calling a time out to talk to madam hooch with the rest of the slytherin team supporting him harry looked at the flower in his hand it was a perfect white lily he knew just what to do with it ron flew up to him laughing his head off that was bloody brilliant harry ron gasped between bursts of laughter bloody brilliant madam hooch has decided that there is nothing in the rules saying that players cantuse a flower as a diversion tactic so the game will continue carver announced madam hooch blew her whistle and the game burst into action once more the gryffindors all congratulated harry while the slytherins shot him dirty looks and muttered obscenities under their breaths harry flew up to silver who looked at him with surprise harry she said smiling that was so she stopped mid sentence as harry held the lily out towards her a smile spread over her face and her heart began to beat faster as it hovered next to her right ear wait harry thought her heart doesntbelong next to her ear that the snitch sure enough the small golden snitch was hovering right next to silver head it was staying still longer than harry had ever seen it do so before as she took the flower from him he reached out slowly and closed his hand over the snitch not realizing what had just happened she looked up at him her eyes still bright with gratitude from the flower he raised his snitch laden hand into the air as he leaned forward and kissed her and he vaguely heard carver words potter got the kiss i mean potter got the snitch potter got a kiss and a snitch he heard the silence of the crowd as they all turned to see if carver was correct he drew away from silver grinning and showed her the golden snitch which was beating it wings uselessly against his hand she beamed at him and they both began to laugh just as the crowd burst into ear deafening applause harry landed only to be pelted with hugs we ve won the cup ron was yelling we ve won the cup ron began randomly hugging every person he could reach but silver jumped away from him stop it you ll crush my flower she chided harry grinned as he fought his way past the ecstatic crowd towards silver it just a flower ron was saying it is not she protested harry gave it to me yeah ron harry chimed in as he reached them tucking an arm around silver rolling his eyes ron turned around and walked off in another direction harry looked down at silver whose eyes were dancing happily as they looked up into his you were brilliant harry she told him i wouldnthave gotten the snitch if it werentfor you he replied smiling sure you would have she replied confidently just not as fast smiling he placed a kiss on top of her head she smiled up at him but that was the end of any time they had alone for some very rowdy gryffindors including ron seamus and dean were literally pushing them towards the castle they were soon being escorted into the castle and towards the common room halfway there silver stopped harry doubled back to meet her what he asked um harry i know we re probably going to have a party and everything but i going to be a little late okay she asked harry saw that she was looking in the direction of the dungeons snape he thought bitterly he was about to protest when he caught sight of her silver locket hanging around her neck he thought about the memories that he had seen of her home life none of which were pleasant in the least and as much as he hated to admit it she probably needed to see snape who was sadly the closest thing she had ever had to a parent stupid git harry thought idly why did she have to go and pick a fun sucking leech like him harry she asked hesitantly oh sorry he said yeah sure go ahead thanks she said softly i know you dontlike him harry but i know he cut off i ll see you when you get back she smiled her thanks and set off towards the dungeons he watched as she broke into a run going around the corner he sighed and shook his head he then headed towards the common room when he arrived he was hauled in and nearly yelped when he saw what was in front of him heya harry george greeted how are you tonight fred furthered what are you two doing here harry replied nice to see you too george said sarcastically we re all waiting for you so we can go to the party go harry repeated dumbly yep fred replied proudly lee jordan having a party in your honor well okay not in your honor but we can pretend we re taking a few of these other kids with us but anyway come on wait i can t harry protested as they pushed him out of the portrait hole i have to wait for silver well where is she ron asked as he the quidditch team hermione dean seamus lavender and parvati filed out behind them she with snape i think harry replied but she said she d be back ron snorted if she wants to waste her time with that git then let her but come on yeah dean echoed i ve never been to a make out party before lavender and parvati began to giggle a make out party harry asked well why would i want to go then you dontactually have to snog harry george said you can just hang out drink butterbeer that sort of thing harry couldnthelp but notice the evil glint in his eye however no i dontwant to go he protested but he was hauled bodily through the secret passageway to hogsmeade as they set off towards the three broomsticks which lee had apparently booked harry couldnthelp but have a good time everyone was filling fred and george in on his diversion and he was beginning to feel a bit proud of himself when they arrived however it was a different story everyone was in either in couples or entering their names in the snog bowls where random names were called out for two people to snog in a closet for five minutes come on harry want me to put your name in fred prodded no harry replied shooting him a dirty look i have a girlfriend remember and i hope she not too mad at me for coming he added silently not that i really had a choice he still felt guilty though without really knowing why he was bored out of his mind as he sat at a table stirring his butterbeer and wishing that he had forced everyone to wait for silver he missed the mischievous looks fred and george were throwing in his direction ron and hermione were too busy speaking mush to pay much attention to him so he was left to his own thoughts suddenly fred came over and grabbed him by the arm ouch what re you harry began but fred silenced him okay george was announcing who will be the next lucky two to enter the closet murmurs of excitement passed around the room pathetic harry thought who would be so desperate that they would put their name in a bowl in hopes of harry potter george suddenly cried faking surprise harry was yanked out of his thoughts with shock for a moment he just stared dumbly at george who grinned and stuck his hand in the girl snog bowl and fished around and he said dramatically as he unfolded the piece of paper that he had extracted harry watched as his eyes widened and then he looked up at harry with a smile on his face he opened his mouth to say something but then the smile faded and it snapped shut silver riddle he finished lamely for a moment harry was confused but then he realized that george was staring guiltily at a something behind his back he could only hope it wasntthe something he thought it was he felt someone grab his robes and lead him towards the closet he chanced a glance to the side and his heart dropped to his toes it was silver george caught up with them as silver shoved him into the closet um well you have five minutes he was saying cheerfully silver turned to him her eyes flashing with anger if anybody opens this door i will hex them so badly they wontget out of the hospital wing for a week she hissed the entire three broomsticks seemed to be watching in silence as silver shut the door leaving her and harry in darkness harry felt more nervous than he ever had in his life silver didntsay anything for what seemed like hours the silence was tearing him up as he wondered how mad she really was when she finally spoke he wished for the silence once more how could you harry she choked he couldntsee her but he could hear the hurt in her voice i didn t he said quickly i didnteven oh you didn t did you she asked her voice cutting no he said they made me come and i told them not to put my name in the bowl you knew when you came that they would she accused you know fred and george he realized with a sinking feeling that she was right he had known somewhere in his subconscious but was he actually going to go through with it no of course not he could never hurt silver like that but i wasntgoing to actually go in the closet he protested oh yeah she asked angrily can you prove it he felt as if she had slapped him silver i would never yes you would she replied her voice rising with every word because you came you came when you knew they were going to do that you just admitted it without even knowing it he didntreply i didntwant to hurt you he finally said oh so making out with another girl wasntsupposed to hurt me she exploded well you know what you d better thank fred and george for putting your name in that bowl because i wontbe kissing you ever again she flung open the closet door and began to leave harry thoughts flew madly around his head he leaped out after her and grabbed her wrist she spun around and slapped him passionately dontyou touch me harry potter she spat saying his name with disgust harry felt her wrist slip out of his fingers and he watched dumbfounded as she ran out of the three broomsticks every eye in the room was on him and he silently willed himself not to give in to the nausea in his stomach mate ron asked quietly walking up slowly harry stared at the door where silver had just left silently and unblinkingly ron took his arm and began to lead him towards it hermione came on his other side and put her hand on his shoulder they walked out of the bar harry head spinning the entire time she left me he finally realized as they made their way outside she left me he dashed out of ron grasp as his stomach gave a final sickening lurch he vomited into a bush unable to escape the reality of what had just happened when he had stopped hermione magically appeared with a glass of water and some napkins harry used the water to rinse out his mouth and the napkins to wipe it she hates me he said finally each word coming out slowly and painfully no harry hermione said gently she just hurt right now that all she ll realize that you were never going to do it harry she will no he croaked she she really left no mate ron said quietly taking a hold of his arm harry allowed himself to be led back to the castle ignoring ron and hermione comforting words he felt numb and it wasntuntil he walked into the common room that the pain hit him hard he barely made it to his bed before he felt his knees give way hermione had followed them into the boys dorms and was still murmuring nonsense comfort to him finally she and ron were silent and they sat on the edge of harry bed harry re played the day events in his head over and over each time feeling more and more nauseated bucket he finally croaked ron dashed for the cupboards in the back of the room and returned just in time harry wretched into it although he had no idea how he had hardly eaten anything that day to begin with hermione soothed his head back onto the pillow and he had no idea how long it was she and ron stayed there with him until he fell into a restless sleep still in his quidditch robes disclaimer i do not own or claim to own any of j k rowling characters places items ect comments i know i positively evil for making harry and silver break up and the plot thickens chapter 32 routine how could you hermione hissed at fred and george the next morning we didntthink silver would come fred said uncomfortably and that matters ron answered angrily he didntwant to come in the first place and he didntwant his name in the bloody bucket harry listened to them argue listlessly they thought he was still asleep he wanted to jump out of bed and give fred and george a good punch in the face but he didn t he felt too empty to do it he didnteven know why they were still there anyway so he just lay there letting them think he was asleep well he looked so bored george protested weakly oh so you decided to keep him busy snogging a girl hermione shrieked furiously oh come off it fred exclaimed he was never actually going to snog the girl we just wanted to see how he would react and it not like any of the girls expected him to snog them they know that he loyal to silver george said sounding as angry as hermione well the whole party was a stupid idea in the first place hermione said her voice rising passionately you snuck fourteen people through that passageway if dumbledore ever found out dumbledore wont find out and if he did what would he do fred answered give us detention he probably knows anyway george added that man knows everything that doesntmake it okay hermoine replied hotly for a moment everybody was silent maybe fred said at last maybe if we explained to silver well that might work if any of us had any idea where she is hermione answered she not here george asked his voice unnaturally high well i went to dumbledore and he told me not to worry so she obviously somewhere in the castle but we can only begin to guess where hermione replied is harry i mean is he fred trailed off uncertainly if you were going to say completely heartbroken the answer is yes hermione told him he wontsay a word to us unless he asking us for a bucket to vomit into and he doesnteat so we can only begin to guess what he puking ron added i suppose we really screwed up george said you bloody well did screw up ron yelled back and you d better find a way to fix it yeah fred said yeah we will we re going to go see dumbledore george added harry heard the door open and shut and heard ron muttering under his breath they d better bloody fix it hermione sighed and walked into view she looked at him and jumped upon seeing that his eyes were open harry she exclaimed you re awake ron hurried over as if to verify for himself that harry was awake hey mate he greeted in an attempt at cheerfulness hungry harry shook his head are you sure harry hermione said it almost lunchtime harry stared ahead of him idly in reply what would be the use of eating he would just vomit up anything he ate he was sure of it he closed his eyes under the pretense of falling asleep once more after a few minutes ron spoke aw mione i cantstand to see him like this he said his voice strained he wonteven talk to us i know hermione answered but he really hurt just as hurt as silver is she didnteven listen to him mione ron said sounding frustrated ron she walked into the three broomsticks to see george reading his name out of the snog bowl and the fact that fred had dragged him up to the front of the crowd made it seem like he was expecting it to happen and no offense to harry or anything but he really isntvery good at explaining himself out of tough situations like that harry couldnthelp but be a bit amused hermione was being intelligently blunt as usual yeah but but she got to know harry wouldntdo that ron exclaimed but that just it ron she doesnt hermione replied sounding equally perturbed everyone she ever known has hurt her and harry just did the same thing to her it normal ron sighed exasperatedly well what do we do he asked finally i dontknow ron she answered i just dontknow harry stomach gnawed at him although he wasntsure if it was from his feelings or from hunger he drifted off to sleep again seeing as it was the only thing to do harry come on mate wake up ron was saying a bit tentatively harry rolled over to look at his friend silently um it monday and it breakfast time ron said meekly and hermione says you should really come on tell hermione to shut the bloody hell up harry replied evenly rolling back over ron didntanswer and harry sensed him leaving after a moment he evaded all the curious stares he was getting by putting his pillow over his head and attempting to go to sleep once more although he wasntthe least bit tired he heard the door slam open and thought wryly wonder who that could be harry potter get out of bed hermione demanded harry didntmove and hermione snatched his pillow and his blankets out she demanded he turned to look at her with amusement and annoyance but mostly the latter get out of the boys dorms hermione he said calmly and leave my bedding here if you please look harry i know you re upset but that no reason to miss class hermione said because classes are the most important thing in the world right hermoine harry answered i never said that hermione replied but what i did say was to get up so come on go away he answered harry get up she yelled harry ignored her and rolled over on his empty bed she could scream herself senseless if she wanted but he didntfeel like going to class and she wasntgoing to make him hermoine continued to scream until ron quieted her mione he not coming so just stop and give him back his bed ron said he going to miss class hermione replied as if this were the most horrible thing somebody could do yeah well he has a good reason ron replied so let get down to the kitchens and ask dobby to keep an eye on him for us and let him be hermione didntreply so ron continued if we dontgo now we ll be late to class oh alright she complied but honestly he is so dramatic harry felt his pillow land on his head and a second later his blankets landed on his legs he sat up briefly to fix his blankets and then lay back down staring up at the ceiling listlessly he didntsee how he was the dramatic one when she was the one gong ballistic because he was going to miss a few classes suddenly the door opened harry looked to see who it was but didntsee anybody a second later a pair of saucer like eyes appeared in front of his face he yelped and fell out of bed harry potter sir dobby squeaked dobby did not mean to scare harry potter right harry said wincing as he got up and back onto his bed to look at the house elf dobby hears that harry potter is very sad sir dobby said looking as if he were about to burst into tears dobby wants to help harry potter nothing you can do i afraid harry replied dobby surveyed harry for a moment before asking does dobby have permission to be bold harry potter sir go ahead harry said sitting back against the wall why is harry potter sad sir dobby squeaked harry sighed they didnttell you he asked oh no wheazy and his missus did not tell dobby why harry potter is sad dobby replied shaking his head frantically well my girlfriend kind of broke up with me harry said finally dobby wishes he could help dobby said looking positively heartbroken for harry please donttry harry replied weakly no offense or anything dobby nodded dobby will not meddle in harry potter affairs dobby said dobby is a good house elf harry didntanswer is harry potter hungry dobby squeaked suddenly no harry lied dobby looked torn but wheazy told dobby to feed harry potter sir dobby explained i not hungry dobby harry said his temper starting to rise dobby is a bad house elf dobby cried in alarm dobby argued with harry potter orders he began beating his head against harry footboard harry rolled his eyes dobby stop he yelled dobby stopped and looked at him teary eyed i hungry after all harry grumbled dobby will feed harry potter sir dobby replied and he rushed out of the room at once harry groaned hoping his stomach would choose to keep the food down when dobby returned he ate the food the house elf provided gratefully after that he kept up a halfhearted conversation with dobby in between the times when he fell asleep harry finally dressed and went down into the common room keeping watch on the clock ten minutes before the last class let out he dismissed dobby and went down to the library knowing that ron and hermione were going to rush up to gryffindor tower to see him and not wanting to face them he wandered aimlessly through the shelves looking for something to catch his eye he suddenly found it but it was not in the shelf in front of him but beyond it silver was sitting alone at a table in the library working on what appeared to be homework he watched her through the shelf in a kind of trance he had to talk to her without having her run away he had to set things right he began to silently rehearse what he was about to say when malfoy walked up harry blood began to pound in his ears as he watched him approach silver hey he greeted silver looked up shove off she replied i heard you broke up with the potty malfoy said i said shove off silver replied standing up and gathering her things malfoy face hardened and he and took her by the arm donttell me that half blood he whispered his face only inches from hers harry couldntrestrain himself any longer he stepped out of behind the shelf and caught malfoy on the side of the face with a well aimed punch malfoy staggered backwards releasing silver at once harry grabbed malfoy by the collar and shook him hard before he had a chance to recover he whirled around dragging malfoy with him and smashed him against a bookshelf with strength he never knew he had dont touch her he hissed dontyou ever touch her you re not her malfoy began but harry pressed him against the bookshelf his hand around his neck and malfoy immediately stopped talking i telling you not to touch her harry said calmly now what do you say harry pressed his hand into malfoy neck harder and malfoy choked okay i wonttouch her let me go harry released him and malfoy wasted no time in heading for the door harry then turned his gaze to silver who looked shocked in the blink of an eye she burst into tears and with a sob that made harry heart hurt she fled from the room he sighed and ran a hand through his hair canti do anything right he wondered he had been expecting at the very least a thank you he headed for gryffindor tower feeling nauseated once more i canteven keep my bloody food down he thought miserably as he headed through the portrait hole he walked past many curious eyes towards the boys dorms and when he got there he found the reason how would i know where he is ron roared i was in classes all day same as you are well you re the one that shares a room with him hermione replied like that matters you come barging in here whenever you want ron answered can one of you move harry asked dryly i about to vomit and i need my bucket they stopped and looked at him blankly he groaned and clutched his stomach as the nauseating feeling in his stomach began to grow ron grabbed hermione and yanked her out of the way harry headed for the bucket by his bed and made it just in time when he was done he lay back down and glared at his friends who were standing nervously by his bed w where were you hermione asked timidly i was in the library beating up malfoy for hitting on silver harry replied matter of factly ron and hermione exchanged glances no harry said answering their unspoken question she didntsay one word to me she started crying and left oh hermione said softly can you two go away for a while harry asked i kind of want to be alone right now sure mate ron said quietly putting his hand on hermione back and leading her out of the room harry threw up once more before he fell asleep something he had become quite good at doing even when he wasnttired he vaguely remembered that he was supposed to have occlumency that night and decided to sleep through it the next two days were the some of the worst harry had ever experienced he went to classes on tuesday for hermione sake and had a wonderfully miserable time in defense against the dark arts tonks accidentally said the word silver and although she was referring to the color rather than the person harry had to dash out of the room to wretch he didntgo back after that and flatly refused to go to classes on wednesday he couldnteven imagine facing snape in potions and didntwant to risk having to run out of any of his other classes either to his surprise however he seemed to really have scared malfoy who stayed a good distance away from him at all times he completely ditched occlumency on both monday and wednesday and amazingly dumbledore didntdo anything he supposed dumbledore knew everybody seemed to know he was sick of getting sympathetic looks from everybody and so during mealtimes he went up to his bed and took a nap late wednesday night hermione began to go through with him what they had in each of their classes she carefully explained the components and purposes of the potions snape had had them brew and explained their other classes in detail she made him do the homework required for them and told him that she would turn it in for him gee thanks hermione at least i wonthave any missing homework he said sarcastically as he began a history of magic essay your welcome she replied just as sarcastically his mind began to wander as he wrote and when he finally looked down his paper read in the early 1970s witches and wizards discovered a wonderful silver silver silver silver i cantconcentrate he announced hermione took his paper from him and read the half sentence her eyes filled with tears oh harry she said i so sorry ron looked up is it that bad he asked curiously hermione began to cry and wrapped her arms around harry after shoving the parchment as ron ron read it and looked up at harry sympathetically i sorry mate he said in the quiet calm tone he had been using so often the past few days harry felt a lump in his throat and he quickly backed away from hermione grasp he walked to the boys dorms and fell face down on his bed pressing his face into the pillow hard finally the lump disappeared and left him with a now familiar emptiness as was now routine he forced himself to go to sleep the only place he could escape reality disclaimer i do not own or claim to own any of j k rowling characters places or ideas comments sorry i didntupdate yesterday for those of you who didntnotice the server was down chapter 33 loving hate thursday was by far the worst day harry had to go through he attempted to go to classes but only made it through half of transfiguration before professor mcgonagall praise of hermione work absolutely beautiful reminded him of silver and he had to run out to vomit is it just me or is this getting worse he wondered as he walked up to gryffindor tower the rest of the day passed uneventfully ron and hermione didntpester him and so he simply lay in bed until everyone else came in to go to sleep he forced himself to fall asleep along with everyone else although he wasntquite sure how he managed it amidst all of ron snores harry awoke because of a bright light filtering in through the boys dorms ron groaned from beside him muttering something about bloody bright harry wake up a feminine voice said do you have any idea what time it is mione he answered turning to look at his clock i not mione and i have no idea what the time is silver answered pertly harry shot up into a sitting position oh he said gaping at her by now most of the other boys were awake and watching with interest she walked up to him and slapped him briskly it hurt i hate you she announced fervently i knew th he began but he was cut off by the fact that she had climbed onto his bed and enveloped him in somewhat of a passionate kiss something is very wrong he thought but whatever it is i like it she pulled away from him and looked at him with unreadable emotions in her eyes i hate you for going to that party she said she paused to let it sink in and then continued but that not all i hate you for rescuing me yesterday in the library i hate you for not talking to me this whole time and i hate you because when you look at me like that it impossible not to kiss you with that she kissed him once more he returned the kiss this time and wrapped his arms around her she pulled back but not completely out of his arms this time her eyes werenthard to read she was looking up at him with the same loving adoration that he was looking at her with he began to grin i hate you for being so adorable you know she informed him he began to pull her to him but she stopped him wait i forgot she said trying to push him away he paused looking at her intently i hate you for making me love you so much she finished he grinned and pulled her into an earth shattering kiss when he released her she was smiling back up at him so you forgive me he gathered a bit uncertainly just like that just like that she confirmed i sorry harry his heart instead of feeling as if it were going to break with sadness suddenly felt as though it were going to burst with happiness he began to pull her closer but she stopped him do you still love me she whispered her lips only inches from his more than i ve ever loved anyone he replied honestly she smiled tell me she requested i love you silver whatever your last name is he replied contentedly riddle works she replied as he pulled her into a kiss how bout potter he asked mischievously as he drew away that works too she informed him her lips brushing against his as she spoke good he replied kissing her once more this time he didntallow her to draw back but continued to kiss her get a room ron exclaimed throwing his pillow at them harry pulled away from her for a moment but silver was the one who spoke shut up ron she replied a bit breathlessly seriously we dontall want to watch you two snog all night ron replied silver sighed as she drew away from harry once more well you ve ruined the moment now she told him glaring at him and pulling away from a very disappointed harry ron looked a bit smug well we dontwant to hear mush all night either so just go into the common room anyway he answered silver gave ron a withering look as she rose and headed for the door followed closely by harry who also glared at ron the fire in the common room was dim but provided a decent light harry sat on the couch and held silver wordlessly for a few minutes half of him thinking that it was all a very realistic dream he kissed the top of her head and he could almost feel her smile why d you forgive me he asked i dontknow she answered which made him a bit uncomfortable i mean i do but it hard for me to say she corrected herself he rocked her slowly his arms securely around her as he waited i suppose it because i can t well i can t cantlive without you she said her voice barely above a whisper why is that hard to tell me he inquired b because harry i i just not used to trusting people enough to say that she said sounding a bit annoyed sorry he said kissing the top of her head once more but if it makes you feel any better i cantlive without you either it does she said sounding relieved every time i heard or saw anything that reminded me of you i threw up he informed her twice oh harry she said i sorry well it wasntpleasant he agreed but it wasnttotally your fault fred and george she sighed yes fred and george he growled next time i see them i ll do nothing she finished harry trust me they ve already punished themselves enough you ve seen them he asked surprised yes on monday they were both practically in tears begging me to take you back she replied monday harry exclaimed how come you waited until now because harry i was so hurt she said even when i realized that it wasntyour fault i was still hurt just the thought of you hurting me hurts does that make sense harry thought about it for a minute yes he said after a while for a moment they were silent harry was still rocking her and he felt her relaxing as he did so i sorry for running out on you in the library she said suddenly harry frowned and stopped rocking her why did you do that he inquired i dontknow she sighed it was too overwhelming i wanted to kiss you and i wanted to slap you and then i saw the look on your face and it was just too much what did my face look like he asked interestedly hurt she replied because of me it wasntyou that hurt me harry told her it was the lack of you he began rocking her again where were you the whole time harry asked the room of requirement silver replied i found it by accident and fred and george explained to me what it was oh he said did you go to any of your classes just potions she replied harry groaned at the near mention of snape i surprised snape hasnthexed me yet he moaned my guess would be he hasntfigured out the password yet silver answered helpfully he couldnthelp but chuckle at the idea of snape standing outside the fat lady portrait trying to guess the password so basically if i ever in the halls with no witnesses i in danger he asked amusedly i wouldntrely on witnesses to keep him from hexing you she replied he laughed yeah it is snape we re talking about he agreed i ll talk to him tomorrow silver said decidedly hopefully before he gets you comforting harry informed her she giggled and then yawned i tired she said beginning to get up dontgo yet harry answered pulling her back to him he had just gotten her back and was not even considering letting her go anytime soon plus he had slept more than enough in the past five days i cantstay awake much longer she protested just for a little bit he said scooting down into a more horizontal position she was too tired to protest and she laid her head against him sweetly in less than a few minutes she was asleep harry took in everything about her that he had missed her scent the softness of her hair the peaceful look she acquired when she was asleep but most of all just her he eventually fell asleep as well not knowing or caring what time it was it ended much too soon for his liking what are you doing hermione squealed waking him up out of a dead sleep he opened his eyes to find that he was laying on his back and silver was sleeping sweetly on top of him at hermione voice she stirred slightly but didntawaken that he could tell hush mione he answered harry you are sleeping with a girl on a couch hermione replied i should give you a detention i would prefer it if you would refer to silver by her name harry replied coolly and i wontbe taking any detentions unless she comes with me silver hermione squealed mione hush up ron called from the boys dorms we re just getting back to sleep what do you mean just getting hermione asked it morning time already i would hardly call five fifteen morning time ron answered and yes just getting because harry and silver kept us up all night hermione gave harry a suspicious look that caused him to grin and blush really mione get your head out of the gutter he told her we were just sleeping all our clothes on and everything promise it was hermione turn to blush well i never said she began but you thought harry countered hermione tiptoed over much more quietly and peered at silver so you two are back together she asked delightedly yep he confirmed smiling and running a hand through her hair how she inquired well at around one o clock this morning she came in slapped me told me she hated me kissed me and told me she loved me harry replied grinning hermione giggled as they both looked at silver who was stirring once more sounds just like her she said i heard that silver murmured sleepily harry grinned how long have you been awake he inquired long enough she replied but i not ready to be awake yet she snuggled up to him as she said so and he obligingly secured his arms around her you donthave to he said because hermione going to go back up to the girls dorms and wait until a reasonable hour to come down here hermione smirked at him as she walked up the stairs and he chuckled what silver inquired oh nothing just the look hermione gives people that boss her around he replied hmm she replied tiredly he rubbed circles on her back fully awake and feeling as if he had slept enough to stay awake for an entire week during which he fully intended never to let her out of his sight after a bit she stirred again and nearly rolled off the couch he caught her and drew her back up beside him as her eyes fluttered open she saw him and smiled well arentyou handsome this morning she asked sweetly he felt himself grinning stupidly in reply she began to scoot closer to him but suddenly she jumped up i have to get ready for class she exclaimed heading for the portrait hole he rolled his eyes frankly he didntcare if she was ready for class or not as long as she was with him where are you going he asked curiously oh i took all my things to the room of requirement she replied i going to go and get ready and i ll meet you in the great hall at seven thirty okay whatever you say he replied agreeably he trudged back to the dorms to get ready himself and was surprised to find that it was only six thirty since when did she need an hour to get ready he had half a mind to go and find her when he remembered that she was probably going to have a talk with snape so that he didnthex harry into next year when he saw him at breakfast wake up harry ordered ron flicking his ear he back ron groaned much to harry amusement yes he is harry agreed and he wants you to know that if you dontget up within the next five minutes he going to whap you with a pillow until you do muttering under his breath ron complied when they walked out into an empty common room he nearly exploded where is she oh we re meeting her in the great hall in about half an hour harry replied so you woke me up a half an hour earlier than i needed to be ron demanded yeah you looked like you had gotten enough sleep harry answered ron just shook his head you know if you werentmy best mate i think i would punch you right now he commented i know harry answered grinning hermione joined them shortly and ron became much more good natured about having woken up since she greeted him with a kiss glad you woke up now i see harry observed wryly ron blushed and hermione smiled where silver she asked uh we re meeting her in the great hall in about fifteen minutes he replied do you want to head over now she inquired oh no she might not be done yet harry replied she had to talk to snape about not hurting me when he sees me ron grinned yeah hermione tried to tell him you were out because you werentfeeling good and he docked twenty points from gryffindor twenty points harry repeated he said it was for telling a falsehood ron replied doing an excellent imitation of snape with the last three words harry began to laugh it wasntfunny that so many points had been deducted from gryffindor or that snape was so mad at him but he hadntlaughed in days and he felt compelled to be ridiculously happy ron and hermione exchanged smiles and then hermione enveloped him in a hug oh harry it so nice to have you back she sighed yeah mate it really is ron agreed giving harry an appreciative look harry grinned it nice to have silver back he replied beyond nice in fact ron gave him an odd look but it quickly disappeared to be replaced with a smile well let go find her he said we ll be a few minutes early so we ll just have to hope snape already gotten silver pep talk or whatever it is she tells him harry laughed alright come on he agreed they headed down to the great hall in good spirits when they entered harry did a double take charisma was the most noticeable thing in the entire room she had now reached the height of the table and was beginning to develop shinier feathers and a sleeker coat she spotted him and gave a squeal nudging silver in the back silver who was standing next to the gryffindor table talking to parvati and lavender turned to look at harry and the great hall suddenly grew silent harry realized that whilst everyone knew that they had broken up nobody knew that they had gotten back together he grinned and winked at silver who blushed and beamed at him in reply he was a bit uncomfortable as he made his way over to her amidst all the stares but happy all the same when he reached her he grinned put his arms around her and bent to kiss her harry everyone watching she protested weakly he grinned so he answered pressing his lips onto hers somebody gave a whoop and immediately the entire great hall excepting a selective few began to echo it silver was still blushing when harry drew away and the great hall was still in an uproar way to go harry dean yelled loudly as they sat down harry blushed uh thanks he mumbled something hit him on the back nearly knocking him into his food he turned to find that it was charisma oh hi charisma he said the hippogriff nuzzled him affectionately silver smiled she missed you she informed harry yeah harry asked amusedly scratching charisma head silver looked at charisma for a moment and charisma stopped cuddling up to harry in order to look back at her harry got the feeling they were having a conversation of sorts which made him a bit uncomfortable but he was relieved when charisma backed off so that he could eat without her head in his lap he began to eat hungrily and as he did so he observed the great hall with appreciation he had never noticed just how wonderful it was the enchanted ceiling above gave an excellent imitation of a cheerful sunny morning the students all looked so content the valentines day ball poster hung neatly on the door harry choked on his food suddenly ron hermione silver and charisma looked over in concern are you okay silver asked as he regained his composure there a valentines ball he replied oh that ron said yeah they hung up that poster on monday and you didnttell me harry demanded hermione snorted no offense harry but you wouldntexactly have taken the news well yeah you probably would have thrown up your entire stomach ron said wincing at the thought oh harry said realizing that they were right i suppose he glanced over at silver who was doing her best to look completely innocent how many people have asked you so far he demanded she shrugged a bit meekly how many he demanded six she admitted ron choked on his food and hermione nearly spit out her orange juice six harry echoed already she bit off a piece of her bacon on response you didntsay yes to any of them did you harry asked suspiciously she gave him a reproving look of course not she said defensively what kind of pig would ask you right after we broke up harry fumed who asked harry dontgo getting mad she answered i didntsay yes to any of them so it doesntmatter oh yes it does harry replied glaring angrily at every boy he laid eyes on they were trying to take advantage of you right after we broke up well it didntwork she replied calmly tell me he demanded she sighed he then spotted dean and seamus who were looking at him in a rather scared manner and blushing they did didntthey he asked pointing to dean and seamus well yes silver said dean and seamus were two of them but harry she grabbed his arm and yanked him back down as he began to stand up ready to give dean and seamus a piece of his mind and fist the others he demanded devin carter kyle lawrick neville and malfoy she answered neville harry exploded well yes but he admitted afterwards that he only asked me because he was too embarrassed to ask luna silver said so dontbe mad at him harry harry nodded briefly as his eyes searched furiously for devin who was a ravenclaw he found him caught his eye and gave him a menacing look causing devin to hurriedly look away who this kyle guy he asked um i dontreally know he in slytherin silver answered he a seventh year ron replied and he was none too happy when she refused from what i overheard wednesday at lunch and malfoy harry said looking at malfoy with loathing i cantbelieve he had the nerve harry calm down silver said a hand on his arm he reluctantly turned back to his food although he still felt like punching a hole through malfoy face ron sniggered suddenly guess what mate i d say that snape wants to kill you as bad as you want to kill malfoy he commented harry looked up at snape to find that snape looked close to foaming at the mouth harry was surprised he didntjust jump up grab his wand and yell avada kedavra while he had the chance um i thought you talked to him he said to silver reaching for his wand as snape continued to give him a death look trust me that a big improvement silver replied taking his hand out of his pocket before he could reach his wand harry groaned he had never seen snape look more hateful i cantwait until monday he said sarcastically silver laughed why because we have occlumency again she joked donteven joke about that he replied she giggled and he relished the sound without warning he put his arms around her and pulled her into his lap she looked at him questioningly for only a moment before wrapping her arms around him i missed you you know he informed her quietly she hugged him tighter in reply me too she whispered he didntlet her go until the bell rang to get to class and even then only reluctantly as they walked towards class hermione grabbed harry by the arm harry i need to talk to you she said he silver ron and charisma all stopped to look at her she gave an exasperated sigh alone she finished cantit wait mione he said looking at silver pointedly nope she replied pertly he was about to protest but silver stopped him with a hand on his arm i ll save you a seat harry she promised he watched her go longingly this had better be good mione he said as she disappeared around the corner why didntyou ask her to the valentines day ball hermione demanded uh she my girlfriend harry replied so she going with me right hermione gave him a look of utmost exasperation well lucky for you she wonthold it against you for thinking that she replied but really harry that doesntmean that she doesntwant to be asked fine then i ll ask her harry said beginning to head towards transfiguration harry you d better do it right hermione warned he stopped what do you mean do it right he asked make her feel special when you ask her hermione replied we were talking that morning before the quidditch game and she was saying how she would really like to be swept off her feet one of these days swept off her feet harry echoed what does that mean hermione sighed figure it out harry she exclaimed they walked around the corner to find ron and silver waiting for them they were talking about something but quickly stopped when harry and hermione came into view the foursome exchanged glances and then set off for class the shortened school day passed very smoothly without one hint of nausea harry noticed when classes finally let out harry was overjoyed a whole weekend of having silver to himself once more lay ahead during which time he would attempt to figure out how to sweep her off her feet hey guys want to see the room i ve been staying in silver asked suddenly sure ron replied where is it it the room of requirement harry informed him how d you find out about that hermione asked interestedly dumbledore told me silver replied actually it been quite nice having my own room i ll bet hermione said the door to the room of requirement was already there when they arrived hey the door already there ron exclaimed yeah i think it because i left all my things in it silver answered but who knows she pushed open the door and the foursome plus charisma walked into a very nice room decorated in gryffindor colors towards the left wall there was a fireplace and a single couch and coffee table in front of that towards the right wall there was a bed a nightstand a dresser and a closet on the far wall there was what looked to be a huge dog bed but harry assumed it was for charisma isntit nice silver asked beaming around at the room harry was watching charisma intently she was getting awfully big and he knew it would only be a matter of time before charisma castle days were over he looked over at ron and hermione who were also looking at charisma the three exchanged glances none of them wanted to be the one to tell silver that her days with charisma were limited in the end they made a silent decision not to say anything they helped silver gather her things and take them back to gryffindor tower and then harry and ron waited in the common room while hermione silver and charisma made their way up the stairs to the girls dorms to drop her things off when silver came back down harry wasted no time in pulling her onto the couch beside him she willingly allowed him to pull her into his arms and for a while they just sat there she buried her face into his chest and he leaned back contentedly he noticed that ron and hermione were watching them very intently what he inquired curiously you two are just really sweet hermione replied simply harry smiled and glanced down at silver you hear that hon he asked we re sweet she beamed up at him yes you are she agreed kissing him lightly harry smiled and tightened his arms around her completely forgetting that ron hermione or anybody else was in the room all that mattered was that silver was his again and he never intended to give her up disclaimer i do not own or claim to own any of j k rowling characters places items ect comments for those of you who are getting bored with romance hang in there action will be coming up after the valentines ball which is one or two chapters away haventdecided yet oh wait i lied there going to be a bit of action before that right then i ve given enough away chapter 34 what goes up ron harry said exasperatedly how do you sweep a girl off their feet it was saturday night and harry had been thinking over the question almost all day he was still nowhere closer to finding the answer and hermione wouldntgive him any clues she wanted him to think it up himself the other hint she had given him was do something to make other girls jealous he had no idea what girls wanted in the first place so that didnthelp much ron looked over with surprise you re asking me was his reply yeah shoulda known you wouldntbe much help harry mused earning himself a glare he grinned what it only true ron rolled his eyes who do you have to sweep off their feet he asked parvati harry said sarcastically who do you think it is ron grinned sorry mate he replied no need to get so sensitive hermione told me i had to sweep her off her feet when i ask her to the valentines day ball harry said and i have no idea what that means she told me to figure it out you donthave to ask her she your girlfriend ron scoffed yeah that what i thought but hermione said i had to ask her harry replied ron groaned that means i have to ask hermione harry chuckled yep so you better get thinking he agreed sweep them off their feet ron pondered do you think they mean it literally nah they d get mad if we tripped them with a broom harry answered ron began laughing hysterically that not what i meant mate he managed in between laughs it not that funny harry mumbled ron finally stopped laughing although every time he looked at harry he would chuckle i reckon we should ask for help mate he said finally harry followed ron gaze to dean and seamus no way am i asking them harry exclaimed i ve half a mind to punch them in the nose anyway aw come on you cantblame em ron said the hottest girl at hogwarts breaks up with her boyfriend just in time for the dance people are going to ask her they were taking advantage of her harry said his temper beginning to rise the low down rotten dirty little alright alright we ll go talk to someone else ron said scanning the room he groaned and harry immediately saw why the only other person in the dorms was neville harry chuckled ron it cantbe that hard he said not if hermione told me to figure it out true ron agreed sweeping them off their feet harry murmured visions of broomsticks began to form in his mind and soon he was thinking of quidditch he groaned ron i keep thinking of quidditch he exclaimed exasperatedly ron blushed me too he admitted that was entirely the wrong phrase for hermione to give us suddenly harry jumped up i ve got it he exclaimed ron jumped up too what he asked excitedly i not telling you my idea harry replied what ron said yes you are no i not harry answered smugly i thought of it and you re not using it just buy hermione flowers or something your idea is better than flowers ron groaned harry grinned let just say i ll be making a statement he replied so when does this brilliant plan go into action ron asked tomorrow at breakfast harry answered happy with himself for finding a suitable plan i going to go with the flowers ron announced harry sniggered and eventually that led to a rowdy pillow fight the next morning harry snuck out of bed early he shook ron awake knowing full well that it could result in a broken nose go away ron growled ron listen harry answered i need you to have silver in the great hall standing up at seven o clock got it silver stands up at seven ron repeated got it in the great hall harry hissed the great hall stands up at seven ron mumbled right harry groaned ron he said exasperatedly trying very hard not to scream at him silver ron mumbled stands up great hall seven go away harry supposed that would have to do i ll kill you if you forget he mumbled as he grabbed the marauder map and left he exited the portrait hole and looked at the map it took him a second to find his name but he did but a second dot was headed his way severus snape harry groaned out loud and snape dot began to quicken it pace mischief managed he hissed shoving it in his pocket and fumbling for his wand snape came around the corner just as he drew it out and for a moment the two froze snape looked at harry and actually trembled with rage harry noted that he too had his wand drawn out think harry think he told himself umm expelliarmus right go he raised his arm but snape was too quick expelliarmus snape said smugly and harry wand flew into his hand going to hex me potter snape inquired it was self defense harry answered looking for an escape route from what snape sneered nothing just give me my wand back and get out of my way harry snapped he then realized that he had made a big mistake snape took his wand and pointed it at harry throat you dontgive orders around here potter he whispered why arentyou headed for the great hall anyway harry sighed it a surprise for silver he said i going to sweep her off her feet when i ask her to the valentines ball snape eyed him suspiciously how are you going to do that he demanded it a surprise harry answered hoping that snape liked surprises apparently he didn t he opened his mouth looking as if he were about to curse harry into oblivion but then it snapped shut he looked as if he were fighting an inner battle harry was pretty sure he knew what it was finally snape spoke his voice icy it had better be good potter with that he threw harry wand on the ground and proceeded to the great hall harry let out a long breath as he retrieved his wand snape had come within an inch of causing him great injury he was sure of it he glanced at his watch groaned and headed for the quidditch field at a run once there he didntstop for breath but entered the locker rooms grabbed his firebolt and headed back to the castle he then walked quietly it was six fifty nine according to his watch he edged outside of the doors and peered in silver ron hermione and a large charisma were walking to the table hermione was holding a bouquet of flowers and holding ron hand silver began to sit down but stopped when ron nearly went ballistic dontsit down he bellowed silver jumped up and looked at her seat as if it were going to eat her harry shook his head grinning ron wasntone for subtlety he mounted his broom and gathered his courage you can do this he thought she loves you she wonthate you if you embarrass the crap out of her he let out a long breath amazing how he could face voldemort in a duel but had trouble with carrying out his plan to ask his girlfriend to the dance finally he took a breath and soared into the great hall gasps came from the students as he shot towards silver silver turned around and barely had time to register what she saw before harry pulled her onto his broomstick with him and soared upwards not losing speed the entire time harry she squealed leaning into him to keep her balance as they flew upwards what are you doing harry allowed the broomstick to come to a stop when they were well above the other students his heart racing so far so good he pointed his wand at his throat and muttered sonorus then taking a deep breath he tried his best to sound how he imagined his father would in a similar situation morning beautiful he greeted silver casually his voice echoing through the great hall she stared at him in reply a pink tint appearing on her cheeks morning she finally replied faintly he grinned i have a very important question to ask you he informed her some might call it the question she looked shocked he continued in a dramatic voice silver riddle would you do me the honor of accompanying me to the valentines day ball a few people laughed but most awaited silver response slowly a smile began to spread across her face of course harry she replied throwing her arms around him and almost making him fall off the broom the great hall burst into applause grinning harry directed the broom downwards and allowed her to slip off of it amidst all the clapping and cheers he leaned over and kissed her cheek see you in a few he said gotta go put the broom back with that he flew out of the great hall grinning he felt giddy with relief from the fact that she had said yes he hadntexpected a no but he definitely hadntbeen expecting such an enthusiastic response he felt very pleased with himself as he stored his broom and set off for the great hall he thought he had done an excellent job of sweeping her off her feet hopefully she thought so too when he entered the great hall the cheers began anew blushing he made his way over to silver she threw her arms around his neck again harry that was so sweet she sighed happily he grinned did i sweep you off your feet he inquired eagerly she laughed literally and figuratively she assured him he felt extremely pleased with himself did you come up with that idea all on your own harry hermione inquired sounding impressed yep he confirmed she smirked at him of course your first idea was probably tripping her with a broom she teased harry blushed and ron snorted actually mione it was ron informed her hermione and silver burst into giggles harry blushed harder silver leaned over and kissed him lightly dontworry honey i think it sweet she assured him she wasntdoing anything to help his blush but he appreciated it anyway suddenly ron and hermione stopped laughing looking behind him what are you doing here ron asked pointedly i just wanted to talk to silver a familiar voice replied harry groaned inwardly cho voice silver turned to look at cho who smiled sweetly at her would you mind walking with me in the halls for a few minutes she asked not at all silver replied she turned to charisma who was the size of a pony you stay here she told it firmly the hippogriff reluctantly obeyed as silver got up to leave she caught harry eye harry tried not to look guilty he had never told silver about cho and wasntsure whether he should have or not does she know about cho hermione inquired harry shook his head should she he asked hermione shrugged i dontknow harry silver smart and emotional it an interesting combination harry watched as silver and cho exited the great hall charisma chirped loudly demanding his attention what he asked charisma just stared at him uh i dontknow what you re trying to tell me harry said feeling a bit dumb charisma made an impatient noise and harry swore she rolled her eyes sorry he apologized he looked over at ron and hermione who were watching with amusement maybe silver will give you lessons on how to communicate with hippogriffs ron suggested very funny harry answered dryly he looked hopefully towards the doors hoping that silver would walk back through them hermione and ron followed his gaze we ll just wait for her here hermione said she shouldntbe long harry nodded so did i really do a good job he asked hermione smiled yes you did she assured him i think lavendar and parvati almost fainted with jealously anyhow and i daresay cho is jealous enough i never liked cho how i liked silver harry commented we can tell ron answered smiling you re way mushier with silver and more confident hermione added face it you would never have pulled that broomstick stunt for cho harry grinned guess not he admitted i bet cho ll be telling a different story though ron said wryly that girl does have a knack for exaggerating harry groaned i can only imagine for a few moments they were silent until ron commented well you wonthave to much longer mate here she comes harry looked over and sure enough silver was making her way towards them she sat down next to harry gracefully and then smiled up at them all what did i miss she inquired nothing much hermione replied what did cho want nothing much silver mimicked pointedly oh fine hermione sighed we were just discussing the fact that harry likes you a lot more than he ever liked cho so what did she want silver looked a bit surprised but regained her poise immediately she just wanted to let me know her personal views on harry she replied and what were they harry inquired silver smiled at him they were unimportant and irrelevant my little heartbreaker she replied he wasntcompletely satisfied with the information but didntpress the matter so what do you guys feel like doing today he asked changing the subject i want to go for a walk silver said charisma needs to get outside too well that settles it then he answered decidedly the foursome followed an extremely excited charisma to the doors it was a wonderful sunny day out and charisma had only taken a step outside when she broke into a gallop as she ran across the field she unfurled her wings and in less than a second she was rising into the air silver beamed and gave a little hop in the air she flying she exclaimed excitedly she sure is hermione agreed they watched as the hippogriff soared around enjoying its newfound freedom in a moment charisma had returned to earth and was trotting up to them she sat down and looked at silver and the other three were silent as the two passed silent information charisma suddenly turned her gaze on harry and silver followed suit are you two talking about me he accused silver smiled we wouldntdream of such a thing she replied innocently she turned to charisma why dontyou go fly around for a while she suggested you can meet us when we re done with our walk if you like charisma wasted no time in becoming airborne once more harry reached out for silver and she immediately came into his arms as they began to walk around the lake ron and hermione followed hand in hand a bit behind silver sighed with contentment it so pretty out today she commented harry pulled her closer in agreement and steered her towards a few large rocks they seated themselves behind them blissfully out of sight harry glanced over at her feeling playful so harry said mischievously am i romantic or what she giggled of course you are sweetie she replied oh come on he insisted say it like you mean it harry potter you are absolutely the most romantic male i have ever had the pleasure of meeting she said dramatically now that more like it he told her no matter what cho chang says she added her eyes sparkling he turned towards her and what might that be he inquired interestedly raising his eyebrows at her i not telling she replied playfully oh you re not he asked getting the feeling that a game was about to ensue no i not she declared well i just going to have to get that information out of you he told her i d like to see you try she answered sticking her chin defiantly in the air even if it means tickling you senseless he asked slyly reaching for her no she squealed jumping up oh yes he replied standing up and lunging for her giggling she escaped his grasp and headed for some trees he followed her weaving in and out of them and not realizing where they were headed suddenly she stopped in her tracks and he nearly collided into her spider she shrieked stepping back harry noted a solitary small spider scurrying in the opposite direction uh huh he said very scary she gave him a patronizing look it most certainly is she informed him they stared at each other for a second and then he grinned her eyes widened as she realized what he was about to do harry no she cried although she was laughing long before he reached for her and began to tickle her she fought to get away but he grabbed onto her and as she stepped backwards he tripped over something she gave a small scream as they fell but she landed laughing he looked at her concernedly are you okay he asked she simply laughed i m fine she managed between gusts of laughter he was still a bit concerned and he rolled off of her so that he was laying beside her finally she seemed to have controlled her urge to giggle and they turned to look at each other are you sure you re okay he asked yes she replied still smiling amusedly i good i cantbelieve you tripped he blushed well if you hadntbeen pulling away if you hadntbeen tickling me she reminded him if you had told me what cho said he answered she sighed must you be right she asked annoyedly he pulled her over to him yep he replied triumphantly she smiled at him fine then she replied in a mock exasperated tone she basically told me that you were a two timer and had a secret relationship with hermione and to dump you on the spot harry chuckled sounds like something she would say he admitted did you like her a lot harry silver asked worriedly i suppose harry replied reaching over to pull a leaf out of her hair as much as you like me she ventured hardly he replied amusedly first of all i dontlike you i love you secondly it was hard to like somebody who kept asking you about their dead boyfriend silver looked a bit confused cedric diggory was her boyfriend voldemort killed him right before i dueled him harry explained oh she said in a small voice harry entwined the fingers of his right hand with her left and for a moment they stared at their interlaced fingers did you kiss her harry silver inquired suddenly yeah well kind of harry answered it was more like she kissed me he looked at her eyes and saw that she looked worried he pulled her closer but she not half as good a kisser as you he told her in fact he paused and placed a kiss on her lips it rather hard not to kiss you when you re this close he kissed her again and felt her kissing him back to his relief she pulled away though only some of the worry gone from her eyes she really pretty harry she said he laughed she doesnteven begin to compare to you he answered he reached out and touched her cheek listen he said you re a better kisser than cho you re prettier than cho you re more fun to be around than cho i dontlove cho i love you he might have continued but at his last words silver kissed him and he was not remotely in the mood to stop kissing anytime soon he reached his arms around her but she was still hesitant she drew away slightly and looked him in the eye i love you too she said looking a bit fearful took her long enough he thought amusedly as he pulled her back into a kiss he felt one hand running through his hair and he wasntsure of the other one exact location at the moment but he had a feeling it was probably working on its second or third button he pulled away for a moment and looked into her puzzled eyes is there a particular reason you like to unbutton my shirt he inquired she blushed profusely and he grinned one of these days you re going to get to the last button and then what will you do he asked not really expecting an answer her eyes twinkled mischievously if you d just shut up and kiss me maybe you d find out she replied he complied immediately these were the times he appreciated her fieriness much to his disappointment he never actually got to find out what would happen when she got to the last button harry hermione called silver silver began to pull away but he held her for a few more seconds before letting her go what do they want he grumbled mione they re not going to be in the forbidden forest ron was saying silver sat up but harry stay laying down buttoning up his shirt they both looked around they were indeed in the forbidden forest says who ron silver piped up harry noted that she was covered in leaves and had to hold back a snort of laughter you two are in there hermione exclaimed her voice getting closer where over here silver replied harry heard footsteps approaching and soon hermione and ron came into view ron sniggered when he saw them having fun he smirked we were until you came harry answered irritably sitting up and brushing some the leaves off of silver back i ll bet ron answered still smirking hermione mirrored his look as she observed them harry glared and silver blushed harry then turned his attention to ridding her hair of leaves he was a bit unsuccessful seeing as most of them were in very small pieces ouch she exclaimed as he attempted to extract a small piece sorry he apologized sheepishly i cantget them out she ran a hand through her hair and groaned anybody have a brush she asked hopefully nobody replied and she sighed she grabbed a log and held it in front of her and then used her wand to transfigure it into a very acceptable brush nice work hermione complimented silver beamed as she ran it through her hair bits of leaves fell out as she did so she handed the brush to harry when she was done he gave her a questioning look you need to use it she told him trust me he made a face at her and she made one back then smiling he ran the brush through his untidy hair you two really shouldntgo in the forbidden forest just to snog hermione told them disapprovingly firstly harry answered we didntcome in here to snog i just wanted to tickle her that all hermione looked disbelieving and secondly we had no clue we were in the forbidden forest he finished whatever ron replied let just get out of here before we get in trouble harry got up and helped silver to her feet he put his arm around her as they headed out love you he whispered in her ear she smiled up at him i love you too she replied quietly ron and hermione pretended not to hear but werentvery convincing harry was too content to care he felt like everything was perfect and he wanted it to stay that way he tried to ignore the small voice in the back of his head that told him that whenever things seemed to be going well something bad always happened not this time he thought nothing is going to happen this time he pulled her closer protectively as if expecting a death eater to jump out of the trees and attack he wasntgoing to let her get taken away from him ever but he couldntblock out the nagging words in the back of his head saying what goes up must come down disclaimer i do not own or claim to own any of j k rowling characters places or items comments well here you have it a clue on silver parentage it not much to go by i ll admit but you get to eliminate some people from the circle chapter 36 flower harry took a deep breath as he looked into silver face she was waiting patiently for him to invade her mind and uncover possibly her worst memories he wanted to know but then again he didn t just do it harry she said interrupting his train of thoughts alright he said his mouth feeling dry here goes he closed his eyes and said quietly legilimens he felt as if he were being pulled in to silver it was a very odd feeling almost as if she were sucking him up he landed in the same wooden room where he had previously witnessed many memories of her being beaten he figured it was her bedroom a small girl of seven or eight years wearing black robes with silver trim was slinging a small backpack over her shoulder he knew it was silver from the reddish brown hair and big expressive eyes she was beautiful even in her childhood the door banged open and the girl gave a squeak and flinched get out here you useless brat a woman voice called coming mum she said quickly she headed for the door where a shadowy figure was standing harry had figured out by now that silver knew how to manipulate her memories so that her mother face was always blocked he didntunderstand why she didntwant him to know who it was but he had never pushed the matter the woman gave silver a hard punch on the side of her head as she passed and silver small head bounced off of the wooden doorway she didntcry out complain or even put a hand to her head she just kept walking she walked to the kitchen her mother following her harry saw a pained look in her eyes she sat down and her mother banged a plate down in front of her on it lay a piece of toast burnt and unbuttered silver eyes widened when she saw it and she crammed it into her mouth as if she hadnteaten in days her mother gave her a sharp slap causing her eyes to widen use your manners you filthy pig her mother hissed yes mum she whispered cringing you will be going with bella today the woman announced harry mind spun bella bella as in bellatrix lestrange he watched as the small girl eyes grew wide with fear and anxiety no mum she said bella is really mean she worse than y she was cut off as her mother gave her a shove that sent her crashing to the ground harry had a feeling the last word of her sentence was going to be you but he couldntbe sure at that moment a knock came dontargue with me impertinent child her mother said as she stalked to the door silver nodded mutely as her mother walked out of the room harry watched as tears began to fill her eyes she rubbed her head where she had been punched gingerly and a tear slid down her cheek she angrily brushed it away and sniffled up her tears yanking her hand away form her head he saw the determined spark that she so often held now pass through her eyes her mother came in and grabbed her by the arm dontembarrass me you brat she hissed in silver ear when they arrived at the door her mother voice immediately filled with cheeriness now just go along with bella sweetie and mummy will come to the meeting later she told her patting her head before pushing her a bit harshly out the door harry felt shocked when he realized that silver had been pushed towards an eight year younger bellatrix lestrange how are you kitten lestrange greeted warmly after silver mother had closed the door silver looked surprised he watched as her eyes filled with hope g good she said her voice barely above a whisper lestrange turned around and slapped her in the blink of an eye the small girl gasped and the hopefulness left how about now lestrange taunted still feeling good no she whispered good lestrange replied now let go the dark lord does not like to be kept waiting with that lestrange took off harry watched as the younger silver took a deep breath and jogged after her lestrange led the small girl through alleys where surely if the girl hadntbeen holding on to the back of lestrange robes the whole time she would have gotten kidnapped finally they arrived at a small cellar door lestrange opened it and shoved silver inside harry heard a sickening thud and then a flopping sound that could only mean silver was falling down a flight of stairs harry found it slightly annoying that you couldntmove around in the memories the way you did in a penseive but he saw pretty much everything anyway the vision blurred for a moment and then harry was staring at a crumpled heap at the bottom of the stairs lestrange walked down and kicked the girl on her way past get up she hissed trembling and wiping tears silver did as she was told with no complaint lestrange walked to a cabinet to the side of the small passageway that they were in and pulled out a mask after pulling it on she was wearing the official death eater apparel seeing as she was already wearing black robes she grabbed silver and hissed stay close or i ll leave without you silver immediately grabbed onto lestrange fear in her eyes harry saw her wince with every step she took and felt a rush of anger how could anybody treat such a small child like that suddenly something distracted him from his thoughts lestrange was making her way towards a tall figure but it couldntbe who he thought it was get off me child lestrange snapped as she and silver arrived in front of the stranger she flung silver from her and silver would have gone toppling backwards if the stranger had not reached out and pushed her back upwards lestrange gave a giggle that sickened harry you re so sweet severus she told the tall figure hardly snape replied coldly he was peering down at silver from behind his mask lestrange reached out and grabbed silver arm say hello you rude child she barked twisting silver arm silver face contorted with pain he hello she gasped lestrange continued to twist her arm and snape made an odd motion with his arms it was almost as if he were going to reach out for silver but he stopped himself let her go he snapped his voice higher than usual lestrange released silver and stared up at snape she not your child snape hissed menacingly her mother has entrusted her to my care lestrange answered snape appeared to look down at silver again although harry couldntreally tell because he had a mask on losing patience lestrange whipped around i going to go find narcissa she announced she looked down at silver keep up if you can she challenged with that she disapparated away silver gave a small gasp snape looked around and then squatted down child he said she gave him a terrified look and began to run away but he reached out and grabbed a hold of her arm she turned to him wide eyed and scared out of her wits you re running the wrong way he told her she over there by the man with the long blonde hair silver looked over to where snape was pointing and there were two masked women and a tall man with a blonde ponytail no doubt it was narcissa lucius and bellatrix silver turned her gaze back to snape still wide eyed thank you she whispered snape let go of her arm and stood up but silver remained there staring up at him he looked up for a few seconds before glancing down at her once more you re still here he commented you re not going to hit me silver asked in awe no child he replied impatiently not once silver prodded no snape answered sounding uncomfortable her eyes widened and lit up and she shot him a shy smile thank you she whispered again then she turned and ran to lestrange harry followed silver clung to lestrange robes and stared over at snape for a long time until suddenly everybody hushed then they began to assemble hurriedly into a crescent before voldemort throne in which he was now sitting welcome voldemort greeted them sounding not unlike snape when he welcomed his classes at the beginning of the year silver turned away as he began to call his subjects up and punish them and harry turned to watch her she seemed to be fighting some kind of inner battle he reached out a hand to comfort her but it passed straight through her curse these memories he thought frustratedly he was forced to settle for watching her suddenly lestrange reached out and yanked her into a standing position here she is my lord she said pushing silver towards the throne voldemort turned his head toward silver and she gasped his snakelike red eyes seemed amused silver began to fight against lestrange turning and trying to run in the other direction lestrange gave her a powerful punch and she fell into submission out of the corner of his eye he distinctly saw a death eater flinch when silver was punched he could guess who it was sorry my lord lestrange said wrestling silver up to his feet voldemort reached out and took silver arm go he hissed at lestrange who hurriedly ran back to her place he then turned to silver and spoke to her in a low voice which no one else could hear stop fighting me he whispered never silver answered he laughed and then spoke to the crowd in my hands at this very moment is one whom i sense has great potential he announced she has a strong and determined spirit i am pleased i dontwant you to be pleased with me you great git silver exclaimed loudly several death eaters gasped voldemort turned to her and began to laugh harry had a feeling that normally that type of behavior would have resulted in death you will change your mind young one he said and then leaning so close to her that she winced you will change your mind he released her as she was still struggling and she fell back off the small stage that his throne was set up on and hit her head she didntmove and harry guessed she was unconscious leave her voldemort ordered although nobody made an effort to get her harry began to walk towards her unconscious figure when he began to spin again he knew he was being taken to another memory finally he landed just outside of silver house to find himself looking at bellatrix lestrange once more he inwardly groaned he really didntfeel like seeing her any more he was angry enough as it was the silver he was looking at was the same one that was sitting across from him on the couch at that very moment her eyes had their guarded look and she was still shouldering a small backpack lestrange looked at her and smiled in a horribly sickening way how are you my sweet she asked her voice sickeningly sweet terrible silver replied sarcastically lestrange knocked her firmly on the side of the head hold your sarcastic tongue in the future she ordered lestrange turned and began to walk and with a roll of her eyes silver followed harry got the feeling that she was used to being punched in the head by now lestrange was leading her through the exact same alleys that they had walked through when silver was seven lestrange kept glancing at her watch and muttering late when they arrived outside the cellar door lestrange turned to silver menacingly you d better hope he doesntremember you from last time she hissed and you had better be respectful i wontbe respectful to anyone who sees fit to take the lives of innocent people silver whispered looking to the side lestrange grabbed her by the hair and yanked her forwards what did you say she hissed i i said silver began wining in pain as lestrange continued to abuse her hair you heard what she said did you not a voice suddenly came lestrange turned to look at a very angry looking snape what it to you she spat i was just wondering if you were as deaf as you are dense he replied evenly lestrange let go of silver hair why are you defending the girl severus she asked a smile playing upon her features snape features hardened you are giving her unjust punishment he answered lestrange let out a laugh oh she deserves it she assured him did you not hear what she said i thought we already covered the fact that i had snape said in a bored voice fine lestrange said looking both confused and appalled here have fun with her she opened the cellar went in and closed it firmly behind her snape and silver stayed put for a moment before snape opened the door and went in not even looking at silver silver eyes glowed with curiosity as she followed him down the stairs at a trot you she said panting as she caught up with him i remember you he pulled a mask out of the cabinet and examined it i doubt it he answered i do she insisted you saved me last time too snape gave her a sharp look remember silver asked no snape replied putting his mask on and reaching for the door wait silver cried amazingly snape waited he turned to silver his expression unreadable due to the mask thank you silver said quietly snape turned and entered the chamber before another second had passed harry watched as silver eyes filled with confusion she tentatively opened the door and looked around until her eyes locked on snape she began after him but swiftly changed course shaking her head to herself she stood in a corner by herself waiting he guessed for the meeting to begin as she waited she began to shake as she looked towards the throne for a moment everything became fuzzy and then harry was watching as silver was shoved up towards voldemort once more she stood defiantly beside his throne not looking at him or acknowledging him in any way voldemort eyes swept over her greedily now here a sight for sore eyes he commented silver turned to him angrily dontyou say that about me you dirty old git she exclaimed indignantly in response voldemort reached out grabbed her wrist and yanked her to him he spoke as loudly as before looking straight at silver you would do well to remember who i am my innocent little flower he told her i know very well who you are tom she answered harry eyes bulged out was she crazy she was talking to voldemort as if he were an inferior voldemort twisted her arm causing her to wince you will not call me by that name he demanded i will too she answered harry had the crazy urge to laugh at the way she spoke to voldemort she was treading on very thin lines in fact he wondered why voldemort hadnteither killed her or used the cruciatus curse yet i like your spirit he informed her you will make an excellent addition to the ranks i not joining any r let go silver cried he had exposed her forearm and was about to press his finger onto it in order to give her the dark mark he looked up at her in amusement as you wish he said letting go but you may not leave or you will take the mark silver seemed to debate for a second before clutching her arm close to her and glaring at him i see you have not much changed since you were eight he said of course i am talking about your mental development you seem to have made quite an improvement physically silver blushed you horrid dirty old man she accused voldemort laughed you flower are good for a laugh he informed her my name isntflower and i wasnttrying to be funny she informed him your name is flower if i say it is voldemort replied and i didntask if you were trying to be funny did i hmph was her reply voldemort directed his gaze to a group of very shocked death eaters do you see the mercy of your lord he asked a rousing chorus of yeses answered him he grinned this girl you see before you who openly denies my name you will soon see bow before me he told them of her own free will then you will see the power of your master silver snorted loudly and voldemort head snapped towards her harry saw definite annoyance are you asking for torture he inquired twirling his wand about she glanced at it warily no she conceded i suggest you keep your mouth shut unless you would like to compliment me he answered silver glared voldemort continued to tell them about his future plans for silver which included bringing animals over to the dark side and making her his personal apprentice silver rolled her eyes at each of his suggestions which caused him to become undeniably annoyed yet amused harry personally felt that he could roll over laughing the way she treated voldemort was unparalleled even dumbledore did not address him so casually or rudely and voldemort seemed to be refraining from punishing her although harry supposed it was for obvious reasons the only way he would ever get her to the dark side was by sweet talking her that much was obvious when the meeting was dismissed lestrange left silver to walk home herself as silver walked home not noticing a certain potions master behind her she fumed to herself rather loudly i suggest you keep your mouth shut unless you would like to compliment me she mimicked in a high voice oh well all right tom how about your breath smells better than oh wait nothing you re better looking than oh wait nobody your morals are higher than oh look nobody again is anybody sensing a pattern harry glanced at snape who was walking behind her and trying very hard to keep from smiling as they came to a fork in the road he spoke to her in his usual harsh tone i would suggest keeping your voice down a bit with that he took the opposite road from silver silver jumped and then backpedaled instantly to watch him until he disappeared behind a curve then she turned to continue home and harry felt a spinning feeling once again this time he landed in the memory that he had seen before it started exactly where it always started bring her to me voldemort said a masked death eater whom he assumed was lestrange pushed silver forwards silver fought with a passion but voldemort managed to reach out in one swift motion and grab her arm come here flower he said she spat at him and he laughed you would do well not to enrage your master he advised her you re not my master tom she replied and you never will be voldemort eyes filled with rage apparently that had been the last straw he threw her from his small stage and she landed on the ground but still conscious crucio he hissed pointing his wand at her silver bit her lip hard to keep from crying out and he laughed you cannot escape it he cried finally silver mouth opened and she let out an anguished cry voldemort laughed with satisfaction as he lifted his wand there now he said i take it you are feeling more compliant she got up eyes flaming and spat at him once more the wad of saliva landed on the lap of his robes tears streaming from her face she got up and began to run for the door a few death eaters began to get up but voldemort stopped them no he said quietly his eyes bright with rage let her go she will still be mine harry watched as silver ran blindly through the dark alleys until she came to the edge of the forest she ran right into it without thinking sobbing suddenly he began to spin again and then he heard her voice harry he opened his eyes and there she was sitting in front of him her eyes were bright with tears he pulled her close and she cried silently for a few moments before wiping her eyes a glance at the clock revealed that time had passed quickly and it was nearly bedtime and well past dinnertime he didntfeel remotely hungry however so he didntcomment when she pulled away her eyes were still bright that was the only time i ve ever cried out when i was abused she said quietly it hurt a lot harry well he was pretty mad harry said trying his hardest not to look too amused you sure do know how to bug him dontyou to his surprise she smiled yep she admitted rather cheerfully it was like a game to me see how much i could taunt him before he kills me harry brow furrowed why would you want to do that he asked well harry i had nothing to live for she replied softly the only thing i knew was that i didntwant to become a death eater so i didn t harry was silent for a moment and she leaned into his arms you ve known snape for a long time he said at last he protected me before he even knew me she agreed and that why he not a git harry not to you harry said but honestly think of his passwords silver gave a halfhearted laugh okay then she conceded he not a git to me she suddenly buried her head into the front of his robes oh harry what if he dead right now she asked harry wasntsure how to respond but he did the best he could he would have died for what he wanted to die for you he answered i dontwant him to die for me she replied i dontwant him to die at all memories of sirius began to wash over harry as if his death had happened just yesterday i know he croaked they held each other for a long while and even after silver fell asleep she was still holding him tightly he took her in his arms and carried her over to snape bed he pulled back the covers and set her down in it and then pulled them up to her shoulders she stirred and her eyes fluttered open momentarily dontleave me harry she said quietly before closing her eyes once more he felt it would be wrong to sleep under the covers with her so he lay down on top of them she scooted over to him unconsciously and he put an arm around her blanketed figure his mind drifted back to sirius death as he fell asleep suddenly he felt something hit the side of his face his arm still around silver he peered upwards and nearly yelped snape was standing above him looking angrier than he d ever seen him get out of my bed he demanded fiercely harry obediently and quickly jumped out fearing for his life snape bent a bit so that his face was close to harry s he was breathing hard and trembling with rage his face beginning to redden harry had definitely never seen him this mad what were you doing in bed with her he asked looking as if he d like nothing more than to strangle harry we didntdo anything harry said defensively she asked me to stay with her why would she do that he demanded because she just showed me her memories of voldemort using occlumency and she probably didntwant to be alone is that a problem harry answered he knew he had made a mistake when snape raised his wand and pointed it at him harry couldntdo anything but stand there trapped between the bed and the nightstand as snape opened his mouth to curse him with who knew what but silver saved him she cried out and both of their heads shot towards her no she cried i didntdo it she began to flinch repeatedly as if somebody were hitting her hard she screamed out this time and harry watched in shock as snape reached over and took a hold of her flailing body silver he said quietly wake up i m not a death eater she yelled flinching in between words silver snape demanded shaking her gently but firmly at the same time her eyes shot open and she looked at snape with surprise you re alive she whispered then her eyes rolled into the back of her head and she fainted get me a revival potion potter snape ordered the cupboard on the left wall harry walked up to the cupboard and opened it to be presented with a variety of different potions he had absolutely no clue which one was a revival potion he stood gaping at the contents for a moment until he was swept into shadows snape reached past his head and grabbed a glowing white potion damn you potter you re useless he snapped as he walked back towards silver harry tried to think of a comeback but he decided it was best not to insult a man who hated his father guts hated his guts and had just discovered him sleeping in his bed with the equivalent of his daughter instead he watched as snape propped her up and trickled some of the potion into her mouth her eyes fluttered open as he emptied the vial contents down her throat she looked at snape for a long time before reaching out and touching his cheek with a scared look in her eye you re really alive she said at last yes he confirmed she enfolded him in a tight hug and refused to let go for several minutes harry couldntsee snape face from where he was standing but he watched as tears began to trickle down silver cheeks finally she drew away harry edged over to the side to get a glimpse of snape face i thought you were d dead she sobbed snape rolled his eyes in annoyance well i not he answered so you have no reason to be crying silver wiped her eyes and nodded s sorry she sniffled you have nothing to be sorry for snape answered now go back to sleep he flicked his wand and the lights went out leaving only a dim fire you get the couch potter he announced harry walked over to the couch and lay down on it no sooner had he lay down than something hit him in the face a pillow a second later two blankets sailed over and dropped on his face he wondered if snape was trying to suffocate him and make it look like an accident after fixing his blankets he snuck a glance over in silver direction over the top of the couch snape had conjured up a fluffy reclining armchair next to the bed and looked as if he were already asleep silver was sleeping on the edge of the bed closest to the armchair and snape and he could tell that she was already sleeping he lay back down and closed his eyes and heard a distinct shuffling from the other corner of the room he didntbother to see who it was but instead focused his remaining efforts on clearing his mind to ensure a good night sleep disclaimer i do not own or claim to own any of j k rowling characters people items ect comments wowie am i a day late with my updates sorry i got back from camp a day late but dontworry i am not currently experiencing any form of writer block so you can be expecting regular chapters once more chapter 38 the meeting harry stayed completely silent as snape lay silver down on the bed in the room she had stayed in over christmas break he watched as snape looked from silver to the glowing white potion on the nightstand and harry knew he was wondering whether it would be better to awaken silver or let her wake up on her own either way the tears were certainly coming finally snape seemed to have come to a conclusion he propped silver up and uncorked the vial harry prepared himself snape allowed the contents of the vial to trickle down silver throat and soon her eyes fluttered open she acknowledged harry with a brief glance and then looked at snape was it a dream she asked hopefully snape shook his head and she looked downfallen you cantdie she told him you just can t you can hide from him and have the mark on my arm burn me to kingdom come snape replied bitterly silver reached out and brought snape arm over to herself she pulled up the sleeve and stared at what harry knew was the dark mark she traced it gently with her finger and then looked up at snape voldemort wants me really badly she said so you could give me to him harry and snape both did a double take then he wouldntkill you or at least he would give you more time silver continued excitedly and you could say you were training me to be a spy at hogwarts to have me get close to harry for you and really you could train me to be a spy for the light side as she finished her idea her eyes sparkled with pride i think not snape answered a bit coldly her face fell why not she inquired snape put his hands on her shoulders because you will not suffer like i suffer he exclaimed loudly silver looked too surprised at the fact that he had yelled at her to say anything harry himself was a bit surprised at snape strong reaction i will not have you take the dark mark snape yelled still angry i will not have it okay silver said meekly but snape didntappear to hear her foolish girl think of yourself he ranted you have no idea of what it takes to defy your own thoughts and emotions in front of the dark lord whilst you are being punished no idea but you could teach me silver protested weakly snape gave her a piercing glare i would have to torture you in order to do it he said fiercely and as long as i am alive you will not be hurt in any way no matter what the reason silver lower lip began to tremble but i dontwant you to die she whimpered softly snape looked at her for a long moment his emotions unreadable we cannot always have what we want silver he said finally his voice although still harsh was a bit softer a tear trickled down silver cheek please she begged you cantjust let him kill you we can be spies together i ll do anything you want learn anything you want and i am thinking of myself i want you to stay alive for a long long time harry could see that she was holding back sobs i will not have you suffer for me snape told her firmly then dontdie she wailed as the sobs surfaced snape looked taken aback for a moment as he looked at silver dontsay such things he told her sternly i w will suffer i if you d d die she sobbed stop it snape snapped in reply i wonthear of it oh yes y you will she answered angry through her tears b because it s t true snape looked almost offended dontbe foolish child he said i c can be f foolish i if i want she replied y you are too this time snape definitely looked offended i most certainly am not he argued are too was her response i l love y you utter rubbish snape answered stubbornly silver turned and buried her face in her pillow wailing incomprehensibly snape looked half confused half angry a spy for the light side he scoffed to himself females silver wailed something in which the words stubborn idiots and men were distinguishable snape looked mildly amused i would appreciate it if you would come to your senses and have a clear conversation with me he informed her matter of factly after a minute or two silver managed to sniffle up her tears and turn to snape are you ready to talk he asked calmly only if you take back what you said she replied about females snape asked no about me loving you being utter rubbish she answered it is snape said silver grabbed a pillow and hit him firmly with it snape looked surprised and amused take it back she yelled at him very well he said unconvincingly i take it back you didntmean it she accused no he agreed why she asked looking on the verge of tears once more because snape answered managing to sound as if his answer was sensible it not rubbish though she said it true snape didntreply so she continued cantyou please take it back and say something else she asked such as snape asked well an i love you too would be appropriate seeing as you do love me she suggested he raised his eyebrows at her dontyou she asked he was stubbornly silent her eyes began to get teary dontyou she repeated in a small voice must you force me to make a fool of myself he demanded irritably she nodded yes he said through gritted teeth she smiled at him for a few moments i ready to talk now she then announced snape looked as if he would rather leave the room i ll bet you are he muttered glaring at her and receiving a bright smile in reply after a couple of seconds she tilted her head questioningly at him looking a bit like a puppy harry thought it was cute silver snape said solemnly i want you to promise me that you will do everything in your power never to receive the dark mark silver looked hesitant not even for you she asked quietly especially not for me he replied she turned away from him for a moment looking out the window intently silver it not worth getting tortured over snape told her not for me not for you but he would let you stay alive longer she protested if i told him you had lured me into coming to him no snape replied he would get impatient as he always does and finish me off and then you would be left with no choice but to be a spy or a death eater silver turned back to him do you want to die she asked quietly snape stared back at her for a long while before responding i not sure he finally answered silver leaned forward and put her arms around a very stiff and uncomfortable looking snape she hugged him tightly her eyes squeezed shut behind his back i dontwant you to die she whispered he didntrespond he merely looked at her strangely when she released him and then got up and walked out of the room silver turned her eyes to harry oh harry she sighed he walked up to her and hugged her tightly kissing the top of her head in the process she scooted over and motioned for him to sit down beside her he did as requested and they linked hands i dontknow what to do with him sometimes silver said quietly how can he not know whether he wants to die or not harry wondered aloud silver squeezed his hand in reply it hard to explain she answered but i ve felt the same way when he asked after i met dumbledore she replied after you met dumbledore you considered death harry asked wryly no harry she said her voice patient after i met him i considered living he looked at her questioningly i had nothing to live for before he gave me hope she explained still patient he reached over and pulled her to him he held her tightly for a long time before releasing her i glad you decided to live he told her she smiled me too harry she answered harry pulled her to him once more and ran his fingers through her hair absentmindedly he wondered what he would be doing right now without silver so much would be different almost nothing would be the same in a way silver was even responsible for getting hermione and ron together snape would still be his bitter sarcastic self well okay so he still was his bitter sarcastic self but not all the time although she didntknow it silver had spread happiness into the lives of many different people what are you thinking she asked him suddenly he discovered that she was looking at him intently you he replied do you have any idea how amazing you are she looked puzzled i not amazing harry she said half chiding he smiled at her you ve changed a lot of lives for the better he replied she tilted her head her hair falling to one side me she repeated you he answered she looked doubtful i dontknow harry she said looking away i dontthink so at all he gently turned her head back towards him well it true he replied i not amazing at all though she protested he grinned you re an amazing kisser he said playfully she giggled and just how many girls have you kissed harry potter enough he answered she raised her eyebrows at him and he pulled her to him he kissed her softly and briefly but all the same meaningfully she sighed as she drew away i ve only ever kissed you she said thoughtfully as she leaned her head against his chest but i think you re a good kisser just the same he couldnthelp but laugh hopefully that wontever change she smiled eyes sparkling what the fact that i ve only ever kissed you or that i think you re a good kisser both he replied as seriously as he could she smiled they won t she assured him harry began to tighten his arms around her but suddenly his scar seemed to burst with pain the room began to get fuzzy and he felt himself losing his grip on it the next thing he knew he was on his hands and knees on the floor yelling with pain harry silver shrieked jumping up he groaned and put a hand to his forehead the room spun around him making him feel nauseated what all this racket snape demanded from the doorway it harry silver said sounding close to tears please help him harry thought it mildly amusing that silver trusted snape to help him when snape probably saw it as a perfect opportunity to murder him what is it potter snape demanded scar he grunted as fresh waves of pain began to wash over his head although none as painful as the first obviously snape answered dryly what about it voldemort frustrated harry answered barely able to make out the words hurts a lot would you like to see dumbledore snape asked harry couldntrespond for at that moment he heard a frustrated yell that came from neither snape nor silver but from himself but it wasnthis yell suddenly the world went black just before it did he heard silver give a concerned cry he found himself in a cold dark but seemingly familiar room he was sitting at a stone desk that was covered with half burnt parchments and he was more angry than he ever had been in his life he looked at his arm which was stretched out in a fist on the desk in front of him and pulled up his sleeve he gave a strangled yelp as he saw the dark mark ah harry he said pleasantly here you are again enjoying yourself it took harry only a moment to figure out that he was voldemort or rather he was inside of voldemort somehow he didntreply so how have you been he asked himself pleasantly that not me that talking he reminded himself its voldemort very observant of you voldemort said dryly oh great harry groaned to himself dontyou enjoy my company voldemort asked him amusedly no harry answered silently suddenly an image of silver flashed in front of his eyes voldemort gave a laugh having fun with my little flower harry he inquired i dontknow what you re talking about harry thought furiously donttell me you dontknow flower voldemort said she a very beautiful girl you seem to have met her before do you know her well harry felt a gigantic force pressing on his mind his brain he knew voldemort was trying to access his memories of silver i don t know what you re talking about harry repeated stubbornly dumbledore just introduced her to me why do i sense a lie voldemort snarled harry couldntanswer he was too busy concentrating on blocking the force attempting to access his memories show me voldemort demanded there nothing to see harry thought in reply so go away where have you learned this voldemort demanded outraged why can i not see because you re a prick harry thought voldemort gave a cry of fury which broke the force bearing down on harry mind at the same time an unbearable pain enfolded him beginning at his scar and flowing through his body he gave a near scream of pain and felt a vibration in his pocket suddenly a blinding white light filled the entire the room voldemort roared with anger this time what is this he demanded what is this harry heard something fall to the floor and shatter he was being suffocated by the light just like in the passageway but at the same time so was voldemort voldemort voice filled the room as he shouted out an incantation that caused the brightness of the white to fade to a mild gray voldemort repeated the incantation louder and louder and harry found that it was impossible to concentrate through the pain that voldemort anger made him feel suddenly as if a switch had been clicked the blinding force disappeared and he and voldemort were alone in the cold room where have you gained possession of such a weapon voldemort demanded what is it there was something in his voice fear no not fear but perhaps apprehension voldemort was nervous about the torch of course he had no way of knowing that it was actually a torch harry suddenly felt superior you re scared of me harry thought in reply i not any more scared of you than i am of your little schoolyard friends voldemort sneered in reply the same strong invisible force began to bear down on his mind once more well then you must be pretty scared of them then harry thought back almost teasingly as he struggled to hold voldemort off do not tease me voldemort commanded angrily a sharp pain shot through harry body and suddenly he saw before him the dark spiraling staircase where he had found the torch he gritted his teeth and used every ounce of his willpower to push voldemort out what does this mean voldemort muttered to himself didntknow you were in the habit of talking to yourself harry thought shut up voldemort answered irritably i should like nothing more than to kill you at the moment but you wont harry answered as he fought against the force voldemort was still pressing on his mind because you need some information out of me now dontyou foolish impertinent child voldemort snarled i shall kill you potter make no mistake go ahead and try harry answered boastfully voldemort chuckled manically and harry suddenly felt cold there was nothing inviting amusing or happy about that laugh at all it was purely dark not at all how a laugh was supposed to be proud are we voldemort inquired interesting harry didntrespond very well then voldemort said sounding irritable once more you are dismissed dismissed harry repeated angrily you cantdismiss me you donthave any control over m but as he thought the cold stone room he was in drifted out of view and he found himself staring up at silver dumbledore lupin ron hermione and snape he sat up groggily hello harry dumbledore greeted the others looked too shocked at the fact that he was awake to do anything silver suddenly seemed to overcome this and let out a sob as she flew into his arms he rubbed her back comfortingly you re all right he told her b but harry y you you she trailed off and cried into the front of his shirt i all right too he replied no need to cry she managed to sniffle up her tears and he pulled her up into a more comfortable position in his lap she rested her head in the crook of his neck still breathing shakily harry looked up at the others who were looking at him questioningly would you mind explaining harry dumbledore asked in a rather upbeat way uh sure harry answered glancing down at silver my scar started to hurt and uh i guess i blacked out and then i kind of talked with voldemort for a while until he sent me back here silver arms tightened around his neck harry she sighed harry didntget a chance to reply because dumbledore spoke very interesting dumbledore commented and how did you and voldemort converse well i was in his body and when he spoke it felt like it was me speaking harry replied and for me to talk to him all i had to do was think what i wanted to say and he heard it dumbledore opened his mouth to speak but harry cut him off oh yeah and he tried to use occlumency on me he found out that i know silver but i just told him that you introduced her to me once he got a bit angry when he couldntaccess my memories so my scar start to hurt again and the torch went off just like in the passageway i think it might have scared him a bit at first but he said an incantation that made it fade away and it finally disappeared my scar hurt so much that i couldntcall the light back he got a glimpse of the passageway where i found the torch but it was really dark and he couldnttell what it was then he well he sent me out of his mind he told me i was dismissed and then i just woke up as harry finished explaining dumbledore looked half worried half interested well now harry i think you handled yourself very well considering the situation dumbledore replied his gaze however rested on silver harry immediately felt extremely guilty and it must have shown on his face it not your fault harry lupin and hermione said at the same time yeah i know harry replied in a voice that clearly said that he didntknow any such thing silver looked up at him her beautiful brown eyes searching his intently at first he wanted to hide his feelings from her but he found that it was nearly impossible dontfeel guilty because of me harry she said gently caressing the side of his face you didntdo anything wrong and i dontwant you thinking that you did harry was still troubled as he looked down into her sweet face he had given voldemort a big clue in revealing the fact that he knew her and i probably going to kill her just like i killed sirius he thought miserably he found himself unable to meet her gaze any longer and he turned away his eyes and throat stinging terribly harry please look at me silver said pleadingly he reluctantly turned back to her she spoke words of comfort to him but he didnthear it all he knew was that he was putting her in danger he would give up anything for her but what if what he really needed to give up was her if he was no longer around her she would probably be in less danger and less danger was what he wanted for her he looked at her beautiful innocent face guiltily her pretty brown eyes were pleading with his questioning him harry she asked are you listening i putting you in danger he finally said no more than i am you she answered but you re more important than i am he snapped surprising her of course i not harry she protested you are too he answered stubbornly determination filling him and you dontneed to be around me anymore harry she exclaimed why does she have to make this so hard he wondered he gently pushed her off his lap although it pained him to do so harry no she whispered he made the mistake of making eye contact with her it nearly killed him her eyes swam with pain and it seemed to swallow him in making him unable to bear to be away from her he used every last ounce of his willpower to make his next statement it safer for you though he said she shook her head please she asked her voice barely above a whisper her eyes pleaded with him to take her into his arms and hold her he couldntrefuse the thought of being without her was unbearable anyway he reached out for her and pulled her to him she clung to him tightly as if she were never going to let him go he realized how much he had affected her harry you are so upsetting sometimes she informed him i hate you despite her words he felt a grin forming on his face really i couldnttell he teased she pulled away just enough so that she could look into his eyes now that she had gotten over the momentary fear of having to be away from him she was much more confident and determined looking a fire seemed to be lit in her eyes as she looked at him half loving half reproving sorry he apologized sheepishly hmph she replied i love you he tried she melted into his arms immediately harry sighed tired she asked yup he replied meetings with voldemort can really wear you out wouldntyou say she giggled yes i believe they do she agreed he looked up at lupin who winked at him he smiled in reply hermione was smiling a silly sort of smile as she observed them and ron had a half questioning half interested look on his face snape looked as if he were about to kill harry but couldntthink of a way to get to him without hurting silver dumbledore merely looked amused very well then harry dumbledore began but silver interrupted professor dumbledore she said politely when will harry and i be able to come back to the castle dumbledore looked surprised and silver quickly explained her request in time for the valentines day ball she asked eagerly harry grinned cute he thought dumbledore smiled actually miss riddle i think that you will both be ready to come to the castle later on tonight but right now i am thinking that harry needs a nap in a quiet place and you know what you need to do silver nodded and harry was a bit confused what did she need to do so you may come back tonight around eight dumbledore finished silver smiled good she said decidedly she looked over at harry you do need a nap you know she informed him he smiled wryly gee thanks he answered she beamed up at him and he couldntresist bending down and placing a kiss on top of her head her eyes danced happily as he did so i love you too she mouthed to him silently he grinned no matter how long it took her to say it he loved hearing it or in this case seeing it for a minute or so everybody in the room just stayed and chatted with each other harry eyelids began to feel heavy and he thought that perhaps he really did need a nap he leaned back too drowsy to make out what it was he was leaning on tightened his arms around silver and fell asleep instantly he dreamed of his conversation with voldemort over and over each miniscule detail playing out in his mind once more as he slept he unconsciously spoke out loud the entire conversation disclaimer i do not own or claim to own any of j k rowling characters places items you get the drift chapter 4 a strange unity harry awoke the next morning with the feeling that something exciting had happened but he couldntremember what silver he remembered as he dressed he briefly wondered if he had a habit of getting up early or if ron had a habit of getting up late he headed downstairs towards the kitchen his stomach reminding him that the previous night he had an early dinner when he entered the kitchen he found it impossible to do anything for a second except gape although snape had his robes covering it as he swished around harry caught sight of tight bandages encircling his abdomen snape paused and gave him a calculating stare never seen broken ribs before potter he asked no harry replied although it was a lie snape sneered at him harry ventured a glance at professor dumbledore and saw to his relief that he was untouched lupin was also there and smiled warmly at harry as he entered morning harry he greeted morning harry replied with a grin as he ambled over to sit next to him across from harry sat tonks she beamed her good morning at harry and he mirrored her snape took the seat across from lupin harry realized that was where he always sat snape turned to him with annoyance is there any particular reason why you re staring at me potter he asked other than the fact that i find you interesting harry replied with what he knew snape saw as sickening sweetness nope lupin gave harry a look that clearly said that was funny but you shouldntdo it harry simply grinned are pancakes good for this morning mrs weasley asked harry looked up at her and gave her a good morning smile she seemed to appreciate it although her eyes got dangerously bright as she looked at him when her question was met by approval she turned to making pancake batter the door creaked open and silver walked in good morning silver dumbledore said mrs weasley turned from her pancake batter good morning dear have a seat she invited silver gave everyone her cautious but sweet smile morning she said meekly everyone called a good morning back even dumbledore and mrs weasley although they already had next to harry i think dumbledore instructed silver obeyed and harry noticed that she didntseem quite so cautious as she had the night before her eyes widened as she looked up at snape what happened she exclaimed seeing the bandages harry was surprised at her genuine concern nothing snape mumbled drawing his robes closed just had to deal with some death eaters he reached into a pocket of his robes withdrew what looked like a silver necklace he held it out to silver silver reached out her hand and he released it to her you didntget hurt for this she asked of course i did he growled you love that locket well you re more important than a necklace silver replied a fiery edge to her voice what if you were killed well i wasn t snape answered harry watched in shock not only was snape talking to someone like he were a normal friendly person but silver was acting as if he were a normal friendly person silver glared at snape a moment before looking down at the locket in her hands she then looked back up at him with a much softer look to her eyes he looked as if he didntknow whether to expect anger or gratitude thank you she said softly snape looked relieved welcome he mumbled mrs weasley served them and in a bit everyone was down eating breakfast harry ron and ginny tried to get silver to participate in a heated quidditch conversation while hermione looked on and fred and george sat in a corner looking as if they were thinking up a new prank when everyone was done fred and george came up and stood behind harry and silver let go somewhere else and talk these chairs hurt my butt fred said harry has enough candy to share with us all ron replied let go i dontremember saying i was sharing harry called as fred george and ron raced up towards his room he turned to silver ginny and hermione with a smile come on he said he and the three girls followed the boys up the stairs although hermione stubbornly stayed four stairs behind and would not say why ron turned to silver are you coming to hogwarts this year he asked everyone stopped fighting over candy to listen and hermione peered over the edge of her transfiguration book yes silver replied i ve taken a test and dumbledore says i can transfer in as a sixth year neat harry answered to his surprise she smiled at him he allowed a stupid grin to pass over his face in return so george said in a voice that commanded attention everyone quieted and looked at him except for hermione who pretended to be reading her book george turned to silver what your story he asked only if you want to tell it of course silver smile faded well she said i can try and tell you i suppose it hard though nobody said anything seeing as nobody had a clue what she was talking about she looked around and took a deep breath well to start with my parents she said i ve never met my father i donteven know who he is dumbledore knows but he refuses to tell me as for my mother well i sure you ve heard about her she a death eater she has a horrible temper harry watched as pain reflected in silver eyes but she continued she well she abused me a bit a lot why would anyone want to hurt you george interrupted silver looked at him a long moment before replying because she hates me she said simply harry watched as her eyes filled with tears then she buried her face in her hands sorry she gasped as she tried to hold her sobs back ginny reached out but the second her fingertips touched silver shoulder silver flinched as if ginny had just slapped her she wiped her eyes and said sorry i just ginny nodded what your favorite subject harry asked randomly trying to clear those deep brown eyes of tears she gave him a look so grateful it made him feel weak transfiguration she said thoughtfully or defense against the dark arts yours defense against the dark arts harry replied automatically she smiled i suppose i should have expected that harry waited but it didnthappen she didntlook at my scar he realized in fact she hasntlooked at it yet at least not that i ve seen he decided that he rather liked it it was the first mention she had made that she knew who he was or at least what he had done fred and george began to talk about the pranks they had played on their teachers harry listened and was amazed he was surprised they hadntgotten expelled and once we put a charm on snape robes so that they were bright pink the whole day fred said that so mean ginny exclaimed and silver echoed her but they both giggled serves him right the git ron exclaimed git silver asked ron stared at her as if she had just dropped off another planet come on he said you ve spent enough time with snape to know that he a git no he not silver replied a bit defensively yes he is ron exclaimed he positively a monster silver eyes narrowed he is not she argued hermione stopped pretending to read her book and put it down he horrible ron replied especially to harry he treats harry like the scum of the earth doesnthe harry silver turned shocked eyes to harry who nodded a bit uncomfortably yeah he really does harry admitted ron went into long detail about the things snape said to them on a regular basis and how terrible he was during potions during which he was supported fully but ginny fred and george harry tried to stay out of it as much as possible when ron was finally done with his long winded speech he looked pointedly at silver well he not a git silver said firmly after all that you still think he not a git ron goggled well ron she snapped sometimes it not as easy for people to be nice as you may think things happen that can hurt a person for life like what ron challenged harry instantly knew he had made a mistake like abuse silver replied passionately tell me ron have your parents ever pushed you into a corner and kicked you until your ribs broke have they ever grabbed you by the hair and thrown you across the room have they ever stuck a rod in the fire and then pressed it against your neck do you think you would go along being perfectly friendly to everyone if your own parents did that to you ron was silent for a moment his ears turned red well i wouldntbe a git like that idiot he replied why are you so protective of him he hasntdone anything except react to life silver replied yeah ron asked furiously and how are we supposed to know that you re telling the truth i mean snape is horrid to every living creature on this planet except apparently you how are we supposed to know you arentsleeping with him or something ron hermione exclaimed silver mouthed wordlessly at ron that just just horrid she choked before bursting into tears at that moment lupin burst his head in the room how it going the last part of his sentence died as he looked at the sobbing silver severus lupin called he stuck his head back out into the hallway and harry heard him say she crying snape burst in looking as if he were about to kill someone when he looked at silver something flashed in his eyes that harry had never seen before concern what happened he asked silver just sobbed snape reached for her shoulders and for a moment harry thought he was going to shake it out of her but he did the opposite he pulled her to her feet and she immediately ran into his arms clinging to him and crying snape looked both shocked and accustomed at her behavior as he winced harry decided that it probably hurt to have a girl throw herself at you when you had broken ribs he turned to them what happened he asked he looked down at harry for once without the slightest trace of menace potter harry shook his head i dunno he mumbled i do hermione said eyes flashing in ron direction ron was a jerk snape looked at her questioningly but she shook her head that all she informed him i ll take over lupin offered you two go next door as snape and silver left lupin turned a menacing gaze on them harry had never seen him look so angry well he asked what did you do ron ron refused to say suddenly they heard snape and silver in the next room what happened snape asked he he said he said that i was sleeping with you she said mournfully amazingly snape didntyell well you know that there no truth to that dontyou he asked calmly y yes but he was being so horrible he called you a git harry heard a smile in snape voice as he answered well i am a git snape replied no you re not silver cried passionately sure you dontwant to take a vote he asked sounding mildly amused yes silver answered sounding muffled harry guessed that after her last answer she had enveloped snape in a hug listen snape said still sounding calm and in control i not as nice as you think i am i know silver answered they told me i still dontthink you re a git if people said horrible things about me all the time i d be mean too to everyone amazement snape chuckled well i glad you dontsee me for what i am he said i do too silver insisted you re not a git there was silence for a while and then snape asked thoughtfully how are you doing with everybody i trying to trust them silver replied earnestly but i flinched today when ginny touched me i think i hurt her feelings silver gave a sigh why do i have to do that because of how you ve been treated snape replied trust me it when you try not to flinch that you make the mistake you block them out instead and then you become an old git like me you re not a git silver replied halfheartedly after a moment she added harry has pretty eyes harry blushed as everyone looked at him and he grinned sheepishly snape chuckled again does he he asked mmm hmm silver answered are you really that mean to him in class afraid so snape replied he looks so much like his father i canthelp but treat him like it well silver said thoughtfully i think you should be nicer to him he really nice i sure he d forgive you i ll try and be nicer to potter snape relented harry she corrected i dontdo first names snape said you do now she replied just as firmly no snape answered silver sighed okay but try to sound nicer when you say potter she said i ll try he said but he didntsound as if he would you re not a git silver said suddenly dontstart that again he sighed she giggled why not i determined to convince you you re not wontwork he said simply silver gave a contented sigh for a moment she and snape were silent harry mind reeled the foremost thing on his mind was that she liked his eyes second was that she had the power to turn snape into a completely different person snape wasntsarcastic bitter or mean when he talked to her in fact he was more a of a softie snape gone paternal ron muttered in amazement no kidding hermione replied faintly looking as shocked as everyone else and none of you will say anything about it lupin said with quiet firmness in his voice they all turned to look at him she good for him and if you ruin his chance to make the most of life i ll have your heads ron you ll have to be punished for what you said i ll talk to your mother ron looked very disappointed guess i deserve it he muttered but i didntknow it would make her cry sheesh i think we should try and be nicer to snape ginny said suddenly in a hushed voice they all exchanged glances as horrible as snape was they knew they should do it even if it was more for silver than anyone else snape voice became heard in the adjoining room once more you should go back would you ever hurt me silver asked suddenly the question sounded random but snape was prepared for it never he said what if i she began never snape repeated and you believe it right i want to she replied sounding desperate i really want to but everyone everyone hurts me i won t snape replied and you should believe it i want to she repeated wistfully harry heard the pain in her voice as she said it snape said nothing else for a while and then he repeated his former suggestion you should go back in there he said alright she agreed but i want to talk to dumbledore first see if he knows where my mom is if he knew he would have told you snape replied you re avoiding going back i want to go just the same silver insisted you re making an excuse snape told her please silver begged alright snape relented let go and see if he busy or not ginny giggled he such a softie she whispered in amazement even lupin looked mildly amused like i said he reminded them not a word about this they all nodded solemnly although they knew that he knew that they had every intention of discussing this once he left i off to have a word with your mother ron lupin said as he left ginny got up and closed the door behind him and then squealed can you believe it that is not snape seriously ron said i cantbelieve him why couldnthave chosen one of us to be nice to never thought the old git had it in him fred commented snivelly gone all paternal on us george agreed it is interesting hermione agreed especially how he promised to be nicer to harry right away at this everybody looked at harry who said mischievously she thinks i have pretty eyes harry and silver ginny sang out she was quickly joined by fred george and ron although at silver name hermione bristled harry looked over at her come on why dontyou like her he asked over the singing what she done hermione looked distressed i cantexplain it she said you re jealous because she prettier ron accused hermione glared at him and was about to say something but ron held up his hand it doesntmean we like her any more you know it not like she our best friend all of a sudden and not you but she could be our friend all of ours if you would let her you just dontunderstand anything hermione shouted standing up and storming out of the room ron looked flustered i thought i handled that very well he said turning to look at them you did ginny assured him she just sensitive right now you have to prove to her that silver not a threat not just say it well how do i go about that ron grumbled harry got the feeling he didntwant ginny to answer however and apparently ginny was wise to his emotions as well because she remained silent although she looked as if she had something to say at lunchtime harry was surprised to find that the only people in the kitchen when they arrived were snape mr mrs weasley and kingsley where silver ginny asked from beside him looking disappointed hermione gave a snort that clearly said she didntcare snape glared at her a moment before answering she with dumbledore at the moment they should be back shortly he replied sure enough once they had all sat down at the opposite end of the table silver and dumbledore walked in dumbledore went to his usual spot at the head of the table and silver gazed hopefully at an empty chair next to snape but he gave her a reproving glance and she reluctantly took a seat next to ginny hi ginny greeted warmly silver beamed at her hi ginny she replied the two girls smiled at each other for a second before returning to their food hermione watched in a disapproving manner so mrs weasley said i think we should all go shopping tomorrow dumbledore nodded his head mum ginny said suddenly our owls haventeven come yet oh yes dumbledore said with the air of one who had forgotten to tell someone something important seeing as you were all staying with me i decided to give you your letters myself please remind me this evening we re going to diagon alley silver asked excitedly at this several adults shot her disapproving glances she quickly looked down at her plate what was that for ron asked well she said i decided to go there once while i wasntsupposed to but just to look around she added defensively yes she obviously thinks there is a force field that deflects death eaters all around the place lupin said disapprovingly i had a disguise silver protested i hardly think a hat and sunglasses counts as a disguise tonks replied well not all of us are metamorphagus silver answered and you found me quick enough anyway well it not that hard tonks said exasperatedly you just follow the trail of drooling guys you leave wherever you go silver blushed i do not she mumbled as she stabbed at her salad tonks rolled her eyes silver glanced upward and met harry eye do too he mouthed she blushed and became interested in her salad once more although she was smiling harry had no idea what possessed him to do that but he was glad he did he suddenly became aware that he had not been as subtle as he wished however because to his dismay lupin snape dumbledore and tonks were all staring at him it was his turn to study his salad very carefully the rest of the day harry ron ginny and silver played chess and exploding snap that evening they went down to the living room as was tradition to continue their chess tournament harry was very happy to see that he and silver were on about the same level when it came to chess which was novice according to ron silver pieces at first yelled directions at her and she became so flustered at one knight that she threatened to throw him across the room if he didntshut up which made all the other pieces quickly decide to obey her silver had been the first to lose to harry but harry triumph was short lived seeing as ron beat him easily in five minutes after forty five minutes ron cornered a very red ginny and pronounced himself champion he glanced over at hermione who looked very embarrassed at being caught peering over her arithmacy book at them come on hermione come play me ron invited hermione looked indecisive suddenly silver stood up i think i going to go talk to dumbledore she announced hermione watched her go and then immediately came over to play ron harry watched as silver walked over to dumbledore and after a moment they both disappeared she came back soon however with familiar looking letters in her hand ron successfully beat hermione as she walked over i have our hogwarts letters she said shyly handing hermione hers hermione gave her an icy look as she grabbed it from her and silver looked disappointed after giving the others theirs she backed away and looked forlornly around the room harry was about to call her back over he didntcare much whether hermione left or not at the moment when she suddenly seemed to have picked out somewhere to go silver was walking up to snape who was sitting by himself on a small couch reading a huge book entitled do you have finesse with potions judging from the way snape was sneering at the book he obviously thought he had more than enough finesse silver sat down next to him and he glanced over at her looking surprised look at my letter she said sweetly holding it out in front of him although harry was sure snape had seen many hogwarts letters snape took it in his hands and read it interestedly an advanced transfiguration book he questioned yes i ve passed the test to be in advanced she replied and n e w t potions he said approvingly mmm hmm she agreed suddenly snape frowned now what a smart girl like you doing in divination he asked it a load of rubbish you should be in arithmacy oh no i terrible with numbers she replied and do you only take the classes you re good at he answered oh no i terrible at potions too but i still made it into the n e w t class she replied honestly harry saw a ghost of a grin flicker across snape face well i suppose you can go a bit easy on yourself with divination he relented silver was studying the hogwarts crest on the envelope intently tell me about the houses she requested snape glanced over at the crest for a moment well he began each of the four houses has a different founder and each takes in students that possess its most prized qualities i cantbelieve it ron whispered from behind harry snape the storyteller in gryffindor snape said for once without distaste in his voice the daring and bold are prized in ravenclaw those of great wit will find their kind slytherins prize power and cunning hufflepuffs are perhaps a bit of everything many say the hufflepuffs are a bunch of dunderheads but i had a hufflepuff that went on to be a potions master silver listened intently staring at the hogwarts crest the whole time she raised her eyes to snape s what house do you think i ll be in she asked tentatively snape looked down at her calculatingly you silver are a gryffindor he replied after a short moment but i not daring or bold she protested you are both he replied when you re not on guard protecting yourself from others and you know it but how will the sorting hat know that she asked harry wondered how she knew about the sorting hat he figured either dumbledore or snape must have told her the sorting hat sees us for what we truly are snape replied then looking down at her questioning eyes and it can see through years of abuse silver looked down for a moment contemplating then concern flashed in her eyes but ron said you hated gryffindors she exclaimed putting a hand on his arm and sitting up in urgency well you ll just have to be an exception to that rule snape replied silver settled back down next to him her hand still on his arm snape eyes flickered briefly over the letter and then he looked over at harry who had been watching intently and quickly pretended not to be why arentyou over there he heard snape ask her hermione doesntlike me she replied fearfully dontmake me go harry was surprised to hear the urgency in her voice he looked up to see that she looked utterly terrified of being near hermione miss granger would never physically hurt you snape answered her quickly even if she does have an unfounded dislike for you are you sure silver asked very sure snape replied harry wondered at the fact that silver thought hermione would hurt her hermione had been cold but she hadntexactly threatened her i suppose she just used to being hurt ginny said from beside him must be ron agreed i mean hermione scary but not that scary that night harry found he wasnttired at all when he and ron trudged up to bed they sat up late eating candy and discussing snape change of character when around silver until finally they forced themselves to go to bed harry was oddly eager to get out of the house and go shopping the next day disclaimer i do not own or claim to own any of j k rowling characters places items ect comments ooh the big four oh wish i could say this will be an exceptionally special chapter but i thinking no okay so somebody mentioned that i should do a response to my reviews so i was thinking maybe i would reply to them at the end of each chapter what do you think yes or no and also somebody mentioned that i was dragging the story out too long sorry wince i have writing fever i kind of agree though it is a bit much i planning on having the story wrapped up by the next counts on fingers four chapters or so i not completely sure but it ll be somewhere around there anyway review review review i need your guys opinions oh and for those of you whose questions i haventanswered that are about the plot of this story and such they will either be answered in this chapter or the ones to come i think chapter 40 the difference harry mind was reeling as he faced dumbledore over the past hour he had told dumbledore much more than he wanted to and dumbledore had told him much more than he wanted to know he averted his eyes from dumbledore wanting more than anything to be somewhere anywhere else any more questions harry dumbledore asked what a stupid question harry thought of course there are more questions there always more bloody questions he put his hands to his forehead and rubbed as he thought uh the torch he finally said what is it dumbledore was silent about two seconds too long and harry looked up at him curiously dumbledore was surveying him quietly and calculatingly over the rims of his glasses i dontthink you are ready to know dumbledore said finally harry just about exploded why the bloody hell not he yelled jumping up out of his chair it my bloody torch and i deserve to know sit down harry dumbledore told him calmly fuming harry sat eyeing dumbledore with intense dislike and you will please watch your language dumbledore added watch my bloody language harry thought furiously why should i bloody watch my bloody language i dontthink you are ready to know dumbledore continued because you have very much to think over already well you asked if i had any more questions harry pointed out indeed i did dumbledore admitted gravely i was hoping for an easier question how hard can it be to tell me what the stupid torch is harry wondered dumbledore seemed to read his mind it involves more than you think harry more than you think yeah okay harry said looking in the other direction and willing himself not to scream with frustration dumbledore was silent which added to harry aggravation he finally turned a menacing glare in his direction which seemed to amuse him more than anything else ready to be done harry he inquired politely yes harry muttered through clenched teeth dumbledore nodded to him and walked to the door but he stopped after opening it and turned back to harry i will always be available to you harry dumbledore said quietly harry anger died down a bit but not completely thanks he muttered frustrated he took the torch out of his pocket and stared at it intently what are you he demanded loudly it gave a small burst of light but otherwise stayed silent he raised his hand to throw it but thought the better of it and shoved it in his pocket stupid bloody torch dontknow why i carry it around he muttered i could know why but no i not ready harry heard footsteps and quickly walked to the door shut it and locked it he then plopped down on ron bed staring at the ceiling in complete and utter frustration he heard the doorknob turn harry came hermione tentative voice go away he growled we just want to make sure you re okay she argued no you don t he roared you want to find out what dumbledore told me well guess what i not going to tell you a bloody thing watch your language harry silver exclaimed are you telling me that after all that just happened you re worried about my language harry asked incredulously well yes silver said hesitantly you re insane harry declared i sorry harry she answered sincerely he closed his eyes and let out a silent sigh pressing his fingers into his temples i not mad at you so you have no reason to apologize he said frustratedly sorry she replied stop saying you re sorry he yelled sor i mean okay she said he couldnthelp but be mildly amused are you hungry harry she asked timidly no he replied harshly his stomach protested immediately with a large growl he rolled his eyes um i meant to say yes he admitted he heard a smile in her voice as she replied alright would a sandwich be good and some crisps and lemonade he didntthink he had heard such a good idea in his entire life yup he answered she cleared her throat pointedly please he added grudgingly he heard fading footsteps and added at a yell and i only want you to bring it at this he heard many complaints but silver called back alright he settled back onto the bed and closed his eyes out of all the questions he had asked dumbledore he had forgotten to ask him how long he had been without food the mere thought of it made him hungrier than he ever had been in his life he groaned and rolled over he hoped silver was bringing him a very big sandwich as he was imagining how good it would taste he heard a soft knock at the door he jumped out of bed leapt for the door and yanked it open silver awarded him with a smile and a kiss on the cheek hungry she asked in a mock innocent tone she presented him with a tray that had three full sandwiches a mountain of crisps and a very large glass of lemonade he took it thankfully and stuffed a bite of sandwich in his mouth as he took it back to the bed she closed the door and then perched lightly across from him and the tray watching him with undisguised amusement how long has it been since i ve eaten he inquired she looked thoughtful for a moment two and a half days she announced he nearly spit out a mouthful of crisps but caught himself oo an calf ays he repeated through the mouthful she cringed and put her hands in front of her eyes donttalk with your mouth full harry she chided he swallowed and gave her a grin before continuing to eat yes two and a half days she confirmed we managed to get some soup down you yesterday but that was it well that explains why he paused in order to take a bite chew it and swallow it i starved mm hmm she agreed she fell back onto the bed and lay with her hands on her stomach hungry though he was harry paused for a moment to appreciate her she looked so vulnerable so perfect he took a slow bite finishing his second sandwich and observed how at peace she seemed she turned to look at him and he stopped chewing what she asked he gulped his bite down nothing he answered picking up his third sandwich and averting his gaze elsewhere he felt her gaze rest on him for a while longer but then she turned to look up at the ceiling once more he resumed watching her as he finished his lunch finally feeling very full he stretched back onto the bed himself perpendicular to her how are you harry she asked concern lacing her voice fine harry answered automatically he glanced down at her to see that she was looking at him disbelievingly okay maybe not he admitted i just frustrated that all i dontknow how i could talk to my dead godfather in my sleep and not remember it and dumbledore wonttell me what the bl stupid torch is silver sighed but the sigh wasntfor herself it was for him he sensed this and looked down at her with a mixture of surprise and gratitude i wish i could help harry she said somebody has to defeat voldemort you know she trailed off leaving harry feeling uncomfortable she didntknow about the prophecy yeah about that he said awkwardly well um it going to be me she looked over at him what do you mean it going to be you she demanded it has to be me harry answered me or nobody it in the prophecy prophecy she echoed yeah the prophecy harry took a deep breath and proceeded to tell her about the prophecy he even recited it word for word out loud for the first time since he had heard it he felt that she had a right to know as he explained it she crawled over to his side and laid her head against his chest when he finished she gave a shaky sigh oh harry she murmured against his chest i ll be all right he assured her i know you will she said i just wish you didnthave to to well voldemort harry chuckled you just wish i didnthave to voldemort he repeated you know what i mean she said raising her head and looking into his eyes he looked down at her and was surprised at the intensity of what she was letting him see she was scared and concerned more so than he had ever seen her before or at least that he had ever seen her let on so serious he commented i was making a joke but it not funny she said tearfully he stroked her hair gently i not planning on losing he informed her her lower lip trembled ever so slightly what if you do she whispered he pulled her down to him and wrapped his arms around her it not even an option he answered her breath was shaky and he rubbed her back until she calmed after a few minutes she pulled back and looked at him looking much less scared than she previously had you had better not be thinking that you have to do everything all by yourself she told him he chuckled you and moony should start a club he informed her well you re always acting like you have to take everything on yourself and you don t harry we want to help you she insisted harry smile suddenly dimmed yeah sirius wanted to help me he pointed out and a lot of good that did him he turned away from her feeling a wave of pain in his chest harry it wontturn out that way for everybody she told him maybe not he agreed but what if it you that it does or moony or ron or hermione i couldntstand that silver well then you re practically admitting defeat already silver replied harry we re all perfectly aware of the risks well then you re all perfectly insane harry answered his voice rising no you re perfectly insane silver exclaimed sacrifices are going to have to be made harry and its she stopped as he sat up and grabbed her by the shoulders you will not be sacrificed he growled his face inches from hers she looked at a loss for second but quickly regained her composure i will if i want to and there no stopping me she answered stubbornly he let go of her and gaped in amazement so you re telling me in advance that you re going to kill yourself for me he yelled no i telling you that i willing to she replied you re impossible he declared you re impossible was her retort he turned to the side facing away from her too stubborn for her own good he growled silently to himself harry she ventured suddenly what he asked stonily are you mad at me she inquired it took all of his willpower to ignore the pleading in her voice yes he answered i really sorry but she began i thought i told you to stop saying sorry he snapped oh she said weakly there was silence for a moment and just as he was about to tell her that he wasntreally mad at her she spoke i love you she offered he was shocked into silence he had heard her say it before but always at least forty five seconds after him and always hesitantly never never had she presented him with those three wonderful words so confidently he turned to look at her still in complete shock he was jerked back to his senses by the fact that her eyes began to tear sorry she said tearfully i just thought i just she turned away and harry realized why he tackled her in a hug that sent them both sprawling down onto the bed he kissed her fervently on the way down her neck her forehead and then her lips harry what she began as he drew away i love you he murmured into her neck she let out a breath of relief he pulled away from her and looked down into her eyes i didntmean to keep you waiting he apologized but you kind of took me by surprise he paused to kiss her nose affectionately you ve never exactly ah well he paused trying to think of a way to say it nicely said it first she finished for him yeah he agreed kissing her neck once more why d you do it he returned his rapt attention to her neck although he was still listening for her reply well it was stop it harry you re distracting me it seemed like the perfect time didntit mmm harry answered nipping at her ear harry she exclaimed pushing him a fair few inches away from her he grinned but then paused to consider her question not really he said decidedly he began to lower his head back down to her ear or her neck whichever his lips reached first but stopped when he saw how shocked she looked it wasn t she asked how well uh we were kind of having a fight he said exactly she said as if it made perfect sense and now we re not fighting anymore are we he grinned mischievously nope he agreed bending down once more she rolled away from him much to his annoyance what is it he demanded it was the perfect time wasntit she persisted he sighed at the determined look on her face and knew he was not going to be able to get near her until they had successfully discussed the fact that it was definitely the perfect time for her to say it any time is the perfect time he answered she looked shocked that he would think such a thing but no because then it not a special time she protested hearing you tell me that you love me makes it a special time he replied she seemed to consider his words for a moment and then she smiled dreamily really she asked truly he confirmed beginning to edge his way towards her she scooted further away and eyed him suspiciously he gave her the most innocent grin he could manage and began to quicken pace she scooted further and her eyes widened as she realized that she had reached the edge of the bed harry she squealed silver he mimicked in a high voice she giggled and allowed him to pull her close he didntkiss her but paused to look into her face before he did so he took in everything about her that he could from her scent to the loving anticipating look in her eyes she seemed to be doing the same neither of them heard the sound of the door opening or footsteps behind them harry began to lean closer when suddenly a shadow passed over them silver eyes widened as she looked up please be lupin harry thought fervently or ron or hermione or ginny yes ginny she harmless however the shadow was far too tall for ginny dumbledore harry thought frantically it could be dumbledore or kingsley he tall mr weasley is kind of tall yes mr weasley he has a tall shadow please just anyone but he was suddenly grasped by the back of his collar yanked up and pushed forwards harshly he used the wall to break his fall and spun around to find himself looking into snape enraged face snape raised his wand looking as if he were about to kill harry on the spot stop it silver exclaimed snape wand was a few inches away from harry throat it wavered there at silver command harry fumbled in his pockets only to find to his horror that he was wandless put your wand down silver said snape lowered his wand a few inches great harry thought now he aiming at my heart snape looked at him with utmost loathing i ve had enough of you potter he growled you are completely out of bounds you you he hasntdone anything silver defended he put you in a compromising position snape roared no he didn t silver argued snape turned to her eyes blazing he was on top of you in a bed snape thundered silver blushed profusely you donthave to let the whole house know she exclaimed and he wasntdoing anything we werenteven kissing and that matters snape hissed yes she exclaimed snape opened his mouth to argue but was interrupted by a very very welcome voice ah severus here you are lupin greeted brightly from the doorway snape poked his wand into harry throat as he turned to look at lupin dumbledore has requested to see you lupin informed him he says it urgent snape looked from lupin to harry and back to lupin again slowly he drew his wand away from harry throat he looked at harry and with a very twisted sneer announced we ll finish up this little talk later with that he stormed out of the room for a moment the three just looked at each other before lupin cleared his throat harry and silver both turned to look at him ah silver i believe you are needed in the uh lupin trailed off uncertainly downstairs oh i see silver answered sarcastically smiling amusedly smooth remus lupin grinned i thought so he agreed as she walked past him lupin turned to harry and raised his eyebrows a more serious expression on his face compromising position he asked harry blushed no he said immediately i mean i wasnttrying his gaze shifted to the floor at his last words ah lupin said well harry you must remember that well a kind of muffled sound came from him and harry looked up to see that lupin was shaking with laughter harry was half appalled half relieved lupin caught his eye and howled with laughter shutting the door as he did so he laughed so hard that he had to sit down on the bed and gasp for breath finally he had regained himself enough to speak sorry he breathed it just just he trailed off looking at harry oddly just what harry asked curiously lupin shook his head nothing harry nothing he said tell me harry insisted i dontwant to upset you lupin answered harry thought for a moment well now i know it about my parents and i not upset so tell me he said lupin looked at him in surprise well it just that james always told me that if he ever found you with a girl i would have to give you the talk because he and sirius would be too busy giving you pointers instead of reacting to the news about his father harry asked you re not going to give me the talk are you erm no that is unless you well need it lupin said looking as if he desperately hoped harry didntneed it uh no i fine thanks harry said quickly he then smiled what did my mom say he asked sitting down on the side of the bed opposite lupin and lying down what lupin repeated yeah after she heard my dad say that harry said he closed his eyes imagining his father sirius lupin and his mother all sitting down in a cozy house talking together how do you know she heard lupin asked but then he continued well never mind that she told your father he was a horrible prick and that she was going to divorce him and find him a proper father harry eyes shot open what he exclaimed lupin chuckled she was just kidding harry he informed him he pretended to be hurt and she told him that she was just teasing him and that he would be the best father there ever was even if he did try and corrupt his son harry smiled good he said relieved but harry lupin said really how serious are you about silver harry stared at the ceiling i haventthought about it he said i mean our relationship it just kind of happens well there a certain point where you have to take control lupin said carefully harry sat up and turned to face lupin what point is that he asked lupin opened his mouth but the voice harry heard was not his remus harry tonks said from the doorway the kids are going back to the castle all of them right now lupin asked yup tonks confirmed well come on then harry lupin said walking towards the doorway harry trotted after lupin still wanting an answer to his question lupin and tonks however were walking side by side down the stairs moony harry said from behind them lupin flatly ignored him as he answered something tonks had asked him moony harry tried again tonks laughed and said something back and lupin laugh echoed her they arrived downstairs and harry cupped his hands and yelled moony lupin jumped and spun around as they arrived in the living room what is it harry he asked as all eyes turned on them harry uncomfortably avoided everyone gaze there was no way he was asking lupin in front of everybody especially since silver was one of those everybody s um nothing he said unconvincingly lupin raised an eyebrow right he said uncertainly harry made his way over to fred george ginny ron hermione and silver and sat down dumbledore began to talk to them about going back to the castle mentioning his and silver names specifically a few times but harry wasntlistening he was looking at silver worriedly they had never talked about having a more serious relationship it had just seemed to progress on it own but did they need to talk about it he wished that tonks could have stayed downstairs for just a few more minutes before interrupting no barging in on him and lupin harry dumbledore said suddenly harry eyes shot towards the headmaster you first dumbledore said holding out a pot of floo powder oh right harry said he hoped he was right in assuming that he had to go to hogwarts he took a handful of floo powder threw it into the fire and said hogwarts he landed in dumbledore office which looked different somehow he had a feeling something important had changed but what everything seemed to be in place but something was definitely different to his relief ron hermione silver ginny and finally dumbledore all arrived behind him again he missed dumbledore speech as he tried to figure out what had changed the next thing he knew silver nudged him in the side come on harry she said he glanced at dumbledore who was looking at him with amusement and then followed the rest towards the gryffindor common room he walked downstairs to find that the entire castle had changed somehow it all felt different but looked the same he stopped in his tracks and his friends turned around to look at him concerned something different he said they all looked around except for silver who looked at him what different harry she asked everything he answered dontyou feel it his friends exchanged glances i dontfeel anything different ginny ventured neither do i ron added me either hermione said as if that settled the matter harry couldntbelieve it how could they not notice he looked at silver hopefully i i dontfeel anything terribly different she said meekly but i sure there is something harry looked at all of them in disbelief he felt as if he was in a completely different castle and none of them felt a thing this cantbe good he told himself uh well it not that different he lied i think i just tired he tried his best to look tired and they all seemed to buy it except for silver when they arrived in the common room it was empty harry had lost all track of time and was surprised to see that the fire in the common room had dimmed it late he announced to nobody in particular ginny yawned her agreement yeah g night she said trudging tiredly up the stairs to the girls dorms ron and hermione echoed her and then hermione turned to wait for silver and ron for harry silver looked at the two of them a moment before reaching on her tiptoes to hug harry tell me what different she whispered into his ear then she kissed him lightly said a cheery goodnight and headed up the stairs with hermione harry stared after her in surprise for a moment did she really know him well enough to know what he was thinking when ron and hermione who had known him for six years didntappear to have a clue he shook his head and headed for the dorms with ron who was too tired to notice that anything was bothering harry as harry sank under the covers he wondered what day it was it took him a few minutes to figure out that it was monday very late monday but it was hard to sleep because something was different something was very different he didntknow how late it was when he fell asleep for all he knew it could have been early tuesday morning but when he finally fell asleep it was troubled he had no visual dreams that night but in the back of his mind he heard a cold dark laugh that caused him to break a sweat and clench his teeth disclaimer i do not own or claim to own any of j k rowling characters places items ect comments hmm i wasntreally planning on this chapter but i couldnthelp myself and featured at the end of this chapter will be drumroll response to reviews chapter 41 contract are you sure you re all right harry hermione nagged as they walked to defense against the dark arts i m bloody fine harry growled well i just a broken record he suggested i just looking out for you hermione exclaimed offended and that includes asking the same question and getting the same answer over and over and over and i get it hermione interrupted took you long enough he replied irritably hermione sighed and he echoed her silver had coaxed him to reveal how he felt that things had changed in the castle and since then he had been treated like a bomb waiting to explode by ron and hermione silver was concerned as well no doubt about that but she at least treated him normally besides her concern included hugs kisses and encouraging words whilst ron and hermione consisted of one simple factor nagging he didntthink he could take any more stress hermione continued to huff next to him which successfully raised his annoyance why did i agree to walk to class with you again he asked because you had nobody else to go with hermione supplied your girlfriend is with my boyfriend why doesntthat sound good harry asked sarcastically yes perhaps i should have worded it differently hermione agreed ron and silver had both gone to the owlry to send letters to fred and george ron wanted to get some free supplies from their joke shop and silver was just keeping in touch as she put it as harry and hermione rounded the corner they saw ron and silver talking in front of the classroom ron was leaning against the wall with his hands in his pockets blushing and silver was smiling smugly standing in front of him at silver side stood charisma who was now fully grown or at least very close to it harry and hermione both strained to hear his words yeah yeah big deal ron muttered looking down silver laughed oh come on ron you just have to she trailed off as charisma gave her a warning chirp to let her know that harry and hermione were approaching ron blush intensified when he caught sight of hermione uh hi he mumbled uncomfortably silver looked on the verge of laughing once more but refrained what were you talking about hermione demanded nothing silver replied innocently in a sing song voice she swept into the classroom before hermione could question her further dragging harry with her charisma sat down just outside the doorway watching silver intently the hippogriff had accepted the fact that she no longer fit in most classrooms but would only sit quietly when she could see silver from the doorway as harry and silver sat down harry lay his forehead on the desk silver rubbed his back comfortingly not feeling good she asked sweetly i just wish i could figure out what so different he grumbled it starting to get on my nerves and indeed it was it was getting increasingly hard to concentrate it felt as if there was some presence in the castle something that was bearing down on him every second waiting for a chance to strike he sighed and lifted his head up as tonks arrived last class of the day he reminded himself then i can go talk to dumbledore tonks greeted the class cheerfully and everyone on the gryffindor side of the room came to attention unfortunately on tuesdays they had the class with the slytherins who were always too busy amongst themselves to pay much attention to anything else tonks cleared her throat pointedly and a few of them reluctantly straightened in their seats today we are moving on to a new unit she announced dueling beside harry silver straightened interestedly right now i just want to see what level you are all at so you are going to start out in the pairs that you are currently seated with harry was very satisfied with this but he didntlike the starting out part he saw no reason to change partners whatsoever and later on we ll switch so that you can i not switching partners harry declared loudly tonks turned to look at him a bit flabbergasted he glared back he was not going to let anybody else even have a shot at hexing silver yes he is silver argued from beside him please continue professor tonks with a last worried glance at harry tonks continued her speech what are you talking about harry whispered to silver it ll be boring dueling you the whole time silver answered we ll have to switch yeah but if you end up in the hospital wing then he began harry nobody in this class is going to be able to lay a wand on me she replied confidently harry was taken aback fine then miss confidence he muttered anyway i would love to start off with a volunteer pair tonks was saying so are there any before the words were even out of her mouth malfoy hand shot up volunteers mr malfoy tonks said wonderful who would like to challenge him nobody moved nobody that is except for silver her hand shot straight up into the air immediately a smile playing upon her lips miss riddle tonks said taking a special pride in saying her name excellent please come to the front of the classroom harry inwardly groaned the last thing he needed was to watch malfoy try and hex his girlfriend silver however nearly jumped out of her chair and headed for the front tonks magicked her desk out of the way and stepped aside to explain the rules alright well just show me what you know she said finally malfoy and silver were both staring at each other silver with hatred malfoy with a combination of loathing and lust malfoy swept into a formal bow just to annoy silver who nodded her head curtly then they faced each other wands drawn malfoy struck first stupefy he tried protego she responded almost boredly he frowned and then smiled i have a little pet for you half blood he informed her serpensortia a huge black snake shot out of his wand causing several girls to scream it slithered towards silver and for a moment they just stared at each other attack malfoy ordered instead the serpent coiled harmlessly at her feet silver smiled at malfoy charmingly why thank you malfoy she said with mock gratefulness just what i ve always wanted malfoy gaped only a second before dodging a stunner sent at him from silver how d you do that he demanded i have my ways she replied expelliarmus malfoy dodged just in time he shot another stunner at silver who stepped out of the way casually mocking him with her calmness harry watched her closely he could see that she had a passion and natural flair for battle engorgio silver said suddenly pointing at malfoy arm which he didntmove out of the way quickly enough it immediately began to swell to the width of a fire hydrant making it impossible for him to hold his wand in it he switched hands and harry could see that he was beginning to lose patience filthy little he muttered furnunculus silver rolled easily to the side her eyes glittering tut tut malfoy you dontreally want to do that do you she teased incendio he cried in rage pointing his wand at her feet silver jumped forward as a fire began to blaze near her feet after landing she wasted no time in casting a spell locomotor mortus she cried malfoy legs locked and he fell to the floor but not before he completely lost his temper no half blood beats me he roared my father your father has nothing do with this silver retorted you shouldntbe talking about fathers malfoy retorted especially not when yours is a filthy mudblood silver eyes flashed with anger dontyou talk about my father she yelled raising her wand you have no right malfoy eyes glittered with a mixture of fear and amusement as silver advanced on him with her wand she opened her mouth most likely to hex him into the next century but he struck first imperio he yelled his wand pointed at silver drop the wand the class gasped charisma charged through the door and harry vaulted out of his seat but everyone stopped when silver laughed no thanks malfoy she replied i rather attached to my wand stupefy with a flick of her wand malfoy was stunned beaming she turned to tonks who was ashen faced he used an unforgivable she said her voice a pitch higher than usual he actually used an unforgivable yes well this is malfoy we re talking about silver replied the little slimeball canteven win a duel using unforgivables tonks suddenly seemed to realize that silver was standing there you she said you just like it was nothing it didntaffect you not for a second i ve had my experiences with the unforgivables silver replied casually petting an overexcited charisma soothingly they dontfaze me much seamus chuckled along with some of the rest of the class um you realize that avada kedavra is included in those unforgivables he inquired amusedly where do you think i learned to dodge she replied evenly at this the class was silent the smile faded from seamus face oh he said quietly um class will be dismissed early today tonks stammered the class filed out whispering quietly but silver gave harry ron and hermione a look that clearly said that she was staying are you alright she asked tonks me tonks asked you re the one that just had an unforgivable used against you i ll probably end up being fired no you won t silver soothed it was malfoy that cast the spell not you but i told you to show me what you know tonks said looking downcast silver laughed i sure nobody took you seriously she said now why dontyou go visit with dumbledore while we get killer over here to the hospital wing are you sure tonks asked i mean he s he s i cantbelieve you re joking about it dontworry about it silver said after we drop him off at the hospital wing we ll come and give witness to what just happened in your defense okay alright tonks consented weakly silver smiled her out of the room and then turned to malfoy little cockroach she sighed mobilicorpus malfoy lifted off the floor and silver directed him out of the room harry had a feeling she purposely hit his head on the doorway he ron and hermione exchanged a glance before darting after her and charisma silver ron exclaimed you were bloody brilliant that was some excellent dueling hermione chipped in harry walked up beside her and put his arm around her causing her to accidentally hit malfoy body on the wall that was stupid he informed her she looked at him in surprise you could ve been hurt he continued she smiled you re starting to sound like me she teased he grinned well you took my job he answered doing stupid things that can get you in trouble silver looked slightly offended i knew i was going to win she replied are you saying you didntthink i was going to erm no harry lied i just thought you could ve gotten hurt she huffed in a way similar to hermione only much cuter in harry opinion he kissed the top of her head and decided to leave the matter alone when he straightened he suddenly became dizzy he stopped wavering unsteadily harry silver asked concernedly he heard a thump which meant that malfoy had come into hard contact with a wall just a little dizzy he said squinting as everything began to come back into focus silver was standing in front of him oblivious to the fact that malfoy was alternating between hitting the left wall and the ceiling behind her she reached up a hand and stroked his face gently harry i think you should go see dumbledore now she said worriedly i can make it to madam pomfrey and back he replied surprisingly hermione didntinterfere at all although harry suspected it had something to do with the fact that ron stepped on her foot when she opened her mouth to speak well alright she consented reluctantly but well walk next to ron and charisma just in case harry rolled his eyes as ron and charisma solemnly stepped forward on either side of him come on i just got dizzy for a second he complained and you re also convinced that something in the castle has changed when everything is exactly the same hermione piped up something obviously wrong harry silver shot hermione an icy look and charisma made a low growling sound ron shook his head hermione silver said her voice laced with impatience just be quiet hermione looked as if she were about to argue but ron shot her a look and she dropped silent looking as if she had been cheated out of something harry mind was spinning great he thought i turning into a mental case next thing i know i going to be at st mungo he groaned out loud clutching his fists frustratedly nothing wrong with you harry silver told him then why am i the only one who knows something different he exclaimed why cantyou guys feel it well harry i mean we haven t it probably silver trailed off uncertainly what harry demanded well harry voldemort silver exclaimed causing ron and hermione to jump i mean you go inside his body and have a little chat with him and then you re in bed for two days talking in your sleep you have a frustrating and overwhelming talk with dumbledore and now you feel like something different of course something different harry it you harry was silent for a few seconds so you re saying that i ve changed he gathered yes harry she said how he inquired silver took a deep breath as they rounded the corner to madam pomfrey s and stopped outside of her office to face him harry i can just guess at a lot of things she said quietly but i ve spent a lot of time listening to voldemort plots and such and i think that you ve changed because he s well he more a part of you now more a part of me harry repeated more a part of me his voice rose as he spoke you think voldemort is a part of me silver looked over at a stunned ron and hermione take malfoy she said we ll meet you in dumbledore office the two complied both eyeing harry warily as they passed he was still staring at silver in disbelief she looked at him for a moment and then set off in the direction of dumbledore office with charisma in tow so you think i some kind of half me half voldemort thing he asked as he trotted to catch up with her i never said he was you she exclaimed well what does him being a part of me mean then he exploded i dontknow how to explain it harry it just harry wasntlistening to her what the bloody hell does she mean that he is a part of me he thought angrily i cantbelieve you think i like him harry yelled what kind of a girlfriend are you she whirled to face him placed both hands on his chest and shoved hard he staggered back into the wall i never said that she yelled back tears forming in her eyes i would never say that for a moment he was so surprised that he didntsay anything but then he realized that she was running towards dumbledore office charisma gave him a withering look and followed her well what did you mean then he yelled as he ran after her he watched as she reached the gargoyle told charisma to stay outside and ran up the stairs harry stopped as he reached charisma who snapped at him when he tried to get past the gargoyle listen i really need to go in he said i never meant to make her cry charisma growled at him disbelievingly but let him pass harry ran up the stairs and into dumbledore office only to wish that he hadntcome at all dumbledore tonks and professor mcgonagall were watching in confusion as silver stood crying into snape robes murmuring something incomprehensible snape looked up at harry and his eyes hardened what ve you done to her he snarled now now severus dumbledore said i sure harry hasntdone anything i haven t harry confirmed i just got mad because she told me that voldemort is a part of me everyone quieted well now harry why did that make you mad dumbledore finally asked harry gaped in disbelief well wouldntyou be upset if somebody told you that you were the darkest wizard ever known he asked i n never said t that silver wailed indeed harry dumbledore said harry opened his mouth to argue but dumbledore held up his hand i think harry you should consider it from a different point of view he said calmly do you love miss riddle what does that have to do with it harry asked dumbledore gave him a piercing look and harry grudgingly answered his question yes i do he said silver sobs quieted some well then i think it would be safe to say that she is very important to you so important that she is a part of yourself dumbledore asked harry considered the question for a moment well i guess he admitted but i not in love with voldemort dumbledore chuckled true he said but your bond with voldemort is a magical bond harry he has marked you as his equal his only equal and that makes him a part of you and you of him it is almost like a binding magical contract harry was silent super he thought voldemort and i are under a binding magical contract to try and kill each other just great okay he said finally why were you talking about it anyway snape snapped obviously not having forgiven harry for making silver cry oh yeah harry said i feel like things are different here i mean everything is in the same place and stuff but it all different it like something is inside of the castle waiting for something he finished feeling extremely stupid what kind of an explanation was that something was waiting for something he looked up at dumbledore hesitantly ah was all that dumbledore said so i just feeling like this because voldemort is a part of me harry said forcing the words out i believe so dumbledore replied harry chanced a glance in silver direction and saw that she was looking up at snape talking discreetly as he listened and looked down at her he struggled to hear a snatch of their conversation so be nice she was saying quietly snape looked up and caught harry eye harry looked away quickly the look in snape eye had not been nice at all the door opened and ron and hermione arrived ah mr weasley and miss granger dumbledore greeted i suspect mr malfoy is being treated yeah but madam pomfrey is having a hard time getting his arm to deflate ron sniggered harry couldnthelp but smile dumbledore beard quivered dangerously well i sure he will be all right in the end he finally said decidedly and then turning to snape tonks and professor mcgonagall we need a staff meeting to decide his punishment however minerva would you be so kind as to summon the other staff professor mcgonagall nodded and walked briskly out of the room professor dumbledore hermione said suddenly we came so that we could be witnesses to what happened thank you miss granger but i afraid that wontbe necessary dumbledore replied hermione looked very downcast i will be sure to contact you if we should need your assistance though dumbledore added a twinkle in his eye hermione brightened a bit oh well alright then she said i think you children should be on your way dumbledore commented unless you have anything else to bring to my attention no ron and hermione chorused silver dislodged herself from snape and shook her head to the negative effect dumbledore turned to harry who shrugged not right now he said but by tomorrow i ll probably have a whole new set of problems he added silently the foursome left dumbledore office harry feeling very tired and irritable silver didntsay a word to him when they reached the landing she merely went up and patted charisma before following ron and hermione in the direction of the common room harry watched her intently and finally reached out and pulled her back gently by the wrist it was all she needed to fly into his arms surprised he held her tightly i sorry he murmured into her hair me too she replied he closed his eyes and rested his face in her hair instead of being confused and irritated he now felt simply worn out he lifted his head and she looked up at him you need to take a nap she observed homework he answered nap she replied firmly alright he consented not feeling like arguing he later found out that by nap she expected him to go into the boys dorms lay in bed and sleep until the next morning something he had no problem doing he wasntplagued by an uneasy sleep this time he suspected it had something to do with the kiss silver had given him before he had fallen asleep response to reviews regini thank you very much and be my guest i know how heated laptops can get harrytpaxd204 yes yes of

hard as he could leammelone ron mumbled ron did you know that the valentines ball was today harry demanded wha ron asked sleepily valentines ball today harry repeated ron eyes popped open and he groaned dean and seamus had doubled over with laughter by this time and awoken neville what going on neville inquired rubbing his eyes ron and harry forgot about the ball dean chortled harry and ron exchanged glances did you buy mione anything harry asked no ron groaned do you have anything for silver not a thing hogsmeade yup they both quickly got out of bed and began to dress amidst dean and seamus laughter how re we going to get out of the common room without the girls seeing us ron asked um invisibility cloak harry suggested right ron said turning his gaze on dean and seamus and you two are going to open the portrait for us why should we seamus teased then at ron look anything you say master ron we wouldnt dare risk your wrath ron rolled his eyes as he pulled a comb through his hair harry considered doing the same but didntsee what good it would do he pulled out his invisibility cloak and allowed seamus and dean to admire it for a moment i ve always wanted one of those dean said wistfully where d you get it harry shrugged as a sign that he didntfeel like discussing it and dean and seamus took the hint what am i supposed to say my dead father gave it to me harry wondered er right seamus said in an attempt to break the tension shall we go harry and ron threw the cloak over themselves in reply dean and seamus broke into fresh laughter at the sight of hermione and silver sitting on the couch in the common room silver looked up at the two upon their arrival is harry up she asked her eyes glittering with hopefulness harry felt his stomach do flips at the eager look in her eyes uh no dean said he seemed really tired so we told everyone to be quiet so he could sleep in silver looked disappointed oh she said softly alright i doubt ron will have a problem sleeping in with him hermione said an oddly fond look in her eyes harry and ron exchanged glances harry holding back a snigger and ron a blush yeah seamus said well anyway we re just going to go out yeah out dean echoed silver and hermione regarded them suspiciously for a moment but then turned back to talking seamus walked up to the portrait hole pushed it open and said loudly after you dean stopped allowing harry and ron to pass and they heard his voice as they left no no go ahead i insist no really you first um okay then seamus and dean jumped out of the portrait hole and it swung shut behind them harry and ron lifted the cloak so that it was just barely off you guys are really bad at that harry commented not the way to thank us for helping you dean replied definitely not seamus agreed okay then wonderful job ron replied sarcastically thanks seamus said brightly that really makes my day dean added rolling their eyes harry and ron disappeared underneath the cloak again and set off for hogsmeade harry yeah any ideas on what to get harry groaned hurry up harry you re hogging the mirror dean exclaimed impatiently go get a different mirror harry retorted but that my mirror dean insisted harry rolled his eyes as he attempted in vain to make his hair lie flat well until my hair lies flat you re going to have to deal with it harry said irritably no offense mate but your hair hasntlaid flat for sixteen years ron said from behind him what makes you think it going to tonight tonight is bloody special harry answered yanking the comb down and attempting to pin his hair against his head with it no luck silver not going to care if your hair is flat or not harry ron said sensibly as dean sniggered i guess harry answered dubiously looking at his untidy hair in the mirror but it does look a little flatter doesntit sure ron replied unconvincingly harry shook his head and surrendered the mirror to dean returning to the boys dormitories with ron they pulled on their dress robes ron grumbling the whole time i hate dress robes ron muttered fervently at that one not as bad as the one you had in fourth year harry answered in what he supposed was a helpful way yeah minus the lace plus the silk ron answered sarcastically why canti have normal material harry had to work very hard to keep a straight face at ron comment ron new dress robes were maroon and while free of lace and frills were a silky material which dean had commented reminded him of his mother nightgown since then ron had been completely against anything silk harry own robes were green once more as well only slightly lighter than last time mrs weasley had bought them for him and had been ecstatic that she had found robes nearly the same color as your gorgeous eyes seamus suddenly walked into the dorms holding in his hand a gold watch which he had needed to complete his look oy harry he called as he fastened the watch around his wrist silver wants you to know that she and hermione will meet the two of you in front of the great hall a grin spread across his face if i were you i wouldntwant to be late he added the ball already started and she looks hot tonight at harry look he dashed off in the direction of the bathrooms harry debated going after him but ron gave a sharp pull on his arm dontwaste your time with him he said frowning harry retrieved the lily and box of earrings that he had picked up for silver while in hogsmeade and followed ron out of the gryffindor common room so remind me why you got a lily instead of a rose again ron said as two hufflepuff boys passed with roses in their hands talking anxiously about their girlfriends because lilies are symbolic of purity and she liked it when i gave her one during the quidditch game harry explained for the thousandth time right ron said unconvinced and i think my mom would have wanted me to harry added for the first time ron gave him a cautious and surprised look oh he said dumbly harry looked down at the lily in his hand uncertainly wondering if silver would like it or if she would want a rose like most of the other girls ron nudged him as they turned the corner there they are he said harry looked up a bit nervously and was momentarily stunned silver looked like some unearthly being her robes seemed to be made of a mixture of pure silver and diamonds whenever she moved in the slightest tiny sparkles seemed to erupt from her robes which fitted her very very well her hair was piled delicately on top of her head with curls spilling down onto her cheeks on either side she wore no make up except for a light pink gloss over her lips she was chatting contentedly with hermione neither of them noting the fact that he and ron were heading their way she turned to look at him as he drew close harry she said delightedly a smile lighting her face he presented her with the lily that he was holding wordlessly her eyes traveled from his face and down to the flower in his hand and he heard an intake of breath oh harry it beautiful she exclaimed taking it gently from his hand she closed her eyes and smelt of it and harry wished he could forever hold that picture in his mind she opened her eyes a smile on her face and he couldnthelp but smile back that not all he informed her holding out a small black velvet box proposing harry came a voice from behind him he turned to see dean grinning at him cheekily a blonde ravenclaw hanging on his arm very funny he replied turning his attention back to silver silver made a face at dean but then smiled as she accepted the box and opened it her eyes widened when she saw its contents ooh harry she breathed reaching a finger in and touching the earrings gingerly as if she were afraid they might disappear do you like them he asked hopefully i love them she replied gazing at them in awe they were tiny dangling silver hearts that were engraved with a small star in the center silver gently dislodged the earrings and put them on looking at harry expectantly harry grinned his approval and she threw her arms around his neck unexpectedly he held her tightly for a moment and then let her sink down and out of his arms she gave a contented sigh as she looked up at him ron cleared his throat loudly and harry looked up to find that he and hermione were waiting for them oh right he said offering his arm to silver beaming she slid her arm through his as they walked into the great hall it looked as if all the students were already there excepting first through third years who hadntbeen allowed to come where charisma harry asked as they followed ron and hermione over to the refreshments table i made her stay in the dungeons silver replied the dungeons harry echoed yes she replied i didntwant to leave her in the common room or the girls dormitories or she would bother people so i got permission to leave her in the dungeons harry noted how she purposely avoided the use of snape name and found it amusing knowing that she did it for his sake he glanced over at ron and hermione who were filling up on snacks or rather ron who was filling up on snacks and hermione who was watching impatiently and complaining cute couple he commented when he saw that silver was looking in the same direction as him she giggled yeah she agreed a slow song came on and he poked her side playfully wanna dance he asked he wasnttoo sure of his dancing abilities but after he had found out there was going to be a ball he had practiced dancing with an invisible partner early in the mornings before anyone else was awake he thought or rather hoped that it had done him some good she smiled mm hmm she replied he led her out to the dance floor a bit nervously and slid his arms around her waist she put her arms around his neck and gazed up at him thoughtfully so anyway she said as he somehow managed to steer them out of the way of an overly excited and fast moving couple without stepping on anybody feet since we were talking about ron and hermione has ron talked to you yet talked to me harry echoed about what she frowned well i promised him i wouldntsay anything she said kind of about hermione uh other than asking me what to get her for tonight no harry answered oh she said glancing over at the other two what was it supposed to be about harry inquired i told him i wouldnttell she repeated he pulled her closer but you can tell me he coaxed giving her his best begging face she smiled bemusedly as she looked up at him well he waited interestedly no she finally said i shouldntsay please he begged her no she replied firmly he bent down to kiss her nose pleadingly no was her reply he tried her neck harry she said warningly he looked at her innocently making her giggle i going to get it out of you he threatened are not she replied grinning mischievously he began to tickle her she squealed and pulled away missing another dancing couple by inches he chased her through the crowd until they reached a clearing on the side she glanced back at him to see if he was still following and gave another squeal when she saw that he was she darted away but he caught her around the waist tickling her mercilessly no harry stop she laughed squirming in his arms he relented and pulled her to him her back against his chest he leaned down so that he could speak into her ear going to tell me he inquired n no she replied uncertainly wrapping her arms around her waist to protect herself i ll eat your ear he threatened the earrings will give you a stomachache she warned he chuckled so be it he answered nibbling lightly on her ear but making sure not to touch her earrings she squirmed away okay i ll tell you she exclaimed he disappointedly pulled away and allowed her to turn around in his arms for a moment he couldntremember what it was she was supposed to be telling him he had just been enjoying the game ron going to be so mad she said glancing around his shoulder to make sure ron was still at an acceptable distance ron doesnthave to know you told me he replied she looked up at him earnestly but that would be just like lying she said he grinned alright i ll tell him i forced you to tell me he declared and that it all my fault he set his forehead against hers as he spoke and she smiled alright she agreed much to his amusement he looked into her eyes and could tell that she was trying to think of how to word what she was about to say he really confused about hermione right now silver began she kind of pressuring him to tell her that he loves her but he confused about love he doesntreally know what it means he wanted to ask you but i think he too embarrassed mione doesntseem like the type of girl that would pressure him into saying that harry said thoughtfully she more sentimental than you think silver replied hmm he replied looking down at her she smiled you re not thinking about ron or hermione are you she asked amusedly nope he admitted he lowered his lips to hers and watched for a moment as she closed her eyes in anticipation of his kiss he kissed her softly and briefly and then drew back to look at her she beamed at him love you he told her her eyes seemed to sparkle more intensely at the sound of his words i love you too she answered shyly he grinned and kissed her on the top of the head dance with me he asked of course she replied harry then realized that a fast paced song was playing at the moment erm well he said trying to think of an excuse to change his mind he had never danced to a fast dance before and didntthink he would be very good at it but didntwant to let on she giggled at his expression come on we ll get ron and hermione to come with us she urged harry snickered i d like to see ron try and dance to this song he agreed between him silver and hermione they managed to drag ron away from the snacks and onto the dance floor where they pretty much made complete fools of themselves excepting silver who chided them for acting silly as they invented new dance moves dontbe shy harry told her grabbing her and twirling her around i not shy she insisted i just dontwant to embarrass myself he pulled her into his arms and dipped her you couldntembarrass yourself if you tried sweetie he informed her as he bent over her he earned himself a kiss and grinned like an idiot as they straightened dontlook now harry but snape gonna kill you ron said cheerfully as he twirled hermione around harry followed ron gaze over towards an extremely irritated looking snape who was watching him with loathing since when does he come to valentines balls he asked since silver does hermione answered no kidding harry replied he glanced at silver who quickly tried not to look pleased that she was the reason snape had come you asked him to come didntyou he accused twirling her about and then bringing her close into his arms no she replied defensively he wanted to come to make sure i dontput you in any more compromising positions harry asked with a grin she blushed probably she admitted he chuckled and dipped her one last time as the music stopped am i compromising you he inquired in mock seriousness as he hovered over her she and hermione began to giggle helplessly as he brought her back up harry was very pleased with himself for inspiring such a burst of happiness and he and ron followed the girls back to the refreshments stand for a glass of punch silver hair had come slightly undone by all the twirling and dipping but the wisps of hair that escaped the careful pile on top of her head only made her look more beautiful in harry opinion slow music began to play but harry decided to skip the opportunity to dance since silver and hermione looked so intent on talking so he said to ron danced a slow one with her yet no ron answered slowly you should harry replied i dontknow ron said every time i get even a little bit romantic she starts harry put a hand up to signal ron to stop as he looked over at silver a very tall boy with black hair and even blacker eyes was talking to her with a glint in his eye that harry didntlike at all ron followed his gaze and recognition dawned in his eyes kyle lawrick he told harry harry brushed past him and towards kyle silver looked immensely relieved when she saw him harry slid an arm around her and glared at kyle kyle looked at him interestedly hey harry he greeted sticking out a hand why are you hitting on my girlfriend harry answered not pausing for a second i wasnthitting on her kyle said mock hurtfulness in his voice i just wanted to dance with her harry raised his eyebrows and the difference would be well you werentdancing with her so i figured somebody should kyle replied do everyone a favor and stop trying to figure things out harry answered kyle face hardened you dontknow me he began in a low growl and i d like to keep it that way harry finished kyle gave him a withering look and turned to walk away wow harry hermione said simply can you believe he had the nerve to ask her harry fumed what a little silver quieted him with a finger over his lips we know harry she assured him and then with a smile thank you he grinned anytime he assured her he ll think twice before asking her again ron crowed triumphantly you should have seen the look on your face harry it was worse than snape ron hermione exclaimed sounding shocked they followed her gaze to see snape standing only a few feet away giving ron a death look silver burst into giggles it not funny ron exclaimed in a whisper he ll kill me well you dug your own grave didntyou silver replied smartly ron rolled his eyes and muttered snape supporter under his breath which made silver begin to giggle anew oh no hermione squealed suddenly you ve gotten us all in trouble ron they all looked to see that dumbledore was making his way towards them there was no denying that they were his destination he was looking right at them they quickly all straightened and tried to look as innocent as possible as dumbledore approached them good evening he greeted them good evening they all chorused back his eyes twinkled as he looked at them such guilty faces he commented a slight blush surfaced on all of their faces excepting ron who turned a bright red i was wondering miss riddle if you would do me the honor of dancing with me he inquired politely me silver echoed dance with you if harry permits of course dumbledore added with a twinkle in his eye harry blushed uh yeah go ahead he answered dumbledore turned back to a flustered silver all right she agreed faintly dumbledore led her out to the dance floor and they began to dance students whispered and giggled pointing at the pair but nobody made too big of a deal out of it harry saw that dumbledore and silver were conversing as they waltzed he must have wanted to tell her something he commented yeah ron agreed or maybe he just wants her to tell him something hermione said smartly harry looked at hermione for a moment if he wanted her to tell him something about voldemort he wouldntdo it at a valentines ball he said keep your voice down potter snape snapped harry glanced up in surprise either snape had gotten closer or his glasses were playing tricks on him is he eavesdropping on us harry wondered in surprise he exchanged a glance with a scared looking ron and hermione and shrugged well harry silver doesntalways pick the most opportune moment to say things hermione reminded him yeah i guess harry admitted but i still think dumbledore crazy if he thinks she going to tell him anything about he was cut off by warning looks from ron and hermione which could only mean that snape was still eavesdropping he suddenly heard tonks voice and turned around she was making her way towards them with a smile on her face hey kids she greeted them fondly hi they chorused remus says hi harry she informed him cool harry said and then wait you talked to him today um well yes tonks said uncertainly a smirk began to spread across harry face in person yes tonks admitted flushing faintly you were on a date harry exclaimed this time tonks blush was definite no we weren t she argued sure harry smirked flustered tonks turned away and crashed full force into snape snape jumped as if he had been hit with a bomb harry was shaking with silent laughter oh um hi severus tonks greeted as she took two large steps back snape glowered at her hello he finally said stiffly i um didntknow you liked balls tonks ventured the look snape gave her was priceless he looked completely offended that anyone would ever think that he liked balls in the slightest i don t he answered oh tonks said in a small voice dumbledore suddenly seemed to appear out of thin air harry looked around for silver and began to panic when he couldntsee her not to worry harry dumbledore said miss riddle has only gone to the ladies room i was wondering though miss granger if perhaps you would accompany her i not particularly fond of the idea of her going off alone sure hermione replied heading for the door harry listened halfheartedly as tonks and ron began to participate in a conversation about quidditch but his eyes rested by the door awaiting silver return after a minute or so he looked over at dumbledore and snape and straightened when he heard a snatch of their conversation said she had something important to tell me after the ball snape was saying harry inched closer hoping not to be noticed do you think it about that matter though dumbledore asked gravely i suspect it snape answered she ll usually tell me things straight away but this makes me think that it more important than usual harry wondered if he had heard right if he had then snape had just admitted that he considered the things silver usually told him important i hope you re right dumbledore replied we re running out of time and potter snape growled suddenly interrupting dumbledore what are you doing harry froze he had gotten closer than he had meant to erm nothing he said i was just just just eavesdropping snape suggested harry felt a twinge of unfairness snape had been doing the exact same thing to them he opened his mouth to tell him so but when he looked up at snape snape was not looking at him his eyes were focused on hermione who was making her way towards them alone hermione was biting her lip when she reached them um i cantfind her she said meekly i ve looked in all the bathrooms except for the ones on the third floor but lavender and seam i mean um well lavender said she wasntup there hermione flushed slightly as she finished harry felt a bit of unease rising up in him she probably went to check on the blasted animal snape said irritably i ll get her with that he brushed past them harry almost wanted to follow snape but he stayed put why would she say she was going to the bathroom if she was going to go check on charisma he asked well you know her harry she probably was on her way back from the bathroom when she remembered how lonely charisma was and then decided to go visit her for a bit hermione replied comfortingly yeah you know how she much she loves that thing ron added from behind harry harry jumped and spun around to face ron and tonks he had been completely unaware that they had approached you re probably right he agreed although he would only be satisfied when he saw her he glanced up at dumbledore who merely nodded dontbe worried harry hermione urged i not harry lied he looked towards the door to escape the disbelieving stares being thrown his way for a few minutes nobody spoke everybody just looked at the door harry thought it was taking an awfully long time for snape just to walk to the dungeons get silver and come back he probably scolding her for going somewhere else hermione said suddenly interpreting harry thoughts yeah ron echoed weakly harry looked at them briefly he only had to look a second to see that they didntbelieve a word they were saying suddenly ron face went taut and he straightened looking behind harry harry slowly turned around and his stomach gave a lurch snape was making his way towards them alone i ve searched the dungeons and had the portraits search the halls he announced she not in the castle we ll have to search the grounds not in the castle harry mind echoed he looked at ron and hermione who both tried and failed to look as if they werentworried so be it dumbledore agreed tonks would you please ask professor mcgonagall to keep an eye on things while we are gone of course tonks replied hurrying off in the other direction harry watched her go dazedly hermione suddenly tugged at his sleeve come on harry she said he snapped to attention and realized that snape and dumbledore were already headed for the door he broke into a jog to catch up with them where do you think she is he demanded as he caught up dumbledore looked at him expressionlessly for a moment i must say i do not know he replied finally unsatisfied harry turned to snape snape eyed him with hatred and then directed his gaze away harry dropped back a few steps making a face at snape behind his back ron and hermione came on either side of him they made their way outside to be faced with a moonless night we should split up to cover more ground at once hermione suggested dumbledore nodded and opened his mouth to speak but was interrupted that wontbe necessary snape said from a few feet away he was looking down at the ground intensely and he finally stooped and reached for something he straightened and harry heart stopped beating completely he was holding silver locket at arm length finally he brought it closer to observe it the chain is broken he said sounding as if he were observing a potion somebody had made in class he and dumbledore exchanged glances she was taken by force he finished his voice suddenly quieter response to reviews kittie riddle thank you very much you say you want a clue shakes finger firmly no no no patience i know i evil smileymare1810 yeah i realized

longer than usual to update chapter 42 the ring harry followed dumbledore and snape up to dumbledore office in a trance ron and hermione had to literally drag him with them after the gargoyle sprang open harry paused and stared at it a bit as if he had never seen it before half of him felt like he had never seen it before in fact because it was so different harry hermione snapped her patience lost come on harry looked from hermione to ron to the gargoyle and suddenly sprinted up the stairs to dumbledore office he pushed open the door with a bang and dumbledore and snape merely looked at him unfazed where was she taken harry demanded looking back and forth between the two of them how are we supposed to know potter snape replied annoyance evident in his voice well when are we going to go get her harry asked snape gave him a look of utmost annoyance and turned back to dumbledore who was talking to the portrait of phineas nigellus right away phineas replied disappearing from the portrait then dumbledore turned to fawkes who was watching interestedly fawkes dumbledore said quietly the bird tilted it head questioningly find her was all dumbledore had to say for fawkes to disappear in a flash of fire how can she be gone harry demanded dumbledore and snape just stared at him i said how can she be gone harry yelled she just went to the bathroom how can she be gone dumbledore continued to look at him and snape shook his head and looked away for some reason snape action angered harry beyond belief how harry bellowed at snape why wontyou look at me it your fault you know if you had just harry was forced to stop as snape whirled around and grabbed him by the throat listen and listen well potter he snarled say that again and you wontlive past your next birthday let him go severus dumbledore commanded harry felt snape fingers tighten around his throat and then release harry took three large fast steps backwards breathing deeply he looked at dumbledore in amazement snape had just nearly strangled him and all dumbledore was going to do was tell him to let go dumbledore blue eyes seemed to be boring holes through his and harry was forced to look away the flames of dumbledore fire suddenly turned green and spat out a worried looking lupin good evening remus dumbledore greeted good evening remus harry echoed in his head silver disappears out of thin air and he has the nerve to say good evening he realized that lupin and dumbledore were both staring at him so he grudgingly greeted lupin lo he mumbled lupin looked as if he didntquite know what to do finally he walked over and put his hands on harry shoulders we ll find her harry he said harry nodded although he wasntso sure she had completely vanished how were they supposed to track that he heard the door open and tonks walked into view shortly she stared hard at him for a moment and then exchanged a meaningful glance with lupin harry turned away from the two and looked at dumbledore what are we going to do now he asked there nothing we can do harry except wait dumbledore replied maybe if i could talk to voldemort again he would tell me if he had caught her i know it he always gloats no harry lupin and dumbledore said at the same time harry glared at them well there has to be something to do other than just sit and wait he exclaimed shut your trap potter snape growled i dontha harry began hotly shut up snape roared advancing on him remembering the feel of snape fingers around his throat harry satisfied himself for a glare and obscene mutterings under his breath lupin stepped in between him and snape giving snape a death glare and him a sympathetic glance suddenly a ball of fire seemed to burst from dumbledore desk causing everyone but dumbledore himself to jump fawkes had returned ah fawkes dumbledore said have you found her fawkes lifted into the air and dived for snape who looked a bit frightened the bird attacked the inside of his robes and a death eater mask fell to the floor fawkes picked it up and dropped it into dumbledore hands harry felt like he was going to be sick that wasnta good sign at all dumbledore looked at fawkes gravely the same place he asked fawkes made a crooning noise and dumbledore seemed to have made a conclusion silver is at the cellar he announced she is alone and unguarded at the moment but that will soon change the door is easy to open from the outside but impossible from the inside severus remus and tonks you will retrieve her the children may come if you wish they stay snape said eyeing harry with dislike they go lupin countered they go tonks agreed sorry severus two to one snape gave her a murderous glare but then seemed to realize that he had other things to be doing well come on then he snapped snatching a jar from atop dumbledore fireplace and grabbing a handful of floo powder before thrusting the jar into lupin arms nobody dared to ask where they were flooing to snape threw the powder into the fire with force stepped in and demanded snape manor lupin politely held the jar open for tonks who smiled at him as she took some and then transported herself next went hermione then ron and then harry harry very nearly jumped out of the fireplace when it deposited him in snape study which caused everybody but snape to jump out of the way snape merely looked at him as if daring him to come into any kind of contact with him harry was returning snape glare as lupin arrived so why did we come here harry asked and what the cellar dontask questions snape replied and then to the rest of the group follow me exchanging glances everybody did as they were told snape seemed in a particularly bad mood and nobody wanted to push that snape grabbed his cloak and put it on as he led them out of his front door and began walking down the dark road severus tonks ventured where are we going are you deaf snape retorted the cellar donttalk to her like that lupin interjected snape looked back and sneered at him causing lupin face to redden with anger tonks looked back at lupin and mouthed let it be and lupin grudgingly nodded they came to a fork in the road and snape abruptly stopped and turned around causing everyone to stop dead we cannot talk beyond this point until we reach the cellar he said so i wanted to make clear what we are doing we are coming to get silver and only to get her his eyes focused on harry boring a hole into him reckless acts will result disastrously some of us would do well to remember that he finished are you talking about me harry asked his temper flaring yes potter i am snape answered you will not let your thirst for revenge risk her safety harry noted how the only person safety snape seemed concerned about in the least was silver s although he still felt like punching him in the nose he relented okay he said resentfully snape nodded and then swiftly spun and began to head down the right fork the path became more and more narrow as they progressed until they had to walk single file harry was right behind snape and he had no idea who was behind him all he knew was that he wanted to get to silver and fast however the trail never seemed to end snape neither sped up nor slowed down but kept up one brisk pace harry attempted to put his head to the side to see if there was a clearing or a cellar or anything really but as far as he could see in the moonless night the trail continued on forever suddenly snape stopped dead harry collided with him full force and behind him he felt many more impacts and a few yelps of surprise snape somehow managed to stay standing regarding them all with distaste but true to his word he didntspeak snape turned to his right and walked into the trees without hesitation for a moment harry just stood there and gaped but hermione pushed him impatiently and he dived in after snape snape led them through the thickest forest harry had ever been in at a very fast pace harry tripped over tree roots about every three steps but managed to stay on his feet the entire time if he put his hands up on either side of him he could always feel trees it was like walking through a very narrow dark bumpy hallway then it happened harry saw definite light ahead he began to quicken pace hopping over the tree roots as he did so he suddenly found that there was no more moss or roots under his feat but instead very worn down cobblestone the others filed out behind him and they all stopped and surveyed their surroundings with interest and wonder they were standing to the side of an old wide cobblestone street that was bathed in a dim sunlight in front of them was what looked to be a ghost town old dilapidated and crumbling stone buildings stood around them and broken down carts lay to the sides of the street the entire place had an eerie foreboding feeling to it where tonks began but snape lunged at her and clapped his hand over her mouth before she could say anything else he pushed her back into the forest his hand still over her mouth and the others quickly scrambled in at his look snape pushed tonks down and squatted beside her and the others did the same suddenly what sounded like rapid gunshots came from the clearing promptly followed by a shrill scream and more shooting harry crawled forward for a glimpse of what was going on but snape abandoned tonks and pulled him back by his collar harry put a hand on his now sore neck glaring at snape who mouthed dontlook in a very stern way the shots continued to be fired for at least another two minutes and then abruptly everything stopped snape made them stay crouched there for another five minutes before he rose and turned to them he put his finger to his lips and with a grim face stepped out of the trees harry was about to follow him when he saw snape cringe something snape had never done before cautiously harry stepped outside the sight before him nearly made him throw up laying just a few feet away from him was sirius dead his eyes were open and he was staring at harry emotionlessly harry began towards him but snape grabbed his wrist and shook his head harry allowed his eyes to dart away from sirius laying just a few feet away was a dead silver her eyes also open hermione cautiously stepped out of the trees and had to clap her hands over her mouth to refrain from making any noise ron stepped out and his eyes practically doubled he set his mouth in a firm line and refrained from making any noise however lupin stepped out and had much the same reaction finally came tonks her eyes widened and she jumped backwards snape raised his hand out in the air to get everyone attention and he began to walk determinedly down the street harry wanted to look up away from the corpses that he was sidestepping but he couldn t he walked past a dead lupin ron hermione dumbledore the entire weasley family and the entire order minus snape before he was truly affected lying dead on the street in front of him was cedric diggory the first thing that raced through harry mind was i have to take his body to his parents he reached down towards cedric and snape turned around faster than any normal human being ever could and grabbed harry arm harry tried to reach for cedric with his other hand snape grabbed both of his arms and hauled him past harry tripped over something and looked down to see another dead sirius it made him sick he fell to his knees and wretched next to sirius body snape still holding on to both of his arms harry made no effort to move when he was done and snape began to drag him holding both of his wrists in his hand harry felt incredible waves of loss and grief running over him and allowed himself to be dragged across the hard cobblestone not caring what physical pain it did him finally the corpses seemed to come to an abrupt end as the street forked off snape took the left road without slowing down in the least still being dragged harry managed to get to his feet at the same time feeling pangs of loss everyone dead he mourned silently i ll never play chess with ron again or do homework with hermione i ll never get a kiss from silver again i ll never be able to his thoughts were cut short as snape suddenly grabbed him by the shoulders and turned him around he felt waves of relief as he saw ron hermione lupin and tonks all walking towards him for a moment he just stood there but snape gave a sharp tug at his arm and harry knew that they werentdone yet he felt incredibly tired as he walked and that he would like nothing more than a good sleep his knees began to buckle but suddenly something hit him sharply on the side of the head snape fist he angrily opened his mouth to tell him off but was smothered by his hand immediately he exchanged a hateful glare with snape before consenting to keep quiet with a curt nod snape removed his hand from harry mouth and wiped it disdainfully on his robes harry couldnthelp but find it the tiniest bit amusing as they walked snape circled the group keeping them awake with blows to the head excepting tonks and hermione whom he shook roughly by the shoulders suddenly a small wooden house seemed to pop out of nowhere it was so small in fact that it looked like harry bedroom at the dursley with a door snape opened it and gestured for them to go inside harry stepped through the door expecting to find himself in a very small room but instead found himself on what looked to be the same path he had just stepped out of only the sunlight was gone and the moonless night they had come from had returned the feeling of gloom and depression left him and his tiredness faded away the others filed in behind him and looked similarly relieved tonks had tears streaking her face and was wiping at them furiously ron was extremely red looking as if he had just gotten the most embarrassing insult of his life hermione and lupin simply looked stunned just ahead of them was a small well and beyond that a small stone room with a door that looked like the one they had just entered finally snape came in and shut the door behind him we can talk now he announced immediately he was bombarded with questions what was that place why couldntwe talk where are we how did you know your way through that forest harry kept silent as the others asked questions for he could see snape tolerance level going down as the level of questions went up silence snape yelled everyone fell quiet immediately snape inhaled deeply giving them all piercing looks that was the only way to get to the cellar he said quietly it is an enchanted magical town that is activated at the sound of the human voice the person or people you have deep emotions towards in any way but hate are the ones that you saw dead if you were to touch one he paused and glanced at harry you would die the next path we walked down is designed to use the feelings of grief and loss you had previously felt to lure you to sleep if you had slept you wouldnthave woken up do do we have to go back hermione ventured most likely snape replied but as long as everyone stays silent there will be no side effects to the roads we take why did i see sirius harry asked suddenly if he already dead why did i see him harry didntwant to mention the fact that he had also seen cedric just because someone is dead doesntmean you canthave feelings about them snape replied and what would you know about feelings harry wondered as he looked at snape the most emotionless being he had ever met snape looked back at him with no sign of sympathy at the fact that harry had just been tortured by images of his dead godfather who did you see harry inquired that none of your business snape replied evenly fine harry said annoyed where silver snape pointed to the small stone room in there he replied with that he began to walk towards it harry was momentarily stunned but then he quickly caught up to snape why ve you been sitting here all this time he demanded why haventwe gotten her already snape whirled around on him his eyes flashing menacingly because i needed a break he hissed harry took a step backwards and fumbled for his wand snape rolled his eyes and turned back towards the small house when he reached the door he turned to them and said quietly stand back they all backed up immediately and snape threw open the door and stood to the side after waiting a few seconds he stepped cautiously into the doorway suddenly like a hound that picked up a scent he straightened the others quietly walked up behind him and held their breaths when they heard what had caught his attention right in front of them was a long stairway that led downwards and coming from it there was unmistakably the sound of sobbing silver snape called the sobs stopped for a moment and then returned twice as loud as the first time silver snape said only this time it was a statement he put a foot on the stairway but silver voice stopped him no she cried dontcome down here snape pointed his wand down the stairway as if ready to hex it is it a trap he asked cautiously n no she sobbed but y you cantd down why not snape inquired eyeing the stairway suspiciously b because she wailed i not i donthave any i m what is it child snape demanded silver only sobbed louder snape looked flustered what is she talking about he asked incredulously looking at them silver harry called what if i came down no she yelled don t y you dare harry was appalled at her passionate answer but snape looked a bit satisfied they all looked at each other questioningly as they listened to silver sobs when suddenly hermione whispered something into tonks ear tonks eyes widened and she stepped up to the stairway and squatted down silver she called are you naked yes silver wailed miserably harry and snape each took a huge step back from the stairway lupin and ron edged away a bit as well hermione began to look around the small room intently where are your clothes tonks called are they up here n no came the reply hermione stopped searching the room are they down there somewhere tonks asked hopefully no silver sobbed v v voldemort h has t them filthy bastard snape cursed loudly he took off his cloak and thrust it at tonks tonks took it and looked from the cloak to snape questioningly do with it what you must snape said impatiently just get her clothed and bring her to me tonks nodded silver she called down the staircase i coming down there okay no silver cried listen honey i going to bring you something to wear tonks explained n n no silver sobbed tonks sighed and looked at hermione who shook her head she would want you to go down more than she would me hermione said trust me tonks nodded and began to head down the stairs everybody listened intently the heightening of silver sobs signaled that tonks had successfully made it down the staircase here sweetie wrap yourself up in this while i get the door unlocked tonks said soothingly they heard the rattling of chains and then a horrible sliding noise followed by a click silver sobs quieted dramatically alright now tonks was saying i thought we d just wrap it around you and tonks voice trailed off momentarily and when they heard it again she sounded as if she were on the verge of tears oh sweetie tonks sighed it going to be okay silver voice became audible but harry couldnttell what she was saying you re going to be all right tonks was saying soothingly everything going to be fine now let get this cloak on you properly no we cantstay here for a while severus would kill me a second later tonks called up sorry sev we re going to have to tear your cloak i don t snape began but suddenly he stopped and his eyes flashed sev he roared sev tonks giggles drifted up the staircase but silver remained silent the anger left snape eyes to be replaced by worry harry began to pace in front of the stairway running his hand through his hair repeatedly suddenly he heard footsteps he jumped around and faced the stairway not daring to peek down but waiting for silver to surface there nothing to be scared of sweetie tonks was saying soothingly a moment later the two appeared silver was latched into tonks side shaking uncontrollably she was wearing snape cloak as one would a bath towel clutching it to her defensively her eyes lifted and slowly scanned the room her eyes locked onto his and she gave a sharp intake of breath and clutched her towel to her closer than before and shaking even more she blushed and lowered her eyes leaving harry halfway confused he could see how it might be awkward for her being wrapped up in nothing but a cloak but she had looked scared scared of him her eyes continued to search the room until they locked onto snape she tore away from tonks and ran to him hide me she whimpered snape awkwardly lowered his arms so that they covered her bare shoulders still shaking a sob escaped her she began to cry murmuring into his robes the entire time the word scared could be made out again and again it was obvious that snape had no idea what to do harry had to admit he had no idea himself finally her sobs subsided which left her merely shaking i was so scared she said shakily so scared well you can stop being scared now snape replied a matter of fact tone to his voice she didntreply and snape looked down at the top of her head with worry why are you shaking he demanded still no reply snape squatted down and looked up at her piercingly what did he do to you he asked she shook her head and buried it in his shoulder snape looked at a loss until his eyes landed on harry he seemed to have an idea you haventsaid hello to potter yet he informed her she drew away and harry was unable to see the expression on her face as she looked at him then she turned and looked at harry his stomach flopped about excitedly he wanted to run up to her take her in his arms and swing her around with joy at having found her but the fearful look in her eye stopped him she took a cautious step towards him her head tilted to the side as she observed him i wonthurt you he said quietly it was almost as if she were released from a spring she launched herself into his arms her face buried in the crook of his neck trying not to look too shocked he wrapped his arms around her harry she whispered quietly he pressed a kiss into her hair in reply and she tightened her arms around him after a few seconds she took a step back and out of his arms she looked at him intently for a moment before putting a hand to her forehead and letting out a soft sigh oh no she groaned harry and snape both stepped towards her concernedly she turned to snape much to harry disappointment she and snape looked at each other for a moment before she completely burst snape put a hand to her lips to silence her and squatted down once more again slower he requested she took a deep breath voldemort is going to kill the dursleys so that harry wontbe protected at their house anymore he going to lure them out telling them they ve won something i dontknow what apparently bella thought of the plan though so it cantbe that clever he also let all the death eaters out of azkaban tonight but i doubt the rest of the wizarding world will know until around noon tomorrow when fudge makes the rounds because the dementors arentgoing to raise the alert oh and they re going to perform the kiss on fudge while he there but let at least one other person off to tell the story she finished and there was complete silence snape blinked at her a couple of times and then straightened when is he planning on carrying out his plan he asked casually silver bit her lip um tomorrow at around noon she said snape blinked at her again and then pulled out his watch i suppose you mean today around noon he observed wryly i really sorry silver said her lower lip quivering dangerously i wanted to tell you dontbe sorry snape said it not your fault but it is silver protested i knew about it and i didnttell you dontbe silly child snape replied briskly now how are you feeling silver looked surprise at the change in subject how am i feeling she echoed yes snape said impatience lacing his voice she seemed to consider it a moment terrible she finally pronounced but much better than i did a few hours ago tired snape asked no o silver replied as she yawned snape smirked i can tell he said sarcastically silver looked around how are we getting home she asked she looked at the door and took a step back not that way she said her voice begging it the only way snape replied no she said fervently i ll never go there again it was it was horrible you were dead she turned her eyes on him and he looked back down at her with a strange expression in his eye finally he seemed to have made a decision come here child he requested silver took a cautious step towards him he looked down at her gravely and began to speak but harry was suddenly distracted by something in the corner of the room it was a small ring probably gold with a glittering red stone on top a ruby for some reason it looked familiar to him as if it were his and he had lost it a very long time ago he began to walk towards it entranced by it sparkle harry donttouch that silver exclaimed suddenly but it mine his mind said i have to touch it i have to he stretched out his hand towards it and heard a faint cry somewhere in the distance but it didntmatter the only thing that mattered was getting the ring the ring that was enticing him as he looked at it he had to at least touch it feel it it is mine after all he thought to himself somebody grabbed ahold of his other arm and he began to panic no he shouted let me get my ring he lunged for it and whoever was holding him lost their grip on him he greedily grabbed at the ring and one of his fingers made contact suddenly he felt a tugging at his navel realization hit him hard and much too late the ring was a portkey response to reviews finelinebetweenloveandhate i glad you like my story

happen and i didntrealize it until you guys told me heehee oh well chapter 44 cup of tea harry hit the ground with a thud that made him dizzy for a moment he just stared at the cold stone floor in front of him then he slowly and groggily sat up and looked around for a moment his vision was blurry all he knew was that he was in a very dark cold room slowly everything began to come into focus in front of him all with their backs turned were many more death eaters than he would like to count all of them bowing towards a tall figure seated atop a stone throne there was no doubt that it was voldemort harry looked down at his hand to discover that the ring that he had been grasping was gone he glanced up at voldemort who was busy giving a speech to a particular death eater kneeled at his feet harry then realized that he was out in the open and probably very conspicuous although he would like nothing better than to punch voldemort in the nose for whatever he had done to silver another half of him wanted to get back to her he hadntbeen ready to leave just then he glanced around for the ring that he had previously held in his fist and saw that it had fallen in between two kneeling death eaters he must have thrown it on accident when he landed there was no way he could chance getting it he looked up towards voldemort again and saw a heap of diamonds in the shadows by his throne diamonds he thought not diamonds silver robes anger and recklessness began to wash over him in waves each more powerful than the last he opened his mouth to yell but abruptly snapped it shut you didnteven say goodbye to silver an unfamiliar voice in his head scolded getting back to her is more important than killing yourself because you re angry at voldemort harry edged towards a wooden table that was in the corner and crouched in it shadows thinking hard but that little bastard deserves to pay another more familiar voice yelled loudly and if you get yourself killed silver will pay the other one argued harry put his hands to his head and suppressed a groan he was beginning to get a headache fine he thought suddenly i wontdo anything stupid i ll just grab silver clothes grab the ring and get out simple enough he got up and began to edge his way along the far wall towards silver clothing when he finally came into seeing range of the death eaters he slowed his pace none of them paid any attention to him however they were all watching and listening to voldemort intently harry suddenly heard a snatch of the conversation voldemort gave a cold chuckle that caused a shiver to go down harry spine yes yes we will soon be having fun with what lucius and i call our little flower voldemort was announcing lucius lucius harry thought furiously oh you will will you he asked angrily there goes the plan the voice in his head said disappointedly the entire crowd of death eaters and voldemort all whirled around to look at him he was faced with the uncomfortable realization that there was a wall behind him and a wall of death eaters in front of him well well look who decided to join us voldemort said his voice laced with amusement harry opened his mouth and then snapped it shut for the second time in less than ten minutes just shut up and get to the ring his mind yelled angrily voldemort not even supposed to know that you know silver cat got your tongue voldemort inquired harry looked into the red snakelike eyes and felt a twinge of uncertainty he suddenly remembered his and silver conversation about the prophecy i not planning on losing he had told her what if you do she had asked tearfully it not even an option had been his reply but he hadntbeen counting on facing voldemort in person so soon so what the voice in his head said boastfully you can take him on now you have power that he knows not of course if you knew what that power was it might help a tiny bit damn he muttered for lack of anything else to say voldemort chuckled what the matter harry he asked a mockingly cheerful note to his voice dontyou want to be here yeah harry answered sarcastically i was bored so i just thought i d drop by and maybe we d have a cup of tea such good humor for someone who about to die voldemort commented your father wasntnearly so cheerful harry felt a surge of anger pass through him he pointed his wand at voldemort threateningly donttalk about my father he said coldly voldemort laughed and a shiver went up harry spine i ll talk about whatever i wish boy he said and then his voice a soft hiss donttell me what to do i ll tell you whatever i want harry answered hotly before he knew what was happening voldemort wand was pointed at him and the cruciatus curse was headed his way death eaters flew out of the way as if they were being blown to the side it hit him and hot pain surged through his body his head was about to split open where his scar was and he fell to the ground curling into a fetal position he couldnttell if he was screaming or not the pain was so intense but when the curse was lifted voldemort was laughing and so he assumed he had been now boy voldemort said you will die he sure cutting to the chase quickly harry thought to himself although if i had wanted to kill someone for sixteen years and he always managed to escape at the last minute i d probably finish him off pretty quickly harry raised his wand subtly ready to shout out every single curse or hex that he had ever learned and hope that he could end up with one of his arms intact but he was interrupted a loud crack could suddenly be heard and an unmistakable masked figure apparated at the foot of voldemort throne voldemort surveyed snape distastefully i haventsummoned you he informed him finally snape straightened and began to walk towards harry he pushed his way through the death eaters until he was right in the middle of them and harry snape voldemort hissed i have not summoned you snape turned towards voldemort and took off his mask audible gasps went through the death eaters harry supposed it was a sign of disrespect snape held his wand out in front of him and a small ball of green light appeared at the tip if it hadntbeen such a serious moment harry would have laughed at the look of confusion on voldemort face snape muttered something and the green ball of light began to expand reminding harry oddly of his torch get him voldemort suddenly cried the death eaters exchanged glances and then lunged forward as they did so the ball of light seemed to explode enfolding snape in a green shield it looked as if a tornado were taking place within the bubble for snape hair and robes blew every which way a string of bright white light went from the tip of his wand to the top of the globe he was standing in confused and probably scared the death eaters paused one of them took a bold step forwards apparently expecting to make it through the green shield but as soon as contact was made a kind of electrical force shot up their leg making them scream and then fall to the ground the boy voldemort said apparently changing his mind get the boy instead snape whirled to face harry with a menacing look on his face or was it a grimace what are you waiting for he demanded get inside what harry exclaimed he would rather be taken by the death eaters than be fried trying to step into some weird green bubble get inside now snape commanded saying each word with painstaking exaction harry stubbornly stayed where he was which was pressed against the wall about three feet away from the edge of the bubble as the death eaters swarmed around on both sides towards him foolish impertinent disobedient snape raged harry couldnthelp but smirk accio potter snape yelled suddenly he cantdo that harry thought not without using his wa suddenly he was pulled forward as if he were tied to the back of the hogwarts express he didnteven feel himself pass through the shield the only thing he felt was snape stagger backwards as he smashed into him snape pushed him away roughly and harry fell hard on his bottom he let out a few choice swear words that made snape look down at him in a mixture of amusement and disgust donttempt me to dock points from gryffindor he said harry was surprised that he could hear snape what with all the wind that was inside of the bubble or shield whatever it was it felt as if he were in the middle of a whirlwind but the wind wasntpushing him to the sides it was merely blowing around him and bouncing off he was also surprised that snape was treating the situation so lightly he struggled to get his thoughts together when he finally did all he could think was snape is definitely going to get killed for doing this silver is going to have a heart attack and die when she finds out he took a deep breath at this stage there was only one thing to do and that was to help snape at least until voldemort killed him or both of them for that matter torch he thought i need the torch he took it out but snape saw put it away potter he spat we dontneed to be blinded right now harry opened his mouth to protest but snape cut him off his voice barely above a whisper listen potter you must not let the dark lord see that weapon put it away this instant harry grudgingly put it in his pocket now summon the ring snape commanded no harry answered flatly at the same time that he spoke voldemort did as well severus he roared his voice echoing through the room what are you doing snape turned to face him unblinkingly i saving potter he announced a look of pure shock registered on voldemort face and harry couldnthelp but grin he doubted voldemort had ever been quite so confused voldemort face suddenly grew hard get the ring snape hissed traitor voldemort roared at the same time harry answered no summon the bloody ring before you no longer have a chance snape exclaimed impatiently but harry began he was drowned out by voldemort i do not tolerate traitorous acts you shall pay snape and pay dearly he was looking at snape with an intense dislike and although his voice was calm it was ten times louder than harry s get the ring snape said calmly his eyes locked with voldemort s he spoke quietly enough that voldemort couldnthear them and harry did the same although his temper was rising i wontget the ring harry argued i the one who can defeat voldemort now snape voldemort was saying fingering his wand as he surveyed the two inside the shield you do realize that your silly bubble cannot stop the force of my spells listen potter snape said completely ignoring voldemort i not here to defeat him you can do that later as of now you and i both know that you are not ready i am too harry answered normally death would be inflicted but i think we ll have a bit of fun first shantwe voldemort was inquiring silkily potter snape began but he was cut off crucio voldemort hissed his eyes seeming to glow in their sockets a red light traveled down the white line of electricity that was connected to snape wand and his body and face contorted in pain he still held his wand arm up although harry could tell that he would not be able to do so for much longer go to silver snape breathed now harry put one hand on snape arm as he pulled out his wand but snape moved out of reach donttake me he whispered amidst voldemort laughs why not harry demanded silver will get over it snape finished shortly his breathing shallow right now he needs to be kept busy he cantknow about silver until she s with dumbledore your shield will not hold much longer snape voldemort was crying triumphantly go snape hissed at harry harry looked snape straight in the eye silver needs you he said the world needs you snape replied pausing to wince you have the world and i have her snape knees were beginning to buckle but he stayed standing with much effort you are the world to her harry replied just come let me take you get lost potter snape grunted i m not planning on dying today but you have to go a thousand thoughts chased around in harry mind he wasntsure if he should leave snape or not a year ago i would have grabbed the ring and hauled off he thought to himself but this wasnta year ago silver had changed everything he wasntsure how she would react to the news that he had simply left snape in voldemort chambers potter snape exclaimed harshly although harry wasntsure if it was from impatience of the amount of pain he was feeling harry took a deep breath and made a decision accio ring he yelled a fleck of gold shot towards him snape shield suddenly vanished and he crumpled to the ground harry immediately felt he had made the wrong decision snape managed to bring his head up to look at voldemort as the ring landed in harry hand harry watched as his eyes filled with defeat landed on the pile of silvery robes next to voldemort throne a remarkable change came over them the defeat vanished completely to be replaced by determination and hate bastard snape shouted bitter accusing filling his voice that was the last harry heard or saw before he felt a tugging at his navel and he was no longer in the cold dark room response to reviews black and potter you ll find out a bit about what happened to silver in

kind of makes sense i went on a writing spree today can you tell and lookie i a good widdle writer two chappies in one day pats self on head chapter 45 what happened harry landing was actually a bit more graceful this time it was on his feet at least in the same corner of the room where he had found the ring the ring which he had been grasping tightly slipped from his fingers as he landed and he immediately bent to pick it up but shot backwards suddenly upon remembering that it was a portkey he carefully tore a bit of his shirt off and wrapped the ring in it then he put it in his pocket and looked around he distinctly heard voices coming from outside he cautiously stepped into the doorway and somebody gave a yelp of surprise he heard his name being shouted by everybody there and they all rushed up to him silver reached him first and reached out to enfold him in a hug but her fingers barely touched his shoulder before he jumped away ouch he exclaimed glaring at her unintentionally she tilted her head to the side questioningly the cruciatus curse he explained oh harry she sighed sympathy evident in her eyes although she kept her distance it was evident that she wanted nothing more than to run into his arms harry suddenly noticed hermione whispering something in ron ear his eyes widened and he exchanged a glance with hermione they both looked at harry extremely hard and he felt uncomfortable hermione proceeded to whisper in both lupin and tonks ears and in the end they were all looking at harry with that same look he looked downwards and scratched the back of his neck uncomfortably so lupin said what happened well i got transported to wherever voldemort is harry said nobody saw me at first and i had dropped the ring in between two death eaters so i was going to go and get silver clothes and then get the ring and leave you didnthave to get my clothes harry silver said chidingly yeah well he said unapologetically anyway voldemort caught me well i kind of attracted attention to myself and then harry suddenly trailed off and then snape came he thought he looked down at silver and then up at the others what is it harry silver asked well and then he paused and then snape came silver eyes widened she took a step backwards realization flooding her eyes and and then she asked softly well he made this kind of green bubble shield thing and it protected us from the other death eaters harry said slowly and then i i summoned the ring he was careful to leave out the part about snape being tortured and sentenced to death but he didntthink it was doing much good as he looked at her her eyes began to water at an amazingly fast rate harry she choked where where is he now harry looked at the ground avoiding her gaze the shield it will protect him wontit she asked harry shook his head what what do you mean she questioned beginning to sound frantic it silver it wontwork against voldemort spells he said but he not he not harry is he she didntfinish but when he met her gaze she was looking at him pleadingly he looked back down at the ground no she said he not no please harry harry ran a hand through his hair what would be a good way to say it he wondered no he wasntdead when i left but he doesntstand a chance well he he wasntdead when i left harry said slowly so i dontknow what happened he looked up at the others helplessly they all had realization written all over their faces then he not dead silver said decidedly he alive well you never know lupin said reasonably but silver you have to understand it would be an incredible feat to be able to live when voldemort wants you dead harry glanced at silver she had her eyes squeezed shut as if trying to block everyone out she lifted her face upwards her lips pursed in concentration silver lupin asked i know she said quietly i know but he alive harry squeezed his own eyes shut and pressed his hands over them he wanted a time turner more than anything at that moment he would go back in time and take snape back with him or better yet he wouldnttouch the dratted ring at all or he would just stop silver from leaving the ball to think this all started on valentines day he thought wryly silver you cantbe sure lupin said his own voice quiet but i know it i just know it she said i can feel it he he might have run away or or harry personally felt that snape was in no condition to run anywhere after the effects of the cruciatus curse and knew he was going to have to tell her so or voldemort may have forgiven him or there a laugh harry thought voldemort forgiving she just going to have to face that snape is dead there no way that he survived i mean he could barely lift up his head or silver was desperately trying to think up some way that snape might be alive perhaps he disapparated somebody suggested yes she exclaimed triumphantly he disapparated harry opened his eyes and looked at ron whom he assumed had said it ron was looking right back at him ron i dontthink he could have disapparated harry said blandly okay so why d you suggest it then ron replied what me i didn t harry answered turning to lupin dontlook at me lupin said the three of them turned to look at tonks oh come on my voice doesntsound anything like that tonks exclaimed when they looked at hermione she rolled her eyes yes of course it was me because i sound just like that she said sarcastically suddenly silver gave a gleeful laugh where are you she called lifting her face upwards as if expecting an answer from the heavens silver hermione exclaimed you donteven know who said that silver laughed in reply silver stop it tonks said you re inviting a stranger suddenly silver took off towards the house but instead of going in it she went around it she rounded the corner and they heard a scream exchanging glances they took off after her great harry thought now she gone and gotten attacked by a death eater they all rounded the corner with their wands drawn out and pointed in front of them only to stop and gape silver was jumping up and down in front of a bloody and bruised snape snape was watching her bounce with an amused look on his face despite his physical state severus tonks asked he gave her an annoyed look yes he asked evenly how lupin questioned for her i thought i just told you snape replied i disapparated but you said that coming through that town was the only way to get here hermione said yes i did snape replied and i was mistaken the only ways to get here are either coming through the town or disapparating to a clearing in that forest he paused and pointed behind the house where a thick forest was and then coming here at least as far as i know oh hermione said looking at the forest with interest how come we didntjust go to the forest to begin with harry asked a bit angrily i mean we had to walk through that horrible shut it potter snape said irritably i didntknow that you could apparate to the forest until just now that where it took me when i attempted to apparate here i must say it was a better outcome than i expected harry rolled his eyes and grudgingly closed his mouth silver was bouncing up and down on her tiptoes her hands clasped together in front of her chest looking as though at any moment she was going to launch herself at snape she was paying absolutely no attention to anyone else in fact harry doubted if she would have known they were there if snape hadntbeen talking to them we should go snape commented as he looked at her we ll use the forest again everybody either nodded or murmured their agreement and began to head towards the forest you cantwalk silver exclaimed suddenly they all looked back at snape who was limping badly off his right leg he shuffled along wincing each time his left foot came in contact with the ground easier in forest he grunted trees the forest was about ten feet away from them but harry wasntsure if snape could make it severus lupin said cautiously how about we levitate you snape looked up with a deadly glare i can make it fine on my own thank you he said coldly lupin looked as if he were about to protest but silver beat him to it please cantwe just levitate you and let you rest she begged laying her fingers gently on his arm and giving him a pleading look i dontwant you to get any more hurt than you already are no snape snapped refusing to make eye contact with her i m fine he attempted to take normal sized steps and he gasped as his face contorted in pain giving no sign that she had seen his struggle silver stepped in front of him and rose on her tiptoes he glared over her head a small smile on her face she waited patiently in front of him finally he looked down at her you re in my way child he informed her please let us levitate you she begged no please he looked upwards quickly as she pleaded with him with her eyes he glanced back down and made an exasperated noise when he saw that her expression had not changed fine he relented silver beamed and stepped aside as tonks and lupin got out their wands snape made quite a fuss when they refused to let him down when they reached the forest but rather insisted on carrying him all the way to the clearing i tell you i fine come now it must feel good to rest silver prompted it most certainly does not he answered glaring at her coldly i want down you re such a baby she informed him flipping her hair over her shoulder i am not he argued then stop whining she replied snape made a face at her in a very childish way and ron had a suspicious coughing fit is this it tonks asked suddenly interrupting the death glare snape was giving ron in front of them the trees opened up to a small grassy circle it looked like a very peaceful place except that one patch of grass was stained red with blood everyone eyes traveled from it to the gash in snape shoulder as if on cue yes this is it snape said glaring at everyone who was staring at him and shifting his shoulder uncomfortably now put me down for the love of merlin tonks and lupin obediently complied gently setting snape down for a moment everybody looked at the obviously worn out potions master as bad as it sounded they all knew that his future was not looking so good at the moment he had managed to escape voldemort wrath once but to put it frankly he was not under any circumstances harry potter so ah who going to hang on to the kids lupin asked suddenly breaking everyone out of their reveries i ll take the girls and you can take the boys tonks offered alri lupin began agreeably no snape contradicted i ll be taking silver tonks and lupin exchanged glances are you are you sure you re up for that severus lupin ventured it would probably be easier for you to just apparate yourself no it wouldn t as a matter of fact snape snapped tonks sighed just let him take her remus she said as lupin opened his mouth to argue lupin nodded you first then he said motioning to snape the shrieking shack of course snape looked at silver and she tentatively stepped beside him with about three feet in between them come here child he said sounding exasperated i dontwant to hurt you though she protested just come snape answered she looked at harry questioningly and he gave her a brief nod she scooted closer to snape and he put one arm around her shut his eyes in concentration and they disappeared with a pop right then you next lupin said to tonks tonks put an arm around hermione and they vanished lupin put one arm each around ron and harry shoulders and the next thing harry knew they were standing in the living room of an extremely old wooden house some claw marks on the wall caught harry attention and when he looked at lupin he saw that lupin was looking at them as well he realized that they were probably lupin own as enchanting as strolls down memory lane can be let get a move on shall we snape asked his sarcastic voice cutting through the silence he received many glares and a look of sympathy from silver which harry completely did not understand however after looking at silver he seemed quite satisfied with himself tonks and lupin began to withdraw their wands and he glared at them suspiciously what are you doing he demanded both of them looked surprised well levitating you of course lupin said finally i think not snape said coldly what tonks lupin and silver chorused i will not be disgraced in such a way snape hissed it wouldntbe disgraceful silver protested i walking was his firm reply everyone eyes traveled to the stairs can we at least levitate you up the stairs silver ventured meekly no she sighed you re infuriating she informed him i ve obviously been spending too much time with you then he answered he began to head for the stairs at a slow shuffle silver giggled i think it the other way around she informed him he merely looked at her and shook his head when they reached the staircase snape didnthesitate for one moment before putting one hand on the railing and using it to help lift him up onto the first stair it was slow business but he made it with no complaints silver watched him worriedly the entire time i going to have remus walk next to you she said suddenly he gave her a sharp look why he demanded because i scared you re going to fall she said i wontfall he replied you re going to keel over any minute she insisted dontmake me sound old was his reply you are she answered a hint of teasing in her voice he gave her a look which clearly stated that he did not appreciate her comment i was just kidding she exclaimed but really remus needs to walk next to you i think not he answered dryly well i think so she answered the two argued all the way to the tunnel which led to the whomping willow which was actually a very long time considering the pace snape was traveling at neither of them gave an inch to the other the entire time fine snape said suddenly just shut your mouth and leave me in peace instead of looking insulted silver looked pleased as she dropped back to allow lupin to take her place looking extremely amused lupin stepped forward silver fell into step beside harry and he immediately put an arm around her and drew her close wincing as he did so every inch of his body was still sore from the cruciatus curse but he had an intense desire to hold her in his arms and never let go harry you re hurting yourself she exclaimed attempting to pull away no i not ah he exclaimed he had pulled her a bit too close and a wave of pain had shot through the side of his body harry i dontwant to hurt you she said snaking out of his grasp he clutched his side in reply okay just walk with me he answered she fell into step beside him and when he looked up at her he saw tears in her eyes what is it he asked she shook her head and wrapped her arms around herself and harry understood i can still hold you he said reaching out for her but she jumped away no harry she said just stop he sighed and let his arms fall back to his sides he didnttruthfully know if he would have been able to bear holding her he was so sore when they finally came to the exit lupin expertly used a long stick on the ground to prod the knot while everyone exited afterwards he made a spectacular exit from the tree flailing branches that made tonks and hermione nearly double over with laughter it was a slow trek to the castle and it was evident that snape was furthering his pain with every step but he determinedly continued on when they walked through the castle doors they were subject to more than a few strange looks several people called their friends over to watch the strange procession make their way towards dumbledore office harry could see why lupin tonks hermione and ron looked thoroughly worn out whilst he and snape were bruised all over snape also appeared to be literally on his last leg as he shuffled through the hallways a grim expression on his face and blood trickling down his shoulder and then there was silver whom appeared to be wrapped in a black towel and nothing else the moment they had entered silver had fled to tonks who was really the only one available to hide her from the curious stares soon the gargoyle came into view and if harry wasntmistaken snape quickened his pace a bit suddenly professor mcgonagall came flying around the corner nearly crashing into snape which needless to say would have been disastrous snape gave her a glare but she merely gasped upon seeing him what happened to you she exclaimed her gaze traveled to harry and you she didntbother to look at the others she simply ran up to the gargoyle yelled a password and waited for them all to pass through it was slow business getting up the slightly windy staircase with snape in the lead although he never would have admitted it he lost his balance a few times and had to be steadied by lupin in each case he yanked his arm out of lupin grasp and glared at him fiercely finally they reached the top lupin opened the door and they slowly filed in dumbledore eyes did not manage to completely hide his surprise as he looked at them snape desperately made his way towards a chair and then wincing before anything had even happened sat down in it he then let out more than a few swear words grimacing and gritting his teeth as he did so i daresay a muscle relief potion is in order dumbledore observed and you too harry harry had been slowly easing himself down in a loveseat squeezing his eyes shut and wincing yeah he croaked as he sat down dumbledore opened the drawer of his desk and pulled out a forest green potion i afraid i only have one at the moment he stated the boy snape grunted obviously still in pain from sitting down give it to the boy no harry began you re more shut up potter snape cut off just shut up and drink it harry obediently took the potion from dumbledore who was smart enough not to argue with snape at the moment and drank it a tingling coldness flowed through his body easing his aches and causing his muscles to relax as he finished he allowed himself to sink into the sofa contentedly dumbledore observed him approvingly minerva he said transferring his gaze to professor mcgonagall would you please go down to madam pomfrey and obtain another vial two snape grunted from his chair another two vials dumbledore corrected himself certainly professor mcgonagall said she turned around but as she did her eyes caught on silver who had been edging closer to harry her eyes widened as she surveyed her merlin child where are your clothes she exclaimed for a moment there was no response but then very suddenly silver burst into tears almost as if she had just remembered what had happened to her professor mcgonagall looked shocked silver harry said quietly she needed no further urging to run into his arms he pulled her close to him reveling in her closeness and warmth he turned his face into the side of her head closing his eyes to the softness of her hair he pressed a kiss into it and lowered his lips down to her ear it alright he whispered you re okay her sobs subsided to quiet shaking against him her face buried in the crook of his neck he heard professor mcgonagall leave the room and reluctantly drew his head back to look at dumbledore miss granger he said quietly i dontsuppose you would mind running and fetching miss riddle some clothes of course not hermione replied and with that she was gone dumbledore leaned back in his chair watching silver intently harry turned his attention back to her murmuring comforting words into her ear harry she whispered so softly that he could hardly hear her i was really scared i know he whispered back he was about to say you donthave to be scared of me when he remembered the look she had given him when she had just come up the stairway are you scared of me he asked instead oh no harry she whispered tightening her arms around him of course not good he answered kissing the side of her head once more he rubbed small circles on her back and she relaxed into his arms he closed his eyes and leaned his head back slightly tightening his hold on her as he did so the feel of her breath on his neck reassured and relaxed him greatly and he allowed himself to match his breathing with hers all too soon hermione arrived back along with professor mcgonagall who looked wholeheartedly disapproving of the position harry and silver were in i believe miss riddle that you will find a very suitable changing closet through that door dumbledore announced pointing to a small wooden door in the back corner of the room silver nodded and wiped at her eyes as she drew away from harry and accepted a bundle of clothing from hermione once she disappeared into the closet dumbledore proceeded to place a silencing charm on the door then he turned to snape who had just gulped down both the muscle relief potions harry wasntsure if dumbledore had ever looked so grim i take it she wasntwearing the towel when you found her he inquired ah no snape replied placing the empty vials on a table next to him that was my cloak a piece of my cloak dumbledore fixed snape with a questioning look no snape answered only she did he motioned to tonks at the last part of his answer and harry could guess what the question had been has she told you what happened dumbledore asked snape shook his head she was shaking badly though and crying he said he shook his head as if trying to rid himself of the memory then something hit harry voldemort said that he and lucius did something to her he said lucius snape roared jumping up from his chair and withdrawing his wand looking as if he were about to go hunting for lucius sit down severus i daresay it a good thing i put that silencing charm on the door dumbledore said and then turning to harry i have two questions for you my first is how lucius has escaped from azkaban voldemort harry answered he let all the death eaters go dumbledore nodded right then secondly how did you come to encounter voldemort harry blushed at the reminder of his own stupidity or as snape would probably put it foolishness well there was this ring on the ground and i really wanted to touch it i dontknow why i just had to and well it was a portkey harry pulled the wrapped up ring out of his pocket and handed it to dumbledore dumbledore almost opened it when the doorknob of the closet turned and opened silver came out looking considerably more confident and sure of herself with snape torn cloak in one hand dumbledore placed the wrapped up ring on his desk and watched as silver sat back down next to harry and snuggled up to him feeling better dumbledore inquired courteously yes much silver replied dumbledore nodded i am happy to hear that miss riddle he said however i am going to need you to explain to me exactly what happened while you were with voldemort silver eyes widened which is why dumbledore continued that i am going to ask everybody that is currently present excepting severus to wait just outside this door on the staircase harry tensed what did he mean excepting severus he should be allowed to stay too he gave silver a questioning look and she studied him for a moment before turning to dumbledore please can harry stay too she inquired of course dumbledore answered harry relaxed once more his arm still around her waist she was no longer content in his arms however but she was now sitting up tensely biting her lip and breathing deeply she turned to him as dumbledore went to place silencing charms on the door her eyes soft and unsure harry she asked timidly i really sorry if this hurts your feelings but would you mind sitting in a different chair she took a deep breath and continued i i really dontwant to be touched while i telling what happened it would make me it would make me scared just thinking about it i can feel she trailed off abruptly closing her eyes and giving a sharp intake of breath she shuddered visibly making harry want more than anything to stay right there next to her ready to comfort her but he would do whatever she needed him to nah i wouldntmind he answered he began to get up and she gave a soft tug on his sleeve he kissed her on the forehead before he went to a different chair for a moment everyone just sat there everyone eyes were on silver silver were on the floor she hesitantly raised her head to look at dumbledore we ll start from the beginning dumbledore said quietly how were you taken well i was coming back from the bathroom when i remembered that charisma was all alone she began snape rolled his eyes earning himself a glare as she continued and then wait where is charisma she asked suddenly is she all right hagrid is taking very good care of her dumbledore replied please continue silver nodded and continued and then i was walking down the hallway to the dungeons when somebody grabbed me from behind put a silencing charm and a blindfold on me and tied me up i never actually saw them but i think it was bella because whoever it was they punched me just like she used to punched you snape interrupted straightening in his chair his eyes blazing yes she said apologetically and then i blacked out dumbledore nodded and waited for silver to continue but she didn t instead she transferred her gaze to the floor biting her lip once more harry knew that this was where things got bad what happened next dumbledore prompted well when i woke up she said her eyes filling with tears when i woke up i was lying on the floor and v voldemort was there she paused to gather herself and harry felt a surge of anger silver had never been afraid of saying voldemort name before voldemort and and lucius she continued squeezing her eyes shut snape made as if to stand up but held himself back with a visible effort they they were waiting for me to wake up she said her voice breaking so that they so that they could she broke off burying her face in her hands or rather snape cloak which was in her hands both harry and snape vaulted out of their chairs but dumbledore put up his and gave them warning looks they both backed up but neither sat down what did they do silver dumbledore asked gently silver began to cry in response harry leapt forward but dumbledore stopped him not now harry he said instead he motioned snape to step towards her after giving dumbledore a dirty look that purpose harry didntunderstand snape knelt in front of silver silver snape said we need to know what happened silver shook her head n n no she sobbed i dontwant t to talk a about i i it i know silver snape answered patiently but we have to know why she replied because silver we need to know if there a possibility if you could be snape broke off and turned his head away looking extremely embarrassed it took harry a moment to figure out what he was trying to say and then all he could do was look at silver frozen in place and glad that dumbledore had dubbed snape as the one to ask her snape turned to look at dumbledore who gave him an encouraging nod just tell us what happened snape tried silver shook her head and snape stood up looking exasperated i really wish you would just tell me he said silver shook her head again and snape made an odd noise in the back of his throat good merlin silver we need to know if you re pregnant he said finally silver gave a half gasp half sob no she exclaimed fervently snape looked relieved and began to turn back but dumbledore gave him a stern look looking extremely uncomfortable he turned his gaze back to silver who was sufficiently recovering now that she had realized that she didnthave to give them a blow by blow account of what they had done to her after a few seconds she lifted her head from the cloak and looked up at snape as she sniffled up her sobs are you are you sure snape asked oddly red in the face as he avoided eye contact there not even a chance you you do know how to tell dontyou to harry surprise and relief silver smiled you wouldnttell me even if i didn t she answered amusedly snape was very red by this time and he glared at her with a mixture of relief and annoyance harry failed horribly to hide a grin at the thought of snape trying to give anyone the talk what so funny potter snape snarled some of the redness fading from his face nothing harry replied innocently sitting down in his chair and winking at silver silver smiled at him and snape gave him a murderous look as he returned to his seat dumbledore tried not to look too amused so silver dumbledore said dropping his formal title of miss riddle is there anything else you would like to tell us oh silver said softly she turned and looked at snape and he stared back for only a moment before turning to dumbledore and announcing i can tell you everything else you need to know she tired very well dumbledore said agreeably for a moment he and snape stared at each other as if communicating and harry watched interestedly both men turned to look at silver the exact same moment and a look of surprise registered on their faces harry followed their gaze to silver who had curled up on the small couch using snape cloak as a blanket and appeared to be sound asleep i doubt she ll be waking up anytime soon snape said as if he were commenting on the weather shall we move her to dumbledore began no snape interrupted she comfortable here harry knew that what snape really meant by that is that he didntwant her out of his sight and he felt the same way very well dumbledore agreed harry would you please allow the others to come in harry obediently went to the door and opened it as he went he heard dumbledore saying to snape you do realize that you re going to have to get the full story out of her why snape replied as harry opened the door um you can come in now he informed everyone as they turned their eyes to him he strained to hear dumbledore answer not healthy for her to keep it to herself as harry walked back to the armchair he had been sitting in he looked at silver there was no doubt that she was sound asleep although her hair looked a bit tousled it was still shiny and smooth as it fell over her face she had a peaceful expression and one hand was clutching to snape cloak as she lay there people on my to kill list harry thought to himself half sarcastically and half seriously voldemort bellatrix lestrange and now lucius malfoy as everybody seated themselves dumbledore cleared his throat i believe severus that you have something to tell me he inquired voldemort is going to attack harry family today around noon snape answered promptly and he also going to attempt to have the dementors perform the kiss on fudge while he making the rounds of azkaban today dumbledore gaze transferred from silver to harry to snape to the clock harry followed it and everyone in the room did as well it was seven o clock in the morning well that leaves us two hours to save cornelius and about five to save harry family dumbledore commented fawkes would you please send out the alert fawkes whom harry had not even noticed before that moment disappeared in a flash saving fudge isntabsolutely necessary snape ventured casually yes well i daresay you wouldntconsider saving anybody necessary unless it happened to be miss riddle dumbledore answered amusedly i saved potter snape answered defensively twice in fact once when he was getting bucked off his broomstick and then today when he was trying to convince voldemort and a flock of death eaters to attack him i wasnttrying to convince them of anything harry protested well it sure looked like it snape sneered in reply now now dumbledore interrupted as harry opened his mouth to reply with a nasty comment harry and snape glared at each other but the hatred drained from their faces when silver suddenly stirred slightly and they both snapped to attention in order to look at her seems like there one thing you two agree on tonks commented harry eyes rose to meet snape s they stared at each other perfectly emotionlessly for about three seconds i think not they said in unison response to reviews p4l so happy you liked that chapter stay tuned for more was that cheesy or what i couldntresist retrieve the melon well maybe i shouldntapologize but i like updating it not a chore for me tis fun wordwiz8121 naw how could i kill snape when silver loves him so besides he adds humor

this chapter oh wait it a surprise you ll just have to read and find out arenti so mean chapter 46 escape harry watched intently as silver slept he was fascinated by the way her sides moved gently up and down as she breathed how she looked so content and at peace a strand of almond colored hair graced her cheek the rest fell limply behind her he had an incredible urge to get up walk over to her and brush her hair back simply because he loved the feel of it snape tonks lupin ron and hermione all sat silently waiting for dumbledore and professor mcgonagall to return nobody so much as moved for the sake of allowing silver to sleep of course harry doubted if she would awaken unless somebody practically yelled in her ear the sound of a door opening caught his attention but his eyes stayed focused on silver he heard many footsteps coming from the direction of the door and knew that members of the order were filing in he wasntsure if he could bring himself to tear his eyes from her even for a moment he heard hello being said and grudgingly looked up at the feel of a hand on his shoulder harry moody greeted how are you good harry answered not sure if it was the truth or not soon all the members of the order were squeezed into dumbledore rather cramped office all facing his desk expectantly dumbledore explained briefly what had happened leaving out a good deal about silver we will need a team appointed to stop fudge from going to azkaban this morning and explain to him what has happened dumbledore said i ll head it kingsley volunteered dumbledore nodded thank you kingsley he said now i d like two or three more alastor yes arthur yes no no remus you ve done quite enough for now hagrid excellent the four that had been chosen stood up and made their way to the door hagrid patted harry shoulder as he went but couldntseem to find words to convey his feelings at the moment mr weasley ruffled harry hair and muttered atta boy harry please try and make it back within four hours dumbledore said we may need you later on today they all nodded and then left silver suddenly stirred and everybody looked over at her no she murmured i in love with harry harry grinned as he watched her he wondered what she was dreaming about he glanced upwards to see much to his amusement that snape looked completely appalled by silver pronouncement he leaned back in his chair turning his gaze back to silver he knew that there was probably a lot about her past and herself that she hadnttold him but he also knew that she would after all she loved him two hours later found hagrid mr weasley and moody back with them kingsley was in the hospital wing being tended to by madam pomfrey apparently he had somehow taken a nasty blow to the head silver appeared to be sleep deprived and was still sleeping soundly although every now and then she would shift positions she never gave any sign that she was going to awaken everybody in the room fell from quiet mutterings to silence as dumbledore called them to attention harry listened halfheartedly as he explained about the attack that was going to be made on his aunt and uncle he was quite sure that if the dursleys died he wouldntbe anywhere near heartbroken or even sad now dumbledore was saying i would love it if we could keep harry family inside their house where it would be easier to protect them this shouldntrequire too many people however since we dontknow for certain what voldemort plan is or if there is going to be back up i would like to divide you up into units for dumbledore stopped suddenly as everybody heard silver voice lots of back up she murmured sleepily they thought i had already told you what they were going to do so they re prepared she stretched and pulled herself up into a sitting position looking at dumbledore with a kind of hesitant honesty dumbledore looked surprised to see her awake but brushed it off quickly well thank you miss riddle he said finally my mom is going to be there she continued as if she hadntheard him she going to be mad that i ve escaped no doubt dumbledore replied silver turned to him her deep brown eyes wide and sad she wants to hurt you she said softly for helping me as i well aware dumbledore agreed silver gave a soft sigh i wish i wasntthe reason for so much hate she said quietly dumbledore fixed her with a piercing stare my darling if you were to truly look at the way you influenced those around you he said you would see that you are much more a reason for love than you are hate a small smile spread across her face you think she asked i know he replied for a moment the two exchanged a meaningful and reminiscent look harry found himself wondering just how deep their relationship went he knew that dumbledore had rescued her from her household and all that lay within it but he had never other than now heard them exchange conversation that would lead him to believe that silver truly trusted him he knew from the way that she talked to ron and hermione that she trusted them but not wholly when she spoke to himself and snape however there was a type of unguarded honesty that revealed itself showing that she truly did trust and love them dumbledore abruptly turned his gaze back to the other people in the room well it appears as though we very well may have to fight he announced nobody said anything and nobody determined expression faded harry looked at lupin who had regained much of his energy and had a hard look on his face he could die trying to save my stupid aunt and uncle harry realized and dudley ugh as much as harry wanted to protest that saving his family was of no importance he very well knew what dumbledore response would be so for the sake of letting everyone come up with a good plan he kept quiet suddenly everybody was standing up and heading for the door all now sorted into their assigned units lupin gave harry a pat on the shoulder and a reassuring look as he left and silver nearly squeezed snape to death before allowing him to get up from his chair finally only harry ron hermione and silver were left in the office with dumbledore they all exchanged glances and then turned to the expected headmaster please silver said can we go too that would be unsafe dumbledore answered sensibly we ll be really careful silver pleaded and we wontdo anything hasty we just want to be there just in case just in case of what dumbledore asked in case you need to take over a duel silver nodded earnestly miss riddle you are very talented at dueling but you are not ready to take on a fully trained death eater none of you are he said looking at all of them but we cantjust sit here and wait silver protested i think you will find that you are very capable of it dumbledore replied silver frowned and was mirrored by the other three dumbledore stood and gave them all a grave look you four will wait here for me to return he said if you have any physical needs other than exercise that is you may ring that bell on my desk and a house elf will attend to you you will find that i have temporarily disabled my fireplace from the floo network so i would not suggest stepping into it and attempting to follow us i would also appreciate that my personal belongings are left alone with that he left did dumbledore just lock us in his office hermione asked sounding shocked appears that way harry answered we have to go silver said and how are we going to manage that ron asked silver put her arms around her knees looking deep in thought well no floo harry said thoughtfully and we couldntapparate even if we knew how the knight bus wontcome to dumbledore window charisma silver exclaimed suddenly jumping up we could ride charisma the only problem with that being that charisma isnthere ron countered silver smiled and walked to the window it opened easily she closed her eyes and seemed to concentrate very hard hagrid tied her up she announced but she thinks she can break free all four of us are going to ride her hermione asked nervously unless you want to stay behind silver replied harry chuckled no worries hermione it not half bad riding a hippogriff he told her at least we ll be able to see her hermione relented yeah ron agreed looking very relieved why wouldntyou silver asked curiously we rode threstrals last year harry explained ooh silver said they look like fun to ride they re not ron said quickly not at all we ll stick to the ones we can see silver giggled and then stopped abruptly and rushed to the window charisma free she announced get ready to ride harry ron and hermione looked towards the window expectantly when suddenly ron spoke nervousness tracing his voice silver has charisma ever been ridden before he ventured silver face fell slightly well no she said but i sure she d let us you dontthink that hippogriffs are like horses do you harry asked i mean she wonttry and throw you will she i sure she won t silver replied look here she is now sure enough what appeared to be a huge silver bird was growing steadily larger as it neared soon charisma was hovering outside the window as silver greeted her with hugs and kisses harry listened amusedly as silver explained to charisma that they were going to need to ride her when silver turned back to them she was smiling charisma says she doesntmind that we re going to ride her she announced how would she know ron asked she never been ridden silver giggled just come on or we re going to be late she answered before anyone could say anything she had climbed out the window and onto charisma back charisma hovered patiently in the air and looked back at them as if to hurry them along harry shrugged and headed for the window soon all four had climbed on silver was in front followed by harry hermione and finally ron to pivet drive please silver directed charisma needed no further urging to soar first upwards and then sharply to the right how does she know where pivet drive is harry asked curiously after a moment silver replied she says she just knows suddenly she leaned back into his arms upon glancing down he saw that her eyes were blissfully closed he kissed the top of her head and pulled her closer he didntfeel like letting go anytime soon especially not to allow her to go and battle a death eater he suddenly found himself not so sure that they should have broken out of dumbledore office hey he said quietly hmm she replied promise me you wontdo anything dangerous he requested he could feel her smile harry potter telling me not to do anything dangerous she asked in mock surprise well i ll be i serious he insisted i dontwant to lose you she turned to the side so that she was able to face him i ll try harry she said honestly but i cantpromise he frowned why not he asked brushing through her hair with his fingers for the same reason you can t she replied if somebody needs me i going to help them harry i not going to stand there and let them well die harry regarded her for a long moment not sure whether he should be proud that he had such a wonderful girlfriend or angry because she was telling him that she would willingly put herself into danger alright he consented but unless somebody needs us we re going to stay out of sight right he glanced back at ron and hermione as he asked they both nodded he then looked at silver who mirrored them with a too innocent look on her face he almost questioned her on it when charisma suddenly dove downwards causing hermione to grab onto him and nearly cut off his circulation silver on the other hand leaned forwards clutching to charisma neck and closing her eyes to the feel of the wind in her face harry was a bit worried that she would slide off of charisma neck but he didntthink charisma would allow her to so he relaxed until they touched down in a deserted parking lot not far from the park it suddenly occurred to him that the four of them were riding on the back of a half bird half horse in muggle community erm he said as they all slid off d ya think charisma should maybe stay here muggles arentreally used to seeing hippogriffs in fact if you said the word hippogriff around my aunt and uncle they d probably think it was a swear word silver giggled i think she could manage she replied she turned to charisma with a smile stay here unless somebody other than us comes then hide okay she asked charisma made a head motion that was undeniably a nod so where can we watch silver asked uh well from the park i guess but you cantreally see the house from there harry said thoughtfully what about your room harry hermione asked we could sneak into the house harry eyes widened do you know what my uncle would do if he caught us he asked oh come on hermione replied why would he catch us they treat you like you re contaminated i seriously doubt they do regular check ups of your room i suppose harry said doubtfully but if we get caught he stopped and shook his head let go he said resignedly silver suddenly giggled mischievously fred and george told me they gave dudley a ton tongue toffee one time she commented harry grinned in recollection as ron snorted with laughter yeah they did he agreed i dontthink he ever eaten another toffee well it not like he needs one ron exclaimed seriously the kid makes a bear look like a bunny rabbit silver burst into giggles as hermione gave ron a disapproving look you know ron it not nice to tease others about their weight hermione commented sorry ron mumbled come on hermione that was a really good comparison silver insisted through giggles hermione rolled her eyes but the corners of her mouth were slightly upturned as they walked down the street harry suddenly stopped causing silver to crash into him guys he said do you think we re being watched immediately they all looked around excepting silver honestly i dontthink they d be standing where we could see you guys she said sensibly right the other three said in unison is there any other way to get to the house silver asked well we could always go around and climb the backyard wall harry said hesitantly we ll have to do that then silver said decidedly but we d have to go through someone else backyard to do that hermione said well do you guys want to go or not silver demanded with a shrug harry began to lead them towards the street behind the dursleys as harry tried to figure out which one was the one they were supposed to enter the other three stayed silent as they observed the houses they were all pretty much the same whitewashed walls neatly painted trim clean cut lawns and the occasional lawn flag i think it this one he announced finally now how do we get in their backyard well silver replied walking up to the backyard fence i was thinking something like this she backed up took two running steps and jumped as she grabbed on to the top of the fence the next moment she had disappeared on the other side that unfair ron complained i never going to be able to do that silver giggled from the other side then have harry give you a boost and how am i supposed to get over harry demanded oh for heavens sake you two are just going to have to work something out she replied hermione can you get over i think so hermione said uncertainly hermione walked forwards a few steps broke into a run and attempted to imitate silver as she grabbed a hold of the fence and swung over although it was a bit less graceful hermione successfully made it to the other side although it sounded painful ron and harry exchanged glances uh i ll give you a boost i guess harry said doubtfully ron looked equally dubious as the two walked up to the fence harry cupped his hands and ron put his foot in them count of three harry asked thinking that it sounded oddly like an occlumency lesson yup ron agreed five seconds later ron was cursing rather loudly at the fact that his ankle had hooked over the side of the fence causing him to land on his bottom silver and hermione were giggling helplessly harry grabbed onto of the fence and gave a huge jump he managed to hook his leg over the side and eventually pulled the rest of himself over too he couldnthelp but join in the girls laughter as he saw ron ron was clutching his bottom as he hopped around cursing quiet down harry told him in between laughs they re going to realize somebody in their backyard everybody quieted but the girls were shaking with laughter as they walked across the lawn where there was to ron dismay another fence to climb i not getting any bloody boosts ron declared glaring at the fence and sending the girls and harry into fresh waves of laughter i ll show you how i got up harry offered as long as it better than how i got down ron replied boost me harry silver inquired smiling sweetly at him he grinned course he replied instead of cupping his hands he placed them on her waist pressing a kiss first onto her neck as he did so she giggled softly and pushed his head away with her shoulder come on we have to get in she said he straightened disappointedly alright then on three he consented one two three she jumped at the same time he lifted her and he was able to place her so that she was sitting gracefully on the fence she gave him a smile before she hopped down to the other side hermione hopped up much the same as she had before seeing as ron was still clutching his bottom but had given harry a look that clearly said he did not want him boosting hermione harry showed ron how he had jumped up and then waited for ron on the other side the girls began to giggle as ron cursed the whole way over but harry silenced them he definitely didntwant to get caught by the dursleys now slowly they tromped their way across the yard to look up at harry bedroom window there was absolutely no way to get up from where they were standing silver began to giggle harry i thought you said we could get in through the backyard she said well i thought we could he replied uncertainly are you telling me that i just busted my arse open for nothing ron demanded harry grinned sheepishly well it kind of a nice backyard he defended slowly silver and hermione dissolved into giggles harry scratched the back of his neck and looked up at the window hopefully as if he expected it to bend down so that they could climb in at any second after hermione and silver had successfully recovered themselves silver said the only thing that made sense well we ll either have to sneak through the house or go home he turned to look at her and she added quickly and i not going home oh so you re going to sneak into the house without me he asked raising his eyebrows if i have to she replied no hermione said suddenly look here she was standing in the corner of the yard where the house and the white fence came together as harry drew near he realized that there was actually a gate there very well concealed by the paint there was also an inconspicuous crack where the hinge was and through it you could see everything that happened both at the front door and the street let just stay here hermione suggested we ll be well hidden and have a fast way to get into the house or onto the street if anything happens okay silver consented taking a seat on the grass beside her harry felt a surge of relief now that he wasntfacing the prospect of sneaking through the dursleys house i need a couch though ron complained oh shut it ron hermione commanded ron looked taken aback fine he muttered gingerly taking a seat away from hermione who tutted and rolled her eyes suddenly silver shushed them all and pointed out the crack look she whispered they all crowded around and peered out just a few feet away from them in the street stood mr weasley lupin moody and tonks they all conferred for a moment pointing to various bushes before performing disillusionment charms on each other and going to hide in the places they had just pointed out they re crazy harry whispered they just did magic in the middle of the street well nobody seemed to notice hermione said unhelpfully what time is it ron asked harry pulled the watch silver had given him for his birthday out of his pocket he gazed at the engraved name for a moment before opening it eleven forty seven he announced they all watched through the crack for a while before a woman suddenly walked by silver gave a slightly loud gasp and clapped her hand to her mouth what is harry began in a whisper but he stopped the woman walking past them was strangely familiar slightly curly reddish brown hair fell down over her shoulders and harry felt that he had seen this woman frame before shadowy frame suddenly he realized who she was his head shot towards silver at lightening speed she was as white as a sheet and shaking uncontrollably her eyes were wide and scared he instinctively reached out and pulled her into his arms she buried her face into his chest but didnthave a chance to say anything where are you going moody voice suddenly growled he stepped out of a bush fully visible once more silver mother stopped looking completely unsurprised a slight smirk was visible on her face harry noted that she had light blue eyes eyes that looked cold and hard not silver eyes by a long shot behind her mr weasley lupin and tonks all quietly stepped out of their hiding places now visible as well is that really any of your business she replied harry felt a shiver go down his spine the voice that was speaking was the same one that he had heard torture silver in her memories he pulled silver completely into his lap as she shook feeling a surge of protectiveness she willingly came to him and although she didntmake a sound he felt his shirt dampen i believe so moody replied evenly silver mother gave a derisive laugh get out of my way alastor she ordered you ve lost your touch if you think i going to listen to you he told her be prepared to pay the consequences of standing in my way she said her voice icy and hard moody chuckled harry strained to see through the crack and by now he could see that they all had their wands drawn out he was struck with the realization that a magical battle was about to ensue on pivet drive quiet blended in pivet drive hermione glanced back at them and did a double take what is it she mouthed to harry mother harry mouthed back grimly hermione eyes widened and she looked from silver to the lady through the crack she nudged ron pointed out the crack and mouthed the words silver mom ron eyes nearly popped out of their sockets as he glanced first at silver and then out the crack at her mother you laugh now alastor but you wontbe laughing when i kill you she said moody face hardened i d like to see you try he snarled dontlay a wand on her another voice said suddenly it didntbelong to mr weasley lupin or tonks silver mother whirled around her bright blue eyes sparkling with surprise she mine snape finished as he stepped into view go snape ron whispered silver dislodged herself from harry and wiped her eyes as she peered out the crack she gave a soft groan and a determined glint came into her eyes he is such a stubborn idiot she whispered furiously what does he think he doing i ve heard about your heroic little act severus silver mother said coolly but i never thought you would stoop to this level spare me the theatrics snape retorted dryly silver mother didntreply instead she surveyed him for a long moment as if sizing him up why d you do it she asked finally snape simply stared at her why did you save the boy she asked of what importance is he to you snape snorted none whatsoever he replied honestly then why she demanded i watched you suffer for him i saw severus why endure that torture for so long if he means nothing to you snape paused only a moment before answering i am not the only person in the world he answered her eyes widened so you did it for someone else she asked who who would severus snape care for enough to endure such torture torture silver echoed in a whisper realization dawned in her eyes as she realized that snape downtrodden physical state had been the effects of the cruciatus curse why dontyou shut your mouth and get down to business snape suggested in reply dontwant to tell me hmm she asked amusedly snape struck suddenly and in harry opinion unexpectedly stupefy he hissed brandishing his wand at her protego she cried at the same moment and within the same breath crucio snape jumped out of the way but only by inches do you really think you can get me with such petty spells silver mother inquired curiously what is it with this god forsaken family and dueling snape roared angrily silver mother laughed and a different voice answered snape it a natural talent harry nearly threw himself at the crack bellatrix lestrange had popped seemingly out of nowhere and was now smirking as moody stepped forward to duel with her really alabastor lestrange said twirling her wand about do you believe that you ll be able to defeat me my own cousin a black in his own right couldntdo so and you moody are no black you donthave to be a black to duel moody snarled lestrange laughed you think that old man she replied suddenly two death eaters appeared harry recognized them as lucius and narcissa malfoy without thought he lunged for the latch on the gate but ron and hermione held him back harry ron grunted stop just stop harry grudgingly stopped glaring through the crack at lucius as he did so hexes and curses were being thrown everywhere and amazingly not one muggle had given any signs of having seen harry eyes were locked on lupin and lucius who had yet to begin their duel but were still in the process of throwing insults but a gasp from silver made him look to snape and her mother the wound on snape shoulder was freshly opened and blood poured freely but he looked triumphant nevertheless silver mother lay motionless on the ground is she harry asked uncertainly stunned silver supplied just stunned right harry said he watched as snape eyes rose and suddenly locked on lucius an intense hatred filled them and spread from there through snape entire body so much so that he shook with rage lucius he snarled the two men made eye contact and everyone else stopped what they were doing to watch harry doubted if he had ever seen snape so angry and full of hate a glance at silver showed her to be tense and anxious her hand in fists and her knuckles white nice to see you severus lucius commented filthy disgusting slimy bastard snape accused if looks could kill lucius malfoy would be far worse than dead harry thought as he looked at snape lucius eyes filled with first confusion and then understanding he chuckled but it was cold and unnerving i never knew you were so fond of flowers he commented silver began to shake once more but harry knew better than to try and tear her away from the crack which she was now glued against snape gave a low growl shaking with fury i had a feeling you were a traitor lucius commented observing snape distastefully you never did use the cruciatus unless commanded to or was that because of your father lucius gave a laugh and snape remained unwavering wand at the ready upon closer inspection harry could see that snape looked to be fighting an inner battle lucius seemed disappointed that snape hadntreached the breaking point yet and so he continued in a low cold voice i make flowers wilt snape he hissed snape just about exploded with anger crucio he roared at the top of his lungs beside him silver gave a gasp lucius was only under the curse for a second before he screamed instantly snape lifted the curse looking at his wand as if it had betrayed him once lucius had recovered enough he chuckled you canttake it he accused you re weak insufferably so your father wasn t though was he he didntstop when you screamed did he resentment was fast flooding snape eyes crucio lucius hissed snape didntattempt to escape instead he let the curse hit him the pain he was feeling reflected in his eyes and the tight lines on his face but he didntcry out after a few seconds during which harry was sure silver was going to bite her lower lip off snape body seemed to break his knees buckled and it seemed to take all of his willpower to keep from screaming as he fought to stay up silver suddenly gave a sob harry pulled her away from the gate and turned her into him he looked through the crack and suddenly hermione pointed towards silver mom he inwardly groaned as he saw lestrange reviving her he pulled silver close as if to shield her from all that was happening as she sobbed silver mother got up anger blazing in her eyes and she smiled as she looked at snape want some help lucius she inquired lucius smiled be my guest he replied in an instant silver had torn away from harry no she cried harry clapped a hand over her mouth and yanked her back down silver he hissed she gave a muffled yelp against his hand and fought to get away but she was no match for him nobody outside of the gate appeared to hear except for snape his head shot towards the gate disbelief in his eyes lucius followed snape gaze curiously and immediately everyone backed away from the fence what in there lucius growled lifting the curse nothing snape grunted in reply fighting to keep standing dontlie to me snape he said what in there harry ron and hermione exchanged glances it seemed that lucius voice was getting closer harry looked desperately around for a hiding place aunt petunia rosebushes would do them no good and neither would her tomato plants suddenly the fence seemed to explode towards harry one of the boards gave him a good blow to the head that sent him reeling backwards and the next thing he knew silver was no longer in his arms although he was dizzy he sat back up immediately he saw ron and hermione but not silver a look through the broken fence showed her to be in the possession of a triumphant lucius malfoy he hermione and ron abandoned all pretense of hiding and dashed out onto the sidewalk well well well lucius said completely ignoring them look what we have here silver had tears in her eyes and was looking at snape pleadingly you re here snape commented i sorry silver said tearfully i really really sorry she made as if to run to him but was yanked back forcefully by lucius snape looked up at lucius who was wearing a smile on his face let her go he said his voice every bit as threatening as it ever had been lucius ran a finger from her shoulder down to her hip in mock thoughtfulness causing her to shudder i not so sure he said tauntingly i am rather fond of her just let her go snape replied let me go silver echoed struggling against him lucius gave her a clean blow to the head and yanked her arms back causing a whimper to escape her donttell me what do to he hissed and donttry any funny stuff he then turned to snape with a smile on his face what do you want snape asked you my friend lucius replied the dark lord is offering a rather large reward for you at the moment fine snape said without hesitation let her go and you can take me no silver cried don t please lucius twisted her arm causing her to fall into silence and looked at snape disbelievingly hand over you wand he ordered snape willingly held out his wand and silver began to sob take it back she cried dontgive it to him as lucius reached for it snape withdrew it causing lucius to frown what am i to do then child snape demanded looking at silver i dontcare just dontdie silver replied through tears how positively touching silver mother said in mock delightfulness my widdle daughter has found herself a daddy or are you her husband lucius mentioned she was quite delightful when she she paused a moment as she found three wands at her throat i wouldntadvise finishing that sentence lupin said his face hard maybe lucius said thoughtfully i could just torture her yes torture seems the ticket until she loses her mind imagine severus watching her go through that agony for hours on end and then finally she free and guess what she has no idea who you are she doesnthave any feelings for you if you die she wontcare i guess that would bring a total of people who care for you to zero wouldntit snape stared hard at silver who was crying hard by this time what do you want with her he asked finally his voice breaking just let the child go she hasntdone anything hasntdone anything silver mother repeated incredulously dodging the wands pointed at her with ease that almost scared harry the girl a brat a traitor she gave away the dark lord plans and no she didn t snape said his voice rising she kept the secret goddammit lucius lestrange and silver mother all turned their eyes to silver who was sobbing even harder at this revelation you lie lestrange said flatly you know i speak the truth snape answered suddenly while everyone eyes were averted snape caught harry eye at first harry thought snape was merely noting he was there but then he noticed the subtle movements he was making with his hands he was pointing at lucius and harry realized that he hermione and ron all had a free shot at his back i ll crucio him til kingdom come harry thought snape shook his head a bit less subtly than he had been and harry knew that his emotions must have been showing or i could knock him out he decided with a bit less relish he nudged ron and hermione and whispered instructions to them nobody noticed as they all levitated a rather large boulder across the street until it was hovering atop lucius head lucius lestrange screamed suddenly they let it drop and as lucius looked up he was rewarded with what looked to be a very hard blow to the face almost the same as knocking out the ogre harry thought amusedly to himself as he remembered his first year lucius grip on silver diminished and she ran towards snape but he pushed her away go child he said exasperatedly obediently silver turned and ran harry caught her with one arm as they ran for some nearby bushes in a matter of minutes lestrange narcissa and silver mother were all stunned the foursome immediately leapt up and towards the other members of the order all whom looked at them extremely disapprovingly silver tentatively walked up to snape whom harry realized must be extremely sore from the cruciatus for a moment snape regarded her the same way he had the others but then rather suddenly he reached out and pulled her to him not giving any sign of hurt as he did so i really sorry silver murmured it over now he answered but i dontwant you to do anything of that sort ever again alright she whispered do you forgive me snape looked a bit annoyed of course child he said she tightened her arms around him and he cringed immediately she jumped a foot away from him her eyes wide oh i so sorry she said i didntmean to hurt you do you ever stop apologizing he replied sounding halfway amused for a moment she looked as if she were about to apologize but then she thought the better of it and didntsay anything at all harry was about to speak when a large crack filled the air five ministry officials had apparated around them well what have we here one of them inquired four death eaters three stunned and one unconscious snape replied all five of them began to take notes names another one asked lucius and narcissa malfoy bellatrix lestrange and alexandra meliflua snape replied meliflua harry thought to himself it sounds familiar but i cantplace it where have i heard that before a glance at ron and hermione showed that they had definitely never heard the name before but harry was sure he had he frowned in concentration but couldntplace it no matter how hard he tried your names yet another asked snape looked around as he began to recite names severus snape arthur weasley remus lupin nymphadora tonks alastor moody he paused as his eyes landed on harry harry potter ronald weasley hermione granger and silver he trailed off uncertainly as his eyes landed on silver the officials looked up questioningly silver flushed meliflua she admitted shamefully no snape countered immediately just silver surname unknown with raised eyebrows the officials made a line through the word meliflua and wrote what snape had said all in unison it was the slightest bit unnerving we ll contact you for further details later one of them said by that time harry had lost track of who had already spoken and who hadn t but he had a suspicion it was a different one altogether four of the men took handcuffs out of their pockets pressed a button on them and then let them go the handcuffs floated to the unconscious death eaters fastened themselves around their wrists and yanked them into an upright position at the same time a green light flashed on the handcuffs and both the death eaters and the four officials that had set loose the handcuffs disappeared the last one took out a small black rectangle pointed it at the street and pressed a switch on the side into the off position a small wave seemed to pass over the street and then the official disapparated come on lupin said suddenly the muggles can see us now they couldntbefore harry questioned they were all under a spell to keep them sleeping and inside of their houses up until now tonks replied now come on we have to get back we have to go get charisma first silver said hesitantly she how we got here you rode a hippogriff here lupin asked in astonishment well yes dumbledore locked us in his office and there was no other way to get out silver said as if it made perfect sense snape merely shook his head and sighed as silver began to lead them towards the deserted lot harry desperately hoped that charisma hadntbeen discovered he had a feeling dumbledore would be displeased enough with them as it was note yay we all know who silver mommy is and if you re confused on where the name meliflua comes from you ll learn more about it next chapter i promise that it was jkr who made it up and not me though oh and i just couldntbring myself to do the response to reviews it takes too long besides i knew you guys all wanted the new chappie disclaimer i do not own or claim to own any of j k rowlings people places items ect chapter 5 an outing to remember the next morning harry woke up early as he was used to by then and ambled down to the kitchen after he got dressed mrs weasley was the only person there and she was busy making waffles i think something going on with silver upstairs she told him harry dashed back up the stairs and listened intently he heard voices coming from down the hall but no certainly not from sirius room he walked down the hallway and paused outside the closed door of sirius room yes there were definitely voices in there and it wasntlupin harry pushed open the door ready to raise heck for somebody else being in there but the sight shocked him snape dumbledore and lupin were all looking down at sirius bed on which lay a soundly sleeping silver they all looked up at him when he walked in what going on harry asked uncertainly where granger snape hissed venomously i dontknow why harry answered well lupin replied we all went into the living room this morning to find silver sleeping on the couch when we picked her up to take her to her bed she just kept saying donttake me back hermione do you know anything about this harry no said harry quietly he wondered what hermione had done i do said a voice from behind him it was ginny all eyes turned to her as she replied well hermione had set down her book on silver bed and so silver went and gave it to her and hermione totally went off she started yelling about how silver had stolen her book and her best friends and silver burst into tears and left i didntrealize that she never came back though ginny glanced down at silver who began to stir snape looked as if he would personally slay hermione severus dumbledore said in a warning tone you will do nothing snape whirled around in a temper why not he demanded because it is not your place dumbledore replied sharply snape still looked as if he would murder hermione the first chance he got harry dumbledore said the menace gone from his voice i think silver here would appreciate it if she were allowed to use this bedroom for the remainder of her stay but if you object we will surely find elsewhere i dontmind harry replied as long as everything stays how it is dumbledore smiled in reply miss weasley he said would you and mr potter kindly bring silver things to this room without waking miss granger ginny nodded and harry followed her out of the room why doesntdumbledore ever use silver last name he asked what is her last name he added i dontthink she has one ginny replied she doesntknow who her father is after all and she probably doesntwant to use her mother last name oh harry replied stupidly when they brought silver trunks back with them she was stirring once more as the three adults conferred beside her bed her eyes fluttered open and she squinted in protest to the lamplight coming from the stand beside sirius bed where am i she asked as she fumbled for the switch on the lamp you are in your new bedroom dumbledore replied brightly as they were all plunged into darkness i cantsee ginny said faintly silver turned the lamp to a lower setting as she sat up this is sirius old bedroom lupin explained to her and it yours as long as you dontremodel silver looked around the room wow harry she said softly harry blushed as he realized that all of his pictures were gaping lovestruck at her snape had a coughing fit as everyone eyes landed on the picture of harry on his broomstick he was hanging upside down off his broom and waving stupidly looking as though someone had just stunned him silver gave snape a reproachful look and he put on a suspiciously straight face then her eyes landed on the picture of sirius lupin and harry father and mother she reached out for it and when her fingertips touched it she withdrew slightly but then she picked it up and gazed at it awestruck for a moment she looked up at harry and then back down at the picture wow harry she said again harry blushed once more and walked up behind her to look at the picture his father was extending his hand with mock formality and his mother was beaming and waving at her sirius spotted harry and gave him exaggerated winks along with head motions towards silver and lupin was smiling and nodding harry blushed as sirius pointed to silver and nodded his head frantically at harry winking the entire time silver giggled as his father followed suit but his mother elbowed him and he stopped and simply beamed at harry harry grinned at silver who was looking at him with a slight blush that one my favorite he said smiling fondly at the picture i kinda like the one of you on your broomstick she teased at this harry felt his face go a wonderful shade of red he glanced at her and felt their eyes lock something they often seemed to do silver didntblock him out so much this time and he readily opened himself up for her he caught a flicker of trust in her otherwise uncertain eyes as she gazed at him well let go now so silver can get ready for breakfast lupin suggested after a while harry reluctantly looked away from her and trudged toward the door he had a crazy desire to say something stupid like see you downstairs but lupin pushed him firmly out the door snape pushed past them and went downstairs looking at harry with extreme dislike as he passed watch it around snape harry lupin muttered what do you mean harry asked well you two cantjust goggle at each other in front of him lupin said exasperatedly in case you haventnoticed he just a tad bit protective of her at each other harry repeated excitedly she was goggling at me too lupin rolled his eyes but smiled come on he said changing the subject molly making waffles harry followed him with a grin that he couldntwipe after sitting and receiving many loathing looks from snape but still grinning ron and hermione came down harry wondered why they always seemed to arrive together soon everyone was downstairs but silver what taking her so long harry asked echoing what snape had been muttering since mrs weasley served him i dontknow mrs weasley said i ll go check snape looked as if he would much rather go check himself but he didntprotest mrs weasley returned with a smile on her face she very excited about going into town today she informed them did you know the only place she ever been other than that dratted house of hers is knockturn alley murmurs spread around the table harry had been to knockturn alley once and he didntfeel any desire to go back it was an alley devoted completely to the dark arts and the wizards and witches that shopped there didntlook pleasant at all so why isntshe coming downstairs snape asked she getting ready mrs weasley replied cryptically snape didntlook satisfied at her answer and he muttered to himself as he took another bite of his waffle a few minutes later dumbledore looked up and said approvingly ah silver may i say you look positively radiant today harry turned to look at a blushing but beautiful silver she had curled her hair into largish ringlets and put a sparkly pink hairpin on one side she wore a pink spaghetti strap shirt which harry rather liked for no particular reason and white pants tied around her hips was a pink polka dotted white scarf and a tiny silver locket hung around her neck thank you she replied to dumbledore as she scanned the table for a seat harry felt extremely lucky that the only empty seats were the ones across and next to him smiling at him she took a seat across from him and next to ginny harry gaped openly how could she be more beautiful trying to catch flies with your mouth potter snape sneered from down the table harry glared at him and snape smirked back at him with a reproving look in snape direction silver announced i think harry looks very nice today harry blushed furiously and attempted to mumble a thank you she simply beamed at him snape looked scandalized after breakfast there was a general scramble for jackets shoes and lost letters finally everyone was standing by the door except for silver almost ready lupin called up almost came the reply harry grinned as she came running down the stairs holding two jackets in her hand one was plain white with a hood and the other was see through and matched the scarf around her waist which one she asked smiling at them for a moment nobody answered the solid one harry suggested she tossed the polka dotted one aside and slipped on the solid one with a knee weakening smile directed at harry snape glared at harry as they walked outside but harry didntcare silver walked next to him as they all gathered at the curb lupin pulled out his wand and raised it in the air and a few seconds later they were all boarding the knight bus slippery looking seats ran along the interior of the first floor and seeing as it was empty this was where they all sat ey ern it neville stan cried pointing at harry silver giggled neville she asked from beside him long story he replied she giggled again stan looked at her with interest what yer name he asked in what he thought was a winning tone swaggering over to her and winking a bit too obviously to harry delight silver scooted closer to him and took his arm looking at stan with a mixture of disgust and fright harry glared at stan and successfully succeeded in getting him to walk off not too friendly are yer silver didntlet go of harry arm and harry had a stupid grin on his face as the bus started it took off with its signature jolt causing fred and george to topple out of their seats and moody to dig his wooden leg hard into the ground so that he wouldntlose his balance another more appreciative effect was the one it had on silver she scooted closer to harry although whether she scooted of her own accord or not was a mystery and put her other hand on his arm is it supposed to do that she asked worriedly yeah harry replied casually that the worst part though except maybe for the turns as he finished his statement the bus turned down a side street more sharply than usual tonks landed in a very embarrassed lupin lap and silver to harry disappointment only almost made it into his snape nearly went flying off the edge of the seat but managed to catch himself in time shooting an evil look at harry who was grinning as silver clutched his arm this is horrible silver groaned harry couldnthelp but laugh it not funny she insisted but she laughed too suddenly the bus jerked to a stop harry who knew the after effects of this stayed seated effectively but silver would ve flown forward and out of her seat if he hadntcaught her once he did she scooted back into his arms leaving one arm around her waist as she did so harry was so happy he was dizzy although it may have been the effect the bus was having on him snape on the other hand looked as if he were going to chuck harry out the window the first chance he got when they finally arrived at the leaky cauldron harry was very disappointed to relinquish his hold on her but did so out of fear of snape lupin was grinning slyly at harry as they stepped off the bus and moody patted him on the back forcefully saying that my boy in a rather loud voice dumbledore turned to them all we shall have to split up or it will look a bit suspicious he informed them molly and arthur you shall take your children and miss granger with you he directed mr and mrs weasley nodded and began to gather up their children severus and minerva you will each travel individually and pick up the items i have asked of you as well as those you need snape looked from silver to harry to dumbledore as if to protest but dumbledore continued talking immediately tonks moody you will travel together and keep an eye on everybody severus you will not speak while i am speaking tonks and moody nodded and snape looked abashed harry tried to keep a straight face remus you will accompany harry silver and i to various stores of their choice harry was surprised it was a privilege to travel with dumbledore throughout diagon alley he was also elated that he and silver were together everyone whom i failed to mention you are free to do whatever you wish and i request that you keep an eye on the other members as you do so everybody please meet up here at five o clock sharp with that everyone assorted and began to pass through the leaky cauldron dumbledore lupin harry and silver stayed until last silver was bouncing on her tiptoes in excitement she practically dragged them through the leaky cauldron not even giving dumbledore a chance to say hello to anyone and once they entered diagon alley she was awestruck to gringotts then dumbledore said silver i will not permit you to take any money out of your family account because your mother may be able to track you then silver face fell but i donthave any money now she said well severus has kindly offered you unlimited use of his vault however i have decided that you will extract a certain amount from both mine and severus vault silver still looked downcast but she protested no silver dumbledore replied his voice gentle but firm harry wondered what dumbledore vault looked like they walked into gringotts and silver although still stubbornly wanting to use her own vault was amazed harry she exclaimed taking a hold of his arm look at those emeralds harry turned to see some goblins weighing a huge pile of emeralds on a scale they re nice he commented nice she echoed harry they re gorgeous i suppose you would be used to them though they re the exact same color as your eyes harry blushed profusely had she just called his eyes gorgeous lupin and dumbledore were smiling mysteriously as they got into their cart silver and harry scrambled in after them and silver situated herself between lupin and harry first stop the potter vault the goblin announced their cart took off although to harry disappointment silver didntseem quite as scared as she had on the knight bus the cart stopped in front of harry vault and he clambered out to fill his bag he felt a bit self conscious aware that everyone was watching him as he quickly scooped piles of money into his bag when he got back in the cart dumbledore was staring at him interestedly but said nothing next stop vault six hundred and twenty three lupin the goblin announced harry had no recollection of goblins ever using names to identify vaults before but said nothing they traveled only a bit further until they reached lupin vault harry hesitantly glanced behind him to see lupin carefully selecting only a few gold galleons from a medium sized pile and then halfway filling up his bag with silver sickles and bronze knuts next stop snape the goblin said boredly as they plunged into darkness once more after lupin climbed in silver dumbledore said as they stopped you are the one who had permission to extract the money not i so you must go and extract exactly fifty each of galleons sickles and knuts silver eyes widened but that much too much she protested silver dumbledore said in a no nonsense tone silver hesitantly walked up to the door to snape vault and the goblin unlocked it with a swish of his finger harry gaped it was a treasure trove emeralds rubies and precious gems of all kinds lined the walls of snape vault silver carefully collected some money and turned to go back silver dumbledore sighed since when is twenty galleons equal to fifty silver frowned and collected the rest of the galleons she climbed back in still scowling harry thought she looked cute anyways dumbledore the goblin said as the cart took off even further downwards i really dontneed any more money silver told dumbledore harry had to agree with her he was certain he hadnteven taken that much money from his own vault well you ll be getting some anyhow dumbledore replied it ll be too heavy she protested dumbledore raised his eyebrows at her i ll carry it for you and give it to you when we get home you need some money to spend at hogwarts especially if you plan on going to hogsmeade oh silver said quietly then she looked up but i not going to hogsmeade sir my parents didntsign the slip fudge has agreed that between severus and i we can override that dumbledore replied smiling at her silver smiled slightly in return but looked lost in thought about something harry realized that they had been in the cart a relatively long time compared to the time it took them to get to the other vaults just as he was about to say something the cart stopped dumbledore rose and got out harry twisted in his seat with curiosity if snape vault had been so great dumbledore must be much better the goblin stroked the door with his finger but it didntstay away dumbledore nodded to the goblin and stepped through it harry sank into his seat with disappointment lupin chuckled you didntwant to see dumbledore vault now did you harry lupin teased harry found himself grinning despite his disappointment not really he replied sarcastically soon enough dumbledore stepped back out and bowed formally to the goblin thank you he said in a deep voice the goblin looked surprised but bowed back and replied your welcome silver nearly ran through the lobby to get outside ooh what first she asked robes dumbledore said decidedly i need some new robes myself and we re right here as it is the four walked into madam malkin robes for all occasions and watched silver be measured the measuring tape did its job quickly and then proceeded to winding itself around her waist and squeezing madam malkin quickly unwound it and apologized now what color would you like your dress robes to be she asked giving silver a color chart silver looked down interestedly harry walked up behind her and peered over her shoulder along with lupin and dumbledore how about silver harry suggested with a note of teasing in his voice silver giggled and searched for the silver patch ooh it is pretty she said yes i think i ll take silver they then helped dumbledore pick out some new purple robes and left well what else is on your list dumbledore asked silver wasntpaying attention however she was staring at the magical menagerie as if in a trance an owl she whispered can i get an owl certainly dumbledore replied to the magical menagerie they re all so lonely silver said as they neared harry remembered that she had the ability to talk with animals where hedwig he wondered aloud when she came to the school for your letter i informed her that she wasntneeded dumbledore replied she was most offended and flew off to the owlry i dare say she ll be back as soon as she gets over it harry grinned at the thought of his owl and her ego where silver lupin asked suddenly they had entered the magical menagerie and she had disappeared they exchanged worried glances and split up to find her harry spotted her at the end of the last aisle crouching down by a black screech owl found her he called lupin and dumbledore appeared almost immediately and the three of them drew closer to watch her converse with the owl poor baby she said softly reaching her finger in to pet it head the owl hooted quietly and closed it eyes at her touch i want this one she said decidedly are you sure lupin asked you haven t seen them all yet i heard this one voice from the moment i stepped in the store she replied i think it a sign alright then lupin replied i ll go get the shop owner harry crouched down beside her what it name he asked looking down at the peaceful owl he doesnthave one yet she replied he was taken from his mother just after he was born and brought here he not fully grown yet but he got his adult feathers and i think he ready to carry letters and the like harry surveyed the owl carefully it was a bit on the small side but it definitely looked mature enough to carry letters back and forth it opened it eyes and peered up at him it had big golden eyes arenthis eyes beautiful she sighed sure harry agreed the owl looked up at silver and hooted of course silver replied harry wondered how the owl could have asked a question in just one hoot but didntsay anything the shop owner and lupin appeared beside them ah you ve taken an interest in this little guy the lady said grinning he quite young but definitely suitable to carry mail he can be a bit violent though i just warning you the owl hooted indignantly and silver looked up at the shopkeeper a bit reproachfully he says he only violent because you handle him so harshly she informed the lady baby owls are very delicate and should be treated with gentleness surprise registered in the lady eyes one owl is the same as the next she replied sharply would you like the cage he in right now harry thought the cage he was in was a bit small even for a young owl and was glad when silver replied no thank you i d like that one over there she pointed to a shiny metal cage that looked both bigger and more comfortable than the one the owl was in at the moment but we re still shopping right now so could you please hold it for me and i ll come back and get it later the owner looked at silver like she was asking rather a lot but agreed as long as silver paid then as they left the shop lupin commented seven galleons was a lot to ask for that little thing the owl glared at him haughtily from silver shoulder and silver laughed he still growing she said defensively the owl rubbed up against her cheek in agreement i think i going to name him esperanza she announced the owl hooted in excitement lupin snorted dontyou think that a little erm girly he asked harry couldnthelp but agree with him and dumbledore had a sly smile on his face as well silver frowned no it not she argued its exotic right harry harry quickly hid his smile yup exotic my point exactly he agreed lupin smirked at him and dumbledore mouth twitched suspiciously do you like it she asked the owl it hooted its approval right then esperanza she said the rest of their shopping passed uneventfully except for the event of getting silver a wand but i already have a wand well okay so it been in my family for three generations maybe i should get a new one they had to wait for forty five minutes until a very excited mr ollivander presented her with a fourteen inch unicorn hair and phoenix feather wand yes very unusual combination indeed he chatted excitedly as they paid i starved lupin announced after he finished teasing silver about being too stubborn for any wand to agree with her me too silver echoed i surprised you two have agreed dumbledore replied esperanza hooted impatiently and nipped at silver ear for the third time in a row making her wince ouch that sensitive she exclaimed to the owl i think he a bit hungry harry remarked innocently she scowled at him as she rubbed her ear and harry and lupin dissolved into laughter dumbledore gave a quiet chuckle well now here our stop then he announced harry was too hungry to even see where they were they went inside and feasted on chicken and mashed potatoes esperanza ate the tiny pieces silver broke off for him and had a go at some mashed potatoes but ended up getting it more on his face than in his mouth as harry lupin and dumbledore laughed openly silver wiped the owl face telling him firmly just ignore them finally at half past four they were done oh silver said suddenly we forgot esperanza cage esperanza lupin muttered under his breath what a mouthful harry smothered back a laugh as silver and esperanza shot them a dirty look after getting esperanza cage although silver refused to put him in it they arrived outside the leaky cauldron at a quarter til snape and professor mcgonagall were already there isnthe adorable silver gushed to snape as he eyed her new owl with dislike completely snape replied in a non convincing voice silver either didntnotice or didntmind however as she proceeded to show him her new wand core snape asked as he fingered it phoenix feather and unicorn hair she replied proudly snape and professor mcgonagall both raised an eyebrow that a bit uncommon snape commented looking at the wand with new suspicion yes it is lupin agreed which might be why it took us forty five minutes to find snape smirked but said nothing as he handed silver her wand back harry got the feeling that thinking of lupin bored out of his mind gave snape satisfaction not that it had been completely boring to see silver accidentally blow things up whenever he put any wand containing dragon heartstrings in her hand however at five o clock none of the others had shown up yet however at a quarter past the weasleys and hermione arrived breathless complaining about long lines at the book store a few minutes after that the rest showed up voicing the same complaints dumbledore graciously forgave them for their tardiness and raised his wand the knight bus appeared in a flash harry was very put out to have silver sit in between himself and snape but when the bus took off silver latched securely to his arm he was sure she wouldnthave minded if he put his arm around her but he didntdare chance it with snape there that night after everybody finished showing off what they had gotten and hermione had successfully read and re read her new transfiguration book they tiredly trudged up the stairs harry ron and silver said good night to ginny and hermione and continued down the hallway silver stopped outside the door to their room which made both of them stop as well ron however looked from silver to harry and retreated inside swinging the door almost shut behind himself esperanza fluttered off of silver shoulder to the railing and stared downstairs intently silver looked at harry a bit shyly but also with warmth she seemed to be waiting for him to say something i had a really good time with you today he offered she beamed at him me too she said for a moment harry debated kissing her but he decided against it in the end because he realized upon looking into her eyes that she trusted him a good deal more than she had previously and he didntwant to do anything to jeopardize that good night he said night harry she replied sweetly he walked into his room still picturing the smile she had given him and the way she had said his name he had a feeling he wouldntforget a single detail of the day he had just been through for a long while disclaimer i do not own or claim to own any of j k rowlings things peace out chapter 7 the perfect surname the weeks of august flew by uneventfully lupin was gone during the full moon but he came back unharmed and after resting a day seemed revitalized harry hadntkissed silver again but that was mostly because they had never been alone since the night of his birthday snape hovered around her like an overly protective parent and glared at harry whenever he had the nerve to so much as brush against her there were moments however when harry felt the inexplicable desire to pull her into his arms whenever he was particularly nice or if she just felt like it she would give him a special smile that she never gave anybody else once in a while esperanza would come and snuggle up to him and harry was sure that he was doing it for silver although she never said anything he had begun to miss hogwarts terribly however and once in a while became exceptionally frustrated at the fact that snape was virtually silver shadow at least he wontbe able to bother us in the gryffindor common room harry thought if she is a gryffindor if not i ll just kiss her during class needless to say harry was very happy on august 31st while everyone was making preparations for the next day he packed with vigor and even cleaned hedwig cage just for the heck of it hedwig was very appreciative and hovered around him as he packed looks like you ve got your own snape ron teased dontsay that name harry grumbled ron laughed a bit frustrated mate he always by her harry complained when does he go to the bathroom ron laughed even harder as they continued to pack oy come on harry it nearly seven ron exclaimed so what harry replied as he continued to pack dumbledore wanted everybody to be at that meeting at seven o clock remember oh harry said as he remembered dumbledore giving the announcement at breakfast while he had been inching closer to silver at the breakfast table only to be stopped by snape who hovered over her chair and began to make a great deal of fuss over her toast insisting it didnthave enough butter he and ron ran down the stairs and arrived in time to see that they werentthe only ones who had forgotten about the meeting ron sat down next to hermione and harry next to him then amazingly silver walked through the door unescorted even dumbledore looked surprised she beamed at harry and sat down next to him on the last remaining spot on the couch harry was absolutely elated hey he greeted warmly as she sat down next to him she put her head on his shoulder in response he grinned uncontrollably shook him off he asked oh harry dontbe terrible she chided halfheartedly he only doing what he thinks is right yeah yeah harry grumbled but he wasntreally angry in fact he was still grinning ear to ear he glanced down at her hand which lay in her lap it was practically screaming to be held he inched his hand over and put it over hers she beamed up at him and turned her hand over interlacing her fingers with his ron was watching interestedly and hermione promptly smacked him on the shoulder and muttered something about minding his own business soon everyone was present except for snape dumbledore noted his absence and the room sat in complete silence suddenly snape swept in his eyes locked on silver and then traveled down her arm and up harry to his face his hand flew to his robes as if he were going to curse harry on the spot severus dumbledore said cheerfully please have a seat snape sat grudgingly on the only remaining chair which was much too far away from harry and silver to his liking for once it was harry who smirked at snape now i am calling this meeting for a number of reasons dumbledore said the first being safety for the students while at hogwarts students they all looked up at him to show that they were giving him their full attention dumbledore eyes flickered over each of their faces and briefly on harry and silver interlocked hands voldemort many people in the room flinched and harry was pleased that silver was not one of them and also rather pleased that snape was is at large therefore i am asking you students to confide only in the members of the order at your school these people are myself professor snape professor mcgonagall professor hagrid and i daresay your new defense against the dark arts teacher but i wontspoil that surprise for you they all looked as if they rather wished he would which caused him to smile but he didntsay any more on the subject harry you and i will be practicing occlumency every monday and wednesday at six o clock the password to my office is sugar quill at least for the present harry nodded he really didntfeel like occlumency again but he thought it would probably be better without snape trying to invade his most private thoughts silver we really must decide on a surname for you dumbledore continued all eyes turned to silver who straightened interestedly your mother surname will certainly not do therefore we must make one up dumbledore sounded delighted at the thought but couldntyou tell me my father surname silver asked pointedly no i afraid that will not do dumbledore replied calmly as though he had been expecting the question silver glared at him a bit moodily so dumbledore said any suggestions anybody how about potter ron sniggered harry blushed furiously and gave ron a murderous glare fred george ron and ginny dissolved into laughter hermione seemed to be trying very hard not to laugh tonks giggled but stopped quickly when harry glared at her lupin looked highly amused as if he were holding in a fit of laughter that could prove dangerous i think not snape said sulkily dumbledore eyes twinkled and his beard quivered dangerously but he managed to keep control as he responded i must rather agree with severus soon suggestions were being yelled out all across the room what about snape ron snickered quietly as he saw snape moody glare at them from across the room harry threw a pillow at him in his opinion the idea was not funny in the slightest silver looked amused at his reaction but said nothing the suggestions ranged from lianyi moody to parks mrs weasley and every so often somebody would yell out potter just to see harry blush and glare suddenly tonks stood up i know she declared a triumphant gleam in her eye everybody quieted to look at her well since silver so mysterious she began eyeing silver with a bit of envy we should give her a mysterious last name one that will make people wonder silver leaned forward slightly as did many others in the room i also think it should make people wonder in kind of a bad way so she not mauled by boys in the halls tonks said eyeing silver with the same gleam in her eye i think it should be riddle you want her to be voldemort daughter harry asked suspiciously some people jumped at the sound of his name others were too shocked at the suggestion to react well it not like tom riddle was the only one in the world with that last name tonks argued and besides it fits her perfectly she ll be mysterious like a riddle people are going to think she voldemort daughter harry repeated snape looked as if he agreed tonks sighed fine then go with potter instead she snapped but if you dontgive her a last name that going to make people wonder you ll be hexing every boy that passes by her in the halls so that they dontjump her well the last name riddle will attract every slytherin in the school harry replied at snape furious glare he added quickly not that all slytherins are bad but the sons and daughters of death eaters you know you have to wonder for a moment everyone sat in thought maybe it is a good idea harry said suddenly like tonks said he looked at dumbledore questioningly i rather like the idea myself dumbledore replied slowly i believe however that the decision is up to silver silver riddle silver said quietly as though trying it out i like it riddle it is dumbledore said children mrs weasley announced i think you should go off to bed mum ron said it eight thirty i perfectly aware of the time thank you she snapped but you have a big day tomorrow so i suggest you get upstairs they all walked up the stairs and into their own rooms but barely five minutes had passed when there was a knock on the door in you come ron called hermione and ginny came in looking happy they had just sat down when there was another softer knock on the door harry knew exactly who it was he jumped out of bed and swept the door open grinning down at her apparently it was rather a good smile for she reached up on her tiptoes and kissed him on the cheek a bit dumbfounded he ushered her in hoping for another she climbed on to his bed and they sat facing ron ginny and hermione are you excited ginny asked silver silver nodded very she assured her i bet you ll be in gryffindor ron said looking her up and down in a way harry was not too sure he liked silver smiled i hope i am but i dontknow if i have all the qualities i mean you all show that you re daring and brave but i don t sure you do hermione replied silver glanced up in surprise you sat next to me at breakfast today remember hermione asked giving silver the first smile harry thought he d ever seen her give in silver direction silver smiled and the two girls regarded each other for a moment i sorry for being so mean hermione said quietly silver looked shocked i d like to be your friend hermione continued if you ll have me she glanced timidly up at silver really silver breathed a smile lighting her features hermione smiled really silver looked as if she were going to fly off the bed at any second and tackle hermione in a hug but she stayed on the edge of the bed of course she exclaimed hermione looked very happy immediately harry and ron exchanged confused glances and then shrugged ginny giggled nervously but happily at the same time the door opened and harry half expected to see snape yelling a triumphant aha but it was lupin you guys had better get to bed he instructed molly coming up to check on you and snape coming to check on you he motioned to silver at the last part of his sentence then he disappeared something tells me they didntwant him to come and give warning ron said bye everyone whispered as the girls filed out of the room ron and harry lay quietly and they heard mrs weasley opening the door to the girl room and saying sweetly good night girls goodnight they sung out in unison snape threw their door open and they pretended to be surprised he glanced at the corners of the room suspiciously as if he expected them to have stuffed silver into one of them and then backed away disappointedly severus you re upsetting them mrs weasley reprimanded as she came running towards the door they need to be relaxed before they go to sleep or they ll have bad dreams ron and harry smiled sweetly at snape who sneered at them in reply shoo mrs weasley told him firmly making shooing motions with her hands as she said so looking defeated snape turned and walked towards silver bedroom good night boys mrs weasley said in a sugary sweet voice night they called out she shut the door and they burst into a fit of laughter my mum can be cool sometimes ron admitted she acted like snape was a stray cat harry exclaimed gleefully it disgusting the way he treats us compared to silver ron said i bet he wishes her sweet dreams and everything if we re quiet we can find out harry said mischievously he and ron got out of bed and poked their heads out they nearly jumped back because snape was somehow just entering silver room what was he doing tying his shoelace ron whispered as he recovered from their near heart attack they crept closer to the room and then stood still craning for any noise to tell them if they were about to be found out why arentyou asleep snape demanded gently you need to get some sleep for tomorrow i know it just hard to go to sleep thinking about it silver replied they heard the bed creak as snape sat down get off of his bed you slimeball harry muttered under his breath ron elbowed him in the stomach to be quiet are you nervous snape asked a little silver replied honestly about the sorting mostly any house they put you in will be the one you belong in so there no need to worry snape replied but what if i dontget sorted at all what if i just sit there for ages with the hat on my head and nothing happens she asked harry remembered thinking the exact same thing before he was sorted snape chuckled that wonthappen he assured her what if everyone hates me she asked everyone wonthate you snape replied potter and the weasleys for one love you so you know you ll at least have them miss granger on the other hand snape voice became dangerously bitter as he said hermione name oh no silver said quickly we made up when snape asked well tonight she admitted we just wanted to all say goodnight to each other in harry and ron room for a bit and we made up then you were out of bed snape asked harry could almost see him raising his eyebrows well yes but it a good thing we were or hermione and i wouldnthave made friends right silver insisted i suppose snape said to harry it didntsound as if he supposed anything at all but even snape couldntsay no to those beautiful deep eyes so snape said silver riddle is it i think it sounds mysterious silver ventured indeed snape replied then to harry shock he continued if anybody gives you any problems i want you to tell potter straight away you trust him silver asked not in the least snape replied distastefully but he can hex the students whereas i would get fired for doing so and he d better hex them well or he ll be getting a detention harry was dumbfounded snape actually wanted him to attack the students i hope malfoy gives her lots of trouble ron whispered gleefully beside him harry couldnthelp but agree that terrible silver informed him although harry could tell she was smiling yes well snape replied not sounding the least bit repentant goodnight night silver replied with her usual sweetness it took ron and harry a moment to realize that snape would be exiting at any moment they sprinted back down the hall shut the door quietly and leaped under their covers there no way he didnthear those footsteps harry thought ruefully the door banged open and they quickly pretended to be asleep harry had frozen in a very uncomfortable position and hoped that snape would go away quickly amazingly enough snape apparently decided he had merely imagined the footsteps and closed the door immediately ouch ron complained from beside him i ll say harry agreed rubbing the arm that had been trapped under his body for a few minutes all was silent as they stared up into the darkness just as harry was getting drowsy ron spoke i bet you anything he knew what we were doing and was just standing there to cause us pain harry agreed
