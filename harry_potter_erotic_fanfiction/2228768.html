 the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you a n yes i am reposting i had a good long think and decided that in the end as much as it hurt to see one year and 34 chapters worth of work disappear in a mouseclick or two of some evil person i didntgo through all of it for nothing so i planning to repost my fic chapter by chapter once or twice a week depending on how busy i am in the meantime i will be writing chapter 35 which is going to take a while anyway this way you have something to read rather than a big blank the biggest biggest biggest thankyou of all goes to astar908 this fic was saved from the bin by them because they had pretty much all the chapters that i lost completely when my computer crashed a while ago and so without them this would definitely not be happening at all so this chapter is dedicated to astar908 chapter 1 end of sixth year once upon a time there was a young girl who lived in a castle overlooking a lake what re you doing bug off potter lily didnteven try to keep the frustration out of her voice as she raised her head to find him looking at her what he asked injuredly arentpeople allowed to make polite enquiries people are with you its always something else i not doing anything lily sighed tiredly just leave me alone she said coldly i will if you ll give me one chance what do you say evans go out with me lily slammed her book down no dontyou get it i not interested not even remotely i have no idea how many times you ve asked me this question but i ve always said no and i always going to say no and only your big head would be thick enough to think that i would ever ever go out with a pig headed jerk like you angrily she picked up her bag and books and headed for the stairs to the dormitories it was only when she got to the top step that she turned for no reason to find james standing next to the fire with an almost defeated slump to his posture the next moment sirius black one of his best friends had bounded across the room slapping his back and clearly asking him how it had gone lily heart hardened once more and she stomped along the corridor to her dormitory mumbling curses it was just one of his phases she thought fiercely he just wanted to annoy her and he had been doing it in this same way since fifth year pushing the door to her dormitory open and dumping her bag onto the floor she threw herself onto the bed and stared moodily up at the canopy of her four poster if i had one wish it would be to see potter dead she muttered what and deprive half the girls here of their own personal god lily sat up with a start she had thought the room was empty but her best friend emma appeared to be sitting up from where she had been packing her trunk in a corner regarding her with an amused smile oh it you em she lay back down contemplating the fact that even if she did manage to somehow accidentally push james out of a sixth floor window she would have half of hogwarts female population at her throats the next morning for trying to ruin the looks of a boy they practically worshipped penny for your thoughts lily groaned and rolled over my thoughts are potter death wishes two days later lily emma and all the other students boarded the hogwarts express and were carried back to king cross station lily and emma had found a compartment to themselves and were busy playing exploding snap when the door burst open and four boys fell in onto the floor in a heap the first to untangle himself was sirius he rose to his feet and bowed dramatically so sorry to have disturbed you ladies we were simply engaged in a spot of snivellus baiting and felt we needed to make a quick getaway although he might find it a bit difficult to come after us considering the clothes he wearing james added smirking especially the miniskirt his hand flew to his hair as he saw lily eyes on him peter pettigrew the shortest of the four took a quick look outside are those slytherins remus lupin a more serious and usually the most sensible of the boys checked and nodded we d better move well nice seeing you ladies sirius said cheerfully as he was dragged out by peter call on us if you ever need a nice gentleman to escort you somewhere james lingered for half a second longer evans are you sure you wouldntwant to go out with get out you conceited loser lily yelled throwing a magazine at him his head moved quickly behind the door and it slid shut for a few seconds the compartment was silent well you cantsay he isntpersistent emma said at last picking up her cards all too soon the train drew into the platform and the girls lugged their trunks into the crowd of students and parents there was no sign of the four boys or the marauders as they called themselves although lily could have sworn she heard sirius voice somewhere she and emma exchanged the usual promises of writing to each other over the summer and with a last hug emma went off to find her parents lily began to drag her things towards the barrier that separated the muggle station from the magical knowing her father would be waiting in his car outside suddenly she heard a voice behind her an all too familiar voice evans oi evans she whirled around anger already welling up to see james potter jogging up behind her what she snapped nothing just sorry for all that on the train he looked awkward jamming his hand into his pocket as he didntknow what to do with it oh ok lily felt thrown for some unidentifiable reason well have a good summer he added going red she looked at him warily yeah thanks you too see you flashing her a small grin though his cheeks were still warm he set off again weaving through the crowds lily felt oddly disconcerted as she watched his retreating figure something had been missing from that and had they really just had a civil exchange without her ending up yelling a n so there you go basically the same just a few minor alterations where i ve noticed a grammatical mistake feel free to leave a review anything will do the next chapter will be coming very soon i also want to add as a last note that if you were the person who reported this story for no reason and had it removed then i really hope that someone finds out and reports your stories for no good reason i shall also point out that were surprisingly unhelpful and rude as they ignored my email to ask how exactly i violated their guidelines which makes it clear that they dontthink before removing a story considering the fact that the website is set up to cultivate those who want to write it rather a shock to see that they re doing exactly the opposite rather undermines the whole principle in fact the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you a n thank you guys all so much for your reviews it nice to know i haventbeen forgotten i would do review thank yous but if this fic gets taken down again for anything it wontbe going up again so i wontrisk it happy easter all chapter 10 dangerous ideas despite emma words lily found that she was not able to talk to her for almost three days due to the sufficient number of distractions that seemed to crop up the first was that of the meeting with dumbledore lily had hoped to be congratulated by the headmaster on the success of the halloween contest but she had not expected to have any such formal meeting and neither did she expect what was to follow having asked directions to the headmaster office of sirius who answered with so much confidence that he must have been there a few times at least she spoke the password and the gargoyle sprang aside to reveal a moving staircase amazed at the resemblance that this bore to muggle escalators lily stepped on and allowed herself to be carried up she knocked at the door cautiously and walked in dumbledore was seated at his desk in the centre of a circular room a fire burned cheerfully in the fireplace and curious instruments were dotted all over shelves out of the corner of her eye lily caught a flash of gold on closer inspection it proved to be a golden phoenix dozing peacefully on a wooden perch do sit down miss evans dumbledore said pleasantly she took a seat in a comfortable armchair and it was only then that she noticed james next to her grinning at her professor dumbledore was ferreting around in a tin sherbet lemon he asked proffering it james looked at the bright yellow sweet rather dubiously but lily took one with an exclamation of delight i haventhad one of these since i was little ah one of the innumerable delights of childhood that is forgotten as we grow dumbledore smiled now the first thing i must do is offer you my congratulations for last night festivities from what i understand it was a roaring success and i look forward very much to seeing what else you two will be able to accomplish together i would also like to introduce you to the reward you have earned your ability to handle the responsibility maturely and deal with organisation co operatively here lily shot a guilty glance at james remembering the way she had acted in the hall that morning has shown that you deserve to be given this please follow me he stood up and led them out of the office down several corridors until he stopped in front of a seemingly blank wall for your information gryffindor tower is that way he gestured down the corridor and you should recognise the route here soon enough now it was when he turned to face the wall that lily realised that it was not in fact as empty as she had originally thought just above their heads hung a pair of masks and lily recognised the traditional shakespearian expressions of comedy and tragedy this can often be the difficult part dumbledore told them he reached up and grasped the nose of the tragedy mask to lily shock the mask did not appear to be made out of metal after all but a rubbery material which squashed down like a human nose for a moment the mask cheeks puffed out and the eyes scrunched up as if trying to hold its breath and then with a loud gasp it expelled what lily could only assume was air alright it said mournfully you ve got my attention password waddiwasi dumbledore said the bricks beneath the mask began to wriggle about some stretching and some shrinking until they had formed the outline of a stone door dumbledore pushed lightly and the door swung open the three of them stepped in lily immediate impression was of warmth and cosiness like dumbledore office this too had a warm fire blazing in the stone fireplace with a soft rug in front there were two desks in opposite corners and two sofas facing each other around the fire as well as this there were several large cushions lying on the floor and and a bookcase at the back lamps stood everywhere giving a soft light to the room and hangings depicting what looked like legends were dotted around the walls nice is it not dumbledore said cheerfully this is the heads common room cool james said he had walked over the fire and was apparently trying to test the give of the sofa by flinging himself onto it you may use this for your meetings as of now and also if you feel that you need some peace dumbledore eyes twinkled i know that some of the inmates of the common room can be rather noisy he took out two small silver keys these are for your own rooms for the first time lily noticed the two doors at the back of the room on one door in curly silver letters was written lily evans and on the other james potter are we suppose to sleep here james asked shocked good grief no we prefer that you sleep in the tower where there are others nearby no these are your personal rooms should you wish to store anything here or use it for a specific purpose you may do so there was a hint of a smile on his face that does not include wild parties in case you were wondering however you may bring friends here as long as you inform professor mcgonagall or myself of who it is and when beforehand we will then judge if it is appropriate be warned we shall know what is going on he smiled at them i shall leave you now to explore goodnight he let himself out and lily heard his feet tapping down the corridor lily and james remained at opposite ends of the room looking silently around feeling suddenly tired lily sank onto a large cushion oh god she thought this head rooms stuff is going to be harder than i thought another more pleasant distraction over the next few days was sapphire emma and lily did their level best to integrate her into their friendship and shield her from callie vicious remarks and this meant a lot of time spent having long girly chats and getting to lessons early to find seats together within those hours that they enjoyed together lily began to wonder how any of the comments callie had made could be true admittedly sapphire was a half blood her mother was a witch her father a muggle and her family was not terribly well off however she was funny and very mischievous and with her sparkling eyes and glossy hair lily failed to see how any boy could ignore her for long it seemed a little like she was a missing piece to their friendship a piece that completed the puzzle sapphire one problem lay with none other than sirius although he had been fairly polite to her the day after the contest in view of the night before it soon became clear that he had no intention of giving her an easy ride what with all the time that emma spent with remus and the occasions that lily had to discuss head business with james a fair proportion of time was consumed where they were at least in the vicinity of the marauders and sirius took full advantage within three days he had tripped sapphire up eighteen times emma had kept count and twelve of those times her books had also gone flying he also managed to knock two bottles of her ink over sprinkle paper into her hair and accidentally on purpose knock a jug of pumpkin juice all over her dinner coupled with all this were the insults and the teasing that he seemed to have an almost inexhaustible supply of heathleigh you intending to go meet heath cliff later by any chance saffy doesntthat sound like daffy are you sure your name isntdaffodil or something just as hippy as your real name so do you have to mine for sapphires or do you just find them that dirty naturally pathetic as these were lily and emma had no explanation for why he had suddenly begun to pick on her after six years of knowing who she was despite the fact that lily idea of giving him a good kick up the backside was tempting sapphire decided to settle for emma suggestion of just ignoring him and taking it in stride with her easygoing temperament it did not take too long for this to become a regular pattern although she still felt hurt when he purposely dug at her one morning that week the three girls came down to breakfast to find the hall buzzing with excitement what going on emma asked as they slid into their seats remus who was sitting a few spaces away with the rest of the marauders answered they re announcing the finalists from the contest after breakfast oh cool lily said excitedly how does it work sapphire asked with interest basically there ll be a boy and a girl from each year from each house and they ll be up against the others in their year for the prize we didntthink it would be fair to pit first years against seventh years correction james called down the table from where he was sitting you didntthink it would be fair i was perfectly fine with the idea lily gave him an exasperated but amused look and threw her hands up in defeat okay fine i didntthink it was fair happy of course james gave her a cheeky grin misrepresentation of facts is a serious crime and i for one am glad i could put this instance right ooh jamesie knows a big word sirius mocked through a mouthful of bacon james hit him on the back and he promptly choked soon enough as plates began to clear daniel jordan who seemed to be an unofficial announce as well as commentator came up to the front and performed an amplifying spell on himself gooooooooood mornin hogwarts his voice boomed several times louder than usual several students including sirius yelled morning back at him i have here the results of the halloween fancy dress contest if you re a finalist just sit tight and instructions will come your way in a few days but anyway since dear old professor minniekins is now giving me a dirty look mcgonagall was indeed glaring at him i should get on so in the first year gryffindor finalists will be rose johnson and thomas brown two shocked squeaks came from the end of the table in slytherin we have dylan grimp and jakarta herpes ravenclaw amy marione and tim tucker he carried on despite the gasps that emerged as he named he finalists eventually he reached the sixth years and lily began to pay a little more attention and gryffindor gemma nicholson and jack stevens and finally in seventh year we have ravenclaw rosaline wood and edward monhagen slytherin bellatrix black and lucius malfoy hufflepuff dominic ashton and hilary darthrite gryffindor sirius black and sapphire heathleigh congratulations to all of you lily turned to sapphire whose face wore a completely shocked expression well done saffy i dontbelieve it sapphire murmured as emma hugged her this is not happening yes it is lily shook her slowly a smile tugged at saphhire lips i cantbelieve i got in well you did and we re proud of ya lily said she saw emma pained expression and grimaced i never trying an american accent again sapphire looked up the table where sirius too was being patted on the back beyond him callie and serena were looking more than slightly annoyed but then her attention was caught by what sirius was saying well yeah i was hoping that one of us four would win through but really he added raising his eyebrows dontyou think that there were better costumes around than some earth woman in an eyesore dress knowing perfectly well that he had meant her to hear sapphire bit her lip and looked down allowing her hair to swing forward moodily she stabbed at a sausage imagining it to be sirius head it was finally that day that emma had a chance to talk to lily about what she had wanted to say after dinner she dragged sapphire and lily to the dormitory ignoring their protests about homework and pushed them both unceremoniously down in the empty room okay em what this about emma twisted her hands do you remember that potion we studied in second year the really complicated one that transformed you into other people lily wrinkled her nose trying to remember the polyjuice potion she asked at last yeah emma nodded well look dontfreak out or anything but i ve made it it took a few moments for this to sink in even then sapphire still looked slightly confused while lily mouth had dropped open you what i made well i making the potion it nearly finished look please stay calm emma begged excuse me lily hissed you re making an illegal potion god knows where using god knows what that you must have stolen from professor singrey since you cantget those ingredients anywhere else and you tell me to stay calm i had my reasons emma said defensively look lil please stay quiet i dontwant anyone hearing lily opened her mouth to say something but sapphire cut her off she was frowning emma you do realise that if you re caught you ll be risking suspension i said i had my reasons emma looked nettled ok then sapphire said quietly what were these reasons and where did you get the recipe and why didntyou tell us before demanded lily i got the recipe out of a book in the restricted section moste potente potions i think it was called madam pince was a bit iffy about me taking it out even though i showed her proof that i did defence against the dark arts i didnttell you before because it didntseem like the right time emma paused as for my reasons when i first started the potion about three and a half weeks ago i wanted to find out if remus liked me now i think i think i just want to know if i can trust him lily still couldntbelieve her ears newsflash em if you want to know that you go ask him you dontdo deceitful stuff like this lily you know what i mean emma tone was pleading but she was right lily did know emma had had a wonderful relationship with her father whom she had adored until he had walked out of her life taking one of her younger sisters when she was ten she had never forgiven him for leaving the family in ruins and had problems when it came to trusting the opposite sex even after seven years it was reminiscent of a muggle soap opera but true the point is lily i need your help and i dontmean by pouring the potion down the drain how lily snorted you want me to transform into someone else and do a little interrogation uh yes there was a short silence as lily mentally replayed emma answer in her head checking that she was not hearing things what please lily emma begged imploringly i would have done it but i cantnow i d give myself away i need you to absolutely not lily i serious this is the one time i really need your help otherwise i ll spend the rest of my life being paranoid about it even if i could who d you expect me to change into sirius lily tone bordered on scathing no said emma thoughtfully he remus best friend he would notice straight away that something was wrong i was thinking someone more like keegan adams what have you been doing planning this yep i still say no please lils lily rounded on sapphire what do you think i dontknow that this is the most sensible decision but i dontknow the full story so i cantreally say sapphire eyed them both doubtfully emma looked back at lily her eyes wide and pleading against her better judgement lily gave in i still dontagree with this but for your sake i ll do it oh thank you lily i swear i ll take the blame if anything happens you d better lily said grumpily but it was lost on emma who was beaming happily up at the ceiling it ll be ready soon i ll tell you when lily curled up on the bed feeling a sudden tension rise the outcome of this would not be good a n reviews anyone the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you a n thank you guys all so much for your reviews it nice to know i haventbeen

boy and girl p s go get em saffy and feel free to give me details on what you re wearing when you decide love lily d lily you werentmeant to write personal messages on these otherwise i could have written a nice polite one to malfoy oh crap i ve done it now as well sorry sapphire congratulations anyway lily i going to kill you dear mum i sorry it taken so long for me to write back to you i ve been studying a lot so it been difficult to squeeze in time i a horrible liar arenti you want the truth a lot been going on lately it kind of been like an emotional rollercoaster i know i know you re going to tell me that i should concentrate on my schoolwork more newts wontbe easy blah blah blah i am studying it just that this has all been going on the sidelines so to speak i guess i d better start at the beginning so that you ll understand callie broke up with me messily in the middle of the halloween contest she went off to sit with serena afterwards i should have seen that coming and i ended up crying like a baby in the toilets mind you it wasnttotally terrible lily evans you know that nice girl you talked to on the platform last year found me and now i think i have new best friends her and emma i honestly cantbelieve that i missed out on what great people they were for such a long time i always thought they were really studious and boring even though i suppose lily can be quite a hit with the boys she looks a bit like a christmas decoration in a nice way with her red hair and green eyes emma a bit more cynical but she fun too i feel a lot happier than i have in a long time and callie can just go throw herself off a cliff for all i care i really dontwant to remember all the things that she said to me that night in other news your idea for me going as a dryad was great mum i a finalist in my year in the contest and the dress was perfect all i had to do was go out and nick a few leaves and flowers from the grounds i have to find a new costume now since you re not meant to wear the same one for the finals any other brilliant ideas so i suppose that at this very moment my life is pretty good wait a moment i would highly suggest that you hide this part from dad done good i have a minor problem with a boy not that kind of problem mum and no dontworry you wontget any grandkids off me yet there this boy in my year sirius black who wontstop picking on me it weird because he obviously known i existed for the last six years but it like he only just noticed me it not bullying either it just this continual teasing i suppose i d better confess that i did have a tiny tiny crush on him in fifth year but now i think he just a pig headed prat lily said i should give him a good kick up the well a good kick but i just trying to ignore him at the moment as per emma advice it hard though there are times when i d just love to punch his smug face the reason i telling you is because from what you used to tell me i think dad might have been a bit like this when he first moved into the neighbourhood and started hanging out with you and your friends in the holidays so i wanted to know what you did to shut him up please say it involved slapping him round the face have no fear though there is very little chance that i would ever like sirius considering how much i despise him at this point in time so i wontbe changing my name to sapphire black any time soon ugh the thought makes my skin crawl anyway emma calling me we have to go to dinner so i ll stop here before this gets too heavy for andromeda to carry hope you and dad are well tell him to lay off the cigarettes please lots of love saffy xxx p s if dad come storming up to the school ready to beat up any boy that so much as looks at me then i ll know you let him read this and i will never write another letter to you again that saturday was gryffindor first quidditch match of the season against slytherin according to the resident quidditch fanatics gryffindor was already in with a good chance as long as they scored over than one hundred and fifty points because ravenclaw had defeated slytherin by two hundred and fifty points in their first match the tension in the air was palpable as lily woke up all around her red clothing was lying on the floor and beds shows of support for the house when emma lily and saffy entered the great hall scarves wrapped firmly round their necks in anticipation of the weather the first thing noticeable was the quidditch team sitting at one end of the table looking pale and talking quietly soon enough they broke away from the group leaving the marauders on their own james in particular looked like he had not slept all night and was not making the slightest effort to bother with eating despite the fact that his fellow chaser sirius was piling his plate with sausages and bacon after breakfast the school began to filter out and go down to the quidditch pitch daniel jordan climbed up into the commentator box closely followed by professor mcgonagall who looked fully intent on monitoring every word he said welcome to the second match of the season gryffindor versus slytherin on the slytherin team i give you crabbe goyle nott lestrange avery rosier and the captain malfoy seven green robed figures walked out onto the pitch clutching broomsticks lily caught a glimpse of lucius malfoy smug face smirking into the crowd every blond hair in perfect place and now the team who will be winning the cup this year jordan sorry minnie jordan do you intend to continue commentating this year sorry professor sorry now where was i oh yeah gryffindor i give you jacobs black stevens lawrence nicholson andrews and their captain potter unlike the slytherins the gryffindor team looked tense james face was grim and set as he faced malfoy while his hair and robes blew wildly in the wind captains shake hands madam hooch called out mount your brooms three two one she blew her whistle and fourteen brooms rose into the air the match was fast and exciting and gryffindor took an early lead lily watched the green and red blurs race around the pitch with more interest than usual for reasons she could not seem to explain to herself beside her sapphire whooped and cheered every time gryffindor scored and even lily could see how hard the team had practiced the chasers worked well together passing seamlessly to each other and almost seeming to read each other thoughts gemma nicholson and jack stevens the two beaters were also doing a good job forcing the slytherins to dive randomly all over the pitch in an effort to avoid their bludgers moira the seeker was darting around in the air high above everyone else obviously looking for the snitch as he circled past lily sighted james face his eyes were narrowed in focus his whole expression centred in concentration on the quaffle as he soared past shouting an instruction at sirius she had to admire his prowess on the broom he seemed completely at home in the air managing to both dive and rise fifty metres in the space of about twenty seconds sapphire excitement was infectious lily had never known that she was such an avid quidditch supporter both remus and lily found themselves joining in with her cheers as the scores mounted gryffindor were leading 160 to 90 if moira caught the snitch now the game would be theirs no one even noticed when emma slipped away halfway through and jacobs passes to black who passes to potter back to jacobs ooh he drops it and the quaffle is caught by nott damn you jordan sorry professor who passes to lestrange who nicely intercepted by that bludger hit by nicholson suddenly a gasp went round the stands and everyone collectively craned their necks to squint up into the sky moira and avery the slytherin seeker were rising sharply up at an almost ninety degree angle both their hands outstretched towards the tiny gold ball that fluttered innocently above it looked as though avery was going to make it first he knocked moira hand out of the way the crowd held its breath and come on moira sapphire screamed gemma nicholson at the last moment swung her bat at the nearest bludger which raced towards avery at such an angle that he was forced to rise sharply above moira a look of ecstatic greed spread over his face as he was moved even closer to the snitch and his hand began to close just as the snitch moving sideways to evade his hand flew straight into moira s the gryffindor stands exploded sapphire was screaming herself hoarse and jumping up and down as were many others while remus and peter hi fived each other in delight lily felt herself smiling widely as the gryffindor team reached the ground and gryffindor wins 300 points to 90 congratulations to captain potter and his team they ve just got into first place running for the quidditch cup as the team moved together to congratulate each other lily laughed out loud to see sirius ecstatic expression which he was directing at the slytherins whose faces looked like thunder she could just about work out what he was saying haha take that you smug bastards not so tough now are you beside him james launched himself at moira and hugged her tightly shorter than him by about a head and a half she was almost engulfed by him he released her and looked up at the crowds grinning his robes sweaty and his hair even messier than it had begun his eyes met lily for an instant and she read the intense fierce joy in his hazel eyes as he looked at her which shook her for some profoundly inexplicable reason to the bone the moment passed and he was distracted as sirius bounded up to slap him on the back talking cheerfully pulling herself out of her daze lily and saffy began to make their way out of the stands suddenly lily turned round where emma sapphire looked behind her then shrugged they continued past the hordes of cheering or scowling pupils lily did not have to wait long for her question to be answered as they made their way towards the castle emma appeared beside them looking excited but apprehensive where were lily began but emma interrupted her hurriedly her face pale it ready lily the potion ready a n okay so this was a bit of a short chapter but it was necessary anyway reviews always make me feel like updating faster hint hint hint the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you kudos to jkr since i copied some bits out of cos for authenticity in this chapter a n thank you guys all so much for your reviews it nice to know i haventbeen forgotten i would do review thank yous but if this fic gets taken down again for anything it wontbe going up again so i wontrisk it chapter 12 the polyjuice potion at ten o clock that night the party was still raging in the gryffindor common room and showed no signs of abating at least until mcgonagall herself showed up bottles of butterbeer and various snacks had mysteriously appeared on the table and people helped themselves liberally as they celebrated their quidditch victory the only people who did not look as though they were thoroughly enjoying themselves were three girls clustered in a corner although they all had drinks in their hands in an attempt to look festive their faces were working against them as they went through the circular conversation that they had had many times before in the course of the evening look i can keep the potion going until tomorrow it ll stay til then i dontthink it a good idea to do it tonight everyone too hyped up what am i supposed to do again lily questioned emma sighed i going to distract keegan and tom i ll ask them to go on a run with me or something all you have to do is take the potion go up to their dorm and start up a casual conversation but work in a few questions as well you ll have an hour to do that then just come down again oh is that all lily said sarcastically what if remus finds out where you are good point emma frowned i d suppose i should tell him that i ll be going for a run with them she got up and made her way over to remus where he stood with his friends lily watched as she began talking and gesturing until her gaze drifted sideways to the others james and sirius james especially had been receiving a lot of compliments for the match but while sirius bowed and smiled james threw everything onto moira skill with such sincerity that lily wondered why his normally gigantic ego seemed to be so flat lily sapphire was leaning forward her eyebrows furrowed i really dontthink this is a good idea lily shrugged trying to make her tone sound light it too late anyway the potion ready yeah but i have a really bad feeling about this we re going to come out of this badly lily curled up on her chair her green eyes reflecting the dancing light of the fire opposite good or bad there nothing i can do now the first thing lily knew the next day was a persistent shaking she opened her eyes to see emma face whassa matter she grumbled turning over come on you have to take the potion lily sat bolt upright sleep falling away like her blankets sapphire was already sitting up on her bed dressed and watching her nervously after going to the bathroom she came back and started pulling jeans on you know you cantreally be keegan if you re going to walk around in girls clothes sapphire pointed out helpfully i have a pair of trousers and a jumper here emma held up a bag i sneaked them out of the laundry yesterday besides she added critically eyeing lily you re going to need something to change back into afterwards come on the three girls hurried silently down corridors following emma who led them straight into a girls bathroom em you didntmake it in moaning myrtle place lily gasped she coughed and waved her hand futilely at the thick black smoke well no one ever comes here so it seemed like a safe bet emma said she opened a cubicle door and lily caught a glimpse of a black cauldron bubbling on a toilet inside she averted her eyes and looked instead at sapphire who seemed more and more apprehensive each minute soon emma came back out with a glass of what looked like thick mud here she said handing it to lily hold she fished in her pocket and came up with a bottle containing three blond brown hairs taking them out she gave them to lily who dropped them in the potion hissed and bubbled before turning a deep cerulean blue feeling only slightly less nauseous lily gave emma and sapphire another glance and then holding her nose drank the potion down quickly she did not have time to register the taste before her stomach began to writhe she heard emma and sapphire horrified gasps as she dropped to all fours and her skin began to bubble like hot wax reshaping itself into a boy body her jumper came loose at the front as did her bra as her chest receded and she felt the weight of her hair disappearing from her shoulders as her skin grew tanned suddenly it all stopped and lily got up gingerly taking a ragged breath emma and sapphire were staring at her in shocked amazement give me the clothes lily said and the voice that came out was not hers but a smooth low voice keegan s mutely emma handed over the bag and she stepped into a cubicle to change she came out again and gave emma a half grin well at least i know that the hairs werentfrom malfoy now she joked awkwardly sapphire mouth was still hanging open crossing over to a cracked mirror lily examined her or rather keegan s face the face of a boy she had known for six years she ran a hand through the short blond brown hair and over the tanned skin her nails were no longer long and feminine but short and blunt she turned round you know you could have got me some shoes emma seemed to pull herself together doesntmatter come on we have to go the three of them took a quick route back to the tower dontwalk like that lily looked back at sapphire huh dontsort of sway your hips you re not a girl any more and it wouldnthurt to swing your arms a bit either like this yeah that ll do in a corridor near the fat lady emma stopped and pushed the other two into a shady alcove behind a suit of armour and shoved lily clothes at sapphire right you two stay here i going to go meet the boys once you hear us go past go straight to the tower and do your stuff saffy you d better wait downstairs about five minutes before your hour up come down meet up and go back to the toilets to change i ll meet you as soon as i can lily gave her a nod and emma walked off down the corridor there was an uncomfortable silence until sapphire began to laugh quietly imagine if anyone found us here she gasped clutching her side it would be all over the school heathleigh and adams caught snogging but keegan wouldnteven know what had happened lily began to laugh too but quickly sobered up as she heard footsteps presently emma voice could be heard so where do you usually run i mean this place is full of ways but still you must have a route you like she continued to talk aimlessly but both hidden girls or boy felt her gaze sweep over them as they walked on as soon as the voices had faded lily squeezed out ten of her precious sixty minutes had already gone see you then she said and walking quickly she entered the tower and headed up the boys stairs trying hard to look as though everything was normal the boys corridor looked much like the girls lily headed towards the last door which had seventh years on it in curly writing took a deep breath and walked in keegan said a voice in surprise at first lily did not reply too busy taking in the dormitory the basic decoration and arrangement did not differ much from her own room it was simply the boyish differences aftershaves and colognes lying where make up would normally be a general mess on the floor instead of the odd bra or witch weekly magazine dropped carelessly and the many posters of quidditch teams on the wall remus was sitting on his bed sorting through a stack of parchment and sirius appeared to be searching for something under his bed peter was reading a book in the corner i thought you d gone for a run with tom and emma yeah well uhm lily looked at her feet and tried desperately to come up with something we were uh running and my trainer came off so i uh tripped and my ankle hurts yeah really painful she sat down on the nearest bed praying it was keegan s oh remus said his attention back on the parchment relieved that he wasntmore curious lily bent down and pretended to rub her ankle she was feeling distinctly ill at ease just then the door banged open and james barged in looking fresh and clean his hair wet padfoot the bathroom yours he turned round and saw lily uh keegan why re you sitting on my bed oh damn she got up hurriedly sorry i just sat down anywhere frantically she looked round and thankfully spotted a photo of what looked like keegan family on a dresser she moved over trying hard to fake a slight limp and began to rub her ankle again nervously why arentyou out running with tom anyway james called towelling his hair lily repeated her story as sincerely as she could make herself sound james turned to her and raised an eyebrow as he dried his hair how did you manage to fall over and do all that when you only left ten minutes ago i fell over just outside i didntdo my trainer up properly lily lied she shifted uncomfortably as james gave her a strange look and turned to sirius again oi padfoot bathroom free he yelled sirius emerged grinning triumphantly and looking like he had just aged forty years his head was covered in dust found it he proclaimed holding a dusty green sock up sorry james darling did you call james rolled his eyes good naturedly forget it remus looked up you know prongs you should really tidy your bit up james surveyed the mess around him and groaned but it a sunday all the more reason to do it remus replied calmly grumbling james began to pick up the random pieces of underwear on the carpet remmie dear do stop taking lessons from emma you re not our mother now are you sirius chided teasingly speaking of emma arentyou worried about the fact that she out with tom peter asked slyly no remus said simply i trust her lily saw her opportunity so you really like her huh she asked casually yeah remus said quietly she special lily fought to control the girlish squeal of delight that threatened to erupt she doubted it would be taken very well instead she nodded impassively and bent down to her ankle again speaking of girls wormtail who were you dreaming about sirius smirked peter went red i dontknow what you re talking about oh yes you do i saw you changing your sheets in the middle of the night you had a wet dream sirius voice became hushed but his grin grew even wider as peter turned purple and sputtered like a firework lily felt slightly ill as she realised what they were talking about oh my god she thought faintly as she attempted to smile weakly at sirius crude jokes i ve been scarred for life after getting more and more agitated peter finally thought of a comeback i not the one who dreams about a certain red head every night he squeaked the grin began to fade from james face why dontyou tell us about these dreams of yours jamesie sirius rounded on him i ve heard him saying her name in his sleep peter said breathlessly all the time even remus was looking up in interest now sirius looked like he was having the time of his life so what exactly goes on in this working relationship between you two that provides such interesting material for dreams oh god please please dontlet them be talking about james turned abruptly away and bent down to his bed but not before lily had seen his flushed cheeks lily and i are just friends woah hold up a minute there has the world stopped turning james doesnthave a crush on me anymore yes hmm sirius said mockingly at least i dontbloody bully girls like you who sapphire sirius looked innocent she just she has a lovely reaction to it that all he grabbed his bathrobe hastily i should go shower the door swung shut behind him as he walked out remus raised his eyebrows there something not right about that nah he just hates her so much that he doesntwant to talk about her james said off handedly the conversation switched to more everyday topics including a heated discussion of quidditch between james and peter far from feeling happier about the change of subject lily began to feel more and more uncomfortable as though she was she was intruding on their privacy the feeling intensified and weighed more and more on her conscience as she thought about it even if they could be immature prats at times wasntit a bit immoral to be listening to all their secrets like this how could i have agreed to this she thought in shock completely oblivious to the others i worse than they could ever be hey keegan you ok james asked breaking into her train of thought you re not usually this quiet especially when we re discussing the kenmare kestrels yeah whatever lily looked blankly at her watch time to go i gonna go get food see you guys later she walked out as quickly as she could manage clomping down the stairs she met sapphire in the common room and the two of them headed down to the toilets lily anger growing with every step five minutes later lily emerged from the toilet looking like herself again complete with suitable clothes the transformation had gone without a hitch but sapphire was not blind to the look on her friend face come on she barked at sapphire we have to go discuss things with emma she swept off down the corridor her rage burning a trail of fire through her mind and almost slammed into someone tom who was coming down in the opposite direction not even bothering to say sorry she stormed down various passages until she reached the portrait hole and climbed through it hey lily we need to a voice said lily turned her head to see james standing a few feet away he gave her a puzzled look as she threw him a class a glare later she ground out and she carried on up the girls stairs sapphire following her could only shrug apologetically as she hurried after her the door flew open and emma looked up in surprise to see lily standing in the middle of the dormitory sapphire closing the door quietly behind her how d it go she asked how d it go how d it go i ll tell you how it went emma vance how could you do this to me a n do a good deed for humankind or rather for my ego and leave a review you know you want to the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you kudos to jkr since i copied some bits out of cos for authenticity in this chapter a n thank you guys all so much for your reviews it nice to know i haventbeen forgotten i would do review thank yous but if this fic gets taken down again for anything it wontbe going up again so i wontrisk it previously on ttoth the door flew open and emma looked up in surprise to see lily standing in the middle of the dormitory sapphire closing the door quietly behind her how d it go she asked how d it go how d it go i ll tell you how it went emma vance how could you do this to me chapter 13 hangover what emma asked clearly confused emma i know i had my doubts and even saffy told me she wasnthappy about it but how could you talk me into taking this stupid potion in the first place emma looked to sapphire who could only shrug what went wrong did remus say something lily laughed but it was a sound that had no real mirth in it oh yes remus totally likes you he completely trusts you and he thinks you re special she spat the word out all you had to do was ask him and he would have told you himself instead you had to rope us all into this mess emma still looked bemused then what happened calm down lils it canthave been anything that bad can it oh nothing happened emma lily was yelling now it the principle of the thing how could you talk me into strike that how could you come up with the whole idea of doing this lily why are you so worried i mean as long as they dontfind out it alright isntit i happy you re happy they re happy it all turned out okay so the end justifies the means does it lily exploded you re telling me it fine to do the deceitful thing that we just did because as long as you re not paranoid it all good huh no but emma gave up trying to placate her and tried a different tack well at least it all over now we can just forget about it she had said the wrong thing i dontthink you understand emma i ve been feeling sick with myself since i walked out of their dorm we ve spent all these years condemning the marauders for all the pranks they ve played over the years when we ve just done something that worse and more more lily struggled for words more immoral than anything they ve ever done or are probably ever going to do the guilt from that isntjust going to go away emma you dontjust forget emma eyes flashed in case you dontremember lily i didnt force you into this you do have your own free will i know and i blame myself for agreeing to go along with this but i blame you even more for deciding to go about it in this way but you didnt have to agree this isnt some sort of forced labour camp you re allowed to disagree with me you re treating this like i made you take the potion well maybe i wouldnthave to if you had told us before you started making it so that we d have some input that was because i knew you would react the way you did and stop me from getting anywhere with it oh so you had already planned for me to say yes you think i such a pushover oh yes lily isntstubborn at all she ll do whatever i ask her to even if it involves deceiving my boyfriend actually at the minute you are being stubborn a stubborn cow as lily gaped in outrage sapphire stepped quickly in between the two of them lily had forgotten that she was even there come on cantwe just sit down and talk this out calmly before you bring the roof down her words were brushed aside as the two girls glared daggers at each other emma was the first to speak i cantbelieve my own best friend would turn on me i cantbelieve my own best friend would be so deceitful lily shot back you know before you start labelling other people faults lily evans you should take a look at your own well at least i admit when i in the wrong do you i canthear you saying anything now just a load of mindless rubbish that all that coming out of your mouth lily stared at her in shock then maybe you wont be listening to mindless rubbish coming out of this mouth any longer she yelled why were we ever friends well we re not now are we emma shouted back sapphire stared in horror see if i care fine fine lily stormed out of the dormitory slamming it behind her she could hear sapphire calling her behind but the last thing she wanted to do was to walk back in and so she continued down to the common room and sat down in a sofa by the window the clouds drifting steadily by outside calmed her and she began to feel more clear headed though not less angry or upset eventually she turned around and surveyed the room the marauders were lounging in chairs by the fire discussing something intently just then remus said something to james who turned round to see her for a moment he was tempted to smile at her as their eyes locked but he was arrested by the expression she held she looked weary as though she had lost her peace of mind for a few seconds she held his gaze then let it drop and turned back to the window you know prongs sirius smirked eye contact is widely known to be one of the most powerful forms of flirting save it sirius james sighed i ve told you before we re just friends for one thing and besides she obviously isntin the mood for anything like that sirius grinned whatever you say prongs whatever you say when sapphire finally came down she found lily in the same position as she had been in half an hour ago hi saffy she said quietly as sapphire sat down hey look i ve just talked to emma and she doing exactly the same thing as you lily rolled her eyes go figure she muttered quietly sapphire frowned please cantyou just talk to her and sort this out you cant just pretend your friendship never existed wanna bet lily just go up and say the first word and this ll be over lily shook her head not going to happen it not my fault sapphire looked at her for a moment actually lils if you want the truth some of it is if you felt this strongly about it you should ve said so before you took the potion not after i know saffy ok i already admitted that was my fault it emma problem now not mine but if you just made the first move then no i won t let her work it out by herself sapphire sighed in defeat okay she said quietly i want you both to know that i not taking sides it between you two and you both have to sort it out lily nodded look i going to uhm do some homework in the library see you around she got up and walked out of the common room before realizing that her bag was up in the dormitory but she did not go back oh well she thought continuing to walk maybe its better i probably wouldnthave been able to concentrate anyway stopping she leant against the cool stone wall just under a flickering torch and rubbed her eyes furiously why did it have to come to this a n looking back at this chapter i found quite a few americanisms where the language that lily used didntexactly well it was more americanised than i wanted it to be i ve changed it wherever possible but a few examples remain so please excuse them anyway you know that little purple button points at bottom left corner of screen it calling your name begging you to click it respond to the call leave a review the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you kudos to jkr since i copied some bits out of cos for authenticity in this chapter a n thank you guys all so much for your reviews it nice to know i haventbeen forgotten i would do review thank yous but if this fic gets taken down again for anything it wontbe going up again so i wontrisk it read on chapter 14 one step forward a week had passed since the fight needless to say it had not been good sitting at a desk lily paused her quill suspended over a potions essay and thought back over the past seven days lessons had been uncomfortable particularly those where she and emma sat together and could not change places with anybody thankfully none of these classes had required partner work yet and so lily had kept her eyes trained firmly on her textbook the whole time sapphire went from one to the other using every means she could think of to get them to talk to each other none of which worked and did her best to alternate her time between the two of them in the end however lily growing tired of knowing that her friend would be feeling guilty over being with one or the other all the time told sapphire to just stay with emma when sapphire did not look fully convinced lily elaborated and explained that she had numerous head duties that would keep her busy and so it would not matter in fact her head duties at the time were more or less non existent because of this she had taken to eating either at the beginning or end of mealtimes alone when there were not as many people around or simply going down to the kitchens whenever she felt in need of nourishment the house elves were more than happy to help the rest of her time she had at first devoted to homework in the library and common room but eventually getting tired of the curious stares that she received or in the case of emma glares she had migrated to the heads rooms she now wondered that she or james had not made more use of it before she knew for certain that he had not come in at all the rooms became a source of peace and a haven from her troubled social life although she honestly did miss being able to laugh carefree with emma and sapphire her one comfort was that she was completely on top of all the homework that her professors were piling on the class the truth if lily dug deep she knew that the truth was that she really missed her friend and if it wasntfor a strong conviction that she was in the right she would have burst into tears several times by the end of the week as well as gone to find emma as it was her spirits were low and more than anything she just wanted to have her life rewind a little back to happier times when she could laugh and talk to people who cared she chewed on her quill checked up another fact in the book beside her and then continued to write the steady tick of the clock on the wall being the only sound that accompanied her she was so absorbed in her work that she did not notice that someone else had entered the room until they spoke you know with reactions like yours a rabbit on the road would be dead meat in about ten seconds lily spun round startled then let out a breath of relief oh it you james grinned he was leaning on the wall where the door was watching her interestedly enjoying potions lily made a face what do you think james straightened up and crossed his arm seriously lily i think you need to start talking you ve barely opened your mouth in ages you never come to meals and from what i know you ve practically bought this place you ve spent so much time holed up in here alone what gives lily did her best to give him a cheery normal smile nothing you re imagining things i just catching up on work james raised an eyebrow lily evans i am quite capable of coming over there and either tickling or beating you up until you spill do you really want me to do that alarmed at the thought of james manhandling her in any way lily hesitated then gave in she swivelled round back to the desk to avoid james penetrating gaze fine i er i had a fight she said in a small voice with emma james guessed yes aaah james nodded sagely thought so well donttell me to go talk to her saffy already done that loads of times and if she didntwork on me you certainly won t actually james cleared his throat i was going to ask if you wanted to come and hang out with us oh lily shifted in her seat wondering for a moment if she had heard right well that nice of you but uhm i fine right now thanks anyway oh come on we wontbite well remus might lily gave him a confused look private joke please no really it fine lily his tone was so serious that she turned around again fully to look up at him this isntjust me talking this is sirius and remus and peter as well and we wonttake no for an answer you cant pretend to me that you ve actually enjoyed the past week well no but lily did not know what to say okay okay fine i ll come uhm thanks good so wanna come raid the kitchens lily looked back down at her unforgiving essay i need to finish this first so n she was cut off by a loud rumble from her stomach betrayed by your own stomach james grinned you should really discipline it better alright i get the point lily laughed i coming i coming she put her quill and parchment into her bag pushed it under the table and got up good cause you ve deprived me of james checked his watch five minutes which i could have used to stuff my face i a growing teenage boy who needs his food let go wonder how long it ll take for him to convince her a voice said lily climbed through the door after james and found herself face to face with remus and sirius who were standing outside prongsie old boy finally james shut the door behind them where peter he asked filch dragged him off said he was dripping mud lily looked around her the floor was spotless moving her gaze up she could not help but feel another twinge of nervousness surrounded as she was by these three tall boys are you sure you dontmind putting up with me she asked cautiously the question my dear lily remus said cheerfully is not whether we can put up with you but whether you can put up with us he stopped for a moment actually retract that i perfectly normal it this demented maniac he pointed at sirius you want to watch out for and his partner in crime here hey sirius exclaimed in mock outrage he punched remus playfully james snorted now where were we ah yes the kitchens suddenly to lily life seemed ten times better granted the marauders were no match for her own friends but they provided the companionship that she had been wishing for and contrary to her expectations they all seemed to be making sure that she fitted in with them and was having fun even down to peter who she shared several laughs before the day was out she studied with remus while james and sirius joked around and made her laugh and within a few hours she felt very much at home with them one moment that she would cherish forever she knew would be the look of shock on emma and indeed everyone s faces when she walked nonchalantly in with the marauders to breakfast the next morning sat down and laughed her way through the meal as she watched james sirius and peter consume several times their own weight in food or so it seemed and mcgonagall amazed expression when she sat down next to james in her transfiguration lesson and proceeded to transfigure her rock perfectly into a golden labrador puppy what mcgonagall did not know was that james had been hissing instructions and tips out of the corner of his mouth the whole time all in all she was a lot happier and surely lily thought that had to give the marauders some plus points at the end of the lesson professor mcgonagall called james and lily up to her desk after congratulating lily on her sudden and dramatic improvement in class lily had to fight very hard to hide her laughter she gave them a more serious look now i know that we have allowed you a few weeks off after the halloween contest to relax but it is time you began planning for the winter ball or whatever you choose to call it you have six weeks if you hold a meeting today as well that gives you ample time as long as you are prepared to work hard her eyes settled approvingly on lily in light of your recent performance in this lesson miss evans i do not think it will be too much of a problem so accordingly that night the two of them seated themselves in front of the fire in the heads common room with a pile of parchment and began to discuss the options what dress code should it be james tilted his chair back on two legs actually i was thinking maybe muggle formal clothes they look a lot nicer than wizarding robes and i sure we could persuade gladrags into stocking them for us i dontknow if you ve ever seen them before lily bent down and pulled two pictures from her bag which she placed on the table for james scrutiny he looked down at them yeah he said after a moment the muggle clothes are nicer and i not just saying that because they reveal a lot more skin lily raised her eyebrows but you re wrong i have seen stuff like this before when lily asked she had thought that he came from a pureblood wizarding family two words my sister one word huh my sister maddie well her name madeleine but we call her maddie i never knew you had a sister what about her well everyone else in the family showed magical signs when they were really young but maddie didn t so my parents thought that she might be a squib and sent her to primary school turns out she was a witch she turned a friend hair purple during a fight a couple of weeks before she got her letter james grinned mum and dad werenttoo happy about explaining to caitlin walters parents that the girls hadnt been experimenting with hair dyes under our roof anyway maddie didntwant to come here she was too into the muggle world so dad let her go to muggle secondary school and he coaches her in magic privately my whole point is i ve seen the things she wears to her formal dances and stuff i also know what a nightmare it is being dragged round to help shop for them or in my case carry bags he grimaced and lily laughed you have an interesting family my family is all like me insane you bet rolling her eyes lily moved on ok so we have to sort that out later uh decorations james groaned cantwe just take a five minute break that was a very long piece of family history i just had to tell you lily gave him a mock angry look and then sighed fine she slid down in her chair and stretched out do you know what sirius is planning for the contest finals she asked suddenly no dontthink he even thought about it yet to be honest james let the chair fall forward again why planning to leak secrets to sapphire maybe james sighed dramatically you know it a pity i wasnt chosen i had a costume all planned lily raised an eyebrow oh really what james dean james shot her another mischievous grin i can just see myself as a rebel without a cause hmm lily cocked her head yeah i can just see you in a tight white t shirt and blue jeans she laughed pity he was a raving homosexual who was almost certainly hiv positive she grinned wickedly unless you re trying to tell me something about you and sirius and all the girls are just decoys james put a hand to his heart in mock horror alas you ve discovered my deepest darkest secret woe betide us all uh james dontsay stuff like that it just worries me lily was wiping tears of laughter from her eyes actually you just created a rather sickening mental image are you sure you dontneed therapy always have done once again the room resounded with their laughter a n short chapter nods yeah i know a little it necessary though you ll see next time i update in the meantime review puppydog face readers recoil in disgust okay fine so that didntwork i order you to go review me excuse the fact that this sounds incredibly overbearing the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you kudos to jkr since i copied some bits out of cos for authenticity in this chapter a n thank you guys all so much for your reviews it nice to know i haventbeen forgotten i would do review thank yous but if this fic gets taken down again for anything it wontbe going up again so i wontrisk it read on note this chapter contains one reference to pg 13 mild r rated content dontread it if you dontlike things like that chapter 15 and ten steps back at seven in the morning a few days later an alarm clock went off a hand emerged from under the blankets to turn it off translation bang it vigorously until it shut up and the figure of a dishevelled redhead rose up realising what time it was she dressed quickly and made her way to the common room she sank into a comfortable chair and tried hard not to fall back into slumber five minutes passed shaking herself awake she walked to the foot of the boys dormitory stairs and called up them james there was no response frowning she tried again a few minutes later james a pair of fourth years passing through gave her a curious look but there was no response from the person she was calling sighing she sat down and waited for a further five minutes before groaning getting up and going up the stairs making her way towards the seventh year dorm she smiled guiltily to herself as she retraced her steps from a week and a half ago she knocked lightly on the door hello footsteps sounded across the dorm who is it sirius called lily can i come in there was a muffled yelp presumably from peter and sirius called back hurriedly no don t peter isntquite uh presentable yet to her amusement lily could hear him muttering to peter no you idiot just put some trousers on and then get rid of the dungbombs push the fireworks under remus bed yeah and the ink pellets sirius lily called trying hard not to laugh in case you didntrealise i can hear every word you say so unless you want to give me the advantage of blackmail i would suggest you shut up and did what i wanted damn sirius muttered he exhaled loudly ok lily what do you want is james awake no he s lily heard sirius crossing the room and there was a rattle of curtains being drawn back fast asleep can you wake him up please remind him that we ve got lily looked at her watch fifteen minutes to go deliver the plans to mcgonagall before breakfast she heard bedsprings creaking and sirius slightly more stifled voice james wake up oi prongs mate you ve got company our lovely head girl is standing outside a few seconds of silence then sirius called out he not waking up lily groaned then do something anything strip the covers off him pour cold water on him whatever it takes there was the sound of something falling to the floor and a moment later lily heard a tap open sirius sounded more hesitant when he replied this time pete just stripped the covers but obviously he finds it comfortable even when his whole upper half soaking still asleep lils sorry arrgh lily made a noise of frustration she thought for a few moments sirius you can hear me fairly clearly right yeah came the bemused reply good lily took a deep breath james potter get your lazy arse out of bed this instant a second year emerging from a dormitory further down the hall gave her a scandalised look she smiled apologetically sorry just trying to wake up a lazy head boy the boy gave her a strange look and scuttled off quickly lily sighed well she asked impatiently i definitely heard you and i pretty sure the whole tower did too but jamesie here didn t he was chuckling as he spoke peter was laughing too always knew you had the language in you lily i sure james would have been glad to know that he was the one who brought it out he called oh trust me lily said darkly he brought it out plenty of times before this sirius sighed i am helping you out for the sole reason that i dontintend to be blackmailed into being nice to snivellus for a month or into scrubbing the transfiguration classroom remember that there was a creak again and then sirius began yelling james lily and i have declared our undying love for eachother we re going to get married tomorrow and then we re going to have wild sweaty animal sex day and night for the next two weeks on our honeymoon in the caribbean sirius lily cried you are so dead i thought it would be worth it to see the look on his face when he woke up sirius called innocently only problem with that was that he didntwake up is the boy completely deaf peter shocked voice sounded lily breathed deeply and slowly trying to stay calm what am i going to do she asked frustratedly i cantgo alone we re both meant to hand the stuff in and i now have she checked her watch seven minutes to go down here she slumped against the door and slid down into a sitting position against it inside the dorm there was silence lily could almost hear peter and sirius shrugging helplessly at each other i cantbelieve i going to say this she said at last resignedly james if you get yourself out here in less than five minutes i will kiss you there was a brief pause as sirius relayed the message by yelling it into james ear sounding more than a little shocked as he did so seconds later there was an answering flurry of movement and peter whooped way to go lily you ve really lit a fire under him if i d known he reacted this fast to this kind of bribery i would have used it years ago james disgusted voice sounded padfoot never never try bribing me with a kiss from you exactly three minutes and twenty seconds later the door opened and lily fell backwards onto a pair of shoes james grinned as he hauled her up his hair tousled and his t shirt looking like it had gone years without knowing the touch of an iron ow she complained rubbing her back you could have warned me your trainers hurt to fall onto sorry said james not looking sorry at all now i believe you promised me something oh yeah lily said she caught sight of peter and sirius hovering just inside the dormitory and pulled the door firmly shut no audiences fair enough how come you ignore everything except the last offer i have selective hearing james smirked besides kisses from girls like you are not something you come by every day and flattery will not get you round me lily said although she was half smiling she stood on tiptoe grabbed his arm and pressed a kiss to his lips well that was what was supposed to happen in theory at least the reality was that lily stood on tiptoe put one hand on his arm to steady herself and used the other to bring his face closer to hers and pressed her lips briefly to his cheek deed done hey james complained i never said where i would kiss you lily said merrily she looked at the time oh god we have to go one minute she started running down the corridor the plans hollered james as he chased after her i got them from the head rooms just now before i came up to find you lily tossed over her shoulder as she scrambled out of the portrait hole damn early risers james thought as he screeched to a halt and knocked lily over outside the transfiguration classroom having handed in three scrolls of parchment to an only slightly irate professor mcgonagall lily and james made their way to the great hall for breakfast sapphire gave them a smile as they walked past while emma looked determinedly in the other direction it was when lily sat down that she realized how very strangely sirius was behaving he and remus were sitting at one end and sirius was laughing madly at something while remus plainly trying to ignore him had his nose buried in a book jamesie sirius guffawed and lily pulled a few slices of toast onto her plate betcha that what your mum calls you when no one around jamesie dear come get your tea like a good little boy he chortled and james rolled his eyes how much sugar has he had he asked remus hmm remus said absently he looked up at sirius then james is that including or not including the two packs of bertie botts our entire stash of chocolate frogs and all that toffee your mum sent him last week bloody hell james said sugar high he explained briefly to lily this is why it a bad idea to let him loose in honeydukes meanwhile sirius had picked up the orange that lily had been peeling and pulled it apart segment he said cheerily holding one up isntthat a sexy word come on say it with me segment seg ment told you he was a demented maniac remus said as he turned a page lily turned to remus remus have you uh talked to emma recently remus looked up again no not really i ve got a funny feeling she avoiding me because i around lily finished i really sorry dontbe remus took a sip of orange juice it up to her to choose what she does dontbe silly sirius snorted the only reason they arenttalking is because of a minor disagreement isntit what is it now remmie poo sleeping positions he giggled madly remus eyed him in disgust and moved away towards james doesntshe know that werewolves like it doggy style there was silence james head had shot up and he was staring in undisguised horror at sirius remus was still looking down at his book though the sudden tenseness of his body showed that he had clearly stopped reading a confused look crossed sirius face oops james looked furious his hazel eyes darkened and a thunderous look on his face showed that he was evidently getting ready to launch into a furious tirade but remus spoke first i suppose you know now he put his book down carefully marking the page and looked at lily she shrugged i already guessed she said at this james turned round to look at her his face now betraying his surprise how disappearing once a month always around the full moon those stories you always told us about where you went the way you looked so ill before and after the way the boggart changed into a moon in third year when it saw you the way you hate silver lily shrugged again it was obvious when i put it all together remus was pale but still sounded calm have you told anybody lily shook her head no and i dontintend to either although i dontsee what their problem is they look at me and see a monster remus tone was dejected to say the least but i don t lily got up and climbed over james to sit down beside remus and put a hand on his shoulder i look at you and i see nothing but a friend a friend who kind clever caring funny and a friend who definitely ranks among one of my best i see someone who was one of those there for me when i needed them look at me remus unwillingly remus raised his eyes to hers i dontcare about what you turn into once a month i care about you there was a very pregnant pause thanks remus said in a low voice it wasntmuch of a statement but lily knew he meant it i telling you that just proved it girls are statistically better at charms than boys lily argued as she walked out of the classroom no it does not maybe we were just having a bad lesson james shot back they had been having this discussion all the way through charms the class had been set a particularly complex form of emotion charm to practice and strangely enough many girls had found it easier than boys did giving rise to the aforementioned argument seriously if you look it up you ll see that 72 of girls gained an e or above for owl and newt level charms compared to only 23 of oh dontthrow statistics at me they re just a bunch of numbers and i dropped arithmancy after fifth year besides you donteven know what i got what did you get then an e i impressed lily said dryly but the fact remains that girls are just better at charms and especially types of emotion charms because they re more in touch with their own emotions that a load of crap i totally in touch with my emotions so do you discuss the way you feel about problems and things with your friends because when we do that you call us girly i not girly by this time remus sirius and peter had given up trying to change the conversation and had walked on ahead well then there you are you arent in touch yes i am i ll have you know that i discuss a lot of deep things with remus and sirius and peter oh yeah i ve heard some of the deep things you discuss lily snorted let me see there peter i saw you changing your sheets in the middle of the night you had a wet dream lily mimicked sirius tone of voice perfectly and how about so what exactly goes on in this working relationship all at once she realised her mistake oh hell oh bloody hell what have i done one glance at james told her that it hadntpassed him by either he was frowning his eyes narrowed at her where did you hear that we wouldnthave said anything like that in front of you lily tried to laugh it off i suppose i must have been walking behind you and overheard james shook his head and looked even more suspiciously at her no anything like that would have stayed up in the dorms his eyes widened lily could see him putting two and two together and to her horror they were making four sirius said those things a while ago and the only people were us and keegan and keegan his voice was almost a whisper lily please tell me that you didntturn into keegan lily couldnttrust herself to speak she looked away james interpreted her silence correctly abruptly he too turned away i dontbelieve it i wont believe it he turned back and expression in his eyes that she had never seen before hurt anger disbelief and something else she couldntidentify you you took polyjuice lily said numbly james simply looked at her lily found her voice again james you have to understand i didntdo it for myself i did it for she stopped short she couldntbetray emma even if she had wanted to who lily james spat who d you do it for he took a step closer as she backed up and lily realized again as if for the first time how tall and imposing he was his eyes had gone incredibly dark and he was glaring down at her come on tell me he shouted and his voice echoed down the corridor but no one would hear they were all at dinner lily flinched as he took another step forward and she found herself up against the wall was this for emma or sapphire or was it just some bloody dare that you planned out or better yet was it just you wanting to do a check on our room what the fuck made you want to betray our friendship like this his eyes showed plainly how furious he was and they were trained on lily with all the intensity of a spotlight i canttell lily struggled with herself to just admit the truth but she couldn t she couldntexpose emma oh right so that all you have to say you spy on us listen to all the things that we say to each other in confidence then use our friendship when we try to help you and you canttell for god sake this isnta game using people and eavesdropping arent bloody games james was so near now that she felt enclosed on all sides by his rage lily head was beginning to swim she breathed unevenly sensing how close he was to her how near his face was to hers even though their robes werent touching werenteven brushing each other she felt as though she was caught up in a straitjacket by him and every time she breathed in all she could take in was his intoxicating cologne the cold stone wall gave her no escape either from him or from her own flushed cheeks let me just understand this you ve spent all these years telling my friends and i that we re bullies and prats and players and that we use people talk about hypocritical james please lily could feel a lump in her throat as his gaze bored straight through her dont james please me you re the one who fucked up lily wanted to sink into the floor and die james looked dangerously angry his eyes dark pools of emotion were holding her gaze and a pure unadulterated fury was emanating from them striking her to the very core james i ve told myself this a hundred times please you couldntmake me feel any worse i so sorry you think sorry is going to change anything you think it going to erase my mind get out your wand and o bliviate me if you think that his eyes were blazing with suppressed emotion when he spoke again however his voice was back to a normal volume but cold as cold as ice it was almost worse than when he was yelling the single reason that i not going to tell remus or sirius is that i ve never seen remus so happy as he is when he with emma and i dontwant to ruin that it already ruined but i would rather have a hundred remuses and siriuses than one of you i cantbelieve i spent four years following you he looked her up and down in an expression that was close to loathing maybe you re not the girl i thought you were tears finally spilled over lily paled cheeks as james walked away wait she cried but it was too late he had turned the corner moments later she heard a crack as he punched or kicked a wall and a loud fuck she leant back against the wall trying to push back the ball of misery that was threatening to erupt a slight movement made her look round and she saw emma standing at the other end of the corridor shock written plainly all over her face it was too much sucking in a soft sob she raced away down the passages towards toe heads room where she flung herself onto a sofa and buried her face in a pillow to muffle all sound bitterly she cried a n sorry this chapter took so long to get up personal issues meant i wasnton the computer long enough to edit and proof it before i could post it i just want to say that i support the great break and although i going to continue posting here because i only just started reposting i fairly sure that most of you have heard of sarinileni horrible treatment by this site the great break is against the unfair no questions asked removal of story policy and they have my full support what this site does is completely unjust and if they want to have such a big site they should be able to run it in a way that is appropriate and fair the way they handle their administration right now is turning away a lot of good authors i ve had first hand experience of it and what makes it worse is that they add insult to injury by being incapable of even responding to polite emails questioning removal i suggest checking out sarinileni profile or solarism s if you want more information fight the unfair policies now that all the unpleasantness has been mentioned feel like leaving a review the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you a n thank you guys all so much for your reviews it nice to know i haventbeen forgotten i would do review thank yous but if this fic gets taken down again for anything it wontbe going up again so i wontrisk it read on chapter 16 solitude when lily opened her eyes again it appeared to be morning the room was lit by a weak daylight that made the ever burning fire look even more enticing for a moment she wondered why she was feeling so miserable and then she remembered the events of last night awkwardly she pulled herself off the couch and went into her room where she surveyed the reflection in her mirror she looked a mess hair all over the place and red eyes from crying so much going into the adjacent bathroom that the head boy and girl shared although she doubted that james had discovered it she did her best to clean herself up and hoped that light make up would cover the evidence of a rough night as lily walked out of the rooms and down the corridor she wondered idly why she had cried so much over her fight with james when she had not so much as shed a tear over her argument with emma maybe it just that i was hit hard by going through another fight or maybe it just that i feel the loss of the marauders now because i know them she sighed as she pushed open the door to the great hall i am going to miss sirius splashing water at me to wake me up at breakfast though she thought sadly and remus helping me with homework and james james being james she stepped into the great hall which was just beginning to empty and made her way quietly over to the gryffindor table hoping to sit down unnoticed unfortunately sirius happened to look up at that exact moment lily over here he called jovially lily stopped short in her tracks his voice had alerted the last three people that she wanted to meet to her presence emma who had previously been studying a textbook looked up but then her head snapped back down again sapphire sitting next to her was eyeing her in concern the make up had obviously not done its job and was already half out of her seat james had stolen a glance at her but when she looked at him she could see him glowering at his cereal making a split second decision she turned on her heel and walked as coolly as she could back out of the hall rounding a corner she stood still and breathed in deeply maybe she would eat later breakfast turned out to be a preview of the rest of the day lily seriously considered skipping all her classes that day and hiding out in the heads rooms but in the end her more studious nature won out and she found herself down in the dungeons as usual potions was normally hell anyway because of professor stingrey who favoured his own house pupils almost to a fault but if it wasntfor tom jacobs who invited her to work in a three with him and keegan she would probably have walked straight out of the room unable to control herself herbology was not good either this was the one class that she took with emma alone and unlike the past lessons where she was used to ignoring emma she could sense her now looking at her with a hint of guilt no pity lily corrected herself sternly that was the only thing she could feel for her now now that the marauders were gone she arrived in charms early and parked her bag on the desk next to her hoping that this would indicate that no one was to sit there unfortunately although emma and james gave her a wide berth she looked up a few minutes before the bell to see tom face looming over her mind if i sit here he asked cheerily but what about lily began looking around then she saw keegan sitting on a side with a pretty ravenclaw brunette claire jaimeson talking animatedly she changed mid sentence yeah ok i suppose nice as the gesture was she was beginning to wonder why he had to be in all her classes that day finally lily was able to breathe a sigh of relief and escape to her head room after defence against the dark arts she sank into a chair and then pulled herself up remembering that the marauders were unlikely to swing by and drag her off to the kitchens today slowly she sneaked downstairs and entered the kitchens requesting an apple pie hi lils she started and turned round to see sirius sitting at a table behind chewing on a chicken sandwich he looked mildly surprised to see her there alone hey what re you doing here she accepted her food from a house elf and sat down opposite same as you what avoiding quidditch practice in the rain with james by saying i had detention and then avoiding homework in the common room with remus by saying i had a sore throat lily smiled ok maybe not i just hungry they chewed for a few moments in silence lily can i ask you something you just did she replied not taking her eyes off her plate yeah well something else what happened between you and james lily looked up sharply what did he tell you nothing but he been in a really weird mood all day either depressed or moody and he snapped at us every time we tried to ask him what was wrong i just figured that since you arenthanging around with us and what with the fact that both of you looked like you wanted to murder me this morning there was something going on you figured right lily said as lightly as she could manage she took another bite of pie and swallowed before speaking but i cantsay anything sirius studied her face for a moment well dontforget that remus and peter and me arentjames he said quietly he got up i d better go back before remus catches on to the fact that i not really in the hospital wing he said grinning at her see you around despite herself lily grinned back and he left the kitchens washing down her pie with a glass of water lily left as well feeling only slightly more comforted by the end of the next day lily was ready to admit defeat she had not felt so shunned for a long time although remus and sirius gave her a smile whenever they saw her she could not help but feel rather low now that she had the enmity of four people in her class alone then there were the marauder groupies namely girls who followed the four boys around like hounds with their tongues hanging out although they had maintained a fairly regular neutrality to her for most of the year so far and then become sickeningly sweet during her brief respite with the marauders they now acted like she was a witch a witch in a world full of suspicious muggles whispers followed her like dogs as the news that she was not with the marauders spread like wildfire until lily was heartily sick of it let them talk she thought sourly and she walled herself up in her room where she tried to work and ignore the pangs of loneliness coming from the bundle of misery that seemed to have gained a permanent home lodged in her chest she was carrying a pile of books with the top one open so that she could read as she walked back to the heads rooms from the library she was so engrossed in trying to understand the complex transfiguration that james helped had been helping her with that she walked straight into someone looking up startled she saw that she had bumped into literally james mumbling her apologies she bent down to pick up the books lying on the floor expecting him to walk on instead his trainers stood in front of her for several seconds before he too bent down and began to gather things into a neat pile risking an involuntary glance at his face lily saw his expression twisted between pretended indifference and an emotion that she did not want to identify thanks she said as she stood dusting her skirt down self consciously she rebalanced her books in her arms waiting for him to go but for one moment she thought he was going to say something to her his mouth opened and he took a breath as if to speak but then it snapped shut again and he dodged past her and walked off without a word shrugging to herself lily opened her book and began to read and walk again it was best to distract herself from the stinging sensation behind her eyes and the lump in her throat reaching the masks she rested her chin on the books to keep them from falling as she stretched for the nose lily she was so unused to hearing people call for her that it took a moment for the call to register when it did she turned round sapphire was standing at the end of the corridor hey saffy she said quietly sapphire ran up and grabbed her wrist lily you have to come huh lily looked perplexed please lils just come on sapphire looked strangely excited but my books can wait who cares about your books lily please you need to come this is really important lily allowed herself to be dragged off by sapphire who led her down corridors looking feverishly excited until they reached the fat lady chizpurfle she said quickly and the fat lady swung obligingly open to admit them sapphire pulled lily over to the girls stairs when sirius bounded up in front of them boo he said cheerfully and here a rare sight our lily of the valley actually in the common room for once with sapphire of the valley he considered for a moment no that doesntsound right sapphire in the mud suits you more it was a mark of how distracted sapphire was that she actually responded to him instead of ignoring him as per usual get lost sirius go to manchester go to italy go to pakistan for all i care just go away from me she shoved him roughly aside and continued upstairs lily in tow sapphire pushed the door open impatiently and pulled lily inside she came in wondering what sapphire wanted her to do in an empty dorm and then stopped dead in the middle of the room emma had stood up awkwardly her hands clasped nervously in front of her lily looked at sapphire is this why you wanted me to come sapphire opened her mouth but lily didntwait for an answer well then i going she turned around and moved towards the door again lily i i sorry emma soft voice sounded through the silent room lily stopped in her tracks but did not turn back what for she asked in a harsh voice there was a brief pause lily was quite sure the other two could hear her breathing to her it sounded unnaturally loud for for everything emma said at last i sorry i talked you into the whole potion thing and i sorry i made you come between remus and me i even more sorry that i made sapphire choose between us and i sorry that i let james get angry with you she stopped lily dropped her head closed her eyes and sighed slowly she pivoted round and faced emma again sapphire was standing to a side her hands over her mouth taking a deep breath emma looked lily directly in the eye most of all i sorry that i fought with my best friend and wouldnttalk to her for two weeks over this lily did not know what to say she put her hands over her face and for a few minutes grappled with herself against the sob of relief that threatened to overcome her finally she was able to lower them and look at emma emma the word sounded strange in her mouth after all this time that she had not used it i i she stopped and swallowed i sorry too she forced herself to keep going i sorry i didntsay something when i should have emma looked at her hopefully friends always emma smiled shakily and held out her hand ignoring it lily launched herself at her and they hugged tightly sapphire burst into tears lily and emma broke apart lily looked at her in amazement there nothing to cry about now saffy she told her bewildered a n sound familiar like mother like son you two are so stupid sapphire half shouted tears falling down her cheeks oh come here emma said and the three of them locked each other into a tight hug three hours later emma lily and sapphire were still lying on their beds catching up in the way that only girls can do lily had filled the other two in on her brief interlude with the marauders and emma had admitted that although she had been feeling guilty for several days it had taken the scene between lily and james that she had witnessed to act as a catalyst and force her to face her having filled sapphire in on the brief details of that night they left the topic behind as lily did not want to dwell on it she could not manage to hide nor the others fail to notice her trembling lip and the way she blinked several times to keep the tears at bay later that evening lily was studying in the library it now seemed like heaven to work with friends done she announced jubilantly pushing her charms essay to a side yippee sapphire said sourly i still have six inches to do on this well i might as well start transfiguration seeing as i in study mode she bent down to search through her bag and emerged a few moments later looking flustered have either of you got my transfiguration textbook the other two shook their heads damn lily moaned it must be in the dorm i ll have to go get it just find one in here emma said lazily chewing her quill they re all the same yeah but i took extra notes to help me cause i doing so badly and they re in my textbook i need the help here so go get it sapphire mumbled flipping back and forth in her charms textbook be right back lily said she slid off her seat and made her way up to gryffindor tower climbing through the portrait hole she was about to mount the stairs when she heard voices yeah the alarm is the only thing stopping you from going up to the girls dorms isntit i mean there nothing to catch you once you re in lily turned ready to give whatever boy it was a piece of her mind her eyes lighted on none other than james and sirius talking intently their heads together as if feeling her look james head swivelled and his cold glance grazed her face the next moment he was looking back at sirius there could be no doubt that he had been the one talking feeling very small lily continued up the stairs she opened the door to her dorm walked in and began to search through the piles off books in her trunk having found the one she needed lily stood up and cast a cursory glance over her area before turning to go she never made it to the door two steps away she suddenly registered what it was that she had seen she spun round again and froze there lying on top of her pillow was a pink lily it looked innocent enough but lily could not help eyeing it suspiciously as she approached her bed again was this some kind of a prank she could think of no one in the female population of gryffindor who was around the level of the marauders throwing caution to the winds she picked it up carefully between finger and thumb so far so good it hadntexploded in her face she turned it admiring the delicate beauty held in the fragile pink petals she had no way of telling how long it had been here but it looked freshly picked a frown creased her brow again who was it from she turned to sit down on the bed once again and it was then that her eyes caught sight of the snow white card lying camouflaged on the pillow laying the flower aside she picked it up and opened it inside was a short message written in block capitals do you like the lily it beautiful isntit just like you lily stared at it who on earth would write this she studied the handwriting on the card the letters were so uniform that it would be impossible to compare with anybody normal handwriting yet there was an undeniably masculine quality about it and was that she brought the card to her nose and sniffed there was a very faint scent of cologne still hanging about the card boys what boy would break into the dorm just to leave a card and flower for her it was as though a light switch had suddenly been flipped on in her brain words replayed themselves in lily head the alarm is the only thing stopping you from going up to the girls dorms isntit there nothing to catch you once you re in the words ran over and over like a broken record the alarm is the only thing stopping you from going up to the girls dorms isntit there nothing to catch you once you re in nothing to catch you once you re in could it really have been james lily thought but why is he making up when i the one who did something wrong it was a sweet gesture but would he really do it in this secretive way it certainly sounded like it was him but then again not quite he was very upfront most of the time why hide about this realising suddenly that she had been away far too long to have just got a textbook lily shoved the card under her pillow away from serena prying eyes hastily filled a glass with water for the flower grabbed her book and ran debating how to put it to emma and sapphire maybe i ll thank james tomorrow she thought she was walking down the charms corridor her footsteps echoed through the apparently empty passage as torchlight flickered dimly on the walls eventually she saw an open door and peered round it wondering who would be there two shadowy figures moved on the opposite wall and the sound of male laughter rang finally gathering the courage to look in with her wand at the ready she saw sirius and remus watching a rat on the floor as it chased its tail in a circle hey guys she tried to say in relief the words did not seem to reach them however but dissolve into the air instead she tried again only to be met with the same result and for some reason she could not manage to move past the doorway and neither did sirius or remus notice her worried about what was going on she gave up and walked on rounding a corner she came across sapphire and emma talking together seated on a bench that she could not remember as being in the middle of the corridor i dontunderstand why he does it to me especially sapphire was saying it not like i ever did anything to him who sirius lily tried to say but once again the words seemed to disappear somewhere between her mouth and their ears angry now she reached forward to tap emma on the shoulder but her hand went straight through her and she found herself pulling her arm out of what seemed to be nothing but a shapeless grey mist frustrated and panicky she had no choice but to continue forwards suddenly professor mcgonagall loomed out of nowhere looking furious miss evans i am thoroughly displeased with you i thought that the head girl would at least keep up an acceptable grade on newt transfiguration a d is not acceptable this merits punishment but i lily began to protest but she had no time her feet began to carry her forwards faster and faster until she gained so much momentum that she was sure she would crash if she stopped against her will she ran down a twisting corridor that did not seem to have any end on and on she ran gasping for breath not knowing where she was going finally she found herself slowing down and ran through a doorway that seemed like many other things to have come from nowhere she had entered a stone classroom set out as if in the middle of a lesson with books and parchment strewn all over the desks several chairs were knocked over and desks were out of place as if the people in it had been desperate in their hurry to get out lily backed away nervously wondering what horror had terrified them whether it was coming for her as well and where it would come from if it did she swiveled round and breathed in sharply in front of the teacher desk was a vortex glowing green it looked eerie but suddenly lily let out a gasp of horror and rushed over james she cried frantically help lily he groaned his eyes shut as he fought to stay up his arms flailing wildly to keep him up in what appeared to be green light grab my hand lily yelled she threw herself full length on the floor and stretched a hand in to reach him but it wasntquite enough come on she grunted furiously and she stretched even further praying she would make it for one long moment she watched her face contorted with effort as james opened his eyes briefly and the pure terror shone through just a bit further the vortex was pulling at her now too her other arm was curled tightly around the leg of the teacher desk damn it she growled and she moved herself even further to reach down down into the emerald green depths finally she felt the slightest brush of skin and a moment later james fingers clasped round her own a flash of green light blinded her white fog obscured all her senses seeming to simply materialize out of thin air out of the mist came a man voice shouting panicking it was james voice lily take harry and go it him go run i ll hold him off what was going on who was harry and why did she seem to be in a house with james lily had no time to ponder these questions because all at once the fog cleared abruptly into a small room decorated and furnished as a child nursery complete with a rocking chair blankets a cot and a quidditch motif on the walls lily found herself standing in a corner her gaze transfixed on a woman with long red hair backing against the wall all at once lily realized with a sudden jolt that the woman was her an older version certainly but still the same person she was attempting to shield a small bundle of blankets with her body but was still trying to stand tall lily could not see the shadow in the doorway she could not move her head but the terror was clear on her older self the shadow advanced and her older self clutched the blankets tighter still tears running down her cheeks not harry not harry please not harry stand aside you silly girl stand aside now not harry please no take me kill me instead with another sickening jolt lily realized that the bundle of blankets was actually a baby wrapped tightly her older self was flat against the wall the anguish clear on her face as she begged heartrendingly for mercy the shadow was laughing now at the rivers of tears on her cheeks as she hugged the child to her chest unyieldingly laughing a cruel high pitched laugh as it came forward raising its wand and in a moment of utmost horror and shock lily realized that he was going to murder them no she tried to cry though she knew it would be no use they could not hear her she tried to move forward desperately working against the invisible bonds that held her in place tried to stop it but there was another flash of green light and cruel laughter lily sat up drenched in cold sweat it took her a moment to recollect where she was she looked around at the familiar dormitory and let the calm silence broken only by the soft even breathing of four other girls invade her ears soothing her body wrapping her arms around her body she hugged herself tightly rocking back and forth on her bed it had been so vivid when she touched her skin it felt ice cold the dream had completely unnerved her but one resolve had come out of it she knew now what she had to do a n chapter 16 reposted feel like leaving a review the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you a n thank you guys all so much for your reviews it nice to know i haventbeen forgotten i would do review thank yous but if this fic gets taken down again for anything it wontbe going up again so i wontrisk it apologies for the lateness of the chapter i working on something else which now needs only to be fully typed up its already half done before it can go up the next chapter of this will be sooner i swear chapter 17 things that go bump in the night cautiously lily crawled to the edge of her bed and looked around four sleeping bodies lay on their respective beds the feeble light of the crescent moon filtered in through the window lighting the room faintly slowly lily slid off her bed and stood up noiselessly she moved carefully towards the door praying that she would not tread on any creaky boards her hand on the door handle she suddenly froze as there was an incoherent mumble and turning round she saw callie roll over she held her breath until she was sure she could hear four sets of even breathing again and then gently eased the door open and slipped past it she trod lightly as she walked down the carpeted corridor in her bare feet keeping to the shadows never mind the fact that she was wearing nothing but a simple vest top that had fitted her when she had been more flat chested in second year but was now a little too tight and short and a pair of crumpled pyjama bottoms never mind the fact that she had no specific idea of what she was going to do or say never mind the fact that there would be serious repercussions if she was caught going to the boys dorms in the middle of the night especially with the head girl thing she had a purpose and she was going to see it through she breathed a sigh of relief as she reached the common room thank god she murmured stealing across the deserted room which was lit only by the dying embers of the fire and pale glimmers of moonlight she entered the staircase to the boys dorms and began to climb eventually after moving at an agonisingly slow pace she gained the top and sneaked furtively along the corridor to the end checking down the corridor once more she raised her hand and knocked quietly on the wooden door praying that someone inside would hear it she did not have long to wait a few minutes later the door edged open and james face appeared looking tired but wary who is he began but then he saw lily oh it you without further ado he made to close the door again but lily took a hasty step forward and jammed her foot into the gap between door and frame james i need to talk to you she hissed james looked at her coldly your foot in the way he tried to push the door further but lily recklessly moved herself forward so that he could not do anything else please she said slightly louder evans you re going to wake the whole house if you dontshut up and get going lily blinked at the cold way in which he pronounced her last name but could not let herself become fazed i dont care she said firmly seeing that she was serious in her intentions james had no choice but to step outside and close the door softly behind him he crossed his arms and focused on a point somewhere behind lily the soft dying torchlight throwing his face into sharp relief even thought lily was determined to do something about the situation she could not help the silent exclamation that rose up as she realised that he was only wearing a pair of pyjama bottoms shit who knew james was hiding a body like this although not usually in the habit of swearing she felt justified in her choice of words as during the few seconds of intense silence she took in the sight before her her mind had gone totally blank although not overly muscled like a wrestler he had a lean toned physique and lily could see the muscles in his chest flexing as he breathed dear god no wonder girls throw themselves at his feet they d be even worse if they knew about this what was i going to say blinking she attempted to remember what she had planned to do oh well at least i not the only one wearing next to nothing she tried once again to shake herself out of her reverie and focused instead on james face it was completely impassive but there was a flicker of movement about the mouth that suggested that he was making an effort to keep it that way he leaned against the wall his arms still crossed in a position that was so familiar to lily and so reminiscent of happier times that she felt a rush of emotion james i know you re you re angry probably furious with me and i can see why but i know what happened james interrupted his face was a cold mask emma told me yesterday so you know about i know it all then there only one thing i can say lily fought to control her voice james i sorry i so sorry i didnt want to do it in the first place but then emma begged me and i felt so awful afterwards because i didntfollow my own instincts when i knew what was right i just i sorry she tried desperately to get behind his closed expression i cantjust sit here and ignore the the destruction of a friendship james reached for the doorknob and lily wondered in a corner of her mind why the few metres between them felt like a few miles is that all you have to say no you have to believe me it was only when lily put her hand to her face and found her cheeks wet that she realised she was crying please she repeated softly i so sorry there was a silence lily eyes were rapidly becoming blurry with tears that she tried to blink back instead she watched james face he looked at her and then up at the ceiling as if in thought i thought there was something wrong with keegan that day he said at last quietly it was like he was out of it i didntrealise how out at the time and that whole story he you fed me about falling over he closed his eyes for a moment and then opened them to look at the girl in front of him tell me something lily if you hadntlet it slip so that i found out would you have told me about it lily studied the floor for a moment and then looked up i think eventually yes she said honestly not straight away but i wouldnthave been able to keep it quiet forever it was driving me mad as it was she kept her chin up as james hazel eyes scrutinised her seriously at least you re telling the truth now he said okay really lily couldntbelieve her ears she had begun to think that this was a lost cause i wontforget but i ll forgive you he half smiled at her completely forgetting herself lily crossed the distance between them and in a wave of emotion threw her arms around him and hugged him burying her face in his chest she tried to take an unsteady breath but found instead that she was sobbing unevenly so relieved that something she have given up for lost was not there was a moment pause and then she felt his muscular arms move hesitantly around her waist and wrap around her in return his chest shifted beneath her as he let out a long breath that ruffled her hair as he bent his head over hers they must have stood like that for almost five minutes a pair of unmoving statues with their arms tightly around each other until lily quiet sobs began to subside eventually james let go of lily and took a step back we should go back he said if you re caught he didntneed to finish the sentence the implication of what could happen hung heavily in the air yeah lily said she felt as if a huge weight had been removed from her shoulders friends friends lily smiled at him night james she turned to go night lily came the quiet reply she crept down the stairs again hearing the slight open and close of a door behind her reaching her own dormitory she climbed carefully into bed thankful to see that all her roommates were still in deep slumber and drifted off into the most peaceful sleep she had had in days sapphire was in a bad mood it could have been because she had stayed up late the night before finishing a complicated chart for astronomy or it could have been because her bag broke while she was heading for her first lesson the next day splattering indelible ink all over said astronomy chart it could have been because professor stingrey took twenty points off her by finding fault with her puffapod leaves shredded not sliced miss heathleigh are you such an imbecile that you do not understand the distinction or because of the grade she was given for her charms essay a p with the comment not up to your usual standards miss heathleigh sirius jeers when she tripped over his feet in a most undignified manner in the great hall at lunch sending her books flying and ripping a big hole in her robes from the table did not help walk much heathleigh he questioned innocently all in all it had been a very bad day consequently by the time dinner was over both emma and lily were guiltily glad when sapphire told them she was going to have an early night and stalked off muttering dark things under her breath about evil people in the world directed mainly at sirius and professor stingrey it was clear that emma wanted to talk to remus so lily walked off and found a quiet table in the library as usual where she managed to flounder her way through a mound of essays at nine o clock madam pince began to shoo everyone out extinguishing the lamps as she went lily packed up and left suddenly as she was walking lily remembered the lily i meant to thank james for that she realised the two of them had not done more than exchange a few words between classes but it was enough to assure remus sirius and peter that things were now back to normal which was why sirius lost no time in dipping the ends of her hair into an ink bottle earning himself several hard slaps and a red handprint on his cheek for a few hours she determined to do something about it as she entered the common room and looked around for james she saw his familiar hair over by the fire chatting to his friends while lazily lobbing scrap parchment into the flames and started towards him but just then someone called her name lily caught unawares she turned wondering who would be calling her so eagerly she did not know who or what she had expected to see but it certainly wasnttom grinning at her she tried to control her surprise and smile hey tom how re you doing tom seemed slightly over nice for someone who had not spoken to her much for the past six years good tired but good tom took a step forward and lily unconsciously leaned back a little did you like the flower he asked lowering his voice conspiratorially for a moment lily didntrealise what he was talking about huh the flower you know the lily i did leave it on your pillow didnti slowly his words registered in her brain james had not left the flower he had she stared at him in shock it was you tom grinned yeah it took a bit of doing i had to ask james about the security on the girls dorms and he said he would double check with sirius as well i mean those two should know from all the rumours that are around and then i had to work out which bed was yours i did put it on yours right y yeah lily managed to get out her head was whirling in a maelstrom of confused thoughts and she was finding it twice as hard to focus on tom words so um anyway i just wanted to say that everything on that card was true i i do think you re pretty tom stumbled over his words you ve grown up a lot over the last few years and you ve got a really nice personality he added hurriedly and i know i really bad at compliments and pick up lines and chatting you up in general b but my point is do you want to you know meet up some time like for a walk or something it took a few minutes for all of this to absorb into lily she was fully aware that she must have been standing there gaping like a fish but she was powerless to do anything about it eventually she found her voice um thanks can i think about it and get back to you sure tom said looking slightly disappointed so see you around see you lily smiled weakly and walked across the common room she had reached the foot of her stairs when she made a split second decision swivelling around she walked straight back up to tom tom i would love to meet up with you tom looked both surprised and delighted great are you free this weekend yeah sunday afternoon see you then she smiled at him and retraced her footsteps as she passed the marauders and all at once she felt the rush of adrenaline evaporate her eyes met james and her smile faded as his face originally lit up with laughter morphed into a look of confusion at her expression turning her head she walked quickly on determined to wake up sapphire a n the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you a n thank you guys all so much for your reviews it nice to know i haventbeen forgotten i would do review thank yous but if this fic gets taken down again for anything it wontbe going up again so i wontrisk it warning this chapter contains some explicit language you have been cautioned chapter 18 week from hell the next week was completely hellish for the entire seventh year professor flitwick who was usually known for being reasonably easygoing came up with the bright idea of having a mock newt exam with both practical and theory so that the students would be able to see how they were doing most unfortunately many other teachers soon caught onto the idea and soon all the gryffindor seventh years could be seen studying feverishly in the common room that weekend for exams in charms transfiguration defence against the dark arts herbology in lily and emma case astronomy in sapphire case and potions james was examining his muggle studies textbook looking very much as though he would like nothing better than to blow it up explosively while remus reread his ancient runes notes over and over again and sirius recited lists of facts about clabberts for care of magical creatures as peter tried desperately to find patterns in sticks thrown haphazardly over the floor in preparation for divination lily too was tempted to go and jump in the lake when she looked through her transfiguration notes and complex models stared her right back in the face argh she groaned this will never work shut up sirius said breaking off in the middle of his list clabberts have a red pustule that beside him emma yawned widely making no attempt to hide it i give up she said sleepily to the group at large if i do terribly tomorrow i dontcare i going to bed anyone coming sapphire rolled up her star charts looking relieved i was waiting for someone to say that so that i wouldntlook like the only lazy one hey emma complained swatting her lightly coming lily uh yeah in a minute lily slumped over her book as the other two walked off it feels like every time one thing sinks in another fifty sink out lily just go to bed live a little fail your exam sirius gave her a wicked grin lily did not grin back unfortunately for you mr black i am going to fail transfiguration so i need a decent grade in herbology to make up for it you re not going to fail james said lifting his head from his book to look at her we went over everything last week you re fine with it you just donttrust yourself right now you ll be great when you do the test sirius smirked his clabbert notes apparently forgotten what exactly is uh everything lily stared at him her eyebrows raised sirius my temper is on a very short leash right now she bit out coolly i also have several sharp objects in my bag dontmake me use them on you i would hate for you to be unable to experience the joys of parenthood god sirius mock whispered as lily packed away her books talk about pmsing actually that not for three weeks lily said sweetly she turned around to face sirius noting his gob smacked expression for future amusement when this is all over remind me to explain the exact meaning of pms maybe then you wontuse the expression quite so freely night remus james peter she waved at tom in another corner as she passed him by and disappeared up the stairs way to wind her up padfoot remus said as he examined a rune chart sirius turned around still looking slightly shocked and remus glanced up and grinned i think he just got more than he bargained for callie was the first seventh year to give way under the pressure she burst into loud hysterical tears on tuesday during the defence against the dark arts theory exam and had to be led out sobbing rather over dramatically lily thought sapphire looked close to doing the same thing after a particularly stressful day on wednesday as professor stingrey breathed down their necks while they tried to make a fire resistance potion seeing her expression as they came out lily dragged her out to the quidditch pitch and told her to just scream and let all the tension out soon both girls shouts were echoing through the air and lily was able to lead a much more cheerful sapphire back in for dinner it was on friday that disaster struck the first section of the morning was given to quiet study in the common room where most of the occupants alternately revised and daydreamed of the evening when exams would be over after break however was their charms practical exam they entered the room and sat down only to have professor flitwick announce squeakily that he would be putting them into pairs with someone they had not worked with before lily was paired with flynn spencer a rather quiet and shy boy from ravenclaw despite tom hopeful glances at her she was able to go through the lesson feeling fairly relaxed as charms was one of her better subjects sapphire however was paired with sirius and it was hard to say who looked more unhappy about this by the time the bell went sirius looked royally pissed off and sapphire wore a thunderous expression that could have started world war three flitwick released them at last and people began to head for the door tom hung back to wait for lily but she perceiving with alarm sapphire narrowed eyes and set mouth waved him on mouthing i ll catch up later she and emma joined the queue to get outside just behind the marauders once they were outside sirius turned to sapphire well i suppose i have you to thank you to thank for a failing grade in charms me you re the one who couldnteven manage a simple glamour charm it just a damn illusion over the face it not that hard like you were any better mine disguised part of your face sapphire shot back yours didnteven get that far and the whole silencing charm thing that owl level for god sake pity that didntwork it would have shut you up you think you re so great so says little miss i think i m all that hey hey james tried to intervene why dontwe shut up both sirius and sapphire yelled as one at him they resumed glaring at each other you are so dumb likewise to you arsehole slapper prat tart excuse me sapphire stared at him look at your skirt sapphire looked down at herself then up again this is my school skirt you prick so why it so short does it matter to you dickhead my dick does have a head actually sirius smirked at his own crude humour not that you ll ever find out sapphire looked at him in disgust pervert bitch you are such a scatterbrained idiot it must be all that chicken you eat that pathetic you eat it too sirius said angrily sapphire raised an eyebrow do i i a vegetarian black strange how you ve been in the same house and year as me for nearly seven years and still dontknow that did your mother never teach you about the importance of observation sirius went almost white and his face contorted into an expression of fury lily and emma stared in horror he looked as though he was about to hit her screw you no screw you sirius made a rude gesture at her and sapphire responded in kind before turning her back on him and stalking off sirius glared daggers at her retreating figure before setting off at a fast walk in the opposite direction lily emma remus and james were left in the middle of the corridor looking helplessly at each other remus sighed you know one day we ll probably be sitting around and laughing our heads off about this emma finished exactly but until then lily began looking resigned to her fate see you they all said in unison and remus and james darted down the corridor after sirius while lily and emma hurried after sapphire they caught her up in a passage near the great hall muttering furiously under her breath good for nothing fucked up bastard who needs a life hey isntthat a bit harsh emma admonished as they fell into step with her he not that bad sapphire looked at her and raised an eyebrow did i see him calling you a tart or a slapper neither emma nor lily could reply face it sapphire said bitterly throwing the door to the great hall open he an arrogant git who deserves to rot in hell and that that after lunch their final exam was their potions theory paper lily smiled at remus as they made their way out that wasnttoo bad no remus agreed nasty question on wolfsbane though and it still only in trial stages he grimaced lily lowered her voice full moon in a few days yeah remus sighed lily sighed too remus i ve been wondering emma doesntknow does she no dontyou think it would be better to to tell her lily suggested tentatively i mean it probably better if she finds out from you rather than from someone else i dontknow remus frowned slightly sometimes i almost do i want to but i worried about how she ll take it i i dontwant to lose her lily smiled at the genuinely scared tone in remus voice remus if she loves you then it wontmatter to her what you are i ll think about it good a few moments later emma herself appeared and began to talk to remus so lily dropped back next to sapphire fortunately for lily and emma who had been forced to listen to her bad tempered ramblings all through lunch while james and remus looked to be doing the same thing with sirius the exam had been fairly good for her and they discussed their answers contentedly the only awkward moment came when tom found her in the gryffindor common room and asked if she wanted to celebrate with him that evening oh i sorry tom lily exclaimed if you d only asked me ten minutes ago emma just made me promise i would celebrate with her tonight she conveniently refrained from mentioning the fact that emma would be with her boyfriend and therefore his friends in other words the marauders oh said tom clearly disappointed ok then see you on sunday yeah lily said uncomfortably i really am sorry tom s okay tom waved a hand carelessly friends first as always that one of the things i like about you he gave her an admiring look you re so loyal anyway see you around and that was that nine o clock that evening found emma lily sapphire remus sirius james and peter lounging on chairs around the fire talking and laughing merrily with bottles of butterbeer and snacks of every kind strewn around sirius had refused to answer claiming that he had a right to remain silent when lily had questioned him about where they had come from she had a sneaking suspicion that james had had a hand in procuring them as well his guilty as charged look and attempt to hastily divert the subject had not escaped her the hostility between sirius and sapphire had cooled down to almost its usual level of sirius taunting sapphire and sapphire ignoring sirius well for the most part perhaps sirius comments were just a little more barbed than usual but there was no need to point out the obvious and nothing would make him stop this is bo ring sirius whined we should be talking about something fun no more sugar for you padfoot james said firmly he leaned over and snatched the chocolate frog out of sirius hand i know that tone of voice all too well the others laughed as sirius lunged after it hey give that back he narrowed his eyes blackman will not rest until justice has been served and the chocolate has been returned to its rightful owner he leapt onto james and wrestled him off his chair and onto the floor trying unsuccessfully to grab the frog that james was holding just out of his reach blackman sapphire was choking with laughter sounds like batman to me although the boy is batty so that might explain it muggle superhero from comic books lily explained to the others watching as sirius pummelled james chest in an attempt to weaken him how exactly lily was not sure uhm sirius peter managed through his laughter you do realize there was a pile of like five of those right next to your chair peter james yelled from his place on the floor shut up it was too late sirius had heard yay he yelled happily climbing off james he flung himself back on his chair and picking a frog up bit off its head james followed more slowly rubbing his arms padfoot you need a diet you re heavy i resent that what if i end up bulimic tomorrow because of what you said he pouted as one everyone burst into more laughter you look like a sick monkey right now sapphire giggled bad move sirius raised an eyebrow you look like a sick monkey all the time heathleigh so i dontknow what you re talking about you know lily said hastily trying to head off the oncoming argument if someone told me this time last year that i would be hanging out with you guys and enjoying it i would have personally escorted them to the hospital wing and told madam pomfrey they had lost their marbles but look at me now i am insulted sirius cried remus spoke over him times change lily people change was it lily imagination or did he sneak a quick glance at james as he said this you people are so boring sirius complained let play a game his face lit up spin the bottle a n ok a thousand and one apologies for how long it been since i updated i had big exams which took away all my time yes that my excuse for everything i dontdo right now and i using it shamelessly as i pointed out to a friend and they are now over jumps up and down singing anyway with any luck updates will now speed up a little until i go on holiday sometime in the near future i think thank you to all the people who reviewed or emailed me telling me to get up off my lazy arse and post this chapter for once in my life i actually listened to someone now a review would be welcomed just to tell me that i ve haventbeen forgotten hints very unsubtly by pointing at the purple review button in the corner of the screen the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you a n thank you guys all so much for your reviews it nice to know i haventbeen forgotten i would do review thank yous but if this fic gets taken down again for anything it wontbe going up again so i wontrisk it warning this chapter contains some explicit language you have been cautioned chapter 19 fun and games uh uh james said shaking his head no way i know what these turn into with you remus was nodding his head in agreement but peter looked torn between which of his friends to support ok there something wrong james has a sense of responsibility lily said she twisted her face in mock horror i think i caught it off you james said just as dramatically he made a little cross out of his fingers and aimed it at her stay away from me lily rolled her eyes at him but smiled she looked at sirius pleading expression well i suppose a short game would be okay she said slowly as long as we re sensible and nothing too embarrassing comes up emma said sapphire shrugged as james burst into a coughing fit sirius sensible have you met him seeing that everyone else was in agreement however james and remus eventually gave in much to the delight of sirius who picked up an empty butterbeer bottle and placed it on the floor in the middle the first to spin was sirius himself the bottle ended up pointing at lily sirius smirked lily dear i seem to remember a certain talk you promised to give me on a certain womanly subject since you haventdone that yet why don t you tell us something about yourself where and when was your first time sapphire gasped thinking he was talking about something else but lily hushed her you really want to know she said coolly though her cheeks were pink transfiguration lesson fourth year 14th october so that why you left so suddenly that day sirius crowed and i thought it was because of james stealing all your quills lily raised her eyebrows so did you plan on returning the stationery you stole she asked quizzically turning to james who was looking distinctly uncomfortable perhaps it was this that made him say spin the bottle so hastily lily spun and it came to rest on sapphire hmm saffy what your honest opinion of sirius sapphire looked straight at sirius and a smirk tugged at the corner of her mouth finally i get to speak my mind sirius you re a twisted prat with an ego the size of asia who cantkeep his mind or his hands to himself she said firmly sirius raised an eyebrow i could say the same to you sweetheart ok ok remus interjected quickly sapphire spun it landed on remus ok uhm what your greatest ambition in life she cringed i know it crap but i cantthink of anything else remus looked rather sombre to get a job he answered quietly lily understood what he was talking about james sirius and peter too looked more serious than usual for a moment emma and sapphire simply looked confused go on moony spin said peter quickly to cover up the awkward silence remus reached out and spun it gently after a few swivels it stopped facing lily remus smiled you know i ve been wanting to ask you this question for the longest time we all know you re just naturally clever so why do you work yourself so hard lily considered for a moment i dontknow she said slowly i think maybe because i want to prove myself if i get top marks no one can hold the whole muggle thing against me plus here she smiled mischievously i get to rub it in yours and james faces james stuck his tongue out at her it was common knowledge that he remus and lily were neck and neck for the top of most classes seriously though you guys are the naturally clever ones i have to work for my marks james began to protest but remus shushed him we ll be here all night if we get into that argument spin lily she did and it halted on sirius hmm lily said a wicked glint coming into her eye alright if you had to pick someone out of this group to go out with who would you choose sirius looked around james he proclaimed merrily james looked disgusted and moved away from him best friend yeah boy friend never he shuddered ugh oh but jamie sirius cried in a high pitched voice think of how happy we could be together you cooking breakfast naked while i wound my hands around your waist and whispered erotic nothings into your ear james was bright red and looked ready to kill i am never sleeping in the same dorm as you again he hissed at sirius remind me to move out tonight everyone else was laughing hysterically very nice sirius lily said controlling herself i never knew you batted for the other team but i meant out of the girls oh said sirius looking crestfallen pity he considered each one briefly you i suppose emma taken and heathleigh well i refuse to take her out on a date he shuddered much like james had yuck i d need disinfectant afterwards like i would ever want you touching me black disinfectant and sandpaper would be what i would need sapphire retorted sirius carried on as if he hadntheard her but you re james so in reality i wouldntgo out with you either i am not james possession lily cried james was so low in his chair it looked like he wanted to fall through the seat his face burning lily too would have noticed her flushed cheeks if she had not been so busy glaring at sirius and her friends both of whom were laughing at her reaction can we please move on james ground out his face still warm rightio sirius said grinning manically he spun the bottle and to james obvious dismay it stopped facing him looks like the embarrassment isntover james dear sirius smirked now i do believe that you have several interesting things that you could tell us about yourself i ll pick one why dontyou tell us about a little talent that you picked up off your sister james looked confused playing the piano you play the piano three voices chorused at once yeah is that so unbelievable james said defiantly no emma said nodding her head vigorously my dears he does not just play the piano he plays the piano little mozart in the making mind you he can do jazz and modern as well really well actually the reason that he plays is rather amusing shall i tell them the amusing reason james sirius took a swig of butterbeer only one word issued from james mouth no that settled then sirius said gather round children he began to talk like a nursery school teacher now when james sister maddie was six her parents decided it would be good her to play an instrument so they bought the piano got her a tutor and she started naturally when she could manage simple pieces she got a lot of attention being as small as she was our james didntlike that at all so he started playing in secret sneaking down in the middle of the night and taught himself how to play all sorts of music until he could boast that he was better than maddie it must have been a classic moment the day he brought his family into the dining room and played them some concerto or other maddie gave up a while ago but james still plays he sings rather well too lovely voice everyone turned to look at james whose red face was hidden in his hands when i need a publicising officer padfoot i ll look you up but for now please shut up why i think playing the piano is dead sexy sapphire said she nudged lily i bet lily thinks so too dontyou lily what yeah i guess wait a minute no no i don t lily face had flamed as well sapphire giggled as lily gave her a dirty look can we please change the game yes james echoed vehemently oh but james hasntdone his turn sirius said sweetly what what was all the piano stuff for then that was just us going off on a little tangent james dear my actual question involved a little thing that you were forced to practice on your sister dolls what oh no oh no padfoot you are not going there i most certainly am is it your life ambition to embarrass me of course that why i best man at your wedding everyone was laughing now both at sirius innocent grin and james murderous expression why are you my best friend well jamesie if you dontwant to say you know what the forfeit is you know what the idea of proposing to mcgonagall naked in the great hall in the middle of lunch is looking quite tempting right now and dontcall me jamesie jamesie the choice is yours fine james mumbled something that no one caught what was that peter asked i said i know how to do hair girls hair james was so red now he looked as though he was going to explode huh you mean like plaits and stuff emma looked confused james nodded sheepishly everyone burst into laughter again are are you serious lily gasped wiping tears of laughter from her eyes well it was either learn how to french plait her barbie or watch her go running to mum whining about how i was being mean to her when i was babysitting her and be docked of chocolate for a week james said defensively besides when you re eight you have a lot of time on your hands to baby sit for a six year old and if that means doing her hair to shut her up then i d like to see you choose his indignant expression only made the others laugh harder maybe you should do a french plait on me one day lily was clutching her side by now maybe i will i ll plait your hair to a hippogriff and see how you like it james stuck his tongue out at her i sure you can do it for her at your wedding sirius said in an innocent tone he seemed to be doing a lot of things innocently that night of course we might have to work around that thing with the groom not seeing the bride before the ceremony and all but i sure we ll sort it out that wiped the smile right off lily face sirius you re talking nonsense it not going to happen i suggest we change the game now please james added fine fine sirius put a hand to his heart dramatically if you dontlike my games so be it any ideas sapphire asked how about a pick up line competition emma suggested quietly it d give us all a laugh peter picked up on the idea quickly yeah here he wadded up a bunch of wrappers into the semblance of a ball we throw this at someone and they have to say a pick up line and then throw it on to someone else first one down has to clean up the mess we leave lily chimed in everyone agreed sirius asked seven heads nodded okay emma your idea you go first peter tossed the ball at her you re so hot you could make the devil sweat she grinned impishly and threw to remus if i could rearrange the letters of the alphabet i d put u and i together he said and passed to lily do you believe in love at first sight or should i walk by again lily reddened slightly as she aimed at sirius nice outfit wanna fuck everyone started laughing as he passed to james who looked disgusted why the hell are you hitting on me never use that on a girl unless you actually want a slap lily said giggling congratulations you ve been voted most beautiful girl in this room and the grand prize is a night with me he passed to sapphire do you have a map i keep getting lost in your eyes she looked sheepish as she threw to peter there must be something wrong with my eyes i canttake them off you he threw to emma who caught it deftly i hope you know cpr because you take my breath away on to james james looked around his eyes fell on lily i ve had a really bad day and it always makes me feel better to see a pretty girl smile so will you smile for me his neck was pink as he threw can i borrow your owl she asked looking at remus what for i want to write home and tell my family i ve met the guy of my dreams lily passed on do you believe in helping the homeless yeah sapphire answered take me home with you he passed to her i the kind of girl who deserves to have boys i dontdeserve she threw to remus again i just wanted to show this rose how incredibly beautiful you are the ball moved to emma hi my name emma you might want to remember it now because you ll be screaming it later she was red as she passed on this is never going to end lily exclaimed as sirius caught it you know the rules keep going remus said the word of the day is legs sirius proclaimed let go back to my place and spread the word lily was next you know you might be asked to leave soon you re making all the other guys look bad lily passed to james who opened his mouth obviously racking his brains that shirt is very becoming on you if i were on you i d be coming too seven mouths fell open at the implication and seven heads turned to look at the speaker who had not been james serena parkinson stood there hands on hips attention focused solely on james she was wearing an incredibly short red leather skirt and a tube top lily could not understand how she could walk past any teacher looking like that and get away with it wh what james stammered looking very much like a deer caught in headlights come on jamie let leave these people and go somewhere private she extended an arm invitingly and shot a glare at lily james had regained his composure beat it parkinson he said coolly and dontcall me jamie come on james you know you said i was the best fuck you d ever had serena said lavisciously looking at him from under lowered lids what james stared at her in disbelief come on baby remember the astronomy tower and the transfiguration classroom i certainly cantforget them those were the best hours of my life with you moaning my name she was bending forwards now giving him a full view of her cleavage his eyes however remained firmly fixed on her face i donthave a clue what you re talking about parkinson i suggest you get a hobby and a life well serena said salaciously if words wontpersuade you maybe actions will without further ado she bent down grabbed his shirt collar and covered his mouth with her own she gave him a full on snog for a few seconds while he struggled under her until at last he managed to push her away from him his lips were already swollen and his face flushed fuck off serena he managed breathing heavily crawl back into whatever hole you came out of whatever you say jamie serena shrugged nonchalantly but mark my words there ll be a day when you ll come round to my way of thinking and when you do here she shot a venomous look at lily again i ll be waiting she sauntered off james began scrubbing at his lips with the back of his hand quick he moaned get me some disinfectant and sandpaper i need to scrub my lips off no one moved it was sirius who finally voiced what everyone was thinking james mate you slept with her james stopped rubbing to stare at him incredulously what i no what on earth padfoot this was in fifth year i was with that slut for three days when would i how would i but she said you said she was the best fuck you d ever had sirius said looking rather ill and not at all hyper and you believe i haventslept with any bloody girl in hogwarts james hollered it was lucky for him that the common room was more or less empty i cantbelieve you would why the hell am i justifying my personal life to you i going to bed he got up and without so much as a good night stomped upstairs there was a stunned silence well now we know how to get him fired up sirius said attempting to lift the mood damper he lowered his voice i thought he said he wasntintending to sleep in the same dorm as me a few minutes later james came down the stairs again still looking exceptionally bad tempered i going down to the heads rooms i am not sleeping in the same dorm as you good night he disappeared through the portrait hole sirius shrugged guess i spoke too soon a n so i take it you all have your copies of the half blood prince i think it the best yet personally though that probably because well i wontsay because i dontwant to spoil any surprises four hours later 607 pages later and i was left wishing that i had more to read and that definitely didnthappen with ootp anyway to let you all know i ll be continuing with ttoth

again so i wontrisk it enjoy the reposted chapter 2 chapter 2 back on the hogwarts express six weeks later lily found herself back on platform nine and three quarters dragging her trunk into an empty compartment thank god i got here early she thought pushing her long red hair back and then immediately feeling infuriated with herself for not tying it back as she usually did who did she think she wanted to impress having manoeuvred herself out of the compartment again lily hopped off the train she saw several people who she knew and waved absently at them as she scanned the crowds looking for emma students were climbing on and off the train and saying goodbye to families everywhere she looked someone trod on her shoe yanking the lace out and she bent down cursing inwardly to tie it up a shadow fell across her hi lily she straightened up to find herself staring straight up into a male face james potter lily it was then that something else clicked into place lily didnthe usually call her evans something was very wrong here perhaps he was trying to butter her up so that he could play a prank on her acting on impulse lily looked around were any other marauders near hello lily wake up this time it was delivered with a slight push to the shoulder and lily mentally shook herself out of her thoughts and looked up at him he had obviously grown another few inches over the summer she felt slightly dwarfed by him even though she was nowhere near short herself sorry hi how ve you been james shoved his hands in his pocket as he spoke and lily smothered a grin he was clearly trying to restrain himself from running his hands through his hair what it to you potter lily had intended it to sound like an insult to send him packing but to her horror it came out sounding almost flirty james had obviously noticed it as well he raised an eyebrow as he opened his mouth to reply but he never got the chance another boy had leapt onto him apparently hugging him if only in a very masculine way prongsie aargh sirius gerroff me james gasped his glasses slightly askew trying to wrench sirius arm off him finally sirius released james and noticed lily standing there arms crossed a gleam appeared in his eye lily he cried donteven think about it lily said firmly taking a step back cautiously i uhm have to go she gestured uselessly at the crowds thronging the platform wait a second arentyou going to ask us how our holidays were especially james sirius added slyly slapping james on the chest padfoot shut up james said uncomfortably but lily attention was occupied by other matters as sirius had slapped james something silver had winked at her and as he removed his hand she read what was written on the silver badge pinned neatly onto his jumper her mouth fell open you re she gasped yup sirius smirked at her our little jamesie is head boy he pretended to wipe an imaginary tear from his eye they grow up so fast shut it james mumbled but this time he was smiling slightly his gaze focused on lily again who had gone paper white you re head boy she asked praying that she was hearing things you not remus or any other seventh year and this isnta joke nope i pretty sure i head boy why what it to you lily removed a small envelope from her pocket and opened it her fingers trembled slightly as she removed a silver badge from it surprise she said weakly i was saving this to put on later james and sirius leaned in to read it congratulations james said hoisting a smile onto his face thanks lily muttered unconsciously pushing her hair back you too for one moment she wanted to fall through the floor then suddenly her normal feelings kicked in so she was going to be partners with potter for the next year why was she blushing and acting like another one of his groupies this was james potter for heavens sake the boy who d made her life hell for six years so sirius began jamesie and lily working together for an entire year you ll be locked up together in rooms a lot wontyou doing things lily eyes widened in shock at what he was insinuating you sick minded pervert she shrieked raising her hand she brought it down with all the force she could muster on sirius cheek he gasped and winced as she turned on her heel and strode away angrily head held high got a temper on her that one sirius said rubbing his cheek painfully yeah muttered james gazing after her two hours later lily and emma were sitting in a compartment talking or rather lily was talking furiously and emma was staring into space and then his idiot friend has the nerve to go and and imply things which i would not be caught dead doing lily said angrily besides which idiot decided to make potter head boy someone like amos diggory i can understand but potter he spends all his time in detention on the quidditch pitch or snogging girls in broom closets he has no respect for rules or anything other than himself so who thought that he would make a good head who lily finally noticed the glazed look in her friend eyes emma vance are you listening to me at all emma looked up at her exasperatedly i listened to you the first time lils and the second time i even listened to you for most of the third time but we have been on this train for she checked her watch two hours and for one hour and fifty minutes of that i have been listening to the same thing over and over again if you want my opinion just ask for it lily sighed and slumped down alright em what your opinion for starters the idiot who made james prefect would be dumbledore and i quite sure he had his reasons for choosing him besides in all your ranting and raving you haventanswered a few basic questions that you should be asking like what lily shot at her friend number one you still haventgiven either me or yourself a decent explanation for why james has started calling you lily when you ve been using surnames for the past six years number two why did you get so upset about what sirius said and why are you so upset about the idea of james being head boy because he stupid and sirius was being gross lily moaned and she slid even further down her seat i canttake this any more she scrunched her eyes shut and put her hands over her ears just as the door opened lily emma kicked lily who opened her eyes to see james potter head wearing an urgent expression at the door lily you i mean we were meant to be at the meeting in the prefect compartment twenty minutes ago what lily sprang up no yes come on sorry em she panted and flinging the door shut behind her she and james hurtled down the corridor i only just found out james gasped out as they reached the door opening it they tumbled in together eight pairs of eyes met lily accusingly and she did her best to gaze round amicably at them sorry she said apologetically great she thought what a great way to start off my year left behind emma smiled to herself and another thing lils she added silently you haventnoticed how much he changed a n so there you go basically the same just a few minor alterations where i ve noticed a grammatical mistake feel free to leave a review anything will do the next chapter will be coming very soon the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you a n thank you guys all so much for your reviews it nice to know i haventbeen forgotten i would do review thank yous but if this fic gets taken down again for anything it wontbe going up again so i wontrisk it warning some chapters maycontainexplicit language you have been cautioned chapter 20 altered perceptions lilyyyyy emma whined for the fifth time tell me what happened or we ll be forced to give you a truth potion and who knows what ugly secrets you could tell us sapphire quipped lying back lily carefully unclipped her earrings and placed them on her dressing table she swapped her cardigan and sleeveless top for a baggy sweatshirt and took off her shoes slowly knowing full well that she was annoying the other two emma glance fell on serena preening in front of the large mirror at the other side of the room i ve got a top like that she muttered to sapphire guess i ll be burning it now serena top was a cream off the shoulder sweater with a huge neck although lily could visualise emma it in quite easily it did not go with serena figure and clashed with her hair a fact serena was obviously not aware of unfortunately serena had heard emma remark she turned around and widened her mascara ed eyes at her in mock innocence oh honey you couldntpull this off she said in tones that almost dripped with fake sympathy sapphire pulled a face and snorted neither can you she said in an undertone emma burst out laughing and serena eyed them both in disdain whatever she said i ll leave you kids to it she walked out of the room leaving it silent save for the steady strokes of lily brushing her hair sapphire could stand it no longer lily evans if you do not tell us right now what happened on your date with tom i will come over and cause you grievous bodily harm it wasnta date it was a walk lily replied calmly she laid her brush down and causing me gbh wontmake me tell you anything we are not playing a game of semantics here sapphire cried just tell us already lily sighed and swivelled around it was nice this time it was emma who snorted lily i ve been your best friend for seven years dontthink i canttell when you re lying okay okay lily threw up her hands in defeat it wasntgreat tom is sweet though but prompted sapphire but i dontknow he tried to compliment me quite a few times i guess it doesntroll off as easily as it does for some so it was a bit awkward and some of the things he said well i cantrelate to them very well like like when he was talking about quidditch as a future career i mean yeah i like the game but all that stuff he was reeling off about teams like profits i had a hard time just following the jargon what i am i meant to say about any of that where did you go emma asked just walked around the lake then he took me to this hill hidden behind some trees and we watched the sun set it would have been romantic i suppose if he hadntbeen so self conscious so are you going to go out again there was a curious note in sapphire voice yeah probably lily shrugged he really nice and we were talking most of the time she grinned suddenly he does such good impressions of the teachers ooh ooh ooh tell saffy what happened when you came up to the common room emma was bouncing up and down on her bed didnttom walk you up sapphire asked raising her eyebrows excuse me he was talking about quidditch inter relations by that time i escaped to the toilets tell her tell her tell her tell her what happened when you got upstairs sapphire looked expectantly at lily who rolled her eyes i talked to james big freakin deal lily you re holding out on her what am i supposed to say he asked me how my date was i said okay and he smiled so what so what lily evans are you blind did you not see how forced his smile was no i didn t you re just seeing things i am not i emma broke off as they heard a male voice float up the stairs emma that remus sapphire said recognizing the distinct notes of his voice be right back i suppose emma swung the door open then turned to glare at lily tell her all and i mean all the details she narrowed her eyes and left the room sapphire turned to lily okay give me the full story dontleave anything out lily came over to her bed and flopped down i seriously dontknow what she talking about there isntmuch to tell em met me just outside the portrait hole and then we went in james came over to ask me about head business and then he just went did you just go out on a date i said yeah with tom so he said did you have a good time and i said it was okay and he smiled and said great see you emma just thinks it was forced well what do you think it was sapphire asked impatiently i dontknow probably just emma seeing things if she were here she d probably be inferring enough to write a book from the way he was standing or whatever he was the door opened and emma came in looking ashen she shut the door and came to sit down putting her head in her hands uh em what going on lily questioned an idea flashed into her head an idea of what this was about a very bad idea emma lifted her head and looked at lily you knew remus was a werewolf it was not a question but a statement beside her lily felt sapphire tense yeah she replied not quite sure where the conversation was going he just told me emma said stating the obvious he said he had something personal to tell me and he hoped i would accept it and he told me her tone was expressionless and what did you say lily asked i left emma face was hidden in her hands again i cantbelieve this he a monster no he not lily said sliding over to sit next to her he still the same guy you know and like he just got a disease a disease that turns him into a raging monster once a month it a problem yeah but surely you can see that he still the same person lily right sapphire soft voice said she had moved to the other side of emma he the same person you just know something more about him but h he a creature of the night evil no he not lily said desperately she had a horrible feeling about what was going to happen he a good guy em you cantblame him for something that happened when he was little and dontyou understand emma why he said that his ambition in life was to get a job all that prejudice against werewolves out there do you really think he needs more from you you cantbe intending to throw him away over this sapphire added equally urgently what you have is special dontgive it up i dontknow said emma she got up and went to her own bed where she climbed in i need time to think but lily began but sapphire shushed her let her be she said quietly she ll soon see sense the two of them went outside into the corridor where they could talk without disturbing their friend did you know about him lily asked quietly sapphire pushed her hair back worriedly no she said i had my suspicions but i never got to any definite conclusions and i never dreamt em would take it this badly neither did i lily said in an agitated whisper i was the one who encouraged remus to tell her in the first place sapphire moved forward and pulled lily into a comforting hug you did the right thing she would have had to have known sooner or later so it better that they get this over with now what if they dontget it over with lily looked panicky things will sort themselves out sapphire said much more decisively than she felt you ll see lily gave a glance towards the light reflecting up from the common room think i should go and see how he doing sapphire shrugged if you want to she put her hand on the doorknob i ll be right here she went in and lily crossed the corridor and descended reluctantly into the common room remus was sitting in a chair on his own staring into the fire she walked over to stand beside him unsure of how he would react to her hi she said uncertainly hey was the short reply after a few moments of standing there waiting for a response which wasntgoing to come she launched into speech not knowing exactly what she was saying remus i so sorry i honestly never thought emma would take it as badly as she did seriously i sure she ll get over it and i feel so bad for telling you to tell her i apologise for saying th lily remus interrupted he at last looked away from the fire lily had always seen had always appreciated his gentle grey eyes but never had she known how stormy they could be until that moment when he finally turned them upon her you have nothing to be sorry for nothing to feel bad about and nothing to apologise for what lily asked wrong footed everything you said when we talked was true there was nothing wrong with any of it so you have nothing to be sorry for but i remus spoke over her you pointed out that i would have to tell her about it sooner or later you were right eventually this would have happened and you said that if she really lov liked me then it wouldntmatter to her it did i accept that i cantexpect pity or understanding from most of the wizarding world so obviously i cantexpect it from her he rubbed his eyes dumbledore said i would have to make sacrifices because of my problem when i came here i guess she was one of them lily was by now kneeling down beside him remus if i could change things i would she said quietly but you can t remus said lightly so there no point in d dwelling on it his voice caught in his throat and he looked back at the fire maybe lily started but just then sirius james and peter climbed through the portrait hole as one their expressions became puzzled at the sight of their friend lily changed mid sentence i ll leave you with sirius and james and peter they ll probably be able to cheer you up more than i can night remus she turned to go receiving a quiet goodnight in reply as she did so and headed back up the stairs hoping that his friends would be able to help the dorm when she reached it was silent and dark except for sapphire curled up on her bed reading under a solitary torch she looked up as lily walked in is she asleep lily asked nodding her head at emma bed sapphire nodded i checked a few minutes ago remus is seriously upset lily said in a low voice seating herself opposite her friend i mean it saffy he practically heartbroken but he refusing to show it she glanced towards the lump under the covers again he said that this is just a sacrifice he going to have to make he being really brave about it another glance she paused and looked at her hands i honestly cantbelieve the way she reacted i keep thinking this is just a bad dream and i ll wake up and everything will be normal sapphire put a soothing hand over her friend s lil you heard the way she was talking before she not like you and me she from a wizarding family she saw lily face and stopped to rephrase i mean yeah i half but since mum only told me she was a witch when i got my letter it not like she taught me what to think on stuff like this em on the other hand has been told since she was old enough to understand that werewolves are bad and evil and that she shouldnthave anything to do with their kind it hard to overcome beliefs instilled in you at a young age she ll work things out eventually whether that means that she leaves remus behind forever i dontknow lily sighed i wish this hadnthappened so do i sapphire said i terrible at comforting people i always say the wrong thing but until she comes to terms with her own heart with herself we re just going to have to heave her alone and not pester it her decision lily looked at sapphire raising an eyebrow you have such good advice since when did you get so wise and all knowing you only just noticed i ashamed of you lily threw a pillow at her friend and stuck her tongue out i going to bed all knowing one or did you already know that sapphire rolled her eyes sweet dreams she said lily changed and climbed into bed hoping very much that the day would bring with it new counsel when lily finally woke up the next morning three of the four other beds were still occupied a cursory glance at emma bed showed that she was still asleep and lily felt a pang remembering the events of last night she pulled herself up and walked into the bathroom a gleamingly white airy room fitted with large mirrors and several sinks two small rooms led off from the main in opposite corners one housing a shower and the other a toilet the lightness of the room woke lily up slightly more and she splashed water on her face as she brushed her teeth she had originally intended to take a shower but seeing that the door to the shower was closed she shrugged it off i ll have to fit in time somewhere after the head meeting tonight she thought she walked back to her room not looking forward to the prospect of transfiguration and once she had dressed began sorting out her books a noise at the door made her turn round to see a brown haired girl standing there can i help yo oh my god she sat down hard on her bed staring at the familiar yet unfamiliar girl smiling nervously at her from the doorway saffy she asked weakly the girl grinned wider do i look different what what have you done lily questioned staring at sapphire hair although just last night she had been her usual pale brown colour now her hair was a strikingly deeper brown it was not as dark as emma mahogany hair but was a deep chestnut with hints of auburn the colour accentuated her cerulean eyes even more making them sparkle with life it not what i have done it what i havent done the colour my hair used to be wasntnatural this is wha how sapphire smiled even more dye based on the muggle kind but it magical so it lasts longer and when it goes it all goes in one go so you know you need to reapply she held up a box and lily could just about make out the name in cursive writing witch n go nice n easy with a toothy brown haired witch smiling beneath flicking her hair around because we re born for beauty why on earth would you use that lily still felt too weak to stand up she was still eyeing sapphire gleaming locks in shock sapphire looked distant if you remember this was the colour i was when i first came to hogwarts callie convinced me that this she shook the box would make me look nice and after that i dunno it just became like a shield it was like even if callie and i had a rough patch the fact that i was still using this could hold us together sort of she shook her head stupid i know plus it got me what i always wanted inconspicuousness she grinned unrepentantly it all washed out this morning though so i figured i free of callie i can be free of this too she put her hand to her hair and her grin vanished all at once she looked nervous and worried is it okay i mean i could always go and us she got no farther because lily had flung herself at her saffy you look prettier than ever sapphire looked happier that that then once lily had released her she dropped the box into the bin where it hit the bottom with a loud clang in the bed next to theirs a few incoherent mumbles were heard and then a loud gasp both girls looked around to see emma sitting up in bed and looking at sapphire as though she was a ghost you explain said sapphire bending to retrieve some socks for the day by the time the whole situation had been explained to emma and the three of them were dressed and ready serena and callie still had not woken up sapphire emma and lily left them as they were as lily so neatly put it those hags need their beauty sleep i dontintend to be put off my food by their faces for the rest of the day just as they were about to go through the portrait hole it swung open before them and sirius clambered in clearly having just breakfasted emma turned pale thinking remus was behind but sirius was on his own his mouth opened but then his eyes fell on sapphire and he closed it again for seconds he stared at her his expression unreadable then his customary smirk that he saved especially for sapphire crept slowly onto his face once again so you ve finally decided to go with the colour of your home good for you sapphire of the mud for a moment sapphire looked as though she wanted to cry then her face hardened she moved forward and smack she had slapped him hard across his cheek as he winced and put a hand to his face she took a step back surveying her handiwork that was especially for you she told him sweetly and dontworry there plenty more where it came from she climbed out of the common room yeah sirius yelled after her well if you think that changes my opinion you re wrong emma and lily followed sapphire just before the portrait swung closed behind them lily caught sirius voice floating back to her second time i ve been slapped by one of those three a n ok so i hope you enjoyed that now for the bad news there wontbe an update of this for a few weeks because i leaving all of civilisation to go globetrotting translation i going on holiday to a place where there is unlikely to be internet access or rather there is unlikely to be internet that i have access to l anyway i taking fanfic stuff with me and i ll be working on the all important chapter 35 in whatever spare time i get to myself so it not coming to a complete standstill if that any consolation so hope you guys all have a happy few weeks of summer holiday and i shall see you or rather post to you when i get back take care all now did you enjoy this chapter enough to leave me a little review stares hopefully the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you a n thank you guys all so much for your reviews it nice to know i haventbeen forgotten i would do review thank yous but if this fic gets taken down again for anything it wontbe going up again so i wontrisk it chapter 21 good manners hey remus said seating himself next to james sirius and peter both grinned at him but emma sitting a few places down on the other side of the table froze and looked at him eyes widening and got up to walk off leaving her lunch half finished and sapphire on her own she was so intent on walking out that she walked straight past lily who had just reached the entrance to the great hall and had witnessed the above scene the flurry of movement alerted remus who looked up in time to watch her leave an unreadable expression on his face lily was very much tempted to slump against the door and groan it had been like this all day emma getting up and going off whenever remus came within a ten metre radius the tension between them was like walking on thin ice very thin ice and it was not fun lily would probably have shaken her friend silly by now except for the fact that sapphire had made her promise not to say anything about it to her as it was she simply shifted her bag onto her shoulder more securely and headed for her friends hey saffy hey you four she picked up a napkin and began piling sandwiches into it what we dontget greeted by name sirius exclaimed through a mouthful of food no time for names and dontspeak with your mouth full sirius swallowed hastily but you called sapphire in the mud her name sapphire shot him a withering look which he ignored whatever no time lily folded another napkin over her lunch and surveyed the other food on display on the table sirius eyed the stack of sandwiches teetering in her hand in disbelief so when do you find the time to eat all that somewhere between writing a charms essay writing a letter to gladrags and dealing with those stupid lists of figures for the stupid ball decorations which i am doing all wrong before tonight meeting i can help you out with them if you want james offered taking a bite of his food thanks she slipped a couple of apples into her bag with one hand and looked back at james seven thirty as usual yeah right see you later she disappeared was it just me or was that rather exclusively aimed at jamie boy padfoot remus said keeping a straight face terribly sorry to remind you but it a bad idea to say things like that unless you want a hit upside the head what do you mean jamie boy hasntdone anythi ouch sapphire snorted and sirius rubbing his head glared at her ignoring this sapphire reached across the table for the nearest jug of pumpkin juice let me help you with that a voice said the jug was lifted just as her fingers were about to grasp it and thrust into her face straightening up she found a tall boy who she vaguely recognized as a ravenclaw seventh year staring down at her with a grin on his face that was obviously intended to be charming thanks she said eyeing him suspiciously uh leon leon wilkes and it was no prob but sapphire continued coolly last time i checked my arms were still in full working order so you dontneed to bother i really dontneed to bother later she added pointedly and she sat down firmly looking at her food until she heard him leave sirius raised his eyebrows god heathleigh no need to break his heart yeah right sapphire retorted you wait til someone tries to hit on you well actually if it a girl and if it a pretty girl i dontreally mind ugh sapphire exclaimed can you not hear how shallow you sound you put me right off my lunch she got up and left sirius shrugged prickly by the time lily found her friends that evening to borrow a few quills fifteen minutes before the head meeting sapphire was still ranting mostly to emma lily was quite amazed at the language that could come out of her friend mouth when she was annoyed they ve been at it all bloody day she was saying furiously opening doors offering to walk me to class am i an invalid or something all they have been doing is hitting on me she saw lily can you believe it lils it utterly pathetic it like they think i some kind of bimbo like serena who actually going to be flattered by the way they act uh saffy lily said emma shook her head i ve been trying that for the past half an hour she said in an undertone i dontthink she can hear us sapphire was still going on i swear the only lot who haventturned themselves into gibbering idiots are the marauders and tom and that because black hates me almost as much as i hate him remus likes emma peter just not into that kind of stuff and james and tom are both interested in you james and i are just friends how many times do i have to tell you that lily said exasperated sapphire took no heed and rambled on at full steam isntthere some sort of law against this or rule because there bloody well should be something to stop idiot boys from chasing after innocent girls for no reason whatsoever d you know some numbskull even brandished mistletoe at me he needs a calendar i just going to have to take action and punch any boy that comes near me since the language obviously hasntgiven them the idea okay forget it i have to go lily said looking hurriedly at her watch i ll just borrow a quill off james or something see you guys later right emma mouthed bye at her and sapphire granted her a disgruntled wave before continuing to gesture violently about what she would have liked to do to several boys if she had had the chance five minutes later she climbed into the heads room thoroughly out of breath you re late james teased looking up from the parchment on his table sorry lily gasped dropping her bag they had decided to move their two separate tables together a while ago since it made working together much easier i have a friend who cantshut up about the evils of the male population oh yeah james said focusing on his parchment once more as lily pulled out her work i saw sapphire looking ready to kill when andy mcgregor offered to walk her to the hall mmmhmm lily agreed absently scanning the list of figures before her hey could i borrow a quill yeah james crossed over to his bag which lily now realized was dumped on the sofa and ferreted through it what that lily suddenly asked getting up and walking over to the fireplace a photo frame stood above on the mantelpiece lily lifted it up to see a photo of the four marauders inside all grinning at the camera as she watched sirius and james started to play fight while remus looked at them half smiling half scandalised and peter laughed outright she smiled sweet turning around she looked at james how remus she asked hesitantly james straightened up a quill in his hand bitter he answered he threw it over to her and she snatched it out of mid air he can understand the whole not talking to him thing but he not happy about the acting like he has a contagious disease part he wandered over and took the photo out of her hands twirling it absently in his own cant you talk to her about that i could lily sighed in fact i would but saffy made me promise that i would leave her to work it out by herself ah there was a short silence i hate this lily burst out it like the way emma used to be after prefect meetings with remus before they got together except this is ten times worse she wonttell me anything and she hides all her feelings james shrugged not much we can do about it is there remus is exactly the same short of locking them both into a room which i dontintend to do because i value my life we re just going to have to sit tight he walked back and sat down in lily seat hey lily protested james raised his eyebrows do you want help with the figures for decorations lily looked sheepish oh okay then she sat down in his seat noting that it was still pleasantly warm from when he had been sitting there and glanced at the parchment before her before brushing it aside menu options mmm james agreed examining the lists of numbers in front of him after a few minutes he looked up and wrinkled his nose at her tell you what lily why dont i do this and you can deal with the menus this needs to be redone lily guessed well no not complete yeah it does james admitted i thought you would have gone to primary school it not that difficult to add and subtract is it lily made a face and stuck her tongue out at him i just not someone who has a friendship with the world of numbers we had a really horrible maths teacher my sister was the one who helped me there i was better at writing and stuff anything that didntinvolve the words profit and loss james laughed it not that hard i was talked into doing this for money he deepened his voice lily guessed to sound like his father s james my boy there is no such thing as being bored tell you what if i teach you how to do the household accounts you might even get some money off your mother for it james grinned dad knew money was always a big incentive for me to do things lily laughed so how much are they paying you to be a responsible head boy wouldntyou like to know james smirked oh but i would okay then james leaned towards her conspiratorially they are paying me he whispered dramatically a truck load of chocolate frogs every day lily could not help but laugh again you and your wild imagination so where do you keep this truckload of chocolate frogs in the library hidden in books james looked solemn they offered me a truckload of troll bogies as well but i said no thank you to those lily burst into laughter all over again insane boy she scolded though her lips were twitching upwards get on with those numbers before i have to finish them point taken james said hurriedly picking up his quill within the next few days life was looking up for lily she had gone on another date with tom this time a study date and had come back flushed with success tom had been much more conversable than she expected and they had shared several intimate moments hidden away in the back corner of the library that plus a lighter workload than usual meant that for one night lily was able to relax and compose a list of various information yet to be decided for the ball fetching her bits and pieces from the heads rooms she made her way up to the common room as she entered it she saw that sapphire was working at a table beside the fire having snagged it at the last moment and headed over to her hey she said cheerfully dumping her bag and pulling up a chair hey sapphire replied she placed her quill back in her bottle and looked up you know this may be only time you ever hear me say this but i love flitwick and mcgonagall for not giving us essays tonight yeah me too lily agreed taking out all her bits of parchment it really saved my life and my sanity sapphire laughed then looked down at her work ugh three more constellations and i ve finished the star chart for astronomy then it just those potions questions lily peered over her friend shoulder her rusty fifth year astronomy flooding back she twisted her head then pointed to one of the stars hey isntthat sirius minor she twisted her head in the other direction and then traced the path of a constellation and sirius major sapphire turned the parchment round lily you genius she exclaimed delightedly she dipped her quill into ink and scribbled the names in there she said cheerfully two down although technically they re canis minor and major she studied her work pity i cantrelabel those human minor and git major lily suddenly remembered something she had meant to mention to her friend saffy she began slowly have you heard hello children an arm was flung around lily shoulders and looking up she saw sirius blue eyes twinkling down at her ahoy maties he sang out everything shipshape here lily rolled her eyes and removed his arm from her shoulders it was until you turned up sapphire said sirius put a hand to his heart dramatically i injured he said faking a sorrowful tone then he dropped his pose but at least i know when i not wanted sapphire bent her head back over her work so that her hair fell over her face but the glint of her eye could still be seen so why are you still here sirius huffed and walked away lily watched him go she then turned to sapphire saffy have you heard i hate that boy sapphire burst out he so sapphire lily yelled startling both herself and her friend who abruptly shut up she cleared her throat have you uh heard the rumours what rumours sapphire said half her attention back on her work the rumours about you and and sirius fancying each other sapphire head snapped up what she hissed uhm i dontthink it got round the whole school lily quailed under sapphire furious glare it just that since you ve been yelling at every boy who approached i think someone got an idea and run away with it oh my sapphire said she looked over in disgust at sirius who was talking to his friends this is insufferable lily looked at her friend in concern but then proceeded to get on with her work in the hope that sapphire would simmer down ten minutes later sapphire flung down her quill violently this is stupid she said angrily i going up i cant concentrate thinking that it would be best for her to go and cool off lily let her go and remained alone at her table chewing her quill and trying to think of desserts that everyone in the school would like fifteen minutes later an arm snaked round lily neck and two hands clasped over her eyes guess who a voice whispered lily smiled despite herself no idea she said would this help she felt a soft touch on her collarbone and it took her a few moments to realise what it was a kiss tom the hands removed themselves from her eyes and she twisted around to see tom face smiling sheepishly she smiled back up at him that was unexpected she said giving him a quick kiss on the cheek yeah well tom looked at his feet you looked so lovely i couldntwalk past without saying hi lily laughed and turned back around to her work before long she felt a pair of arms move around her waist and the weight of tom head on her shoulder what re you doing he asked sleepily head business coming up with menus for the ball she replied she looked curiously at tom tousled head what with all the r romance she asked momentarily forgetting herself as his warm breath tickled her skin tom pressed another kiss on her this time on her cheek i just feel he broke off as a shadow moved across the table a loud noise sounded and lily looked up to see a dark haired boy standing in front of the fire angling her head she could see that the familiar profile could only be james ripping up a piece of parchment albeit rather more loudly and violently than necessary and throwing the pieces one by one into the fire he turned round to see them looking at him oh sorry he said perhaps lily did not notice occupied as she was by tom arms tensing around her but james was smiling in a way that was meant to be apologetic meant to be he walked back to his friends and lily began to work again tom snuggling his face into the hollow of her neck and breathing softly against her she could feel his heart beating out of rhythm against her own so what were you saying she questioned softly as she erased a word with her wand i dunno tom said his arms wound further around her and lily breathed in sharply as his cool hands brushed against the bare skin of her stomach it just feels right like i meant to be here with you lily smiled and was about to turn around to give him a kiss on the cheek again when another sound distracted them and she looked instead up to the sound of coals being raked noisily james was crouching by the fire loudly rattling the poker and tongs shifting hot coals around eventually he got up and swivelled to look at them sorry he said briefly the other side of the room a bit cold the fact that he was wearing a t shirt did not seem to occur to him lily rolled her eyes as he walked away again d j vu tom said as he refocused on her now what were we doing this lily replied nodding her head at her parchment tom shook his head no he said this he kissed her softly and quickly on the lips tom lily protested feeling her cheeks redden this is the common room and we are in full view of the whole house stop it but she allowed him to keep himself near her his body warmth enveloping her she continued to try to think of ideas for the menus while tom gave her mingled suggestions and discreet kisses slowly though another noise faded into the foreground every so often lily would hear intermittent bouts of coughing it began to occur to her that a certain someone seemed to be crossing the room several times always happening to walk straight in front of her more annoyed now she looked up james what are you doing she asked impatiently james shrugged sirius keeps chucking my quill here he held up a quill as if for evidence and the coughing i have a dry throat ok james too sounded slightly irritated good for you bye bye james ignored her and walked off the peace did not last long five minutes later lily was roused once again most people in the common room were working but the marauders were talking quietly all of a sudden james burst into loud laughter so loud in fact that almost the entire room turned to look at him including lily for a moment she wondered what the joke was and then she realised that there was no joke remus sirius and peter were staring at him looking just as confused as everyone else good one padfoot james said apparently trying to calm down he burst into laughter again uh okay sirius said uncertainly whatever you say james calmed down again and looked around at the staring people his eyes lingering a moment too long on the two figures by the fire sorry i disturbed you he said amiably grinning round it was just so funny slowly everyone began to return to what they were doing and the noise level rose back to its original level it was not fast enough however that lily did not hear sirius say james what the heck were you laughing at she ignored the comment passing it off as nothing important and focused once again on trifle apple pie and ice cream twenty minutes later tom still next to and partly on top of her lily saw a shadow once again before her no prizes for guessing who it was james lily said through partially gritted teeth what is it now nothing james said coolly i just wanted to see if you ve finished with the dessert suggestions so we can combine them and the main course not really lily replied stretching her neck oh james said he paused a moment before adding sarcastically well i thought you were working pretty hard must have not been the parchment you were studying so intently tom arms tightened around her but lily wrenched herself out of them and stood up quickly wh ja you she narrowed her eyes grabbed his arm roughly and turned to face tom i sorry tom i just need to go and have a talk about good manners with the head boy whirling around she dragged james out of the common room angrily and down the corridor a short distance from the fat lady she swung him around to face her what is your problem i donthave a problem james said he leaned against the wall and crossed his arms oh yes you do lily said angrily she put her hands on her hips and gazed at him dontdeny it why couldntyou leave me alone i have no idea what you re on about james said he looked up at the ceiling arentwe just wasting our time here nope lily replied she changed her tactics and imitated his pose we are going to stand right here until you decide to be mature you ll be out here all night do you think i care i dontknow do you lily was about to respond heatedly but bit her tongue just in time instead she fixed her gaze on his face determined that they would sort things out eventually after ten minutes of silence james finally tore his eyes away from his feet and sighed so are you going out with tom the question was so unexpected that it took lily by surprise dontchange the subject i not are you going out with him lily sighed deciding it was no use fighting him yes she said wearily do you like him what with the interrogation do you like him yeah lily failed to see the point of this but if it meant that he would eventually start talking she was all for it james looked uncomfortable all of a sudden then maybe i should warn you lily tom isntperfect excuse me he tends to uh kind of believe rumours without question lily was genuinely baffled about why he was saying this what on earth are you on about it just he tends to uh be one of those people that listen to rumours and take them seriously so uh be careful he wanted by a lot of girls in school all of whom know his weakness lily raised her eyebrows i can look after myself i was trying to help james said in a nettled tone i dontneed help lily shot back there nothing wrong and i dontsee why you have to take such an interest in my personal life i just saying tom isntas great as he seems what do you have against tom he a nice guy you cantdecide who i can and cantgo out with by this time their voices were escalating and what lily had originally thought of as a discussion was quickly becoming an argument why do you care that has nothing to do with it yes it does it has everything to do with it what do you have against him james glared at her is it something he does or says is it that he takes up space in the marauders dorm is it because you know girls are after him too is that it are you jealous james turned abruptly away from her lily stared at his back that it isntit you re jealous of him but why you re popular clever head boy what could you possibly be jealous about james sighed he turned around his arms still crossed defensively over his body but would not meet her eyes you know what in one respect i do envy him his voice was quiet and he rubbed the back of his neck uncomfortably but what can he have that you want you have everything there one thing he got that i haven t what that lily was genuinely curious by now there was no longer any anger in her tone for the first time james raised his head and looked directly into her eyes he got you and he walked away a n hi all excuse my late update what else is new and i promise to try and get the next one out as soon as i get half a chance no guarantees though from what i ve heard year 12 is a bitch when it comes to work grimaces encouraging no see my lj for a full explanation link on my profile love you all and love you even more if you leave a review cos the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you a n thank you guys all so much for your reviews it nice to know i haventbeen forgotten i would do review thank yous but if this fic gets taken down again for anything it wontbe going up again so i wontrisk it chapter 22 by the lake if lily had been at breakfast that morning she would have sat down in the place that emma had saved for her and observed the cheerfulness of her house table all looking forward to a lazy saturday morning marauders included she would have been too busy talking happily to emma to take much notice of the arrival of the owl post but eventually she would have looked up to the flurry of feathers and her eyes would have fixed on james she would then have picked up on the snowy owl that had swooped down to him and held out its leg simultaneously trying to dip its beak into his goblet and managing to knock it over spilling pumpkin juice all over the sausage sirius had been about to eat she would have watched as he untied the letter and stroked the owl gently before allowing it to fly off as he read the words before him lily would have perceived his eyes darkening to ebony and his jaw rigid with suppressed emotion she would have seen him look up briefly to close his eyes and take a deep shuddering breath before crumpling the letter forcefully hurling it from him with loathing and then getting up to walk quickly out of the hall his hands clenched at his sides to control the shaking she would have looked on in concern at remus and sirius identical expressions of alarm as they stared after him until sirius reached out to tentatively pick up the parchment and smooth it out she too would have stared at the expression of horror that spread over his handsome features as he read but she wasntat breakfast so she didn t in fact she woke up feeling relatively refreshed after a peaceful sleep she was the last one to wake although it was a saturday no cause for waking early and both her friends had left she stretched watching the way the cool november sunlight danced across the mirror and felt ready to face the day that was until she remembered the drama of the previous night everything good about her day more or less went out of the window after that she wanted to crawl back under the covers and hide which she did after a moment of lying there however she had to face the facts a few minutes of soul searching and replaying the events made lily see things in a clearer light perhaps she had been a little harsh on james he had been annoying her but when was he ever not annoying for all that he had in reality been trying to help her in his own twisted way and she had reacted defensively so both of them had become stubborn and irritated and things had gone a little too far as for the last thing he had said she chose to ignore that for the time being preferring to stick instead to the parts that she could explain away with muggle psychology so surely at least in the interests of headship it was up to her to be the bigger person and apologise for the way she had dug at him they were both so obstinate that unless someone made the first move they would never get anywhere having settled all of this although she hoped she wasnt over rationalising as much as it sounded like she was she sat up again just as the door burst open and sapphire ran in she flung herself on to her bed messing up the neatly made covers buried her head in her pillow and screamed lily stared what on earth she began sapphire lifted her head all i wanted was a quiet breakfast just a quick bite to eat before i hit the books i even got up early so i would be able to eat in peace but no apparently that too much to ask since i was hounded by not one not two but three idiots on the way down she punched her pillow violently and lily winced instinctively at the impact what happened she asked jumping as sapphire laid into her pillow again first off was derek balderwinde he decided to wave mistletoe at me again so i uh i erm saffy what did you do lily demanded slightly worried by the manic grin on her friend face i uh kneed him in a uhm sensitive place sapphire said only lightly she protested as lily looked scandalised well maybe a bit more than lightly ok maybe a little harder than that ok ok it was hard she smirked unrepentantly he might have to go to madam pomfrey and re evaluate his chances of becoming a father lily sighed deciding to let it pass who else she asked unsure whether she actually wanted to hear more or not let me see sapphire considered then leon wilkes came up to me in the entrance hall and asked if it was true that i was going out with black because if not he wanted me to know that his love for me was undying so i slapped him sapphire grinned i getting rather good at this self defence thing arenti lily shook her head you re impossible go on so then i walked into the great hall and i picked up a piece of toast when someone goes is this place empty it was keegan i just said it is now and got up and came here and i not happy i need food rolling her eyes lily stood up and started pulling out clothes tell you what i have some business to take care of but since i ll be skipping breakfast too wait for me in the common room and we ll go down to the kitchens together okay sapphire nodded and having extracted a promise from her friend that she would not physically harm any male for at least a few hours lily headed for the shower once she was dressed and ready with her cloak over her arm just in case she headed downstairs wondering whether james would still be at breakfast or would have gone off somewhere and if so how the hell she was to find him briefly she thought of going to the boys dorm and borrowing the marauder map she had found out about it last year when she had accidentally walked in on the four boys putting the final touches to it against her better instincts she had been sworn to secrecy about it and knew only that it was some sort of magical map that showed people in hogwarts though she had a sneaking suspicion that it also provided aid in the acquirement of butterbeer and sweets at times of celebration deciding not to bother lily reached the portrait hole just as it swung open to admit none other than sirius hey sirius she said have you seen james sirius focused on her and it suddenly dawned on her that he was not looking remotely like his usual cheerful self instead his face was tired but set as though it were a mask werentyou at breakfast this morning lily shook her head wondering inwardly what his cryptic manner was leading up to so you dontknow that james sister was was killed a bolt of shock shot through lily like lightning maddie she asked numbly sirius shook his head too looking almost annoyed with her no no james other sister alyssa lily lifted her hands to her mouth feeling almost numb from horror oh no oh yes i totally stamp all over the boy yesterday and today his sister is killed i am so going to bad girl hell when i die recollecting herself she asked hesitantly where is he sirius cool grey eyes studied her face before he answered i dontknow when i caught up with him he said he wanted to be alone and then disappeared the map lily asked feeling her heart sinking sirius shrugged he put some sort of charm on himself so that the map doesntshow him last i saw of him he was heading outside right lily said making her mind up she began putting her cloak on with shaky unco operative fingers thanks for the help sirius where re you going library lily said automatically disregarding the fact that she had no books and that a cloak was hardly what one would wear in a library she brushed past him and climbed out sirius gave her a few minutes and then hands in pockets walked to the window and looked out he smiled grimly despite the fact that the green verdure of summer had changed to the golden hues of autumn there was no mistaking the red haired girl walking swiftly away from the castle lily tramped across the grass pulling her cloak tight around her as the cold wind swirled about her tugging both her hair and her clothes in every direction above her clouds scudded across the overcast sky and reddy orange leaves spiraled down to rest on the dry hard ground she reached the edge of the lawns and paused for a moment to debate where james would be quidditch pitch the gardens driven by a gut instinct she swivelled and headed towards the lake her footsteps crunching on the gravel walk and yes there he was a lone figure sitting huddled on a bench messy black hair tossed by the same currents of air that rippled across the surface of the lake he appeared to be looking out across the water and from the back his pose was both defiant and defeated lily continued to walk along the deserted path until she was only a few paces behind him there she stopped and waited there was a long silence eventually he spoke words so quiet that lily nearly missed them you can sit down if you want mutely accepting the invitation lily came forward and sat down beside him she shivered as she came into contact with the cold wooden bench and wrapped herself into her cloak even more james i sorry there was no response just the sound of the wind not just about your your sister about yesterday as well i guess we should talk about that later james gave a bark of a laugh s ok i ve kind of got a better perspective on things now lily twisted her hands in her lap feeling the awkwardness of the situation all the more i i didnteven know you had another sister when sirius told me i thought he was talking about maddie james shrugged his eyes fixed on a non existent point on the water i have another sister alyssa she twenty one just came out of auror training oh lily did not know what to say how did she she paused trying to find the most delicate way of putting it die james smiled humourlessly she was a field operative she raided a suspected death eater rally point and they came back unexpectedly she threw herself in front of someone else to protect them and was murdered lily was silent trying to absorb all this new information she had never really imagined james as a person with a big family with sisters he had always been so arrogant that she had imagined until she found out about madeleine that he was an only child but then again james had changed and that was equivalent to everything changing she looked again at james trying to see him with two girls and saw how hard he was trying to keep his face emotionless and impassive his entire body was tense with the effort james she asked gently wouldntit be better to you know talk about it again there was no response the wind was the only one that whispered back ruffling both their hair minutes passed lily calming herself with the quiet of her surroundings realised suddenly that james was clenching and unclenching his hands though his face was still turned to the horizon the silence was almost stifling and lily wondered why she had come down here in the first place when surely sirius or remus would have been of more help still she kept quiet giving him the space to talk finally he let out a long breath slowly i should have known this was coming he said almost harshly lily was startled out of her silence what she asked james swallowed keeping his face turned away from her when alyssa just like i babysat maddie she had to look after me our parents were busy a lot before maddie came along she and i were really close i helped her dye her doll hair hot pink she taught me where to find the hidden chocolate supplies he closed his eyes again briefly and for a moment the mask broke and he looked so lost and child like that lily felt an almost maternal instinct to take him in her arms but of course with the standards she set that would be unacceptable so she gave him nothing but a sympathetic silence when i was old enough she sneaked me and her broom out once a week and taught me to play q quidditch his voice caught in his throat but then all at once as lily turned a compassionate eye one him the mask was back up in place and his face was blank once more his words seemed to come out with more of an effort the summer after she left hogwarts ally had a big fight with mum and dad even after she chose her newts they were hoping she would become a healer or something when she wanted to sign for auror t training they werenttoo happy even though dad an auror he didntwant her to get into the the same situations that he sometimes ended up in so they told her that it was too dangerous for her and that she should think of all the worry she would make mum go through james shrugged in a would be careless manner ally did it anyway four years of auror training she l loved it his voice was low so quiet that lily could barely hear the words he spoke before the restless wind stole them away and threw them into the sky she loved the friends the hours the food everything she finished last summer james breathed out a long held in breath there was another big fight over the holidays mum said it wasnttoo late that she could still start something else like healing ally said she wasntgoing to throw her four years away so then dad offered to get her a desk job but she wouldntlisten she was always stubborn the ghost of what should have been a smile flitted over his face she signed up and was cast as a field operative for the first time his carefully and rigidly controlled voice began to shake slightly the day before she sent off the acceptance letter she took me aside and told me that that there was a risk that she could die james impassive face wavered a little more in fact she said she probably would they were so short of aurors that they were sending anyone to do anything left right and center so she said she was telling me now because maddie was too young and mum and dad would freak he doesntdeal with the new operatives he in a different area if anything if anything did happen to her i should know that she loved us all of us and she hoped i would make a good eldest child to take her place his voice broke and he looked even further away from lily i ve know this could happen since july i shouldntbe doing this now yes you should lily said quietly james it perfectly alright to grieve for your sister james did not reply and lily could see that he was still fighting to maintain that infuriatingly impassive expression look at it a different way james she said your sister loved you and for the time that you were together you were close my sister wouldntcare if i was dead or alive for the first time james angled his head back towards her although not looking directly into her face at least it now seemed like some of her words had sunken in why he asked i thought you said she taught you when you were little lily laughed bitterly oh petunia and i were really close when we were young she paused you see my mother died when i was five so petunia was the one who helped me and played with me a few years later my father met another woman and we got a stepmother annabel lily shuddered even though petunia and i had the odd disagreement we banded together against her she had this thing about children being seen and not heard maybe she felt that we took away time from dad that she wanted dad was still the same loving person he always has been but annabel was so controlling in a bad way that my father never realised what she was doing to us lily lower lip trembled for a moment she used to mock me for being daddy little girl so i stopped running to dad for help and i ran for petunia instead calming herself lily smiled ruefully that is until i got my hogwarts letter dad wanted what was best for me and annabel was only too happy to see the back of me but petunia thought i was abandoning her to annabel on her own and gave me an ultimatum my sister or magic she shrugged i picked magic i lost my sister now if she talks to me at all it always laced with a few insults she looked out onto the opposite side of the lake for a few moments in quiet reflection and then came back to earth with a bump value what you had with your sister james she mumbled almost inaudibly it was special not all relationships are like that again there was another long silence in which neither person could quite manage to look at the other when james spoke his voice trembled even more i going to miss her looking at him lily saw his face screwed up as if with pain and finally she understood what it was that he had been fighting against all along himself james she said gently reaching out to turn his face towards hers it okay to cry james shook his head and resumed his gaze out into the distance i i have to stay he said tightly in a choked voice for for mum and dad and m maddie lily felt her own throat close up she sighed james she said softly you are strong you re strong and you re so stubborn in a good way that i know you ll get through anything you re persistent and you ll keep going following a natural instinct she gave in to the impulse and rested her head on his shoulder feeling the soft fabric of his expensive cloak beneath her cheek what else would have kept you asking me out since third year she laughed serenely that quite a feat since we both know i wasntthe nicest person to you she sighed again dontkid yourself james you re the strongest friend i have there was a pause after a while lily felt a sudden warm weight and she realised that it was james lying his own head on hers they stayed like that two figures in a bleak and lonely world and lily drifted off into a peaceful daze she remembered where she was when a drop of wetness fell onto her lips and darted her tongue out only to realise that it was salty he was crying a n what can i say except to once again apologise profusely for my extreme slowness in updating when i say sixth form a btch i am not joking i dontseem to have

review thank yous but if this fic gets taken down again for anything it wontbe going up again so i wontrisk it chapter 23 aftermath the rest of that day and the next passed in a vague haze for lily it did not take long after james had returned to the castle for people to notice that he was quieter than usual as were all the marauders and how the mischievous sparkle in his hazel eyes seemed to have faded out people began to ask questions and inevitably someone who was neither a marauder nor lily gave them answers after that came the sympathetic subtly intrusive questioning the insincere condolences the treat the bereaved as though they might break voices and the gossip of what had happened there were some who were honestly sympathetic emma and sapphire were both incredibly sorry for james and offered him their own simple words of comfort once lily had got permission from him to explain why she had been away for so long that morning on the other end of the scale were the marauder groupies as lily had now officially dubbed them who all decided to wear nothing but black to mark their sorrow little did they know that they would all be sent straight back to change by professor mcgonagall come monday morning was this what it meant to be popular lily wondered to have a million people at your beck and call but to be almost alone when tragedy struck to have your every move analysed and interpreted in a thousand ways nine hundred and ninety nine of which were not good she could not condemn the marauders though sirius remus and peter stuck staunchly by their friend trying to keep his spirits up and almost never left his side james himself appeared to be holding up as best as he could be expected to he was obviously trying to be as normal and unaffected as possible and appeared indifferent to the talk spreading through hogwarts stone halls of what was going on yet sometimes lily could see how badly he just wanted to be alone to be out of the public eye and how he occasionally lapsed from the cheerful tone he was attempting into a moody silence she noticed and she took it into account she saw too the newfound warmth and respect in his gaze when she sent off countless marauder groupies when she took on double head duties to allow him to get more sleep though the shadows under his eyes were proof negative of how well he managed that or when he saw the way that she treated him completely normally as opposed to treating him like a porcelain figure marked handle with care she spent much of her time doing homework in the common room that weekend near the marauders with half an eye on james while emma and sapphire worked with their backs to sirius and remus on sunday night lily fell into bed feeling incredibly exhausted more mentally than physically her head was whirling with confusion worry and she was dead to the world a few minutes after she hit the pillow thankful for the eight hours of sleep she had been granted the chance of but sleep did not come to the head girl bed that night she tossed and turned woken fitfully by the slightest noises her dreams when she was asleep were not of a forgiving nature either she dreamed of annabel not the brown haired woman who was her step mother did she see however but instead an annabel who was double the height of a man with hair that seemed alive a mass of writhing snakes and spittle that flew from her wide red mouth she came after lily with an unceasing ponderous tread not running as lily was doing and yet lily knew with a sick certainty that eventually she would catch up to her would seek her out with those dreadful bloodshot grey eyes just when she thought it was safe again and again the mocking laugh that had instilled both terror and shame in lily so many times as a child rang maliciously across the land of her nightmares aww the voice that she remembered so well jeered is wittle lily running to daddy again with the weeniest of problems what a baby over and over again the taunting words echoed through her head and she saw in all the clear headedness of older understanding the many incidents where annabel had forced her away from her father caused her to lose several friends endlessly dug at her many times did she wake from her turbulent dreams shaking and sweating with cold tears running down her face consequently when morning finally dawned lily was in no mood to be shaken awake by emma after ignoring her alarm clock she got up heavy eyed and walked to the bathroom as if drugged much the worse for her broken night the thought of transfiguration that day served only to depress her further and she packed her bag viciously throwing her textbooks in a headache had developed and she wondered dully if a pair of fairies with sledgehammers had taken up residence just above her eyes ignoring sapphire suggestion of the hospital wing and knowing full well that she both looked and felt awful lily followed her friends out of the dorm gave the marauders a weak tired smile in response to their greetings in the common room and then decided halfway down to the great hall that she was not in the mood for breakfast lagging behind emma and sapphire she quickly dodged them and set off through a series of passageways that led her to none other than the heads rooms the room calmed her as soon as she entered it it exuded an air of peacefulness which settled her mind and the flickering flames of the ever burning fire invited to her to sit down on one of the large squashy sofas she rested her head on her arm and checked her watch plenty of time before transfiguration she thought foggily the dancing tongues of flame lulled her and her head pounded so much without warning she fell asleep lily gradually lily began to feel a cautious but persistent shaking earthquake she thought mistily and then she was conscious of the fact that it was her who was being shaken on the shoulder with this realization she lifted her head startled and found herself almost nose to nose with james he leapt back alarmed it was then that she realised that she must have fallen asleep exactly as she was sitting upright on the sofa with her chin on her hand and her bag lying forgotten on the side finally james said i ve been trying to wake you up for fifteen minutes what the time lily asked faintly james looked at his watch six forty five with a cry of horror lily sprang up oh god i cantbelieve i slept through an entire day of classes every single professor is going to kill me a shadow passed over james face and as flustered as she was lily did not miss it sorry she apologised breathlessly it just oh how could i have let this happen i ve got to go find emma and then copy up the notes and do the homework and apologise to all the teachers oh mcgonagall going to skin me alive emma outside james said he had fallen back into his old pose of leaning against the wall with his arms crossed she said something about dumbledore lily groaned that it then i wonder if they ve ever demoted a head girl for missing all her lessons before at least i ll go down in history as the first if they haven t but it was an accident i swear i just had a bad night but that a really stupid excuse no one ll ever buy that seeing that she was going nowhere james steered her over to the door handing her bag to her as he went you re overreacting he said firmly if they can make me head boy with my history then they are not going to demote you for one day mistake go talk to emma she got all your stuff i think he pushed her out and climbed after her coming face to face with her best friend emma raised her eyebrows you took forever she looked at james what was she doing in there james shrugged sleeping i think that what she d been doing all day lily nodded fervently and emma rolled her eyes we ve been looking for you all day lils we looked everywhere it was only after charms that sapphire said you might be in here but then since james is the only other person who can get in we spent an hour and a half looking for him because he was off wandering around alone outside lily looked at james who met her eyes but then looked away hurriedly see you later he said awkwardly and walked off lily turned back to emma what this about professor dumbledore emma put a hand to her head oh yeah i forgot about that mcgonagall came to herbology asking where you were and when i didntknow she said to tell you that dumbledore wanted to see you at seven fifteen tonight lily felt her heart sink ok then no matter what james says about his nowhere near spotless track record it kind of obvious they re going to fire me i wonder how they ll do it maybe they ll yell at me first no knowing professor mcgonagall she ll probably give me a lecture on setting an example but it was only once maybe if i just tell them that i ll make up for it by doing detention but they ll never accept that as suitable for this i have to be the worst person in the world what other kind misses all her classes in one day actually scratch worst i have to be the most pathetic person most other people bunk off for fun i just fell asleep i so pathetic and stupid and irresponsible and emma took her friend arm and dragged her off down the corridor lily you re babbling she said calmly come on at this rate you wonteven make it up to his office let go lily let herself be walked up to the gargoyle and emma left her there having given her a five minute lecture on why she was not going to get demoted feeling ill and only slightly reassured by emma decided tones lily ascended the moving staircase and knocked on the door of dumbledore office a voice said come in and she pushed the door open you wanted to see me professor she asked nervously dumbledore turned around from the fireplace ah miss evans he said take a seat he gestured at a chair opposite and sat down at his desk lily slipped into the chair unsure of what was going to happen next dumbledore placed his elbows on the desk and looked at her so soberly that despite both james and emma reassurances lily was perfectly certain that she was going to lose everything she had worked for over the last six years she started forward sir i honestly didntmean to miss all my classes today it was just a mistake i fell asleep by accident i swear it wonthappen again dumbledore held up a hand to halt her flow yes i heard about that he said eyes twinkling it seems that several professors were concerned that one of their most dedicated students had disappeared without explanation particularly when none of her friends knew why rest assured your position is safe no i asked you here for a very different reason or perhaps not so different after all he stood up and walked away from her towards a window lily sighed quietly with relief and got up too to take a few steps towards the door expecting him to ask her to reschedule a prefect meeting or something of that sort there was silence for a few moments until lily thought that professor dumbledore might have forgotten her and she cleared her throat loudly to remind him of her presence dumbledore turned around last night miss evans i received a visitor who wished me to ask you something and to get permission for you to do something should you agree this person felt that i would possibly be more persuasive that they were after a little convincing myself i agreed to ask for them his eyes were twinkling again but lily could not understand how he could look so merry and yet so solemn mr potter wishes to invite you as a guest to his sister funeral this weekend i have given my permission for you to go for a moment lily thought she had heard wrong she grasped blindly behind her felt the solidness of a chair and collapsed into it what she said weakly of course i cantgo i have already granted permission to mr black mr lupin and mr pettigrew to accompany their friend to the ceremony as he put it there now remains only you to persuade what lily exclaimed i cantgo i not family and i hardly a close friend i not going how could i dumbledore sighed very well then he said he looked up at the ceiling as if lost in thought steepling his fingers as i see it there is only one option left to you then what that lily asked uneasily you shall attend the funeral in a head girl capacity dumbledore said looking very much pleased with his idea wh what lily gasped no now miss evans i am sure you do not intend to neglect your duties like this dumbledore said cheerfully you will represent the students of hogwarts you can accompany me to the ceremony and to the small gathering they are holding afterwards as the head girl i am sure that is a suitable arrangement for you wh bu that not fair lily protested i think you will find that it is perfectly acceptable beneath the calm and dignified tones of authority lily could have sworn she could detect a hint of amusement in the old man voice this is purely a duty of the head girl which she is required to fulfil that is all there is to it but i cantget there or anything lily clutched at her last remaining straw hoping it would make her point that is a simple problem to resolve dumbledore replied smiling benignly you will floo from my office with me and when i leave i shall bring you he sat down at his desk i suggest you consider the matter as settled it was evident that the conversation was at an end lily opened her mouth to protest then thought better of it and left the office she made her way back to the common room mind reeling distracted she wandered down the empty corridors one part of her a very much used to getting its own way part was seriously tempted to go and find james and yell at him eventually though lily had to accept that considering his recent loss and the fact that he had actually bothered to ask her indirectly to a family occasion it was hardly appropriate to do so instead she contented herself with muttering a few well chosen expressions under her breath as she neared the fat lady entering the common room she scanned it and spotted emma working on some homework she pulled a chair over and began to copy up notes from the classes she had missed all the while telling emma what had happened emma listened as she worked adding a few exclamations here and there but seemed inclined to take much the same view as dumbledore had for some inexplicable reason just then there was a big commotion at the portrait hole and lily turned around to see remus and sirius enter with a collection of birds yes birds sirius had a turkey under one arm and a chicken in the other both of who were attempting to peck him remus held a perch on which a large snowy owl was sitting glaring balefully at everyone with eyes of amber a strangely docile peacock was strutting proudly at his feet looking very pleased at all the attention as everyone sprang aside when it opened its tail feathers the chicken squawked as someone accidentally hit its head and the turkey stopped pecking sirius long enough to aim for the unfortunate person both boys seemed completely undisturbed by the amount of attention they were attracting they were discussing something together and completely ignoring those around them lily turned back to emma who was watching the two with a mixture of amusement and wistfulness and was about to say something to her when emma stiffened eyes fixed on a point behind and then looked down quickly there was only one person who could cause this acting fast lily swivelled back feeling as though she was a spectator at a tennis match the ball in your court remus remus did indeed appear to be turning away from their direction rather hastily he said something to sirius who was having difficulties trying to stop the chicken and turkey they had apparently decided to band together to peck him simultaneously sirius nodded and remus hung the perch on his arm slowly making his way to the stairs sirius gave his friend a look which lily was at a loss to interpret she did not have long to wonder however before she realised that remus himself was heading over to them a look of steely determination on his face lily emma can i talk to you for a moment lily nodded but emma jumped up oh god look at the time i should really go to bed i can finish this tomorrow i sure she piled her books together as fast as she could em lily began but emma ignored her remus could only stand there and watch as she rolled up her pieces of parchment and placed them on top of the books she turned around to get her bag and all at once there was a loud clatter she had knocked against the table in her haste and all her work and tidily piled books had fallen to the floor darting a glance at remus she bent down and hurriedly picked the parchment up pushing them roughly into her bag after a moment remus bent down and piled the books together before handing them to her she gave him a desultory look as she took them off him standing up she hesitated for a moment before saying in a falsely cheery voice night lils to remus she gave only another glance her eyes cold and a brief nod lily stared open mouthed at her friend lack of manner as she walked away and remus eyes were stormy and then he did something totally unexpected for the second time in his life remus lupin lost control wait he called after her in such a powerful voice that emma did actually halt on the steps her back still turned what is your problem remus demanded roughly emma looked back at him for a moment her mouth opened as if to say something and then she shook her head and carried on climbing fine remus yelled fine if that the game you want to play emma then let play it he stared angrily at her retreating back his cheeks flushed and his body tense you mean nothing to me now absolutely nothing you hear me forget you there was no reply only the sight of emma black robes whipping around the corner remus turned to face the staring common room what re you looking at he growled menacingly immediately everyone head snapped back down and remus looked at lily pushing his sandy hair out of his handsome face she was shocked at the almost beast like vehemence in his eyes uh she said scrambling up to throw things into her bag anxious both to avoid remus in this mood and to find her friend sorry remus i have to go talk to emma with that she fled upstairs calling a goodnight over her shoulder she slammed her dormitory door with a considerable amount of feeling mostly anger directed at emma looking around she saw the brown haired girl putting her crumpled and messy books and parchment neatly away in her area what is your problem em she asked stalking over to her for the third time that evening emma stiffened lily sat down beside her and continued to talk i know saffy made me promise not to force you into anything but i dontcare any more what re you going to do i mean i sorry but you re playing with him and it worse because you left him hanging you never said anything for definite one way or another she paused wondering if emma could even hear her she was still restacking her books slowly with infinite care do you really abhor him that much em cause you re going to have to make a decision now silence a slight rustle as emma pushed aside her curtain a little to allow her to carry on laying out her trunk contents with mathematical precision just as lily was beginning to give up hope she got a reply i ve made my decision emma said softly i just dontthink it going to happen what is it lily sat up straight attention caught by this news emma closed her trunk carefully and looked at lily i like remus a lot she returned her concentration to folding her clothes but it ll never work out my family they wouldntbe happy to hear about it and besides you heard him just now lily shook her head then why do you act so cold to him and yeah he angry em but i think he angry because he likes you and he thinks you ve rejected him he hates me lily donttry to deny it and for some part i probably deserve it it better like it is now i ll just pretend to hate him and he ll be happy with someone else again lily shook her head i dontthink you understand em she said earnestly you re the only person who ll make him happy why else has he waited for you since fourth year it better this way emma repeated lily lost what little patience she had better how exactly are you really going to go back to how you were before with you hiding your feelings until they got too much for you can you really kid yourself that that ll work or are you just thick emma voice when she answered was a lot angrier than before you re not me lily so why are you trying to make my choices for me you think it easy to sacrifice him any hope of an us lily expression softened that exactly what he called you a sacrifice for being what he is she paused the memory of his saddened face contrasting with the hard anger she had just seen please pleasedontdo this em she begged inwardly she sighed at what a go between she was being reduced to they better thank me for this later if there is a later emma shrugged she had climbed onto her bed and was lying spread eagled exhaling lily got up okay fine she said pleadingly will you at least talk to him before you make up your mind completely he deserves to know where he stands you owe it to him emma nodded non committally just dontexpect me to the door swung open and callie flounced in giving the two girls a dismissive glance we arentworthy of her highness attention emma mumbled causing lily to snort with laughter their conversation had obviously come to an end she just hoped that it would eventually be productive a n sheepish uhm hi everyone yeah i know you thought i d fallen off the face of the earth story clutched firmly in hand right well i didn t the first term of sixth form been really hectic and i ve kind of let academic and school commitments take over all the other aspects of my life resulting in me becoming a very sad antisocial person and i need to go back to balancing it all out so as soon as module exams are finished in january i will post more regularly get this story up to where it was before and continue it to the end because i owe all my faithful reviewers that at least anyway hopefully you all enjoyed this chapter review please the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you chapter 24 funeral voices on saturday morning lily woke up with a strong sense of foreboding although it took her a few moments to remember why as she got up and walked quietly past her sleeping roommates she knew without a shadow of a doubt that this would be a very long day having showered she came back to the room and stared contemplatively at her open trunk with piles of clothes thrown messily around inside she had spent two hours the night before trying to find something anything that was suitable to wear to a funeral she had only ever gone to one once when she was eight for a cousin of her father s and her own mother s of course she blinked furiously as images rushed unbidden into her mind and closed her eyes trying frantically to simultaneously shut them out and wipe the lone tear from her face it was an experience she worked hard not to think about returning to the issue of clothing she had gone to bed frustrated at her lack of wardrobe now surveying the mess before her she debated on what to do one option was to wake up her friends and ask if they owned anything but she doubted they would the other was to change the clothes she owned by charming them it was a practice she saw carried out regularly by serena and callie to give the appearance of a new outfit for every day but she was much more sceptical about doing it to her own clothing still it was the only choice that appeared feasible she picked out an outfit a white tank top a long sleeved white net top to go over it and a long skirt and laid them out on her bed screwing her eyes up in concentration she chanted the spell and watched as her clothes slowly faded from their various colours to black relieved she pulled them on added a pair of tights and shoes and then walked over to the full length mirror she stared at herself critically it seemed alright fairly conservative and adult though she had a few qualms about the neck of the lace top which was shallow but very wide oh well shrugging she turned her attention to her hair and decided in the end to leave it loose due to her limited time hurriedly putting on some make up she left the room grabbing a bag as she went she made her way to dumbledore office in record time feeling as if her stomach had twisted over on itself just as she was nearing the gargoyle she saw three figures approaching from the opposite direction stopping short she stood still and waited and a few seconds later sirius remus and peter were in front of her all were dressed impeccably in black suits their hair neat and tidy their faces fresh they greeted one another quietly and lily gave the password that brought the gargoyle to life where james lily asked as it sprang aside and they climbed onto the moving staircase he left last night sirius said from behind her to be with his family he ll be glad you came though he was worried in case you decided not to go at the last minute but you look nice he added approvingly refusing to deny that the idea had crossed her mind more than once lily simply contented herself with a thanks and the allowed the silence to carry her up to the top as they knocked on the door and trooped in dumbledore looked up ah he said good morning miss evans mr black mr lupin mr pettigrew i am glad to see you all in good time and looking spruce he too was looking sober dressed as he was in black robes with a silver clasp at the top now if we are all ready a moment please dumbledore came a lazy voice from the side lily turned to see a wizard with a pointed beard wearing the slytherin colours watching them from his picture she did not have time to wonder who he was before she heard sirius let out a low hiss from beside her you he muttered dumbledore turned to face the portrait yes phineas he asked politely terribly sorry to interrupt phineas drawled but i have a message for the black sheep of the black family he looked at sirius your mother wishes me to say that although you have a habit of consorting with the worst company here he looked disdainfully at lily and remus she expects you to uphold the black honour at this function that you are going to she also says that should you set foot in the household again it must be with purer morals than you have at present sirius expression was twisted you think i you think i give a damn what that hag says he spat angrily go tell her to stuff her message up her arse because i ve got no intention of setting foot in that dump the only reason she even bothered to send a message was because this is a pureblood function isntit language mr black dumbledore said gently remus placed a calming hand on sirius shoulder as lily stared in disbelief it doesntmatter dumbledore phineas said languorously i understand how self absorbed young people are he gave lily and remus one more distasteful look and then drifted sideways out of his painting his words floating back to them always was over independent lily was still staring at sirius as though she had never seen him before she had time to comment however dumbledore moved forward since there are several of us he said i felt a portkey would be a cleaner and more convenient way of travel he held out a broken six pack holder take hold please everyone grasped a part of the plastic and a few seconds later lily felt a jerk behind her navel dumbledore office disappeared in a swirl of colour and instead they were standing on a dirt beaten path in the middle of a clearing with bare oak trees all around them dumbledore dusted himself off and then led the way out of the trees the four student following behind him despite herself lily could not help sneaking another look at sirius pale face he noticed yeah he said in a low voice now you know what my family like doing her best to appear unruffled lily merely shrugged you re obviously different sirius made no reply and they walked on in silence until their reached a tall grey wall with a pair of black gates they looked forbidding despite the wintery sunlight hitting them dumbledore pushed them open and strode through them allowing the four teenagers to pass behind him they walked now on a grassy field with grey headstones dotted here and there in no particular order a few moments later lily caught her first glance of a gathering of people standing under a huge oak tree dumbledore left the path and began threading his way through grass and gravestones until he reached the people standing there taking a look around as she took her place beside sirius lily wondered at the beauty of the spot although the tree was almost bare there was a wonderful reddy gold carpet of leaves underfoot and she could see that in summer the branches that stretched up into the sky would be covered with leaves and would cast a pretty green light over the spot tiny withered stems were all around the base of the tree evidence that there were obviously many flowers to be seen here in spring the tree itself seemed to support much life a yellow speckled ivy had twisted itself around the dull brown bark and looking up lily was almost sure she could see a squirrel hole i ve never seen such a nice place to say goodbye she thought wistfully remembering for a brief instant the small old churchyard where she had watched her mother be laid to rest she was jolted out of her thoughts by the whisperings around her and she realised that they were attracting quite a lot of attention several people were looking at the four teenagers and she could hear the muted whispers students at hogwarts friends of her brother james sirius remus and peter appeared to be free of unease about what was going on around them they were standing in silence and it dawned on lily that they would probably know a few of these people if they had visited james house for parties before she looked around again at the people gathered there most were adults in black robes or suits family and friends she supposed several of them had a hint of james feature here and there one old lady had his sharp hazel eyes and another man hair though pale brown was as messy as james had always been james himself and his family did not appear to be there a few teenagers or young children were interspersed among the adults and lily assumed that they were cousins or children of family friends a square jawed girl with carrot orange hair who looked slightly older than lily nodded curtly at her and lily attempted a weak half smile as she looked hurriedly away turning her gaze she saw a group of young adults two girls and two boys standing together and it struck her that perhaps these were alyssa friends they certainly looked around her age the age that she would have been and seemed more solemn and quiet that the others and the man standing beside them could pass quite well for a muggle army sergeant relentlessly drilling recruits through assault courses lily sighed the sun had gone back behind clouds and it seemed to have dampened the already sober mood she felt a small pressure on her arm and looked discreetly sideways to see remus sirius and peter all giving her a slight grim yet friendly smile as if to cheer her out of hr gloom she smiled back and then stared at the hole in front of her waiting to swallow the coffin which would be borne in almost as a sacrificial offering another hopeless sacrifice to plead for the end of these evil times finally footsteps sounded on gravel and as one everyone turned to see a handsome mahogany coffin being carried towards them on the shoulders of six pall bearers dressed in black lily breath hitched as they made their slow way towards them and the people present parted like water to give them clear access to the freshly dug grave as they turned towards them she saw for the first time the four people walking behind the coffin it was james family his father a tall man dressed in a black suit was walking with a woman who must have been his mother mr potter looked very like his son same messy black hair and hazel eyes and much the same build he even walked in a similar way it was like looking at an older version of james himself the woman james mother looked wan and pale but her face was set a calm expression on it which was at the same time heartrending she was just slightly shorter than her husband her hair was a deep deep auburn almost brown in its intensity and her eyes were grey framed with long lashes and set in a delicate heart shaped face she was wearing a simple black dress understated but obviously finely made behind them walked none other than james and a girl who was obviously maddie lily took a moment as they approached to observe him he was dressed like everyone else in a black suit with a crisp white shirt beneath his hair was its usual mess but his face was almost stonily composed and as pale as a ghost his eyes were fixed on the coffin in front and despite the occasion lily could not help but notice how all four of the marauders could clean up so well apparently she was not the only one to think so she could hear sharp intakes of breath from several girls around and see their raised eyebrows from the corner of her eye as they spotted him maddie walking beside him seemed to be dwarfed by her brother shadow although in reality as lily would find out later she was only slightly shorter than lily herself her black hair was long enough to lie on her shoulders and her head was down though as they advanced lily could just about make out the tear tracks on her cheeks finally the pallbearers reached the grave and the coffin was set down the potter family lined up in a row next to it and then james mother stepped forward a wreath of pure white roses and a square object in her hands she laid the wreath onto the lid the object was stood next to it and lily recognised it as a wizarding photograph a pretty young woman was the focus her auburn hair glinting under the sun as she stood on the grass with a huge house behind her she appeared to be laughing at someone behind the camera and as lily watched she stuck her tongue out merrily squinting lily could just about make out her clear hazel eyes dancing as she smoothed her top over her jeans and stuck her tongue out again with a shock lily realised that this must have been alyssa just last summer she looked around the right age before she had time to study the picture closer a man whom she had not noticed stepped forward i welcome you all to the funeral of alyssa caroline potter he said in a deep soothing voice we are gathered here today to remember her in life and commemorate her in death she was a wonderful person full of life and her presence will be missed by all he looked around as if to check that no one had fallen asleep at his monotones and then resumed his speech we have several people today who have consented to share their thoughts with us this morning so that her memory will be treasured forever taking out a piece of parchment he placed a pair of silver glasses on his nose and read off may i call sergeant m wood forward please the hard faced man stepped forward from the group of teenagers he cleared his throat then looked around at all the people i was recruit potter or rather alyssa instructor for four years at alnwood academy he said his tones were rough the voice of someone more used to giving than taking orders let me tell you now that i am not a kind man i do what needs to be done to force young people into showing talent if they have any for auror training by the time i done with them they will be showing it at alnwood we aim to produce fine aurors with resourcefulness cunning determination and courage is he supposed to be a walking advert or something lily found herself wondering alyssa did have talent she was resourceful and determined to get through whatever she had to do that was what got her through alnwood she was one hundred percent dedicated to her aim no matter what anyone else said and i know that she did face problems at the beginning his gaze was hard and penetrating dontfool yourself into thinking alyssa potter was a perfect person or a perfect auror she wasn t she had her faults and in a sense i could say that it was a fault that killed her but i won t because not all faults are as bad as the word suggests and i sure that recruit longbottom who is now in hospital is grateful for his life which she saved he paused alyssa was hardworking and i sure that the rest of the family will follow in her footsteps whichever career path they choose his eyes lingered on james who pale as he already as met him with a straightforward gaze chin up sergeant wood stepped back and the officiator cleared his throat andrew marx a tall brown haired boy stepped forward from the group of four his chin trembling slightly his eyes reminded lily of remus they were calm and gentle but with a secret fire raging in the depths i he stopped his voice caught in his throat i speaking on behalf of myself jenny rebecca and jack we were alyssa best friends from school through to alnwood and into the field he swallowed i think we can all agree that ally knew how to have a good time there was never a dull moment when she was around she could inject humour into any moment and it would brighten up your day she always had a caring word to say if you were feeling down and always had a spare moment to listen to problems he swallowed again i think what i trying to say is that ally was one of a kind no one will ever replace her as lily studied his face she could see his terse jaw and the way that his eyes glistened i can guarantee you that he looked down at the ground and looked up again a shaky smile on his face when ally parents first asked us to talk we put our heads together to try to think of what to say i think so far i ve covered almost everything we came up with but now i going to say something unplanned his smile weak as it was wavered and died i was in love with alyssa there was silence lily knew she couldnthave been the only person staring almost everyone was the three young people behind had their mouths hanging open i liked her right the way from our third year at hogwarts but it took me four years to admit it to myself i hid my feelings from everyone including my closest friends and i made up excuses about why i hadnttold her that i didntwant to ruin our friendship that she had enough to handle without me adding a burden the truth was i was too stubborn to face my fear of her rejection so she never knew and now she never will he suddenly seemed to stand straighter and looked taller his chin up so as much as this is a memorial speech it also a warning he looked around the crowd never be afraid to show your feelings to the one you love no matter what the consequences because the time may come when it too late and all you can do is regret what could have been lily tore her eyes off his still form her mind still reeling from his confession and looked up to see james eyes on her an intense gaze in them embarrassed and afraid of what she could read lily looked away andrew stepped closer to the coffin and looked down i so sorry ally he said softly i so sorry i never told you how i really felt a solitary tear made its way down his cheek i will always love you and miss you silently he let go of a blood red rose where it fell at the foot of the photo and walked back to his friends head bowed people were still staring at andrew where he stood and although the three around him still looked shell shocked one of the girls still gave him a comforting hug again the officiator stepped forward and finally on behalf of the potter family james potter this was a surprise james had not said anything about speech making but then again he had not said anything about the funeral in the first place james fumbled in his pocket for a piece of crumpled parchment which he skimmed over briefly well he said with the barest hint of a sad smile it looks like everyone taken all of the stuff i intended to say so this is going to have to come straight from the heart sorry if it sounds a bit stupid he looked at the photo for a few seconds as if for inspiration alyssa was a lot of things to a lot of people she was a daughter a sister a friend and aunt a cousin and occasionally a girlfriend i know she sometimes felt under pressure to do all those things well and set an example to all of us who were younger than her but i think she managed just fine to me ally was my big sister the one who taught me how to take cookies when mum wasntlooking and the one who i could run to in times of trouble when she would tell me everything was going to be alright even if it wasn t we had our fair share of arguments probably more actually we were too alike in personality so we clashed a lot james voice gave out a little but even with our fights she taught me more than just pranks she taught me to be myself maybe a little too much here james looked directly at lily throwing her into a momentary whirlpool of confusion but it was the intention that mattered and that was always good pausing james looked back at maddie as if for encouragement to go on and when she gave a slight nod he continued this time rather more hesitantly ally didntthink that people could ever completely die she she believed very much that those who love us never truly leave us and she always told me that they were all around us and in us maddie and i found a poem which we thought was appropriate for this because it suited her so well he beckoned to maddie who came forward next to him and smoothed out yet another piece of parchment she began to read the first verse and james took turns in alternating verses until their voices joined in chorus on the last stanza do not stand by my grave and weep i am not there i do not sleep i am a thousand winds that blow i am the softly falling snow i am the gentle showers of rain i am the fields of ripening grain i am in the morning hush i am in the graceful rush of beautiful birds in circling flight i am the starshine of the night i am in the flowers that bloom i am in a quiet room i am with the birds that sing i am in each lovely thing do not stand at my grave and cry i am not there i did not die as their voices faded into silence maddie folded up the parchment her hands shaking the two of them muttered a quiet thank you and made their way back to their parents the officiator came forward again and embarked on a long monotonous speech lily was startled to find tears in her eyes as she looked at the photo in silence and realised with a pang that now alyssa could never exist as more than a memory in people minds a tear dropped onto her cheek and she wiped it hastily away unnoticed by all but james twenty minutes later the officiator finally finished speaking and after the final goodbye the coffin was lowered into the ground lily sirius remus and peter all watched as it was covered with earth and levelled off a headstone was revealed in the ground and lily read the inscription alyssa caroline potter beloved daughter sister and friend missed by many and beneath that her dates of birth and death and surprisingly a colour photograph of her almost the same as that which had stood on the coffin they stood in silence all of them with heads bowed everyone expression was sombre and quite a few old ladies were dabbing at their cheeks tears fell quietly from andrew eyes eventually the officiator raised his head well that concludes the proceedings he said quietly now if you would all like to adjourn to the potter house there are refreshments available the groups of people began to move towards the opposite end of the cemetery and squinting lily could just about make out a pair of gates in the distance people were walking in twos and threes talking quietly and lily could make out james and his family at the front his head bent towards maddie as she said something she found herself walking next to remus at this point and a sudden thought occurring to her turned towards him remus how re we getting to their house remus looked at her in surprise didnti tell you he asked we cantgo sirius peter and i have detention with professor mcgonagall soon so we werentallowed but then lily felt it sounded rather pathetic to say this but there was no other option what about me remus shrugged ask dumbledore lily looked around but the headmaster was nowhere to be seen trying to ignore the knot of worry in her stomach she walked on and soon reached the gates strangely enough although it appeared to be a fairly quiet side road with a small park opposite there were a large number of cars parked along the sides in an effort to stop the little voice in her head which was setting off alarm bells about what she was supposed to do she let her gaze drift up the road it was funny how many people liked to buy silver cars she thought dreamily her eyes lingered particularly on a pretty bmw parked halfway up the road its silver paintwork sparkling i want a car like that when i old enough and rich enough she decided sighing she turned back to the people around her hoping to see a sign of dumbledore but he was nowhere to be found james as standing with his three best friends he appeared to be saying something in a low voice sirius was looking uncharacteristically solemn the next moment he and james hugged each other like brothers lily turned away smiling as remus did the same suddenly she saw a familiar long white beard and realised with a start that dumbledore was indeed standing a few metres away hastily she started towards him but he simply smiled at her and disapparated with a slight pop lily froze her mouth open in a silent oh of astonishment quickly she looked around to see that over half the people had gone and more were disapparating as she watched sirius remus and peter had gone too by portkey she supposed panic really was bubbling up inside her now constricting her airway then james appeared at her elbow there you are he said come on what you and maddie are coming with me he jerked his head at his sister who was walking up the road and headed after her obviously expecting lily to follow baffled she caught up with him how by car james replied briefly fumbling through his pockets lily gaped openly at him you can drive james pulled out a set of car keys and held them up as if for evidence passed the test last summer so how did you get here lily asked her brain still trying to digest this new information james looked at her as though she had gone insane by car he said slowly he halted in front of a silver car and lily mouth promptly dropped open again this is yours she asked faintly staring at the sleek bmw that she had been admiring not five minutes ago after ten years of saving like hell yeah james said i wanted one of these ever since i found out they existed when i was seven after that i saved as much as i could plus i did work with muggle builders over the summers did anyone ever tell you that wizards are a lot more tight fisted with pay he pushed a button watched as the car unlocked itself lights flashing as it did so and then opened the door for her plus dad agreed to pay one third of the price after i got my owl grades you and maddie can sit in the back and talk to each other he shut them in and then climbed in himself maddie gave lily a small smile as she settled herself but did not say anything james adjusted the rear view mirror and pulled out of the parking space as they drove down various side roads lily had an opportunity to observe maddie at closer range as she stared out of her window she could see at once that maddie was going to be a person who turned heads as she walked past although still growing up her face had an open charm to it that was very appealing the radio was playing a new song quietly in background but it did nothing to disguise the silence between the three people and eventually james sighed honestly he said as they stopped at a t junction normally neither of you can shut up and here you are acting as if your tongues had been cut out he turned into a main road fine i ll reintroduce you lily this is my sister maddie maddie this is lily head girl at hogwarts you two are quite alike so you ought to get on there was an awkward silence for a few moments until maddie spoke so what it like to be head girl lily paused scary she finally admitted everyone expects you to do a great job but if you do it not such a great deal because obviously it goes without saying that you do well and it a lot of hard work i wontsay that it hasntgot its perks though she added thinking of the head rooms so you work with james yeah the car stopped at a set of traffic lights a grin flitted across maddie face do you get on with him i we uh lily hesitated james eyes were fixed on her in the rear view mirror and her cheeks began to go pink she swallowed well she said diplomatically regathering her composure we do now so you didntbefore maddie asked she turned round fully to face lily her expression interested and this was enough to relax lily no she said carefully as the car swung onto the motorway he uhm annoyed me a little the fact that james had been forced to direct his gaze elsewhere for a moment gave her a sudden rise in confidence actually that an understatement he had an incredible talent for infuriating me every time he was within fifty paces which was basically all the time what did he do maddie asked intrigued lily smiled up until our third year he hated me and then all of a sudden he decided to ask me out mostly in the most embarrassing arrogant ways possible i had an entire vocabulary of creative names that i used every time i had to yell at him maddie laughed typical james said his eyes on the road you finally get talking and the topic if conversation is about how much of a prat i am was lily corrected let face it james why else is there only one thing i remember you doing to me in all six years that i classed as sweet what was it maddie asked curiously judging by james expression or rather what she could see of it he had just remembered at the beginning of third year after our last and probably worst fight i spent three days in a seriously bad mood she laughed i honestly wrote a long list of three hundred ways of murdering james potter i still say it was him who was in the wrong but we were both stubborn so we avoided eachother like the plague her face took on a dreamy look as she became lost in the recollections then our potions professor had a go at him because of something or other that he d done wrong in his potion except it was actually the professor fault because he hadntwritten that instruction up on the board so i stood up and started protesting ended up in an argument with the teacher threw a fit and stormed out of the classroom only time i ve ever done that her mouth twisted in a half smile one week detention my first ever detention for james potter sake my friends thought i was mad his friends thought i was mad even i thought i was mad after dinner i actually went up to ask madam pomfrey the nurse if i was ill because i was so convinced there was something horribly wrong with me i never knew that james said in surprise from the front you never asked lily retorted anyway when i got up to my dormitory that night there was a rose lying on my pillow with a note what did it say lily could see the back of james neck in front of her going slowly red i sorry i never saw the rose behind the thorns she smiled reminiscently i dontknow how but i knew it was from him how sweet maddie said delightedly as they came off the motorway and began to drive down country lanes james shifted uncomfortably in his seat neck still red yes wasntit lily said looking rather nostalgic then she took on a matter of fact tone of course two days later he tried to talk me into going out with him so i slapped him and that pretty much what happened for the next three years james cleared his throat now that you ve finished discussing our personal history you might realise that we re nearly here lily looked at her watch have we really been driving for half an hour you were rather caught up james said dryly they rounded a bend in the road and lily stared rising up to meet them was a large house almost a mansion at least three storeys high in front was a semi circular drive neatly gravelled with a border of plants around the edge james entered the driveway and the car rolled to a smooth halt the three of them got out i still cantbelieve you can drive lily said as they walked up the drive yeah but the downside of it is that i have to ferry my sister around in the holidays puts a bit of a damper on any plans for wild parties james said he unlocked the front door and led the way in the sound of soft violin music met lily ears and she wondered at the quality of the sound system that could make the tunes sound so like live music she looked around as she was led down the hall noting the wooden panelling of the walls and the contrasting pictures of abstract art that hung upon them welcome to the manor james said he brushed futilely at his hair and pulled at his tie before leading the way into a large room through a pair of double doors for what felt like the millionth time in a few short hours lily stared the room looked like more of a hall with more wooden flooring and panelled walls in one corner upon a raised platform was the source of the violin music not a sound system but an actual string quartet playing soft classical music many of the people from the funeral party were standing around as well as some that seemed to have just turned up lily spotted mr and mrs potter talking quietly to an old witch james gave maddie a slight shove maddie you re supposed to be serving he hissed maddie turned around rubbing her back and glared at her brother why me she muttered because mum told you to now go sighing maddie departed presumably to the kitchen though not without giving james a dark look and a strong shove back i ll get you back for this later lily raised her eyebrows james rubbed the spot on his arm where she had pushed him sisters he said he looked at his watch i d better go tell mum we arrived safely you ll be okay here for a few minutes right sure lily said trying to sound nonchalant james headed towards his parents she watched as he said something to them and they replied fighting back a smile as she saw mrs potter tug at her son tie clearly trying to do it for him she looked around again and suddenly felt very insignificant amidst these people all of whom seemed to know each other she was about to retreat to a corner when a flash of silver caught her eyes and she looked over to see professor dumbledore in conversation with a middle aged woman he turned smiled and beckoned her towards him nervously she moved there ah madam fawcett this is miss evans our head girl it a pleasure to meet you lily said attempting to look politely interested likewise i sure the woman smiled kindly so how do you know the family are you james girlfriend lily had to work hard not to gawk at the woman inquisitiveness no i simply representing hogwarts ah madam fawcett tipped a huge wink at her but was unable to continue due to the girl that suddenly appeared carrying a tray would you care for a vol au vent maddie asked with supreme politeness proffering the silverware the three of them took a roll off the tray and as she turned maddie caught lily eye rolled her own at the two older people and grinned lily smiled and watched as she walked off towards another group feeling that at least one person sympathised with her she turned back to hear the end of madam fawcett speech such a sweet tempered girl she is she was saying come dumbledore i must introduce you to mr pringle we were having a rather interesting discussion on she dragged the headmaster away and lily was left alone wishing with all her might that professor mcgonagall had not chosen to give detentions out on a saturday she was the only person in the room who was on her own and was beginning to feel distinctly awkward about it james appeared to be talking to a young man who had waylaid him a few minutes later he politely extricated himself and made his way over to lily how re you doing he asked not bad lily answered as truthfully as possible well come on i ll take you to meet my parents james said what lily said horrorstruck no james gave her an exasperated look you re not meeting the pope or anything come on uh uh lily protested she backed up against the wall i was doing fine here they ll never notice me for heavens sake james said and he grabbed hold of her arm and discreetly dragged her over to where his parents were standing mum dad this is lily evans she head girl at hogwarts mr and mrs potter smiled at her and they suddenly seemed a lot less awful nice to meet you dear mrs potter said lily smiled nervously so you work with james do you that must take some doing lily shot a sideways glance at james yeah it does she agreed mischievously james groaned first maddie now you mrs potter raised her eyebrows at her son and then turned back to lily lily evans that rings a bell for some reason she looked thoughtful lily evans lily evans your initials are l e i take it yes they are lily said feeling slightly bemused interesting mrs potter said your owl year james for a moment james looked quite as confused as lily felt then all of a sudden he turned bright red mum he choked out i didntsay anything dear mrs potter said sweetly she fixed james with a beady look now since you are a member of this family why dontyou go and talk to a few of your relatives they all want to talk to you and you d better not do anything to your tie either she added as james scowled and walked over to an old wizened looking man mrs potter watched him hoist a polite smile onto his face always a handful she murmured affectionately before redirecting her attention so lily what are you planning to do after hogwarts well i hoping to go into healing if my grades are good enough lily pushed her hair behind her ear just like me mrs potter said giving her a smile dontworry about it too much dear i sure you ll make it given your current position thank you lily responded at that moment a faint crash of breaking glass was heard and mrs potter frowned if maddie broken a set of glasses again excuse me dear i ll just go and find out what going on back there she walked off and lily retreated to a side where she could remain unobserved for twenty minutes she stood feeling more at ease than she had done for much of the day because she knew that as long as she looked demure she could do no wrong she felt more sorry for james though he was forced to seem polite and pleasant to all the people in the room which he had to circulate through to someone who had unconsciously learnt his moods over the last two months it was quite plain to see how his painful smile never reached his eyes after a while lily began to be aware that the carrot orange haired girl who had nodded at her in the funeral was staring at her feeling self conscious she turned around to examine the mantelpiece behind her and noticed for the first time the photo set in the centre the adorable tousle haired boy in the middle could only be james looking over to the side and reaching for something he couldntbe much older than three the girl standing behind him was obviously alyssa she kept tapping him on the shoulder and pointing clearly telling him to look at the camera a small baby sat propped up on a cushion at their feet fast asleep and lily guessed that this was maddie she looked again at the photo and turned to compare it with the tall boy standing across the room yes he is quite a catch isnthe a posh voice said conversationally lily turned to see carrot girl standing beside her the squared jaw even more prominent at this proximity susan bode she said thrusting a large mannish hand out lily shook it lily evans she said courteously wondering how discreetly she could wipe her hands on her skirt to get rid of the sheen of sweat that had transferred itself from susan hands ah yes you would be the current head girl at hogwarts carrot girl said her voice immediately gave the impression of snobbiness and poshness terribly english uh yes lily muttered oh susan gave a tinkling laugh i dontknow how you do it i was always a little less uptight than the role required she turned her attention back to james well as i was saying i do think beauty runs in the family her smirk indicated her self inclusion in this statement lily could not have agreed less i expect he got girls throwing themselves at his feet in school uh lily was at a loss to answer he just like me i must admit that he rather handsome though i am related i dontsuppose you re the current girlfriend no lily wanted to get out of this conversation as soon as possible and mentally attempted to evaluate possible escape routes of course that what they all say lily received a wink that made her want to punch this carrot girl in the face i she began sorry to interrupt you ladies a smooth voice cut in lily could have almost cried with relief as james himself turned up i need a word with you lily do you mind susan not at all susan said regally go ahead she walked off and james watched her go before turning back to lily with an expression like thunder if i hear one more person go he put on a simpering voice so sorry about your loss i will bloody well crack dontswear lily said automatically she tilted her head to a side i will admit some of your relatives are a little strange james smiled humourlessly i take it susan been inquiring into my love life again lily stared how did you she done the same thing to all my friends ah lily said well in that case yes she has james turned around to survey the people around him you know what i ve had enough of this come on let go huh this time it was james who stared at her lily did you get enough sleep last night come on let go where lily demanded my room where else what lily hissed james you have got to be kidding james raised an eyebrow what would your parents say james looked at his father they know i wontdo anything stupid as for the rest of them i dontcare what they say but lily looked down she could feel james eyes on her searching her face you re scared of me he said finally what no i not yes you are you re scared of what i might do no i just lily trailed off they stood there in silence for a few minutes the babble of quiet chatter mixing with the violins drifting in the air james sighed lily do you trust me he asked he held his hand out sorry lily tried to avoid his eyes do you trust me not to try anything funny on you for a moment lily kept her gaze on the floor and then looked up despite her doubts one look into james serious eyes was enough to convince her of the truth yes she said simply placing her hand on his his fingers closed around hers come on discreetly they slipped out through the same doors they had entered by and james led her through several passages all richly carpeted only then did they realize at the same time that their hands were still entwined abruptly both their cheeks flushing they dropped each other hand and james cleared his throat as he headed up a wide staircase your house is big lily said in amazement as they walked down yet another hallway dontyou ever get lost put it this way james said pausing at a door this house has a mind of its own he opened the door and stepped in lily followed and felt her eyes grow wide as she took in the room around her james room was large much larger than her own and done in simple but effective shades of deep blue and cream a large four poster bed stood in the middle of one wall in shades of pale blue there were several shelves on one side with books stacked on them and a large desk underneath and a swivel chair opposite stood a gigantic wardrobe with a mirror on the front and a square window bigger than lily had ever seen which let a lot of light in giving the room an airy feel the blue carpet underfoot was thick and soft and the whole room was almost immaculate a very faint smell of james hung in the air your room so big and clean she said wonderingly as she crossed over to look at the books there were several books on defence against the dark arts and advanced transfiguration as well as quidditch and most interestingly the art of animagi a slim blue book i was forced into tidying it at the end of the holidays james said with a slight smile you couldntsee the floor any more lily laughed went to sit on the bed tripped over something soft and went flying she ended up sprawled on the floor ignoring james outstretched hand she hauled herself up again and stared at the mass on the floor and you have beanbags on the middle of the floor because sirius saw them in a shop last summer and insisted on buying them ah lily sat down james was still standing in the corner of the room hands jammed awkwardly into pockets you know lily pointed out it meant to be me standing there paranoid about breaking something not you james laughed he walked over to the swivel chair and sat down in it turning himself to face her you can be very strange you know that choosing simply to stick her tongue out at him in reply she looked around at the mirror smoothing her hair down and got the shock of her life when it erupted into female laughter no need to worry there darlin lookin good lily slowly turned back to james who appeared to be trying to control a smile your mirror talks like the leaky cauldron it never shuts up james lips twitched taking a deep breath lily scanned the room again you re lucky you get to combine wizard and muggle stuff yeah james said i get the talking mirror that doesntknow how to zip up the self arranging closet to make up for the mess i leave and the record player which took me two years to figure out how to use you have a record player lily said distracted where james swivelled round and pulled on a knob in the wall that lily had assumed to be a nail a section of the wall disappeared and lily could see a gleaming tower in a gap it was one of the latest designs my sisters got one so obviously i wanted one oh wow lily said so what music do you have james peered into the hole i did have quite a lot he said but maddie has apparently decided to nick it all while i wasnthere maddie name struck a chord in lily mind there was something she wanted very much to ask but she wasntsure how he would take it she watched as he sat down again and the wall rematerialized looking as solid as ever james can i ask you a question james looked slightly surprised shoot when you in the car well not just in the car lily hesitated debating how to phrase her thoughts most of the day you ve been really cheery no not cheery just happy i mean obviously not all of the time but like when you were in the car and you were joking about how much of a prat you were i dontknow i just wasntexpecting you to behave so normally not just you your parents and maddie too why james leaned back in his chair okay first things first last night when i got back we had a talk as a family and we decided that ally wouldnthave wanted us to be upset crying my eyes out wontbring her back in fact if i going by one of her theories i holding her spirit back so we decided that we would try to act as normally as possible for her sake he swallowed i wontlie and say that it doesnthurt because it does a lot lily watched him with softened eyes trust me she said eventually you ll learn to deal with it it wontbe like this forever james shook his head and cleared his throat anyway number two he said in a stronger voice i wasntjoking when i said i was a prat no you weren lily started oh come on lily dontdeny it you ve called me much worse than that and let face it a fair amount of the time i probably deserved it lily began to shake her head but james continued i look back and i wonder what on earth was wrong with me i not saying you were an angel either because you weren t lily blushed but i dontknow how i found it i dontknow why i thought it was such an amazing thing to be able to humiliate someone even if they were a slimy toerag for no specific reason james a lot of people need their heads checked at the age of fifteen you grew out of it i mean come on would i really be holding a conversation with you if i didntthink you capable of it an intelligent conversation james laughed ruefully but it was fun to watch you get all worked up shut up lily glared at him you re not meant to remember what a madwoman i was there was silence for a few moments actually james began looking cautiously at her speaking of little talks there a little talk that we need to have lily face must have registered her puzzlement since james took another look at her and carried on about about that night before i found out that ally mouth forming a soft oh of comprehension lily finally understood what he was talking about suddenly the room felt thirty degrees warmer and for a moment she wished she had never come up to his room or to the funeral wrought as it was with implications james mistook her embarrassment for well embarrassment there wasntreally any other emotion that lily burning cheeks could have been displaying so clearly look it not like i pressuring you into deciding on the rest of your life i just think it ll be better if we get some closure on it that way we can we can move forward in whatever direction closure lily repeated faintly she sat motionless her eyes on the ground her hair swinging forward over her face james was watching her he was trying for a fuller view of her face than she wished to give the silence between them was so thick it could have stifled a smoke alarm and why was it so hot so incredibly unbearably hot focusing on james face in her mind she tried to re evaluate what she felt for him in a few seconds and came to a realization and a decision here goes nothing she looked up at james at his earnest hazel eyes that were regarding her with warm seriousness and it was doubly hard to say the next words i i like you james i like you a lot i look back at all these years that i spent yelling at you and i think damn i missed a really good friend but that all you ll ever be a friend a really good friend practically one of my best i i dontthink i could think of you in any other way i mean at the moment at the very least james opened his mouth then closed it again a knot of worry welled up in lily throat as she realized how charged the air was please dontlet this change anything between us she burst out desperately i couldntbear it if we stopped being friends or anything i wouldnthave said anything i couldnthandle that please i just i really sorry i dontwant anything to be different the look on james face was one of quiet resignation i though you were going to say that i so so sorry lily said gently despite the fact that it was her doing the let down she felt like crying if i could change the way i feel but i can t james looked at her for a moment then shook his head it it ok at least we we can put it in the past now he attempted a somewhat unconvincing smile so what music are you into lily was about to revert to the previous topic before she realized that james was trying to do them both a favour so instead she went with his flow well i dontmind jo she was cut off by a rattling on the doorknob followed by a sudden bang startled she twisted round to see the door fly open and a figure fall into the room james stood up quickly maddie what are you doing on my bedroom floor he asked glaring at her maddie got up slowly rubbing her back i ll have you know that i had no intention of ending up on your floor oh brother dearest and yes i sure there are no bones broken thanks for asking james gave her another glare great so you re capable of turning round and walking right back out of that door if you want to come in try knocking and by the way either you return my music or i search your room before i go back to school maddie tried and failed to look innocent me why would i want your music dontinsult my taste she turned to the mirror to brush her skirt off and grinned as it wolf whistled james gave it a dirty look great whatever bye bye maddie smiled angelically sorry james do you really think i would come here for no reason i have messages to deliver james sat back down grumpily go on then hurry up right maddie took on a fruity english accent miss evans professor dumbledore requests your presence as he wishes to return to school okay lily said getting up and straightening her clothes and james mum said to come down to say goodbye and here she imitated her mother voice if i so much as see that tie of yours out of place you know what will happen because if you can do up a school tie you should be quite capable of doing a normal tie up james tugged fruitlessly at his neckwear making it worse than it already was i ll do something about it he mumbled now the interesting part where i get to be the inquisitive annoying sister maddie adopted a wheedling tone guess what james i heard mum talking to dad just now eavesdropper james muttered but a flicker of genuine curiosity did show on his face maddie looked delighted to be the centre of attention in fact she was wearing a look that lily knew only too well having used it often that angelic expression one wore when about to ruin an older sibling life guess who they were talking about james they were talking about you guess what they were talking about would you like me to tell you james looked torn between throwing his sister out of the room or hearing the rest of what she had to say maddie took his silence as consent they were discussing a certain revelation that mum made today about lily initials lily curiosity peaked but james face visibly paled you re making this up he said in a low voice standing up and taking a step towards her oh no jamie maddie said sweetly why would i make something with this much potential up anyway mum remembered several uh papers in james room when she went in to freshen it up before james came home from sixth year you wouldn t james hissed oh but i feel lily here has the right to know maddie said smoothly she was wearing that one of a kind angelic expression again these papers were stashed away as opposed to being chucked away like most people would do but then i guess these were special papers right big bro james face was void of colour and he was looking daggers at maddie quickly he took two steps across the room and attempted to shove his sister out throwing all his weight against the door to close it behind her with surprising strength however maddie thrust her foot back through and managed to jam half her body into the crack she really was grinning now as james lost his balance and landed on the floor i believe the papers were exam papers from your fifth year she was addressing lily now james was pulling himself up evidently about to attempt another attack on the door what mum found particularly interesting about these papers aside from the fact that they ought to have been in the bin long ago knowing you was that they all had a set of initials emblazoned over all the questions crossed out sure but still legible james threw himself against the door again but could not close it and maddie went on in a sing song voice your initials in fact with various other anecdotes such as i lo james made a final effort at the door and it finally closed on maddie you must have been very bored to write it so many times she called through the door before her footsteps receded lily looked open mouthed at james who was leaning on the door he would not meet her eyes yeah he muttered uncomfortably she has very bad timing he cleared his throat and went to stand in front of the mirror fiddling with his tie the back of his neck red lily stared at his back still shocked before she remembered that the incident must have been around the time that she had humiliated him by the great lake after exams by telling him and most of hogwarts fifth year that she would rather date the giant squid than him feeling inexplicably guilty she shook herself and went to stand next to him honestly i would have thought you would know how to do up a tie by now come here nudging his fingers away she began to unknot the material interestingly she noted that his neck was still pink as he answered i do know how to do a tie i do one every day for heaven sake i just cantdo this one she could feel his eyes on the top of her head rolling her own she pulled the tie off and then put it round again neatly her fingers brushed inadvertently against his cool skin and she swallowed mentally commanding her cheeks not to flush it didntwork it never did thanks james said when she had finished and stepped back he reached up to pull it unconsciously but lily slapped his fingers away dontyou dare and then an uncomfortable silence fell both of them standing opposite each other and yet avoiding the other eyes the floor had never looked more interesting well james said awkwardly yeah see you i guess he held out his hand to shake and lily grasped it uncertainly finally letting her eyes move up to see james downcast face we re still friends right she asked suddenly james looked wrong footed yeah moving towards him lily pulled him into a hug i hug my friends when i say goodbye she whispered into his ear the familiar smell of him washed over her calming her as he gently hugged her back though could she have seen his expression she would not have been feeling quite so serene as it was she felt the warmth from his body radiating onto her own and smiled contentedly into his shoulder they broke apart as the mirror started cackling i ll be seeing you in here again you mark my words it crowed cheerfully shut it james said throwing it a look he opened the door gestured to lily to go out and then led her back down the corridors and stairs until they reached what lily recognized as the front hall professor dumbledore was standing there talking to mr and mrs potter miss evans he said ready to leave yes sir she replied without having to look behind her she knew that james had pushed his hands into his pockets and was leaning against the wall it was lovely to see you here lily dear mrs potter said mr potter smiled at her maddie stuck her head round the doorway leading to the room of the gathering yeah lily thanks for coming she called mrs potter clucked at her and she disappeared hurriedly see you on monday lily said to james taking hold of the chocolate wrapper that dumbledore now held out james gave her a half grin back and the last glimpse she had as she felt the familiar tug behind her navel was of him with a hand raised in farewell a n bonjour despite having module exams in two days i decided it was time to stick another chapter up not that it was a convenient way of avoiding revision or anything hums innocently wish me luck love you all and love you even more if you re kind enough to leave a review n b acknowledgements for the poem to mary frye i think 19 something or other the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you chapter 25 interlude interlude part one emma yawned she opened her eyes slowly in a gentle return to consciousness and stared at the ceiling it took her a few minutes to remember what day it was and it was only when she rolled over sleepily to face an empty bed that she realized lily must have already left stretching leisurely she got up and padded over to sapphire bed saffy saffy wake up there was no answer emma shook the heap of blankets and pulled them down slightly to reveal sapphire drowsy face eyes clenched tightly shut go way she mumbled burying her face in the pillow as she rolled over you re not mum phf she squealed as she fell off the bed emma having unceremoniously stripped the sheets away adjusting the straps of her pyjama top she sat up and glared at her friend rubbing her hip painfully what was that for she asked indignantly because you ll never get up otherwise emma smirked at sapphire who was now staring at the disaster area next to emma what happened there emma sighed lily happened she looked at the clothes strewn all over lily bed shrugged and headed for the bathroom guess you ll be the last one to get washed sapphire huffed and threw a pillow at her but it simply fell against the closed door half an hour later both girls walked down to the great hall the tables were almost empty with only a few stragglers finishing off their food in relative quiet we are so late emma said looking around it nearly eleven already so sapphire piled toast onto her plate we donthave much to do she yawned lazily as she spread jam onto a slice and bit into it oh yes we do emma said firmly we are going to the library and i am going to do my herbology homework while you write those essays for dada and potions that you ve been putting off all week nooo sapphire moaned she gave emma puppy dog eyes that can wait a few hours or days no it can t emma said adamantly you finish those essays if it the last thing you do before lily comes back after a long breakfast which sapphire was reluctant to leave the two girls headed up to their dorm to collect books and then back down to the library they found a table by a window and settled down two hours later emma was still only halfway through her essay and had resorted to sugar quills in the hope that the sugar would inspire her sapphire books were scattered over the table too but there was no sign of the girl herself there hadntbeen for about twenty minutes sighing as she realized this emma got up and began to walk round the shelves she found her friend standing in an aisle almost pressed against the bookcase behind her nose apparently buried in a big book that must be quite an interesting book she observed casually coming up behind her sapphire jumped yeah yeah it is she said flushing slightly emma glanced at the pages obviously i sure it important for your essay she looked over her friend shoulder it must be quite hard reading upside down though she twisted her head to the side hmm innovative spells for removing nostril hair so what you get past a dangerous criminal by doing them the favour of charming their nostril hair off clever sapphire shut the book sheepishly i dontknow what to write she moaned in a whisper i stuck you can come and be stuck at the table emma said dragging her back by the elbow at least try sapphire stuck her tongue out at her friend as she was forced into her seat twenty minutes later emma had still not progressed beyond a few sentences and was becoming heartily sick of reading the same definition of nickelwort over and over again the intermittent sighs of sapphire broke the silence as she chewed on her quill every so often the library doors could be heard opening and closing as students moved in and out nickelwort is a herbe often used in the treatmente of infections of the throate being of goode virtue when can i talk to you emma looked up to see callie standing in front of their table her usual smirk apparently twisted into what she assumed to be a polite smile what do you want she asked coldly raising her eyebrows nothing to do with you callie said snidely she turned to sapphire sapphire can i speak to you sapphire looked undecided but eventually her face hardened normally i wouldnteven give you the time of day but these essays are my only other option she got up then looked at emma i ll meet you back here em emma nodded albeit doubtfully wondering if sapphire would come back crying and watched as they walked out of the library nickelwort is a herbe this was so pointless the musty smell of the books around her was simply putting her to sleep often used in the treatmente the quiet whispers around her seemed even more aimed at forcing her into slumber used in the treatmente of what was she writing an essay on again sleepily she got up and went to stand by the window in the hope that the cold glass would wake her up yawning she stretched as she watched younger students outside enjoying the grounds despite the blustery day some were lying on the grass under trees talking or doing homework she smiled remembering back to the days when the worst homework they had was only a twelve inch essay because four foot essays are so much more fun she thought dryly her mind drifted to the parchment and quills lying expectantly on the table behind her but she could not bring herself to walk back to it the cool wind outside seemed to be breathing a breath of fresh air into her too making her feel more clear headed than she had been in days resting her head on the pane she let herself relax a sudden commotion disturbed the peace outside several students outside were twisting round in alarm and emma heard a distant faint bang peering round she saw a tall dark haired boy come striding across the grounds he was wearing nothing but a t shirt and jeans despite the coolness of the day and was walking angrily across the grass clearly furious for a moment he looked up at the overcast sky and emma realized with a start that the reason the boy profile looked so familiar was because he was sirius the next minute another two boys came into sight one half running behind the other was apparently peter the other walking quickly ahead was emma felt her heartbeat speed up for a second remus hair blowing in the wind he soon caught up with his best friend and emma followed his figure with an almost painful feeling in her chest she watched from her window as remus placed a hand on sirius shoulder and spun him around roughly even from here she could sense the fire raging in sirius stormy grey eyes as he said no shouted something and walked off again heading for a bare branched tree again remus caught up with him and pulled him around for a moment sirius face blazed and he looked like he was about to hit remus emma breathed sharply in but remus did not flinch he put both hands on sirius tense shoulders and looked him straight in the face apparently talking to him peter stood nervously by his side watching the two of them sirius turned away and out of nowhere punched the tree violently looking shocked peter pulled out his handkerchief and handed it to sirius whose lips clearly formed the shape of a swear word emma winced as she saw the white fabric transform to blood red remus still had his hands on sirius shoulders and was still talking to him shaking him slightly for a moment emma wondered what would happen next but then sirius seemed to lose his fury it flowed out of him like water and he relaxed putting an arm round his shoulder remus and peter led him back inside talking their heads together feeling slightly shaken herself emma lifted her head from the window and stared unseeing at the books opposite her old memories and feelings were resurfacing and however much she tried to shut the lid on them that last expression of remus was dogging her mind eye she had seen that care on remus face so many times before that watchfulness over others emotions and troubles no matter what his own might be why had she not recognized it for what it was a concern for those he loved best not an act to hide the beast within why had she not even thought back to the time of the halloween ball when he had waited by her bed to see that she was alright that was no monster that was human more than human quietly pensively she walked back to her bag sat down and opened a compartment that she had rarely gone into since from it she pulled out a photograph taken shortly after the ball of the two of them sitting side by side in the common room they were looking at each other laughing contemplatively emma traced a finger over remus figure the photo remus cupped his hand gently around her cheek and emma saw her own eyes light up as he looked at her affectionately that smile that smile that had once been reserved just for her for the first time since that horrible day emma allowed the recollections to come flooding back and she welcomed them welcomed the remembrance of how he had held her and how safe she had felt in his arms his laughing eyes and his lips coming to a decision emma put the picture away and went back to her essay nothing would stop her this time interlude part 2 when callie had approached her sapphire honestly had no idea of the things to come she had neither expected nor wanted to talk to her former best friend and had in fact preferred to act as though there was absolutely no history of any sort between the two of them the memories were neither ones she wanted to have or wanted to remember no closure just erased gone but now it seemed the bin was about to cough up its contents and her emotions were mixed as she followed callie out of the library callie waited until they were a few corridors away from the library before she spoke do you mind if we go to the dorm sapphire shrugged they headed up the various staircases and passages through the fat lady and up the stairs into their dormitory which was mercifully empty uncomfortably sapphire sat down on her bed callie was the first to speak you dontseem too happy no shit sherlock yeah well sapphire didntreally think it was necessary to say more how ve you been better callie raised her eyebrows come on what wrong nothing sapphire said shortly well why are you being so down callie asked impatiently oh am i supposed to be perky sapphire snapped she put on a fake smile i just chipper thank you no need for sarcasm callie said tartly you could at least be glad that we re speaking to each other oh is that what this is sapphire responded raising her eyebrows i was under the impression that we werenttalking at all callie opened her mouth then seemed to think better of it and closed it again she took a deep breath look she said in her normal tone of voice i was thinking since you know recent events do you want to be friends again for a moment one brief split second instant sapphire actually considered saying yes a memory of her and callie giggling together in the common room flashed through her mind and then it was succeeded by many other memories not least the one of lily finding her in the toilets no she said shortly callie looked taken back what you re just going to throw our friendship away the hypocrisy of this statement was so blatant that sapphire almost wanted to laugh it didntseem to be too hard for you to do at the competition did it she retorted callie blinked yes well she said waving her hand in the air dismissively her voice softened into an eager tone the thing is you me and serena could really be something here i mean what with your new look and everything oh is that what recent events were sapphire asked smiling grimly you want me to come crawling back to you because i look different oh that a reason i ll go for come on saffy callie had taken on a wheedling tone but sapphire stopped her sapphire she said firmly my name is sapphire to you not saffy callie made a noise of exasperation stop being so stubborn the weak grip that sapphire had on her self control dwindled even more stubborn she said sharply how am i being stubborn you used me for six years and dumped me so i found new friends better friends and now you want me to come back again her voice grew louder and louder with every sentence number one that makes no sense number two you re saying you want me to ditch my friends my real friends i dontforget people as easily as you i didntditch you callie said her voice rising to match sapphire s i was just taking a break sapphire made a noise of disbelief good stay on your break stay on your break across the fucking country for god sake this conversation was pointless she turned around and walked towards the door her hand on the knob she suddenly paused then turned around and walked back to callie you know what i want to understand something why was i that easy to throw away the harsh bitterness in her voice surprised even her the few seconds that callie took to answer were all that sapphire needed no o she replied sapphire heard the hint of uncertainty behind her tones that only served to back up her thoughts you re lying she said flatly but i want to know why you owe me that much dontdeny it why was this such an act what was the damn point callie sniffed scornfully you can be so mucked up but sapphire hard gaze did not waver and eventually callie sagged and sat down on the bed all right she said shortly i was jealous this seemed so ludicrous that sapphire could hardly believe her ears what she asked incredulously callie was wearing an unreadable expression you dontremember the first week or two of first year only vaguely sapphire thought all her memories of first year were mainly of herself and callie the first couple of weeks seemed to have been erased the pre callie period not really she owned callie face was still set so you dontremember how how everyone liked you emma and lily both wanted to be your friends the marauders classed you as cool and they had status from day one even tom and keegan admitted you were pretty though none of us knew each other that well when did all of this happen sapphire thought confusedly and why donti remember any of it so she said aloud quite apart from the fact that i dontremember any of this what has it got to do with anything oh please callie snorted it has everything to do with it all that attention you got that wasnt yours it belonged to me and serena we re the purebloods from the big wizarding families just like the potters and blacks that was our popularity you stole so we made you our friend your crowd came after us because we were your friends so we were popular we got what we deserved sapphire was staring at the girl in front of her you deserved it what kind of a screwed view of life do you have she felt the shock coursing through her veins like icy fire in a sharp tone she asked is that the reason behind the hair dye the more you were like us the more we gained status as the reality of what had gone on really became absorbed into sapphire mind she felt numb her stomach seemed to have turned to lead and the icy fires burned her from the inside this is why she realized this is why i so terrified of losing friends this is why i panic at the slightest hint of trouble and find it so hard to be wanted this is why i ll worry that i ll be just as easy to throw away as i was before well your so called popularity didntlast long did it she said bitterly everyone knows what bitches you are and i have a whole vocabulary of words to that effect looks like you are the losers of the year after all callie looked nettled takes one to know one oh please sapphire scoffed resort to your pathetic little comebacks because you cantface yourself well you can kid yourself but i guess i ve seen you really seen you for the first time and i dontlike what i see callie watched as she headed towards the door again and made a last ditch attempt you know i really did like you most of the time sapphire paused standing in the doorway do i really believe that she asked softly i think you know the answer to that as well as i do callie dontbother talking to me again goodbye she closed the door behind her and leaned against the wall to let out a long shuddering breath a sudden lump rose in her throat and she choked it back wiping her eyes so many unanswered questions but she now had some sort of termination for the whole situation or did she am i really worth nothing she thought of callie snide looks and laughter and then she thought of emma and lily of the looks they had worn when she had forced them to talk and of her parents and the genuine unconditional love they had for her the answer to that question was she really worth nothing no a n just fyi therewere two songs that originally went with this chapter before decided to quibble over the use of songs the first part went with the song cantfight the moonlight by leann rimes i thought it was rather appropriate considering remus connection with moonlight the secondinterlude went withblue by sugababes great song and very true anyway hope you enjoyed the repost let me know what you thought by reviewing hint the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you chapter 26 through the rain hey emma said seating herself beside lily and helping herself to a sandwich sapphire smiled at her but remus sitting a few places down on the other side of the table stiffened at the sound of her voice giving her a cold look he got up and walked off the displeasure evident in his stance he left the great hall the flurry of movement alerted emma who looked up in time to see him stand her eyes followed his figure out of the hall and her smile faltered d j vu james muttered across the table lily and sapphire nodded wordlessly the rest of the day was to prove what they knew only too well after breakfast most gryffindors headed for transfiguration outside the classroom emma hesitantly approached remus hey she said quietly the response was immediate remus turned away from her and joined in with a conversation between james and tom emma was left standing there for a few moments before she had no option but to walk back to lily and sapphire both of whom were watching her sympathetically in defence against the dark arts too remus took his place beside james wordlessly and ignored every single word that came out of emma mouth whether directed at him or not the set line of his mouth clamped shut served only to increase his air of coldness it is a well known fact that when something can get even worse than it is it inevitably does as if it wasntbad enough that teachers were piling work on the seventh years left right and centre all three girls were beginning to feel the strain of social life emma had a grand total of seventeen failed attempts to talk to remus although she had not given any motive to her friends they guessed at least in part what she was trying to do and saw how each unsuccessful endeavour served only to depress her spirits though they hoped it would somehow strengthen her resolve sapphire had been tripped up yet again by none other than sirius spilt ink all over herself and managed to rip up her essay for defence against the dark arts the loss of the pieces of parchment on which the essay was written had been easily repaired after five minutes of summoning and repairing spells but the loss of sapphire temper had not been so easily dealt with sirius had had to go up to the hospital wing with a black eye after she had punched him in the face and even afterwards still held the shadow of a bruise over his left eye his dark looks at her for the rest of the day lessons seemed exactly calculated to antagonize her more and consequently her temper was constantly at a dangerously simmering level and lily compared to the other two she felt her problem was much more trivial although she was now surprisingly on a firmer base of friendship with james there was still a niggling feeling in the back of her mind that for some reason they seemed to speak to each other less still she convinced herself that it was just her own paranoia and decided to concentrate on thinking up ways to cheer up her friends instead by the time dinner rolled around she had it quickly she made hr friends eat and then ignoring their noises of protest dragged them upstairs and forced them into homework groaning they finally complied only partially mollified by her promise of the whole thing will be worth it afterwards i swear at eight thirty lily packed up and mysteriously disappeared much to sapphire and emma surprise she re entered the portrait hole twenty minutes later hiding something behind her back and hurried for the girls dorm coming back down having taken her time she found a very different scene from the one she had left sirius was standing in the middle of a pair of chairs arms crossed and smirking sapphire on the other hand was practically smoking at the ears fool she spat only a a clown like you would have such little sense to come anywhere near me after what happened this morning instead of seeming abashed as sapphire was hoping he would sirius simply looked down at himself strange he said raising an eyebrow you d think i would dress more like a clown if i was one this was indisputable sirius was one of the best dressed boys in the year hands down however this knowledge seemed to irritate sapphire only more she glowered at the black haired boy in front of her smug bastard she said angrily she picked up her books slamming them shut and stalked off i going upstairs away from him she called back to lily sirius shrugged and sauntered away leaving emma frozen over her work lily beckoned to her come on we can do that later they traipsed upstairs and opened their dorm door only to be met by the sight of sapphire violently punching her pillow hey emma exclaimed dumping her books and hurrying over no need to take your anger out on inanimate objects she wrested the battered object from her friend and set it down on the bed neatly smoothing away creases i was pretending it was black face sapphire muttered well lily pointed out reasonably you were planning to sleep on that tonight as well sapphire sprang up with a cry of disgust great now i ll have nightmares for weeks seeing her friends faces both of which were relaxing into dejected and angry expressions lily looked around dormitory empty likely to be so for at least two hours callie and serena were not early in sleeping habits perfect she headed over to her four poster and hooking her fingers beneath the frame began to heave it to a side sapphire and emma stared what re you doing sapphire inquired moving the beds together lily grunted as she pulled with all her strength and the bed shifted exactly two centimetres o okay emma said uncertainly uhm would you mind if i asked why lily pulled at the wooden frame again her face turning red with effort it would be more productive of you to stop asking and help me out here emma pulled out her wand you do realise you could do that by magic groaning lily let go of the wood and straightened up rubbing her dusty hands off on her jeans and turning them from blue to grey go ahead the beds were soon levitated together and lily joined the curtains up to effectively create a bed which could have fit six people with curtains blocking them from the outside world she instructed her best friends to change into nightwear and then having done so herself heaved a huge basket onto the bed when emma and sapphire came back they were greeted with a hamper full of food and a large stash of sweets where did all this come from emma asked amazed kitchens lily grinned plus i hit james up for some of the sweets he owes me a favour if all this sugar doesntget the serotonin flowing nothing will huh sapphire looked confused lily rolled her eyes sero to nin it a hormone released when you eat chocolate or sweets that makes you feel happy that why you eat chocolate as a remedy for dementors whatever they climbed onto the bed and lily closed the curtains so that they were in a state of semi darkness this is our night in she announced we have two hours of food and gossip ahead of us to help us relax twenty minutes later all three girls were lounging around on the triple bed in a state of extreme hyperness brought on by serious sugar intake lily threw an every flavoured bean into the air and by diving on top of sapphire managed to catch it in her mouth eurgh she squealed spinach mmph mphl sapphire said from under lily emma burst into giggles you said eurgh she said pointing at lily lily climbed off sapphire ok you know what we should do truths noo sapphire moaned remember the last time we got into this just one round nooo please pretty pretty please ok fine sapphire said heavily yay lily burst into laughter as emma tried to balance a sugar quill on her nose me first me first me first no one answered so lily took this to be general agreement okay this is for emma she picked up a sugar quill do you no did you ever tell remus that you loved him emma rolled over onto her back and stared at the ceiling i i dontthink so i donteven know properly if i do i i like him a lot that not a good enough answer i if i had to say i cant i dontknow what i feel emma had flushed a dark red you re so annoying lily whined right end of game sapphire said firmly or rather as firmly as she could manage lily groaned but toppled backwards as she reached for another pumpkin pasty to take the edge off the sugar can i propose something for us to do sapphire asked how about we rate all the boys in gryffindor i mean looks and so on lily stared all of gryffindor no maybe just in our year and if you re going out with them then you cantrate them only the others can emma shrugged fair enough so alphabetical order first up keegan adams emma you first emma considered as she bit off the head of a chocolate frog he ok she said thoughtfully the sun bleached hair and tanned skin isntreally my type but he not ugly lily i suppose he ok his eyes are a nice colour too hmm okay yeah i guess i agree sapphire attempted to work out the next person how about ugh black no comment you cantdo that saffy lily protested you re not going out with him so you have to give your opinion your unbiased opinion sapphire groaned fine he good looking i ll admit that but it better not leave this room lily and emma burst into laughter at her pained expression at having to say something nice about her arch enemy lily screwed up her face sirius was undoubtedly good looking most girls wanted to be with him most boys wanted to be him very handsome she said he got that whole sexy dark haired guy image working for him yeah and he got good taste in clothes emma added sapphire scowled great let move on how about tom jacobs lily you re out on this one lily nodded and picked up another pumpkin pasty he ok emma said thoughtfully but i dontthink he compares to people like sirius he over average though his nose is a bit long sapphire said doubtfully no offence lils it okay lily said yawning remus sapphire turned to lie on her side he a marauder isnthe that says it all of course he looks really good whatever he does yeah lily agreed but at the same time it different with sirius you can see how how attractive he is from a mile away he practically radiates charm with remus he good too but i think it like you dontnotice it as much in comparison with his friends until it hits you in the face and you think wow speaking impersonally of course thanks for the sermon sapphire said laughing and number five peter not good looking emma said at once his eyes are all watery and he too pale he not that bad lily argued i mean it not like he repulses girls he has had girls after him only the desperate ones emma snorted picking another sugar quill she stuck it in her mouth so that she could use her hands while she spoke he just like a little boy at times he nicer than you think lily said defensively unaware of the smudge of chocolate on her nose the other two laughed madly at her comical expression as she stuck her tongue out to reach her nose when she did realise there was near silence for a few moments before sapphire cleared her throat and last but by no means least identical evil grins appeared on both her and emma faces as they looked at each other excitedly james potter two sets of eyebrows raised as lily buried her face into the bed and groaned noo yes sapphire said happily come on out with it we ve wanted to know this for a long time your real opinion of him when lily lifted her head her cheeks were tingeing pink he fit all right i ll admit it tall and good looking oh no i want more emma said she looked as though she would have cackled if she could specifics it was doubtful that lily would have said the next thing had she not been under the influence of sugar as it was however she could only look back and regret that she had not duck taped her mouth shut before it came to this he looks good is that what you want to hear messy hair nice eyes but i am not attracted to him in any way and and he got a really good body there was silence when did you get a look at him emma said slowly lily raised her face which she had buried in a pillow again to hide her flaming cheeks left with no other option she was forced to tell the story of her midnight apology feeling more and more embarrassed when she had finished any stranger could have easily anticipated the reaction of the two girls oh my god despite having gone to bed happy when the three girls woke up again in the morning their problems seemed to have returned in full force the mood was gloomy in the seventh year dorm and although lily knew it was mostly the worry of work that was making hr heart sink her expression mirrored that of emma exactly the weather seemed to be joining in it was cloudy and cold with an unsettled air lunchtime found lily emma and sapphire all staring blankly into space as they ate avoiding the four boys that had become such a big part of their lives had been difficult but in the end achievable after lunch it was back to lessons and at long last dinner came having eaten lily and sapphire seated themselves in the common room and began working arduously through the stacks of homework they had been given emma disappeared upstairs saying she would join them later ten minutes into her essays lily mind had wondered off topic and resettled on james trying to work out why they had distanced themselves from each other his face swam before her mind eye in its startling variety of expressions it took fifteen minutes for her to realise slowly that in a way their friendship was so strong that the looks they sometimes shared were much more communicative than words could ever be having settled this point she went back to her work with much more fervour and managed to diligently write two feet on the uses of hellebore when the object of her reflections appeared before her hey he said smiling and sitting down d you mind if remus and me work here we need to go through some stuff for the ball once you re done sure lily said clearing some space this shouldnttake me too long she wrinkled her nose just a couple of centuries or so the two boys laughed and pulled out pieces of parchment they worked in silence for about twenty minutes the ceaseless drumming of rain outside providing the only background noise it was pelting down hard from the sound of it and lily shivered inwardly she would not have liked to be out there tonight finally she put down her quill stretched and yawned remus looked up done he asked smiling as she slid down in her chair lily nodded wish i could say the same for this stupid essay he said making a face he looked up at the windows it really coming down out there huh yeah lily agreed letting her hair loose out of its ponytail a flash of white light burst upon the room as lightning lit up the stormy sky and everyone jumped looking towards the outer wall lily however was distracted by the girl who had just come down the stairs she smiled at none other than her best friend emma tilted her head in greeting back at her but her eyes soon settled on what for her was the back of remus head visibly swallowing she walked apprehensively over to him thunder crashed down around the castle and the rain beat a tattoo onto the castle stone walls emma came to remus side remus can i talk to you the change on remus face was immediate if his face had been a computer screen lily thought it would have been as if someone had clicked shutdown because that was exactly what happened although still focused on his work his face had become completely blank remus emma put a hand on his shoulder politely but quickly remus shrugged it out from under her palm and carried on writing can we talk emma questioned again she sat down next to him and tried to angle her face to catch his lily felt rather than saw a slight movement beside her and knew that the other two like her must have been burning with curiosity to look up and watch but of course they couldntdo that from the corner of her eyes she could just about se remus turn away a repeated touch on his arm and he stood up emma mirrored him please can we just talk remus took a step backwards his expression was odd one that lily had never really seen before on his face it was unreadable but at the same time cynical his lower jaw grinding against his upper it funny he said distinctly to the ceiling d j vu he looked directly at emma i could have sworn i said that to you more than once you never seemed to hear he turned and walked out of the portrait hole the next moment emma had followed him lily looked after them then at the two people frozen over their work beside and opposite her come on she said quickly to james what if we dontkeep an eye on them one of them will be dead at the end of this god knows what remus ll do good point the two of them hurried through the portrait hole leaving sapphire who rolled her eyes how did i know that those two would leave together she asked the air meanwhile james and lily stole quietly along the corridors until they caught up with emma the decision of what to do was completely settled in a very few seconds by the exchange of a few looks they did not want to intrude on their friends but neither did they have any intention of allowing the two to come to blows instead they opted to follow them in the shadows just to keep an eye on things remus was striding purposefully down the corridor his black robes billowing out behind him always headed downwards after him came emma there were only a few metres between the two of them and yet emma seemed incapable of closing the gap forced instead to half run after him periodically calling his name it seemed she did not care who heard her now remus she yelled i wontleave you alone until you listen to me remus whirled around at the top of a flight of stairs get lost emma fuck off emma reeled as if she had been hit she was not the only one lily gaped openly and even james stared disbelievingly at his best friend of seven years he had never sworn before the boy in question spun away and descended the stairs quickly it took emma a few seconds to recover but when she did she relentlessly pursued him down no longer did she have any breath for speech almost tripping over herself as she ran down the stairs their footsteps echoed in the passages one set purposeful and determined the other faster and lighter james and lily could do nothing but look hopelessly at each other and follow in their wake finally they were on the ground floor it was not clear where remus thought he was going but the darkened corridors were hardly conducive to good navigation either lily glanced upwards at a window as thunder crashed across the sky again louder than she had ever heard before she looked at james i hope he not intending to oh he is her tone flattened as she realised that they were going past the great hall in a direction that could only lead to one place outside apparently the same thought had just occurred to emma she visibly blanched as she saw him heading towards the huge doors of the entrance to the castle remus please just listen to me for one minute she cried desperately straining ever harder to catch up remus heaved at the doors and they swung open flooding the immediate vicinity with yellowy torchlight which served only to highlight the huge drops drumming down as if there was no tomorrow lightning flashed a glaringly white trident of anger against the inky darkness above even as remus stepped out past the doors he hesitated for only a millisecond before advancing out into the onslaught of water give me one good reason why he flung angrily over his shoulder emma ran to the top of the steps outside and halted unsure of whether to go further chest heaving gasping for air she watched his figure retreat further and further from the doors because because because i love you lily stopped short and threw out an arm to stop james needlessly as he had already frozen mid step with bated breath the two of them watched the scene before them unfold it took the wind a few moments to carry emma words to remus but when they reached him he paused slowly almost against his will he pivoted round to look at emma he was completely drenched hair dripping water down his neck clothes stuck to him and rivulets of water running down his face and arms what did you say he asked quietly emma took a few steps down the stairs until she was almost at a level with remus she drew in a deep breath that somehow got caught in her throat and turned into a sob i love you she repeated and now she really did begin to cry smiling but crying tears which mingled with the rain on her cheeks she moved down to the muddy ground it was perhaps just as well that professor mcgonagall or madam pomfrey did not happen to pass by at that precise moment they would certainly have had a fit at the sight of the two seventh years getting soaked in the ruthless rain standing motionless opposite each other except for emma heaving shoulder as she both sobbed and laughed a flicker of emotion passed over remus eyes then it was impossible to say who had taken the first step the gap between the two of them slowly closed until they were only a foot away from each other i thought i didnt remus said so quietly that only emma heard him you always did she whispered back fiercely you always did and at that moment their minds seemed to truly connect for what perhaps was the first time the floodgates opened and all the distrust uncertainty and jealousy poured away to be replaced with clear understanding the next moment the distance was closed and they wrapped their arms around each other each holding the other tightly remus head lay protectively on hers and she felt his body relax beneath her arms the heavy rain around them had no place all she heard or cared to hear was remus strong steady heartbeat beneath her cheek off in a corner inside lily heaved a sigh and she turned to james whose expression of was one of relief too smiling she put her arm on his and drew him away away from the two figures melded together a single silhouette against the light pulling away from remus emma looked up at him blinking away the raindrops on her eyelashes he was looking at her with that old but never worn out gaze of affection and she left herself bathe in its warmth for a minute before reaching up to brush his dripping hair out of his face i so so sorry she whispered shakily letting her hand trail down his cheek and come to rest on his chest i dontknow why i ever thought i dont care what you are remus i love you i just sorry it took me so long to realise she swallowed feeling as if a thousand nerve endings were on fire where his hands lay on her waist i dontknow if i the one for you but you re the only one for me and you always have been fearful of a sudden rejection throat dry she searched his eyes for a response as he looked wordlessly at her mindless of the rain beating against her a sudden gust of wind drove the water into her face but still he said nothing and she could not see his expression properly then at long last she felt his hands leave her waist and move up until he was cupping her face in them gently with the pads of his thumbs he brushed away both teardrops and raindrops you ll always be the one he whispered hoarsely emma heart swelled she felt like singing and dancing and yet at the same time was able to remain calm and still enough to hesitantly move her head towards his after what seemed like an eternal moment their lips finally met and her eyes closed as she wrapped her arms around his neck and began to kiss him back with all that she felt for him a blissful feeling of happiness engulfed her and she gave herself up to it completely and there they stood an oasis of calm in the midst of the storm twined together under the night sky and the gaze of a pale crescent moon a n having just edited this at long last i too lazy and full of pizza to write a superlatively long author note so please review just because you love me so much and even if you don t feel free to review anyway and i swear i will work on getting the next chapter up sooner on the plus side we re now inching closer and closer to the big one chapter 35 the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you chapter 27 blood brothers morning despite the cool weather outside emma face at breakfast was a picture of happiness as she watched james and sirius sit down opposite her and her friends she smiled sunnily at them causing lily and sapphire to roll their eyes affectionately somebody happy today sirius commented reaching for cereal james rolled his own eyes and smacked sirius upside the head excuse the extreme stupidity of my friend ladies but dontworry he on the waiting list for the nearest mental asylum he snatched the cereal off sirius oh and emma remus said he d be down soon he just waiting for peter that okay emma said cheerfully it a beautiful day isntit james looked up at the ceiling which showed nothing but grey clouds scudding across and raised an eyebrow she been like this since she woke up lily supplied in a mock whisper but her smile as she looked at her friends showed how really happy she was for her just then a pair of legs straddled the bench and a boy who lily had come to recognise as leon wilkes sat himself down next to sapphire hi sapphire he said how re you today great until you showed up sapphire muttered she moved away from him lily james and emma all stared at leon who was eyeing sapphire chest but oddly enough sirius was watching sapphire with an unusually shrewd expression on his face she looked at her plate determinedly avoiding both his and leon eyes leon tore his gaze away from her body so sapphire sapphire sapphire would you be my girlfriend sapphire exhaled would you get lost leon maintained a cavalier smile you ll cave in soon enough he announced before getting up and going sapphire let out a sigh of relief stalker that what he is sirius took a bite of toast but frowned as he chewed watching leon sit down with his own ravenclaw friends what the matter james asked peanut butter instead of marmalade on your toast sirius swallowed no he said he stared at leon for a few minutes longer and then turned back to the group have you ever had a boyfriend heathleigh he asked abruptly what sapphire looked as though she couldntbelieve her ears why do you care an angry tinge of pink appeared on her cheeks i asking have you ever had a boyfriend as in at all during hogwarts sapphire face darkened to deep red if you must know no i haven t she snapped what it to you nothing sirius said he was still eyeing her so have you ever crushed on anyone for some reason that lily and emma could not fathom sapphire normal defence against sirius of ignoring him had crumbled she flushed if possible even more but did not meet his eyes yes of course i have she said with an angry kind of pride i know you think i a freak black but i do have hormones though i keep them more in check than you do but then you ve never gone out with anyone sirius responded raising his eyebrows instead you insult anyone who tries to get near you get over yourself black you re not some kind of psychoanalyst and not everyone a manwhore like you sirius still looked at her not seeming even remotelynettled by her words as if weighing something up well personally i think anyone who wants to go out with you needs a psychoanalyst oh shut up sapphire said sharply what is with the interrogation over who i go out with maybe i just dontwant a boyfriend have you ever considered that in the dung heap you call your mind sirius replied with only one word why for some reason this simple question seemed to incense sapphire even more and she stood up forcefully almost knocking lily over i going she barked i dontneed to explain myself to you she gave him a look of pure unadulterated loathing and stormed out sirius shrugged i dontenvy wilkes he said flashing a brilliant grin at a hufflepuff fifth year who smiled blushed and giggled her way out of the hall james choked on his orange juice and remus slapped him on the back as he sat down hey guys hey everyone answered emma gave him a shy smile as he looked at her and he returned it so what everyone doing remus poured cereal into a bowl james looked around sarcastically hm i dontknow what does one usually do at breakfast flirt sirius responded automatically he raised his voice hey madhura he called a pretty asian girl walking by arm in arm with her two best friends raised her eyebrows at him hi sirius are you free this saturday madhura smiled albeit mysteriously i might be depends what you want to know could i know if you d go out with me madhura looked him up and down i ll think about it she walked off talking to her two friends who had both been appraising sirius coolly as if determining whether or not he was good enough for her she a tough nut to crack sirius said watching her go that because she got beauty and brains so she doesntfall all over your feet like some bimbo james said wisely she d actually be worth your time and effort and interest well sirius began before he was interrupted by the arrival of the owl post no one paid much attention to the birds until a large eagle owl glided proudly down to sirius who eyed it with distaste oh no he said in a low voice unfastening the letter from its leg the owl ruffled its feathers gave him a haughty look and took off again almost deliberately taking his time sirius unfolded the parchment his eyes moved over the words inside but after a few moments it became clear that he was not really reading any more what wrong lily enquired watching his face pale slightly his eyes fixed on one point in the letter sirius started and looked up as if surprised to remember that they were all still there nothing he said shortly he looked down at his food and pushed his plate away before folding the letter up again and putting it into his pocket he stood up i not hungry i ll just go and er yeah he left the hall there was an awkward pause as six pairs of eyes followed his tall figure walking swiftly out of the hall well lily said trying to relieve the tension it must have been something big to drag sirius away from food james smiled but turned questioningly to remus whose gaze was still riveted on the closed door what was all that he said in an undertone remus shrugged go and find out he replied quietly who me now you re the best person for the job he ll talk to you he nudged james on the shoulder i think he was going outside resigned james too got up and walked off he knew lily intent green eyes were fixed on him in confusion as she had not heard any of their exchange but he stored that to deal with later and instead focused on the more pressing problem of where sirius had gone outside he shivered crossing his arms over his jumper and looked around before walking off into the gardens sure enough he soon found sirius sitting under a tree not far from the lake the letter was in his hand again but he was now twisting it around mechanically it freezing cold he said sitting down on the ground beside sirius he clasped his hands around his knees what re you doing out here just thinking sirius said he looked idly at the lake is that really all james asked come on padfoot we ve been best mates for seven years i know when you re not telling the whole truth no reply what was in the letter james asked quietly sirius exhaled a long slow breath my darling hag of a mother wrote to inform me that i ve been legally disowned what james said incredulously are you sure wordlessly sirius handed him the now crumpled piece of parchment and james opened it to skin over its contents phrases leapt out at him legally disowned cut off from the family inheritance frozen continuous association with unworthy peers disregard of family honour outright disobedience persistent refusal to co operate with familial traditions relentless waste of time on pranking shame to blood kin burnt off family tree james looked up at sirius who smiled grimly at his open mouth it all there he said bitterly take away the euphemisms and you can see exactly what they mean he paused for a moment plus as it says in there my wonderful little brother regulus is in total agreement with the proceedings being as he is a model black family heir the only heir now so much for brotherly love james regarded his best friend seriously so what now sirius shrugged most of my stuff is here i cantgo back there now i guess i ll have to find someplace else and then take everything else but where someplace else james asked in concern you know you can come back to my place and stay as long as you like mum and dad d love to have you yeah but i cantstay forever can i a frown passed over sirius face i reckon i might be able to buy an apartment of my own uncle alphard left me a decent bit of gold as soon as my birthday comes i ll have access to it he got blasted off the family tree for that he rubbed a hand wearily across his eyes and it was then that james noticed the recent scars on his knuckles he grabbed sirius hand and scrutinised it what happened here sirius pulled his hand away the day of alyssa s funeral phineas turned up when we were about to leave dumbledore s office with a message from mother about my impure morals when i got back i was pissed off i went outside and even though moony tried to calm me down i ended up punching a tree james raised his eyebrows but refrained from commenting after a while sirius spoke again i suppose that little episode should have been a warning for today his eyes suddenly flashed vehemently i hate the lot of them my blinded parents my soft brother all convinced that to have wizard blood makes you practically royal the only way i would ever have pleased them would have been if i had killed off half the muggle borns in school commanded the heir of slytherin or something james could do nothing but watch his friend compassionately he could not imagine life without his own parents and sister and they were a family that he loved how must sirius feel again it was sirius who broke the silence he drew a long slightly shuddery breath as if trying to hold onto the one thing in the world that made sense i dontknow james it feels like i ve suddenly had to grow up overnight and face my family ideals head on for the first time and it too fast he gave a short embittered laugh what am i talking about i dont have a family now any more you have me james said quietly sirius looked at him for a moment yeah i know he said and i wouldnttrade you you re more my brother than regulus ever was but you re not he did not have to say the last word and james could have fitted it in easily enough blood the word hung in the air heavily james watched sirius profile the profile of a man grown from the same profile of an eleven year old boy that had befriended him and grown as close to him as no one else could come and suddenly he had an idea padfoot do you have your penknife with you sirius took out a penknife with a burnished wooden handle it was a valuable aid to the marauders having attachments that could unlock any lock and undo any knot but it was the sharp steel blade that james needed now taking the knife in one hand he reached out for sirius turned it over palm upwards and made a diagonal slash across it with the blade sirius snatched his hand away what re you doing he demanded as the blood welled up he gaped as james without answering opened his own fist and made a deep diagonal cut in it the crimson liquid bubbled up almost delicately highlighting a startlingly red line over his palm james shut up james muttered throwing the knife aside onto the grass he pulled sirius hand just before he could wipe away the blood and pressed it against his own both boys winced slightly as their damaged skin came into contact and a dull yet searing pain washed over them james did not take his eyes from their hands and sirius could feel that as his own blood left him another kind was coming in he felt a strange tingle up his arm a few minutes later james took his hand away and pulled out a handkerchief so that they could clean up the mess around the cut sirius watched his blood slowly clot across until all that was left was a brown line across the pale skin he looked up finding his throat strangely dry you we re blood brothers james sounded slightly hoarse himself if blood was what we needed to make it official then blood is what we ve got he looked down at his hand besides it gives mum even more of a reason to cluck over you when you come home home it as a word used so freely and easily among others yet sirius had always loathed its sound knowing as he did what home constituted for him then had come the time that he had left 12 grimmauld place and there had been no home but now james house home he could get used to that thanks he said gruffly closing his fist the marks stung a little but this was one wound that he preferred to heal the muggle way with time if i was a girl i d hug you james rolled his eyes oh come here one time only the two of them hugged briefly and when they drew back sirius knew that there was no one else who would ever take james place james looked at his watch you know we re late for charms he commented with a wry smile he stood up and brushed himself off what do you say we swashbuckle up in true marauder style and skive off sirius grinned and accepted his offer of a hand to help him up i d say you almost took after me when it came to very good ideas prongs old friend he paused but it does seem a bit unfair to leave moony and wormtail stuck in class he stooped to pick up his knife ah james tapped his head boy badge fondly this has more uses than you d think and so it was that lily walked into charms that morning only to wonder where james was remus and peter had no answers and she was left to wonder about the empty places where james and sirius usually sat about halfway through the lesson a knock sounded on the door lily like everyone else looked up as it opened and she stared as james stepped in looking no different from usual apart from rather windblown hair wearing his most serious and mature expression i terribly sorry to be late to your class professor he said politely but i was detained by some problems he appeared to hesitate could i possibly borrow remus lupin and peter pettigrew for the remainder of the lesson please potter professor flitwick squeaked you do realise your newts are only months away you need all the theory yes sir but it rather urgent lily would have laughed out loud if she could as james managed to make himself look even more serious and head boyish but the notes you will miss flitwick said despairingly lily bit down hard on her lip and fought to control her expression james flickered briefly over remus and peter and then surprisingly over herself lily said she would give us her notes to copy up this evening he said smoothly flitwick turned to lily is this true miss evans he asked curiously lily confused as she was did not miss the cue the cue to lie like hell yes professor she answered clearly keeping her face neutral james already asked me before very well very well flitwick sighed in resignation mr lupin mr pettigrew you may go be sure that all three of you catch up we shall be moving on tomorrow and make sure you give miss evans back her notes when you re done yes sir the three boys muttered as james held the door open for remus and peter lily caught a glimpse of a dark head beyond to a side which could only be sirius odd she thought as the door clicked shut and flitwick began talking again i wonder what going on by that evening she was still wondering she was pretty sure james knew that she expected some sort of explanation but so far it hadntcome he had mouthed a silent thanks at her in defence against the dark arts and had been his usual self perhaps even louder than usual self at dinner however she suspected that this was more to cover up the fact that sirius was not being his usual self he was much quieter than usual managing only a few halfhearted jokes mostly at sapphire expense after dinner she had hoped to get james on his own but he had suddenly relapsed into one of his moods and disappeared she had been left with no option than to go to the library to research some facts for transfiguration now walking back towards the common room at ten o clock she considered again all the possible options well at the moment she could think of only one thing that could have caused sirius to react like this the death of somebody close but she pondered as she climbed up a flight of stairs she had seen sirius react to his family before and it had not been like this still maybe at that moment she could have sworn she heard a faint noise as something shot past her in the corner of her eye she spun round but had no time to think before the ground began to rumble beneath her feet and the staircase she was on slid slowly up and across to another wall as soon as she had stepped off the stairs moved away again leaving her stuck silently she cursed she more or less knew where she was in a dark little used corridor but it would take her nearly ten minutes longer to get back heaving a deep sigh she started walking again slowly another sound began to force itself upon her ears footsteps she stopped and swung round perhaps those tiresome stairs had carried some else away too the footsteps had stopped too however shrugging she turned back she must have been hearing her own echo but as soon as she started moving again the footsteps started up again too they were out of step with her own and she could have sworn that there were now two sets stopping again she turned hello she called out she strained her eyes in the strange half light but could see no figure approaching hello poppet lily swivelled round and froze four tall figures were standing n front of her in a line effectively blocking the corridor at first she could see only that they were all male and then she managed to put names to faces rodolphus lestrange lucius malfoy antonin dolohov regulus black oh no she turned on her heel intending to walk back the way she had come but there were two people there as well smirking narcissa and bellatrix black she was trapped swallowing she turned back to face the four slytherins in front well arentyou even going to be polite lucius malfoy drawled silence is no way to greet us lily glared at him icily and let her hand drift almost casually towards her wand ah ah ah malfoy shook his head but his wand was already out that not nice what do you want lily demanded determined not to show her fear well bellatrix said smoothly as she and narcissa came around to stand with the boys i suppose you remember a little incident on hallowe en where you decided to insult severus snape we do believe we owe you something for that rodolphus added what lily exclaimed in outrage you re not even his friend be that as it may mudblood malfoy said silkily he is a slytherin and one of our own therefore we must how shall i put it avenge his defeat lily looked them all in the eye and realised that they meant business a sudden shiver shot down her spine but she still kept her head up hoping desperately that a plan of escape would flash into her mind nothing came ahh look at the ickle head girl trying to get away she scared of us bellatrix said a scornful smile curved on her lips as though this were the most ridiculous thing in the world bella dontbe silly she was scared before we even turned up narcissa said didntyou hear her calling she imitated lily voice hello hello a mocking smile appeared on her face too as though she honestly expected someone to answer you ve got nothing coming to you that you dontdeserve antonin said fake cheerfully simultaneously all six took a step forward and lily looked round behind her at the empty corridor steeling herself to run when she looked back she found six wands all trained on her the next moments seemed to play in slow motion both at the time and when lily looked back on seeing the wands her eyes widened and she pulled out her own wand six voices shouted stupefy at the same time looking back she remembered hearing dimly running footsteps behind her six flashes of red light seemed to travel towards her almost as if time itself had slowed down to almost a standstill she watched them advance towards her defenceless body suddenly at the last moment she felt a huge push and was shoved to the side only to crash against the wall and land painfully on her bag all six jets of light hit a rather taller figure instead who crumpled to the floor silence rang through the corridor from where she lay lily could just about make out through blurry vision lucius malfoy as he stepped forward to look at the face of her unknown saviour he smirked and turned to the others look what we have here he called the poor little mudblood knight in shining armour someone laughed but another voice piped up regulus black come on let go when that mudblood wakes up the first thing she ll do is run for teachers not if we sort her out properly snarled bellatrix voice lucius stopped her letit go she ll have worse coming to her in the future we ll leave he kicked the motionless body in the stomach and then in the back so that it rolled over and moved out of her view footsteps receded but it was still some time before lily was able to roll painfully to a side rubbing her bruised shoulder painfully her vision was almost clear so she slowly got to her feet feeling a throbbing where her head had hit the wall to see who the figure lying face down on the floor was and gasped as she saw the messy black hair it was james a n okay before you all kill me painfully yes i know i seriously apologise for the long wait i ve had exam after exam first music exams then final future deciding as levels and life in general has been sucky but now i free well for a week or so until i come off study leave and go back to school again so i shall post as much as i can and i working really hard on chapter 35 so keep your fingers crossed for me and just remember that if you kill me you ll never get to find out what happens to sirius and sapphire or how lily and james get it together got you convinced good by the way how about a little review to pass your time while you wait the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you chapter 28 danger signs well at the tone of lily impatient voice sirius sighed loudly as she sprang off her chair and came towards him so how he doing she asked worriedly the same as he was at lunchtime still unconscious no change but there shouldntbe any lasting damage that all you have to say sirius raised an eyebrow at her look lily he said tiredly if you re so worried about james why dontyou just go and visit him he been up there for two days now and i doubt you ve even set foot over the doorway lily flushed pink i i have homework she said lamely sirius snorted yeah we both believe that i do lily gestured at the table in fact i d better go do it now hurriedly she walked back rolling his eyes sirius shrugged suit yourself he walked off to his dorm ignoring a third year that was batting her eyelashes at him lily sat down feeling glum sirius words were true ever since the attack had happened two days ago when she had nearly been hit by six stunning spells but been shoved to a side by james who had turned up from nowhere and got hit in her stead she had been unwilling to go to the hospital wing to see him for reasons she could not explain even to herself instead she had quizzed practically interrogated the marauders every time one of them came back from a visit the conversations inevitably ended like the one above no matter whether it was remus sirius or peter she was talking to lily groaned inwardly this was ridiculous she had to go see him he was like a business partner for god sake that was it she would go and visit her fellow head student nothing to it she packed up and left before she could back out of it her burst of adrenaline carried her all the way to the hospital wing and into an argument with madam pomfrey on the length of her visit having managed to bargain for fifteen minutes she walked into the cool clean room and headed towards the bed surrounded by screens at the end the first thing that punched her in the face when she stepped around the screen was the explosion of colours and smells that blasted themselves at her senses the source a table beside the bed piled high with bunch upon bunch of flowers all still wrapped neatly in their cellophane wrappers dotted around them were boxes of chocolates all stacked precariously on top of each other raising her eyebrows lily read a few of the tags get well soon james darling love leana hope to see you up soon all the love in the world elise she made a face his fan club from the looks of things all of this was from them not that it was doing him much good taking her gaze off the table lily approached the bed andsat down cautiouslyon a chair beside the head unsure of herself she clasped her hands in her lap and looked at him despite the fact that he was unconscious she could not help thinking that apart from the pallor of his face he looked as though he were about to wake up from a deep sleep he looked different without his glasses more innocent and vulnerable and lily could easily imagine that were he to open his eyes they would not have their usual sharp focus his skin was so white that it blended in with the clinical white bedding and hospital issue pyjamas for all of this his hair stood out in stark contrast like a raven feather lying on snow if it were not for the slight rise and fall of his chest he could have been almost dontthink it lily told herself sternly you re here to visit the boy not mourn him she took a deep breath hi james she said quietly it me lily i ve come to visit after two long days i sorry it took me a while i ve had homework at this statement sirius words echoed back to her and lily knew she could not lie even to someone who couldnthear her okay no it wasntthat the truth was i dontknow it was just hard for me to come up here she swallowed i owe you my thanks james you saved me from those stunners and i know you paid for it in full he had as well quite apart from the fact that he was unconscious when she hadmanaged to gethim up to the hospital wing blood had been dripping from a cut in his head and sirius had told her later that there was bruising on his shoulder where he had hit the ground and on his back stomach and ribs where malfoy had kicked him apparently there had also been slight internal bleeding in his stomach malfoy had not been gentle mostly healed now of course but had he been left to himself there could have been the possibility of death suddenly realizing something as she thought of this lily looked back at the still figure i guess i know now what sergeant wood was talking about at alyssa funeral she said softly you did what alyssa did and got hurt in someone else stead she sighed nobility you have that damn streak of nobleness that makes you worry about keeping other people safe and forget about yourself unconsciously she reached forward and brushed her hand gently over his hair pushing it back from his face the black strands were surprisingly soft to the touch and as she pushed it away she felt a rush of tenderness i wontbe surprised if even your kid has the same fault she remarked dryly suddenly realising she was still smoothing his untameable hair she pulled her hand away as if it were burnt and flushed thankful that there was no on there to see her well uhm i dontknow if you know it but i not the only one who turned up obviously you ve had quite a lot of admirers asking after you sirius said that apparently they ve all been turned away from seeing you but uh the evidence is piled up on that table lily smiled fondly sirius is something else entirely he manages it up here before breakfast at lunch and some time in the evening he says he wants to relieve the monotony of whatever it is you re thinking about there personally i think he hoping you wake up just because you get sick of hearing his voice so much and i have no idea how he getting round madam pomfrey so much her voice faded at her next words he was the first person i met when i was trying to get you to the hospital wing you know i was really out of it myself and i didntknow what to do with you i ended up levitating you and then sirius met me halfway he went white when he saw you james i swear i ve never seen anyone look like that when i managed to get out what had happened he was so angry if it werentfor you lying in mid air and me about to faint i think i think he d have murdered lucius malfoy and his cousin and and his brother with his own hands she looked at the pale face willing something anything to happen to prove she had a listener nothing did well i still dontknow why you and him disappeared that day i asked remus and all he did was sigh and say i would find out eventually i hope i do i have to admit i curious and sirius has changed he had as well lily did not understand how someone like sirius who she had known for coming up to seven years could change so completely in the space of one or two days but now was not the time to be thinking of that she reminded herself anyway remus and peter come up here once a day they re doing their part too remus duplicated all his notes so you dontmiss any class work and peter worked out nearlya million strategies for quidditch so that if when you get out you can get straight to work with the team you know how good he is at chess this is like child play for him lily sighed and i she paused i ve been doing your bit for the head work but you re going to have to take a look at the accounts w when you re back i know i ve done something wrong she laughed nervously no surprises there huh miss evans madam pomfrey had come around the edge of the screen out this boy needs his peace you must have talked his ear off by now she went back around the curtains muttering far too many friends visiting no rest at all lily smiled at the sleeping boy bye she said in a low voice get well soon i we miss you she followed madam pomfrey out behind the screen however there was movement a muscle twitched and a few moments later james potter eyes blinked slowly open a few days later james was restored to his friends still looking wan but greeted heartily he spent a lot of time sitting down and everyone knew of the bandages still around his ribs and the way he winced slightly and put a hand to his chest when he yawned but perhaps he found at least a partial reward in lily warm friendship and cheerful smiles at him his general outfit out of school consisted of baggy sweatshirts and jeans but he was not allowed an exception during school hours the bandages clearly visible through his white school shirt seemed only to spur on his numerous giggling well wishers indeed the marauders had always been one of the focuses of school attention either for their pranks looks detention records or even simply because of the bonds of friendship that held them together so closely but now now only one topic of conversation was riveting all the gossipmongers of hogwarts it had outstripped the news of the head boy attack indeed almost everyone at hogwarts was discussing it from teachers down to first years whether with curiosity shock admiration or loathing a sentiment reserved mainly by the slytherins the subject of all this debate sirius black himself sirius had always been much sought after by the female population of hogwarts he was dangerously good looking his dark hair and grey eyes sent out lethal vibes of attraction to all girls combine those with a toned body and that charming mischievous grin that made him james twin and he was a perilous person to entangle your heart with his eyes alone were the charybdis the whirlpool in which most girls drowned helplessly despite this he was always known as a fun loving prankster with a bad boy overtone that was not downplayed by his detention record which only james could rival suddenly however something had altered drastically since that fateful day when he had left the hall so quickly at breakfast his persona had done a gearshift he constantly had a slightly moody expression on and now seemed more defiant the strange dearth of marauder pranks since they had entered seventh year which lily had never truly appreciated was now being made up for by more or less sirius alone pranks and tricks were being played in their multitudes on both teachers and unsuspecting students slytherins but they now seemed more of an act of rebellion rather than to get a laugh streams of students ran out of classrooms holding their noses as dungbombs were let off in hoards only tobe targeted by water balloons that fell from every available inch of space above eggs and flour showered onto slytherins wherever they walked chalk refused to write books fell mysteriously onto the floor chairs tipped over for no apparent reason legs of tables disappeared cupboards toppled over when no one was near them quills and parchment vanished before a student eyes and ink drained away or evaporated the moment the bottle was opened professor flitwick stack of cushions which he sat on in order to see over his desk disappeared from his cupboard and were found dangling out of a window with ribbons tied to them a few hours later the tricks were all fairly juvenile and not particularly original but the quantity of them seemed to suggest a prank on a grand scale strangely enough this sudden change in manner which should have put girls at least somewhat in awe of sirius seemed only to increase his appeal the cold eyes alone would have scared lily off had she been a first year but apparently kids these days were made of tougher stuff he had always been the most dangerous sexy and rebellious of the marauders and now that had moved to an entirely new level and his allure had increased tenfold everything from the way his hair flicked into his eyes to the way he lounged back in his chair in lessons was squealed about in the corridors and common rooms yet with the increase in attention had come sirius decrease in interest usually playing himself off to the best angle with his fawning admirers he was now doing the exact opposite the oddest thing was that he did not ask for any extra attention from them by flirting in any way the only girls he now even gave the time of day to were lily and emma possibly because he knew they were not falling all over him possibly out of respect for the fact that they were the objects of affection of two of his best friends althoughlily wasntto know that although she was almost convinced that before long sirius would return to himself lily was still concerned enough to ask james about it sirius is just he working through something james had said calmly he had to wake up and grow up and quite frankly i glad he not punching people to let it out if pranking is the way forward for him to deal with life them i all for it and indeed james was somehow finding the energy in his bruised and battered body to stay true to the spirit of the marauders and back sirius up in every prank he played peter was just small enough to sneak into various rooms to place pre prepared tricks or to provide an innocent looking decoy and angelic as remus looked lily was sure that he was the mastermind behind some of their jokes she could not understand any of it when lily sat down to do homework with her friends that particular day neither she nor they had any idea of what was to come tensions were running high once again among the seventh years as essay after essay was set random pieces of parchment were strewn over the table they were all sharing among various heavy books borrowed from the library james and peter were nearby lying on the floor and working arduously for once through homework the atmosphere was fairly peaceful and quiet until the portrait hole swung open and a babbling crowd of first years entered clambering noisily in hey james called can you be a little quieter please we re knee deep in homework we need to concentrate about half of the first years shut up and looked as though they were about to wet themselves the other half eyed james with wary suspicion ah dontmind the big bad head boy came a voice he just stressed out the first years all turned to see sirius climbing in after them every mouth snapped shut and they all stared sirius rolled his eyes go on kids shoo they all scuttled off and sirius headed over remus behind him honestly james you ought to keep a tighter rein on the firsties he said leisurely as he threw himself onto a low seat opposite the girls well you flush my reputation straight down the drain when you say things like big bad head boy james said dipping his quill into his ink bottle and frowning at his parchment it my duty to do that sirius said that as i have reminded you countless times is why i going to be best man at your wedding and that is why i never marrying james mumbled under his breath unfortunately for him sirius had sharp ears yes you are james he said you re marrying black sapphire said unable to stand it any more could you please be quiet i really need to finish this it was a dangerous thing to do sirius focus switched onto her like a spotlight though as her head was down she missed the full effect oh dear he said mockingly i ve disturbed the great one sapphire of the mud you disturbed me from day one sapphire said absently as she skimmed through a page of a huge reference book yellowed with age and covered with tiny print life was so much more peaceful when you werentaround forgive me o gracious one sirius stated sarcastically i know i a disappointment to the world in general but it pains me so much more that i disappoint you too james looked up swiftly something in sirius words or tone seemed to have made him uneasy sirius he said warningly but the boy ignored him remus was watching him warily now too yes well you take away many people peace of mind with your antics not just mine sapphire muttered sirius raised an eyebrow but lily who had now looked up to wonder why james was eyeing his best friend carefully thought this was more to hide an emotion than to express one little miss sapphire in the mud he said quietly but with a harsh undertone always insists on acting like she knows more than she actually does always second guessing everyone around her always making assumptions about how things work that was an even more dangerous thing to say from nowhere sapphire stood up sharply and slammed her book shut with a loud thud causing parchment to flutter off the table that is it she exploded i have had it up to here with your wisecracks and your smartarse attitude what is wrong with you sapphire lily started recognizing the danger signal in her highly strung at the moment friend why dontyou calm no lily sapphire snapped without taking her eyes off sirius i want an answer you clearly have a problem with me black you continually pick on me why within a few seconds the tension in the air had risen to an unpleasant pitch a giant neon sign could not have done a better job of announcing the conflict to the entire population of gryffindor as everyone else in the common roomswivelled round noting the sudden decrease in noise sapphire half turned to see the rest of the common room staring back at her what she barked mind your own business quickly everyone went back to what they were doing and the sound of chatter rose again sapphire looked back at sirius well she asked her voice dangerously soft i want an answer for once and for all what is yourproblem with me a n oooh cliffie and in my mind it hasntlost too much of its momentum from when i first wrote it though i suppose the effect is a little lower for those of you that read this the first time round and know what happens next still posts as often as possible right and until then i would very much appreciate a review from all you nice people go on hit that button the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you a n thanks to all of you who reviewed because you all rock my socks enormously chapter 29 on both sides of the wall there was silence james and remus were both watching sirius intently whose expression was twisted up into a half sneer emma had a warning hand on sapphire arm and lily was half out of her seat peter had got to his feet watching them carefully sapphire herself was using her height to her fullest advantage standing up she towered over her arch enemy who was still lounged on his beanbag seat what sapphire demanded angrily is it my hair that offends you or the way i speak what is it that constantly makes you taunt me why do you have such a huge problem with me why cantyou just leave me alone she was so worked up in a frenzy of angry emotion that she did not realise the wisps of hair lying on her face as they drifted out of her bun all her energy was being used in her glare if looks could kill the boy opposite would have been six feet under by now with third degree burns sirius his expression still that of a mocking sneer opened his mouth i ha he started in a disdainful voice then all of a sudden he stopped and shut his mouth lily watched as he frowned opened his mouth took a breath as if to speak and then closed it again his frown deepened his eyes still fixed on sapphire furious face it seemed as though all five of the onlookers were holding their breaths for sirius reply but he appeared to have no intention of giving one soon his forehead creased even further as he looked at her and he narrowed his eyes suddenly he froze his body tensed up a look of shocked realization spread across his handsome features and a tinge of horror followed it his face drained of colour for the first time he dropped his gaze from sapphire to the carpet shaking his head much like a dog as if to clear it padfoot peter said uncertainly sirius ignored him and looked back up at sapphire for a few moments the surprise was still evident on his face but slowly and clearly with a lot of energy he forced his face back to a carefully neutral expression well sapphire said sounding almost at the verge of hysterics what it going to be why do you have such an issue with me sirius thin self control was slipping it was clear to everyone how he was losing it a fixated glare from sapphire brought him to his feet facing her and traces of anger began to creep through fine he ground out through gritted teeth you want to know the moment the words were out of his mouth he looked as though he regretted them finally he gets it sapphire cried with a half hysterical laugh finally i ve got through to black thick head yes you arsehole i want to know why this always happens sirius breathed heavily patches of pink appearing on his cheeks not until he had himself fully under control face blank of emotion did he open his mouth again i like you even as he said it lily saw the honest shock in his eyes at hearing himself say the words out aloud as if that had finally cemented what he had just realised deep blue eyes met stormy grey ones well sapphire said as though she hadntheard his words are you asking a question or telling me the reason black time ticking sirius face was unreadable i like you he said in a low controlled tone happy now he wheeled round and walked out of the common room for the second time in ten minutes there was complete and utter silence every single face looked shell shocked apart from sapphire who was wearing the most horrified expression lily had ever seen after a few moments james cleared his throat awkwardly uh sorry excuse us the three boys got up and walked out leaving all three girls more or less motionless slowly sapphire sank back into her chair and put her face into her hands after a moment she raised her head slightly someone tell me the last few minutes were just figments of my imagination she said through her fingers lily could only shake her head dumbly as james led remus and peter down the corridor part of him was wondering where he was going to find his best friend the other rather larger part was busy replaying and re replaying the last conversation and wondering if it was possibly for someone to have taken polyjuice potion to act as sirius perhaps he was about to find out that this was all a big joke perhaps not as they rounded the corner a dark figure was sitting down curled up with head in arms against the wall and without a shadow of a doubt james knew that this was the real sirius so much for hoping that this was an elaborate prank padfoot remus said quietly it us there was nothing and then sirius raised his head off his arms tell me i did not just say what i think i said back there he said hoarsely peter shrugged wish we could mate okay sapphire wiped her cheeks so can someone tell me this is just some stupid prank black pulling on me emma shook her head he didntlook like he was joking saffy but but this has to be a prank sapphire burst out black doesntlike me i donteven and he knows i hate his this is all some set up they probably just went out so they could bust a gut laughing it cant she held up her hands as if in surrender look i can even take it well ha ha very funny joke over saffy lily enunciated each word carefully i really dontthink this is any kind of joke please let this be a joke sirius groaned some sick twisted joke my mind is playing on me he looked up hopefully or someone could just shoot me and get it over with james remus and peter all exchanged glances we would james said with a straight face but seeing as we re the only people here we d be incriminated too easily not marauder style at all sirius buried his head in his arms again and let out a muffled groan you know what from now on just carry one of those gags around with you and if i ever look like i about to put my foot in my mouth use it right peter said trying to get a laugh out of sirius that can go on your christmas list uh padfoot seriously just to clear all doubts was this some sort of prank gone wrong remus questioned sirius shook his head so you do like her he does not like me sapphire nearly threw herself out of her chair hands pressed over her ears dontsay that you re all in this together with that bastard emma and lily winced at her choice of wording no we re not lily said placatingly we re with you all the way you know that we re just telling you what we saw emma looked earnestly at her friend i think he really does you know no he does not saffy face the facts you saw the look on his face as well as any of us so so i think he only just realised that he uhm lily paused trying to put it in the way that would be least offensive to sapphire ears that he had feelings for you the question is emma put in do you like him no yes maybe i dont i dontknow remus raised an eyebrow yes sirius that made it perfectly clear to all of us poor souls who dont live in your world i dontknow i opened my mouth to tell her i hated her and and i couldntget the words out so you do like her then i i ll take that to mean a yes james said dryly mr sirius black player extraordinaire the original bad boy himself has fallen for the one girl who wontfall for him prongs remus shoved james with his elbow be a little tactful james potter the name brutal honesty the game james cocked his head face it padfoot you act like a five year old every time she comes near you it not my fault sapphire moaned head on the table apparently not paying attention to emma it not my fault that he had to go spew out a load of crap not that he doesntdo that every time he opens his mouth but still pricks and arseholes are only meant to like other pricks and arseholes i not a prick or an arsehole lily raised her eyebrows i take it you dontreturn his feelings do i look like i return them sapphire demanded furiously clearly not lily muttered sapphire put her head in her hands again why did this happen why did it have to happen to me it not my fault sirius protested she just always brings out the worst in me well apparently that didntstop you from well liking her this is so wrong sirius groaned it wasntmeant to be like this the four of them were quiet for a moment casting flickering shadows against the wall as they considered the best course of action in the end there was only one course of action padfoot remus said carefully you know what you have to do dontyou he paused you have to talk to her what sapphire cried you know that what you have to do saffy you have to talk to him and get things straight that just plain unfair well that life emma said comfortingly i dontlike life sapphire said petulantly deciding not to point out the fact that this statement made little sense lily sighed saffy seriously you need to talk to him now noo sirius half shouted no sapphire yelled come on sirius you ll have to do it some time if you re going to spring a bombshell on her you owe it to her to explain a bit walking out doesnttell her much remus reasoned persuasively sirius looked around him actually i quite happy out here i could summon a few cloaks to sleep on for the rest of the year and you guys could bring me food saffy you ll have to talk to him some time you canttell me you can avoid him for the next well for the rest of the school year yes i can sapphire said obstinately i ll stay in the girls dorms emma can bring me food and you can lend me your notes from all your classes try to feed your bottomless stomach yeah right peter retorted remus right as usual realistically sirius you have to talk to her soon so you may as well get it over with now sirius leaned his head against the wall and let out a long breath i suppose you re right he said in a strangled voice he stood up and dusted himself off now or never right right james said encouragingly full steam ahead put in peter remus raised an eyebrow at him and peter shut his mouth rolling his eyes when remus turned away with the slow step of a doomed man walking to the scaffold sirius began to head back to the portrait his expression well it would not have been out of place at a funeral james turned to peter the encouraging tone fading from his voice dead man walking if you think lily said firmly that i am going to encourage you staying in the dorms then you ve got another think coming look saffy emma pleaded all you have to do is have one little five minute talk with the boy tell him thanks but no thanks and then it all over forever is that so hard yes sapphire said stubbornly emma sighed and looked over sapphire head at lily any blackmail material we can use against her she asked lily looked thoughtful nope dontthink so not at the moment ha sapphire said triumphantly you cantmake me do anything emma sighed again well that does only leave one option she said force what sapphire screeched as her friends grabbed her by the elbows and dragged her bodily out of her chair she scrabbled frantically at the table in a useless attempt to gain purchase you cantdo this you ve given us no other choice lily pointed out she and emma frogmarched a struggling sapphire halfway across the room before she suddenly gave in and went limp making them stop fine she said wearily i ll talk to him she rubbed her eyes but i am not responsible for anything i do or say out there duly noted lily said impatiently now go get this over with as they watched sapphire take the smallest slowest steps possible to the portrait hole lily looked round at emma god this is like the titanic except without the romance because the ship sank before it even set off emma looked confused muggle thing lily said quickly sirius managed it almost up to the fat lady james and remus were both poised in case he turned and ran but so far there seemed to be no trouble it was when he opened his mouth presumably to say the password that he shut it again and sighed raking a hand through his hair i cantdo this he said quietly i honestly can t he slumped against the wall next to the portrait his back against the stone lily and emma watched as sapphire dragged her feet reluctantly towards the entrance half expecting her to turn and flee but she didn t slowly she put her hand on the back of the picture to push it open and then dropped it back to her side forget it really i i cantgo through with this she said wearily not now lily opened her mouth to argue but emma put an arm on her shoulder effectively silencing her they observed sapphire lean back on the wall next to the entrance and sigh her hands flat against the stone supporting her back unbeknownst to the other both sirius and sapphire leaning on either side of the same wall one in the bright light of the common room the other in a dark corridor lit only by torchlight groaned quietly and put a hand to their foreheads before simultaneously uttering just two words why me by the time sirius re entered the common room it was more or less empty without bothering to look around he headed straight for his dormitory clearly having no intention of talking not that it would have done much good if he had as the only person left on the couch was lily her head turned away from them sapphire had gone up to bed with emma who was ever the persuasive peacemaker and lily had enough sense to let emma calm sapphire down a little more before she went up herself remus seeing lily watching the dancing flames nudged james go talk to her he whispered why james muttered because you idiot we need some kind of communication going on or this will never get sorted accepting this as a valid point james let his best friends go on up and walked over to lily sitting down opposite she turned startled oh it you she said smiling with relief hi weird night huh james said stretching himself out and yawning tell me about it lily agreed she eyed him you should really go to bed you know so should you i waiting for things to calm down in the dorm so am i point taken good james put his hands behind his head you know when i told remus i was sure we would have an exciting night after mcgonagall handed out those essay questions i was being sarcastic i didntexpect this i dontthink anyone did lily said sleepily it a pity sapphire had to go and start things off isntit james yawned again but lily had lifted her head suddenly come again well if she hadntasked him to shut up they wouldnthave ended up like this lily had sat up fully saffy start this correct me if i wrong but all i heard was her asking politely if he could let her finish her essay and he started in on her no shut up there well he wasntdoing much was he besides take away the politeness and you ve got a basic shut your trap that what she meant how would you know and anyway she still said it politely so there was no call for him to start making fun of her both girl and boy were now glaring at each other eyes narrowed their voices were rising each time lily grew a shade louder james tones rose to match it she told him to shut up she asked him politely she still told him to shut up but she still asked him politely it not illegal to talk well we were all working he could have talked some other time he was trying to lighten the mood god knows you needed it lily stared angrily at him they were both so caught up in glaring at each other that everything else including the slight click of the portrait hole closing escaped them since when did this get personal since you started insulting my best friend and blaming him for things he didntdo you are the most infuriating boy no prat that i ve ever met she declared good to know i ve gained a title james smiled sardonically lily huffed i going to bed before this gets even uglier fine fine they got up in unison and walked towards their respective dormitories but neither had actually reached the stairs when remus came clattering down the stairs is stopping he looked round the empty common room and his face turned slightly paler than usual ah james we have a problem james raised his eyebrows what the matter uh padfoot not in the dorm remus caught sight of lily still staring at them from her staircase and seemed to choose his next words very carefully he not on the uhm marauder s aid either james eyes widened you re not being serious he gone to h remus quirked an eyebrow at him and james remembering that lily was still in the room cut himself off as remus nodded how did he i left him on his bed and went to the bathroom and when i came back he wasntthere any more remus said miserably so i checked the uhm thing that i checked and he wasnton it that only leaves one place he can be oh shite james said in a voice that for him was close to frantic he ran a hand though his hair and looked at his watch and at this time too god what was he thinking knowing him he wasntthinking at all which is why we have to go bring him back from you know where using you know what you know what he ll be like are you kidding me okay so we do it on f remembering lily james changed mid sentence special days but this is different isntthere anything else he tilted his head wearing an expression which lily couldntsee but remus evidently could see and understand because he rolled his eyes yeah prongs mastermind idea let go up sit on our beds and twiddle our thumbs while singing ten green bottles so we can pass the time until he comes back he snorted sarcastically are you crazy are you crazy james shot back hate to have to bring this up but i head boy i ll get murdered for remus looked exasperated who else is there pete disappeared and i cantdo it by myself besides he only listens to you take the damn badge off and let go james seemed to deflate a little okay yeah you re right he said grimacing have you got the er remus held up a satchel i ve got our cloaks plus sirius knife the uh aid and your spare cloak which makes you extra warm a look passed between the two of them which lily did not understand right then james said putting the satchel on we ll get our stuff on outside hold on a minute lily spoke up stepping forward from her stairs to face them where re you going james turned impatiently not now lily it none of your business he had said the wrong thing again lily eyes glittered dangerously as she took a step forward you may have forgotten your responsibilities but i still head girl therefore it is my business if you decide to go gallivanting around in the middle of the night like hell it is james snapped his temper getting the better of him again what i do is none of your concern and anyway i not gallivanting then what wrong with sirius lily persisted where is he that so worries you that you have to leave the common room at this time of night he s james searched for an appropriate excuse drowning his sorrows remus murmured under his breath james elbowed him shut up he hissed from the corner of his mouth he took a deep breath lily just go to bed at lily rebellious look he almost groaned out loud look i donthave the time to spoon feed you the details of everything i do sirius is fine i fine we re all fine we just have things to do go to bed and i ll see you in the morning without waiting for a reply he and remus took off lily watched the portrait hole swing shut angrily she walked back to the sofa and sat down determined to wait for them even if it took all night she fully intended to give them a piece of her mind when they got back from whatever god forsaken jaunt they were off on she would sit and wait and so lulled by the gentle crackle of the dying flames she fell asleep a n i seriously apologise for the loooooong delay in getting this chapter up the fact is this term has been the most stressful of my life and i ve been caught up in applying to university what i do want you guys all to know is that i will carry this on and finish it but that i cantguarantee updates on a regular i e weekly basis but thank you to all of you who

stuck it in sorry if you didntlike it the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want

again for anything it wontbe going up again so i wontrisk it enjoy the reposted chapter 3 seriously i love you all loads amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp chapter 3 shocks and consequences finally lily said as she and emma sat down in the great hall despite the fact that they were both rather damp peeves had decided to hold a water balloon display in the entrance hall as the students arrived his twisted way of celebrating emma had remarked she was looking forward to some hot food and thought longingly of her warm bed up in the tower trying not to fall asleep she focused on her plate that was when she noticed the envelope tucked under it addressed to lily evans head girl curiously she opened it and removed a single piece of parchment her eyes skimmed over the words oh my she muttered and she looked up the table to see james who had apparently just read his letter and was looking at her as well for the few seconds that their eyes met they both wore identical expressions of shock although lily held some horror in it as well she broke the gaze and banged her head down onto the table uhmm lily emma questioned she tapped lily carefully on the back what exactly are you doing to the table lily voice sounded muffled but was quite clearly still full of despair read the letter retrieving the parchment from where it had fallen emma began to read as lily buried her head in her arms dear miss evans we are pleased to congratulate you once more on becoming head girl you will be working in partnership with the head boy who this year is james potter also of gryffindor as role models for the rest of the school the two of you are expected to work in co operation with each other and set aside any personal differences much responsibility is given to the head students and it is hoped that these new powers will not be abused as this letter may well be depriving you of a much needed dinner the full details of your jobs will be explained to you by professor mcgonagall a weekly time slot has been set up where you and mr potter will be able to discuss any business necessary and it is expected that you will attend these meetings and devote at least two hours to the work given you have kindly been granted permission by professor mcgonagall to use the transfiguration classroom from 7 until 9pm on monday evenings meetings will begin immediately with best wishes for the following year albus dumbledore minerva mcgonagall emma looked at lily what so bad about this lily lifted her head and gave emma a furious glare what so bad what so bad look at it work in partnership with james potter that i already knew and screamed about work in co operation and set aside personal differences i sorry but potter and me co operation not possible and personal differences there are so many it ll take years to set them all aside he ll spend half his time asking me out and as for abusing powers just watch potter slytherin will have lost about two hundred points by the end of next week you wait and see and i have to spend two hours locked in a classroom with him what can we possibly much as emma liked her friend she was rather grateful when professor dumbledore rose to welcome everyone cutting lily off in the middle of her tirade amp amp amp all too soon in lily opinion monday evening arrived and by 6 o clock she was in a mixed mood her classes had been fairly good excepting transfiguration which she was beginning to worry about on the other hand the thought of spending two hours in a room with james potter trying to be polite was not a happy one and as the minutes ticked by she began to dread the idea at ten to seven lily put her books away she would have much preferred to stay in the library with emma and do some reading but she had no wish to get in professor mcgonagall bad books on day one emma looked up in surprise as she got to her feet surely you canthave finished all your homework this quickly lily nodded and picked up her bag put it this way em at least if i feel the need to throw something at potter after the meeting i can do it without worrying that i have to finish a potions essay as well she smiled sardonically and walked off good luck emma called after her earning herself a reproving glare from madam pince the librarian with a sinking feeling lily reached the transfiguration classroom and pushed the door open professor mcgonagall was already waiting for her and james was lounging on one of the chairs good evening miss evans take a seat lily sat down on the chair next to james and dropped her bag on the floor you re actually here on time potter she muttered oh i usually am just not for lessons james replied shooting her a grin that melted most girls hearts lily remained untouched well now that you are both here i suppose i can begin i know that the two of you do not always see eye to eye mcgonagall eyed them both beadily and the two seventh years shifted uncomfortably however the headmaster and myself hope that as you seem to exhibit very worthy qualities in your own rights you will be able to combine them and put them to good use your responsibilities as head boy and girl are to set an example to the other students you should at least try to keep up good grades and stay out of childish fights here james grinned guiltily unlike prefects you do not need authority to give out detentions and you may take away points providing that there are reasonable circumstances again mcgonagall gave james a look and continued you may have to deal with planning various school events and other things for the student body and although you must make the plans the prefects are on hand to help you execute them professor mcgonagall looked down at a piece of parchment now your first task i have no doubt that both of you are aware of the problems growing outside the school walls both political and social the headmaster has decided that to raise the students morale two school events can be organised they should be different and involve the students in something enjoyable have you any ideas for a few moments there was silence how about a fancy dress competition for the whole school james suggested we could hold it at halloween instead of the feast and have judges and things we could even get some other entertainment as well lily considered the idea that might work she said thoughtfully we could choose finalists and then have a proper ball at christmas where the winner could be announced that would be an excellent proposal professor mcgonagall said approvingly i shall pass it on to professor dumbledore do be aware that whatever you choose to do it should be cost effective i ll leave you to discuss your options now she stood up and gathered her books you know i do believe dumbledore was right when you two work together you do appear to compliment each other very well giving them the merest hint of a smile she swept out of the room the door swung shut behind her james and lily remained quiet neither wanting to be the first to speak eventually lily sighed well we re never going to get anywhere if we dontdo anything are we decided on the fancy dress contest and the ball to her surprise james nodded she hadntexpected him to be so mature about this ok she said briskly pulling out a piece of parchment and a quill she began scribbling something down james watched curiously it appeared to be a list she threw it across to him when she had finished halloween contest he read things to consider name place food music drinks decorations time space order of events arrangements pre contest and post contest clearance judges commentator he put the list down it going to be a lot of work honestly lily why d you have to be so organised it looks even worse this way for some reason his remark stung well maybe i just like being prepared lily said her teeth gritted or maybe you dontlike surprises james shot back at her just admit it lily you like to be in control of everything like you don t lily argued her volume growing to match his i don t blotches of red appeared on james cheeks and his hazel eyes were darkening i prefer to live life one day at a time and enjoy it you think that if you haventplanned something in advance it going to be awful oh and all of this comes from mr i ve never planned anything in my life least of all a prank by this time both of them were on their feet lily mentally psyching herself up for any insults coming her way and so she was startled when james turned abruptly away from her when he turned around again his cheeks were back to normal and his eyes had returned to their usual colour although he was evidently still struggling to keep control of himself this is exactly what we werent supposed to do he said his voice at its original level lily looked him in the eye for a moment and seeing that he was sincere made an effort to calm herself down too i guess we did turn into monsters james supplied yeah she looked around maybe we should leave it here for today in case we do something else well stupid james grinned ok we have the uh the basics sorted out sheepishly he handed the now crumpled list back to lily lily pushed it into her bag see you here next week potter james paused his hand on the doorknob james he said huh my name is james i know that lily said feeling confused well maybe you should use it then he smiled at her and disappeared amp later on emma gasped as lily told her what had happened lily what lily threw a pillow at her for heavens sake lils are you completely blind you re telling me that james potter actually did the adult thing for once and backed out of a fight with you and he didnteven ask you out afterwards tell me that not weird lily considered it now that she thought about it emma was right james had changed amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp a n so there you go basically the same just a few minor alterations where i ve noticed a grammatical mistake feel free to leave a review anything will do the next chapter will be coming very soon the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you chapter 30 hitting the rocks everything had quite literally in a metaphorical sense hit the rocks hit the rocks gone down the drain out of the window into the fire down the toilet whichever way you cared to put it things had gone very wrong between lily and james since that fateful night their friendship or at least the general goodwill between them was something that lily had come to count on aside from the polyjuice incident and the minor drama at the funeral it had been a constant that lily had relied on for at least part of her good mood since james had deflated his head a little he had shown the other sides of himself that had been downplayed before by his egotism and it was this that had brought them closer both with similar understandings and characters they fitted well but yet were still always able to challenge each other it was odd really how much james seemed to know about her most of which she couldntremember telling him now over the last day or so suddenly it was like they were back to the way it had been for the first three years she couldntremember being this exasperated with him in weeks and yet now she only had to see his messy black hair to feel curls of infuriated annoyance begin to unwind in the pit of her stomach somehow the way they had parted that night had put them both straight onto the wrong foot when lily opened her eyes again she looked around in the morning light and discovered that she had slept in the common room all night sitting on the sofa in her clothes arms still folded across her chest she checked her watch realising that most people were probably at breakfast and then started as a small piece of paper fluttered onto her lap it must have been tucked into the fold of her arms opening it she read it over and clucked her tongue in exasperation lily i told you to go to bed james lily rolled her eyes typical overbearing james she looked over it again and for some reason this seemed only to increase her irritation of spirits the remembrance that he had left her there all night in the common room did not help gee thanks for your kindness james she thought ironically as she made her way down to the great hall she swept her messy hair off her face and then caught sight of a black haired head halfway down her friends were sitting further on but the sight of his hair which her own now nearly resembled made her come to an abrupt though silent decision she walked down the length of the table head high and as she passed raised an arm and cuffed him round the head he turned immediately oh it you yes it me lily said sharply running a hand through her hair again i sorry did i hurt you there james raised an eyebrow had a good night sleep he questioned in a tone unmistakably sarcastic well you wouldntknow would you lily snapped not after leaving me there so kindly all night i was so amazed at your generosity i forgot to thank you hey james held up his hands as if in defence i told you to go to bed yeah lily snorted thanks for the fabulous little note you left too she pulled it out of her pocket and crumpled it in her fist before tossing it into james lap that what i think of that she eyed him god you think you re so wonderful as if i going to outleap a frog when you tell me to jump just because you re the great james potter i dontdo everything you tell me to the minor fact that this statement did not really apply any more had escaped lily she was incensed at james once again and all her old first to sixth year arguments against him were coming back into play valid or not it was for your own good james said heatedly i suddenly lily realised she was beginning to attract the attention of other students along the table smiling sweetly she grabbed james arm not sparing a glance for anyone else and hauled him outside how do you even know what good for me she hissed it seems like everything you ve done in the last eight hours at least has been bad for me james face was set you think you know everything about other people lily when you don t just go back to your friends and leave me there you go again lily cried ordering me around you re so overbearing i may have many faults but being overbearing is not one of them james shot back besides at least i admit to my faults i admit to faults just fine oh yeah james challenged come on then name me one right now lily glared at him my biggest fault was to give in and think that you were worth the time of day she spat before stalking off and things had simply deteriorated from there it didnthelp of course that sirius and sapphire were avoiding each other like the plague the little talk that they were supposed to have had clearly never been high on their list of priorities as neither had ever got around to it instead they could barely stand to be in the same room apart from classes and even then they couldntbe still unless at opposite ends of the room the glares were replaced with furtive looks if at all which were just as unproductive and even more irritating for the others remus and emma being the only two people who could be in the same room together and communicate without instigating fights had tried hard to schedule several accidental meetings between the two all of which had been unsuccessful even in just getting them within ten metres of each other altogether emma could not even remember the number of times she had tried all the persuasive skills in her power persuasion come on saffy please just talk to him and get it over bribery if you would just sort things out with him i swear i ll buy you a ton of chocolate next hogsmeade trip blackmail ok that it you donttalk to that boy and i ll write to your parents and tell them every last sordid detail of this all of which were met with no good response from the sound of it remus was going through exactly the same thing with sirius really it was like talking to a brick wall actually it was worse than talking to a brick wall at least a brick wall would have stayed in one place and listened politely it would not throw up non existent hands and disappear all right class you know what you re doing simply put the theory into practice and let us see some sparks professor flitwick sat down with a dismal sigh and waited for the havoc to begin right lily said shortly turning to face james do you want to go first or should i you james looked half asleep lounging in his chair lily pulled out her wand and focused on the charm they were working on today a tricky spell to make a feather float in mid air and then write in sparkly writing a word or phrase start small she reminded herself asperito scribus hello she said flourishing her wand the feather rose and hovered before writing in a cursive sparkly green font olleh irked she tried again with the same result that not right james said lazily it more of a flick at the end and it not scri bus it scri bus what would you know about it lily snapped her temper was still short from the arguments before only what flitwick told us james replied coolly but that enough would you stop acting like such a know it all lily bit out i know you think that you re some kind of transfiguration whiz but give me credit charms is my subject i dontneed tutoring in that too i not tutoring i helping but fine suit yourself muttering under her breath lily grudgingly did as he had told her and as expected the quill rose up and inscribed the word hello in the air she could imagine the insufferably smug look on james face but it wasntthere as she turned briefly thanks she said brusquely james shrugged no problem he yawned it doesntmean you can help me at every twist and turn you know i can do it for myself i never said you couldn t god lily why re you biting my head off so much i not doing anything then why have you started so many arguments with me today i have not been starting arguments when did i lily broke off as james yawned again oh for god sake will you stop doing that i dontknow where you partied all night but it your own fault if you canteven stay awake the next day i was not partying james said sharply oh dontlie lily scoffed i not that much of a fool what d you do then rescue sirius from some blonde bimbo and get distracted by the size of her best friend chest will you stop putting words in my mouth james said hotly i wasntdoing anything of the sort if your best friend was knocking back firewhiskey in the hog head at one in the morning wouldntyou he stopped clamping his mouth shut as he realised what he had just said but the damage was done lily eyes had widened what she whispered furiously good god you went to a pub at one in the morning what were you thinking were you even thinking at all what possessed you or sirius to go there you could have been expelled if anyone found out and you re head boy as well why must you insist on picking the stupidest choice i didnt have a choice lily james interrupted his face hard where my friends are concerned there is no choice they come first every time if i didntgo what would you suggest sirius do when he was drunk and alone what lily repeated dumbly she looked horrified he shouldnthave been there in the first place and it all great to say this until you end up at home after getting checked out of hogwarts before you even take your newts enough james said angrily let just just leave it lily and for the remainder of the lesson the two of them practiced the spell in complete cold silence as they left the classroom lily steeling herself one final time tapped james on the shoulder and he turned his face slipping into a here we go again look as he saw her what meeting tonight at seven remember lily watched as james looked at her then at sirius and back uh he said finally i might not be able to make it what lily demanded why not james looking anywhere but at her sighed in exasperation before muttering something in which only the word broomstick was discernible for lily though it was the only word she needed to hear let me guess she said scornfully you and your friends are going to go flying and leave me to sit and deal with the posters all by myself i suppose i shouldnthave expected anything better james narrowed his eyes waving one hand at remus and sirius who were both waiting patiently outside to indicate that they should go excuse me if i spend a lot of my time trying to get my best friend out of his mood he said in a low controlled tone i was under the impression that that was what best friends did for each other how stupid i must be sensing an argument another argument emma darted in come on lily she said firmly grasping her friend arm you just make sure you re there lily called as she was pulled away all in all lily thought as she collapsed into bed that night the last two hours she had spent with james could have been worse they had been working on the posters that were to go up soon to advertise the winter ball and had managed to do fairly well as if echoing her thoughts emma voice sounded from the next bed how was it okay lily said injecting a false confidence into her voice we didntfight once through the darkness she could see the faint outline of emma form which had now sat up really she asked disbelievingly really lily confirmed that must be some kind of miracle emma murmured as she lay back down a minute later she sat bolt upright again wait what am i saying there no such thing as a miracle where you two are concerned you ve been going at it all day her tone was suspicious you re not telling me something how did you manage not to argue well it might have something to do with the fact that we didnttalk at all lily admitted what and we were at opposite ends of the room she added guiltily there was a moment silence then emma sighed i knew it she said lily pulled the covers up to her chin i dontget it em she said miserably why are we suddenly at each other throats i cantunderstand it now and yet the minute i see him it like someone else takes over she could almost hear emma roll her eyes you two are hopeless she mumbled nothing more was said between the girls and soon lily listening to the deep even breaths of emma fell asleep herself the next morning the posters were up and lily marvelled at the effect a few simple words could have by afternoon the castle seemed to be full of giggling girls and boys who looked even more awkward than usual at the prospect of having to ask the opposite sex to be dates the expectant atmosphere did not do anything to improve lily sour mood she was doing everything in her power to avoid james or ignore him if they were in each other vicinity her frazzled nerves could not take much more of the tense state of mind she was in always on edge in case he came near so far she had managed to keep it up for well it was lunchtime only another twelve hours or so for the day she thought picking at her sandwich emma had disappeared with remus and sapphire well considering the fact that sirius was sitting at the other end of the table sapphire absence was automatically explained sighing lily looked at her watch realised there was still almost an hour to go before the end of lunch and decided that she was better off wasting her time in the library than in here accordingly she got up and made her way out of the hall lost in her thoughts mostly about sleep and why she seemed to lack it lily found herself automatically following the well trodden path to the library ooof a loud clatter sounded and lily looked up to see whose chest she had walked into of course who else would it be but her least favourite person at this point in time james watch where you re going would you he growled as he bent to pick up his bag and a stack of books which were apparently the source of the clatter and as much as lily tried to fight it tried to slap herself out if it and shut up in the end she could not stop the words that spilled out of her mouth well i sorry but clearly you werent watching where you were going or you d have avoided me james snorted typical lily he said disparagingly as he attempted to cram books into his arms you have some serious issues as usual my issue is you lily retorted why do you keep arguing with me what wrong with you what wrong with me james asked incredulously with me lily the problem here is you no it isn t you james are the one who has the problem with timekeeping oh for heaven sake james threw up his hands i was five minutes late yesterday at least i showed up yeah because we all know you d rather be ditching the work as usual i didnt do anything like that and you know perfectly well i ve been pulling my weight well that a miracle you still slither out of responsibility whenever you can no i bloody well don t james said angrily really you wriggle out so well it a wonder you arentin slytherin she knew she had gone too far when she saw the look in james eyes his face hardened as he straightened slowly up to his full height his fists clenched around his books and for a moment lily thought he was actually going to hit her little miss lily evans he said coldly head girl of hogwarts always studying always keeping her grades top notch so she can be a goody two shoes you know what your problem is you re too uptight you ve got a stick up your arse and until you get it out you re never going to be a normal person lily gaped at him what james carried on his voice harsh and relentless you think that because you get perfect grades and always follow the rules that it somehow makes you a perfect person better than the rest of us like you re up on a pedestal or something and that gives you the right to correct everyone else well guess what it doesnt by now lily was glaring straight back at him indeed it was hard to say who was glowering more the force of either would have ignited a wet branch well i not the one who swaggers around thinking i clever just because i can slip out of detentions and classes alike and still get good marks unlike you i actually work for them she laughed nastily of course working for something isntexactly anything you would grasp the concept of is it her voice was rising steadily god lily just get over yourself for once james spat i not the one that needs to do that she shot back trying to understand you is just you giving me a headache oh dontworry the feeling entirely mutual james said coldly his eyes glimmered threateningly behind his glasses i suggest you lose the attitude problem fast lily could have screamed in frustration you are completely crazy you re the one who got this thing of insulting me whenever you see me maybe james said in a dangerous tone we should just stay out of each other way without another word he strode off lily for her part remained angry with him for about as long as it took her to reach the library in other words about five minutes then as her frustration peaked self doubt began to leak in was she really right to have insulted him like that yes of course she was she reminded herself sternly he had come back her with exactly the same things she put her head in her hands and for a few minutes let the tears come out in pure weakness from the shock do i really behave like that she wondered i dontcontinually correct people too much my friends can put up with me cantthey as much as she tried to block it james unforgiving words were coming back to her and haunting her more than she cared to admit goody two shoes too uptight better than the rest of us never be a normal person consequently all the way through her afternoon classes she was in a downright miserable mood although she was not sure if it was because she was upset over what james had said to her or guilt ridden over what she had said to him chin in hand she dully took note after note keeping her head down unwilling to show how much he had got to her she avoided looking at him so had no idea how he was feeling after the outburst but instead debated over what in heaven name she was supposed to do next her friends sensing her depression either left her alone or tried to lighten the mood with jovial chatter with which she would normally have joined in if it werentfor the leaden feeling in her stomach she hadnttold them what had happened though she guessed that emma had worked some part of it out with her usual intuitiveness at long long last dinner was over and lily was planning to walk back to the tower finish homework in her dorm and go to bed early she wondered vaguely where tom was she hadntreally seen him for a day or two now all of a sudden a hand gripped her arm and as she swung round she saw james typically messy hair he muttered a short phrase roughly into her ear before turning and walking off in the opposite direction heads room eight o clock what did he want now a n heh another cliffie i evil arenti and before you start complaining yes i know all the arguments they had against each other are mostly from the years when james thought lily was a stick in the mud and lily thought james was a slacker but there is a reason they need to attack each other and the easiest arguments are the ones they ve been using for six years so they re getting dredged up again anyway thank you all so much for your reviews and again apologies for my slow updates life is extremely busy so this tends to kind of fall to the wayside i have to say a big thanks to all of you who reviewed emailed promised to hunt me down if i didntget a move on because you reminded me

or so and in the meantime reviews are still always appreciated d they re so useful for motivation d the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become

characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you a n thanks to all of you who reviewed because you all rock my socks enormously chapter 31 awkwardly unexpected moments for the next hour or so lily debated over whether or not she would actually go to the heads room at the time james had specified part well most of her was worrying that it was some kind of horrible joke some form of retaliation as a follow up to what had gone on before she felt positively ill at the thought of going if she was only going to get into another fight and yet she couldntbe easy unless she did go her mind tossed backward and forward one moment she was resolved to go the next determined not to and then she was enraged against herself for being so ridiculous she couldntask anyone for a second opinion emma had gone somewhere again and though sapphire was nearby she was so distracted in her own thoughts that lily very much doubted that she would get the reply she wanted eight o clock came and went and it was close to a quarter past when lily actually realised what time it was siding with instinct she made a split second decision and left the common room when she climbed in she thought at first that james wasntin the heads room it looked empty enough it was a dim light the roaring fire giving the room a red glow none of the lamps were on leaving most of the space in flickering shadow you re late james tall form unfolded from the floor he must have been sitting beside the couch where she could not have seen him lily bit her tongue but as usual her automated james hate system kicked in well that makes us even she said sharply you were late yesterday i was late today james looked away and when he faced her again his gaze was free from anger i m sorry i just didntthink you would come neither did i she replied there was a moment pause during which lily wondered why on earth james was calling her here just so he could stare at the floor what did you want she asked finally i want james hesitated then took a step forward squaring up to her well it just this is ridiculous we re seventeen we re heads of the school but we re jumping down each other throats like we re eleven again i just thought we could you know clear the air he took another step forward as if to prove his point so here goes he took a deep breath i sorry for what i said before at lunch i just got a bit annoyed and i sort of exaggerated the facts it was it was unreasonable of me to say those things and and i hope you ll forgive me he ended in a rush lily half smiled in spite of herself at his tentative look okay i sorry if i provoked you and for my part in our arguments james shoved his hands in his pockets so truce truce lily agreed clasping her own hands she felt uncomfortably warm as he watched her and swallowed the half light coming from the fire lit only one side of his tall figure and she found herself thinking of things that she knew she really shouldnthave been thinking of james let out a breath well at least it over he said quietly it horrible fighting with you you know that same lily returned it like i cantbe in a good mood if i busy glaring at you you james laughed and lily cursed herself for thinking that it was a nice sound to hear after all the hours of harsh tones clearly you missed all my dirty looks well i thought you liked annoying me you did it so naturally over the last six years lily smiled as he raised his eyebrows and then grinned it was fun to see you get worked up he said his glasses glinting with silent laughter that look faded as he took another step forward and his voice lowered his eyes were overpowering her now and she was unable to move or speak her cheeks burned and she could only focus on his neck and how smooth it looked you were so passionate when you yelled you were beautiful his voice was almost a whisper you still are somehow the gap between them had closed entirely and james leaned down the next moment his lips were unexpectedly on hers and he was he was kissing her for a moment she felt completely powerless in his warm arms as if someone had simultaneously allowed the bottom of her stomach to drop out and taken her breath straight out of her lungs it was the airy light headed feeling she associated with that of being drunk and yet at the same time an overwhelming sense of peace and security enveloped her like a blanket this is how it meant to be a tiny deep buried part of her whispered this is how it should be then almost instinctively her body began to respond starting with an entire guy fawkes day meets fourth of july explosion of fireworks somewhere in her abdomen part of her seemed to drift up and leave the rest of her a part that watched cynically as one hand trailed round his back and reached into his hair to press him closer as she relaxed into his chest this is how it should be the cynical voice said silently but is this how it is going to be his heart was beating erratically she could feel it through their clothes and tingles of shock ran through her veins as his hand dropped to rest lightly on her waist and the other held her arm in a comfortably tight grip that was all she remembered as she melted against him his lips were so warm and sugary being this near to him was intoxicating the musky undeniably james like smell of his cologne was pervading her consciousness and all her thoughts the last time she d been close enough to do this had been when he had lost his temper so ferociously after discovering the polyjuice incident but this was infinitely nicer her fingers threaded through his hair soft and silky and she let out a small sound as his lips caressed hers james was such a good wait a minute james her eyes flew open and she wrenched herself out of his arms he took a step backwards too and she could see that the realisation had just hit him as well an identical flush rose up on both their cheeks as they stared at each other wide eyed oh god lily thought her heart pounding like there was no tomorrow i just kissed james potter there was only one option in times like this run and so she did hastily she backed off and muttered a quick bye before climbing out and walking half running as fast as she could towards the safety of her own bed next morning lily was the first to get up she brushed her teeth and got dressed and then while she waited for her friends to get up decided to tidy her clothes and bed up humming cheerfully she sorted through everything until she found her robes from the day before as she unpinned the head badge the cool silver brought a rush from her memory head badge head boy head room kissing she let out an involuntary gasp and her cheeks burned as she sat down weakly what wrong came the sleepy voice of emma lily swallowed uh nothing she called back i just uhm pricked myself on my badge there was a clatter of curtain rings as emma pulled her hangings back fully and blinked at lily so why are your cheeks practically on fire she demanded lily feigned innocence they are she put her hands to her cheeks oh shrugging it off emma swung her legs down and sat up rubbing her eyes whatever i may as well get dressed now that i awake she picked up a towel and then she called we are going down to breakfast where we will sit with remus sirius james and peter so that we can all discuss why you and james are incapable of having a civil conversation and why sirius and sapphire are incapable of having a conversation no lily blurted emma turned hand on the bathroom door excuse me she asked raising her eyebrows no it just lily fumbled for an excuse i dontthink we should should spend so much time with with the boys she ended lamely what time emma snorted we ve barely spent any time with them remus and i decided that for once we were going to sit it out and do what it called conflict resolution but it lily thought fast well think about it em we were totally happy on our own from first year to sixth this year i dontknow the marauders seem to play a big part with us and it suddenly made life a bit too dramatic i mean there was your entire saga with remus and all the sirius and sapphire arguments and the entire polyjuice thing it feels like we re in a story where about a million over dramatic things happen in one week maybe we should just stay away from them for a while you know just go back to normal emma regarded lily for a long moment lily i can understand what you re saying she said her voice unusually gentle but it wouldntwork lily opened her mouth but emma carried on think about it you and james are the heads of the school you d have to run into him at least once or twice a week probably even more now that the ball is so close i spend a lot of time with remus and sirius is like part of the james package which means that if sapphire is with us she going to collide with him once in a while we cantjust sever ties now because they re well they re forged in iron so to speak no way round it she smiled i think you should make the best of it at least your transfiguration grades are improving that little comfort lily muttered as the door closed behind emma a while later when it was a decent hour to go down to breakfast lily emma and sapphire headed to the great hall despite emma pleadings lily staunchly refused to sit with the boys and went off to sit on her own further down the table emma determined that at least one of the problems would be sorted out forcibly dragged sapphire into a place beside her and tried to make her look anywhere but at her plate feeling rather stupid on her own lily positively refused to look anywhere in james direction and took out a book she began to eat her way through a pile of toast reading about the history of cheering charms as she did so before long however her mind was drifting and while she stared at the page the majority of her brain began a spanish inquisition style interrogation into why she was feeling so uncomfortable because he kissed me she screamed at herself he my colleague he a friend friends dontkiss you ah said that little niggling voice at the back of her head the voice lily would dearly have loved to hit with a frying pan but that not the real reason is it if the voice had had a face it would have been wearing the unbearably smug smirk of a cat that got the cream you feel uncomfortable because you liked the kiss didntyou come on lily admit it to yourself you thought his lips were shut up lily said fiercely sorry lily turned flustered to see sapphire sitting down next to her looking bewildered beyond her james and remus were watching her questioningly though as lily turned her eyes on him james looked away with the faintest tinge of pink gracing his cheeks sorry she apologised i was just out of it she looked back at her friend i thought you were meant to be opening the channels of communication sapphire snorted yeah right it not like we even opened our mouths to each other then the owl post arrived and he got something i think it was some sort of list and after that he just looked moody and stared at his plate not that he wasntdoing that already ah well lily said she glanced at emma you know em is going to give you the mother of all lectures later on yeah but i can live with that sapphire said now pass me some toast it not healthy to keep all that to yourself lily do you mind if i ask you a question what lily asked still focused on achievements in charming through which she was trawling to find information she could use for a revision timeline emma cleared her throat where tom been lately looking up lily saw her friend bite her lip as she watched her earnestly i was wondering that myself she said furrowing her brow i haventreally seen him around it nothing really emma said almost hesitantly i was just thinking i mean usually he turns up to give you a hug or something once a day i thought i had just missed him or something no o lily replied he hasntbeen around she considered for a moment wow it must be bad if even you ve noticed it like i said it probably nothing emma repeated we re all really busy so maybe a pair of hands covered lily eyes guess who lily twisted around speak of the devil she said laughing emma grinned hi tom she said lily i ll catch up with you later see you lily said she turned to tom so where have you been lately oh around tom said lightly did you miss me maybe lily teased she wrinkled her nose ok so maybe i was just wondering where you were she admitted tom put his arms around her well i here now he said eyeing her books clearly i not going to drag you away from the world of homework tonight so anything you want help with he flexed his fingers i good at flicking through books lots of practice lily laughed in spite of herself not unless you want to help me burn them no matches tom said mock ruefully well if i canthelp you in that way let me at least help you relax he kissed her neck and lily smiled the portrait hole swung open and a tall dark haired boy walked into the room he looked around and his gaze settled on lily and tom for a moment he stared at her with an unreadable expression on his face and then he turned and walked to another chair and began to read tom feeling her tense looked up oh come on he said misunderstanding her surely your head business can wait for a little while y yeah lily said trying to smile again she looked back down at her work tom kissed her cheek softly and began to trail kisses across to her ear but lily moved her head away awkwardly don t tom what tom questioned he rubbed her arm and lily glanced up at the figure of james opposite still apparently intent on his book nothing she said tom hand drifted down to her waist and she sucked in a sharp breath the last person who had touched her there had been j what wrong lily tom inquired nuzzling at her neck he repeated his question while lily could do nothing by stare down occasionally lifting her eyes to james this is stupid part of her said angrily he only sideways on and he hasnteven looked round at you why are you so uptight tom voice was slightly colder when he next spoke ok i guess you re busy his voice softened can i at least kiss you before i go slowly he leaned towards her but just as he was about to reach her lips james turned a page and lily leapt back as if she had been burnt tom opened his eyes what going on he asked injuredly he looked at the group of chattering first years look i know you dontgo for public displays of affection but what lily who had been staring at the desk head down sent a fleeting glance in james direction unfortunately tom caught it oh he said in a slightly different tone of voice well he looked at lily downcast eyes i ll just uh leave you to your schoolwork without another word he left and lily let out a sigh as she watched him go a movement made her change her gaze to james who had looked up blushing she averted her eyes and went back to work what good would it do sirius was pissed indeed not in the alcoholic way that would have been a trade up he thought sourly as the cold breeze wafted across his face at least he would have been too fuddled to have to think instead he was out here sitting on a balcony in the cold raging at his own fate while the stars above glistened icy and crystal bright he had been fairly upbeat after the original shock of being disowned really okay so there had been a few pranks to let off steam maybe more than a few but nothing drastic hell he wasntabout to slit his wrists yet still the owl that had arrived this morning had been an unwelcome reminder of what he was trying to escape pushing cold fingers into his pocket sirius brought out the piece of parchment and stared blankly with unseeing eyes at the list written in his mother slanting script it was an inventory of everything he owned in the house apparently his mother had enlisted her house elf help to write down all that was in his room so that he would take only what he was given frankly sirius shuddered at the thought of that slimy little toerag more commonly known as kreacher pawing through his clothes and books he would probably have to bleach everything clean once he got them out consequently he had spent most of the day living up to his reputation as a blood traitor by silently cursing every member of the black family that he could think of the only people excepted had been andromeda his only normal cousin and uncle alphard out of respect fumbling in his pocket again he took out a small gold box and looked at it glinting in the moonlight he had found it in his trunk after dinner actually the plan had been to escape to hogsmeade but james probably suspecting something of the sort had hidden the invisibility cloak and in the end he couldntbe bothered to get drunk alone again instead he focused on the box before taking out a cigarette from inside and lighting it with a muggle lighter it wasnta habit of his to smoke in fact he couldnteven remember the last time he had opened the box when he had seen it today however it had seemed liked an opportunity for release and he had taken it with both hands placing the cigarette to his lips he drew on it and then let the smoke escape from his mouth slowly watching the faint tendrils as they slipped away and wishing that it was more than just smoke disappearing the grounds were quiet and castle lights were beginning to be extinguished as the minutes ticked by faint footsteps sounded now and again as teachers or prefects made their rounds but no one would think to look here it was his place alone slowly very slowly sirius felt himself drifting off in his own thoughts where the only reality was that of the crisp air gnawing at his face and the clear night sky above where the gigantic drop below was not a thing of fear but of interest and the little light in hagrid hut was the only sign that this world was inhabited by anyone else taking a drag of the cigarette again he stared out towards the mountains and rough wild country that surrounded him what are you doing the next few seconds were a blur there was a rush of hurried footsteps and the next thing sirius knew his cigarette was being torn out of his hands by a feminine figure who stubbed the glowing end out on the stone wall before flinging it off into the air sirius got to his feet scowling what the hell are you doing and who the hell are you the girl swung around pushing a curtain of brown hair off her face and as the moonlight fell on her shadowy face she came into focus sirius gaped heathleigh he said incredulously what the hell are you doing what the hell are you doing sapphire hissed she held out a hand give me the rest of them donttell me you only had one sirius was so surprised that he actually did hand his box over he regretted it a moment too late as sapphire hurled the box over the wall and into the darkness getting to his feet he stared at sapphire tense back what wrong with you what was all that for sapphire faced him again angling her face so that her expression was barely visible i hate smoking she said tightly and turned on her heel she was almost at the doorway when sirius replied huh sapphire looked back she let out a long breath do you know what happens when you smoke her expression was unreadable sirius had no idea what she was getting at here but he kept his voice neutral as he responded it not good for you your lungs and stuff but you do it anyway her voice was quiet sirius shrugged one off that how it starts just one cigarette so what sapphire took a step forward still in the shadows her voice sounded almost tired i dontknow why i even bothering with this black but maybe i should tell you something in muggle schools you learn about dangers of smoking very early i ve read books bronchitis cancer heart disease cardiac arrests smoker cough brain damage her tone was monotonous with a dull learned by heart quality muggle and magical diseases no magical cure i dontunderstand how do you know all this something in sapphire seemed to sag my dad smokes she muttered so what sirius honestly failed to see what she was trying to say so what sapphire laughed bitterly if i had a knut for every time someone said that i d be a rich woman by now she sighed it means that i have first hand experience of what it like what what like sirius glared at her stop being so overdramatic you just dontget it do you sapphire voice had risen my friends all said that i was being melodramatic you know what she almost spat the next words out you dontknow you dontknow what it like living with someone who smokes heavily you dontknow what it like watching someone you love burn their life away and you sure as hell dontknow what it like watching your family finances turn into ashes she took a deep breath your dad got the addiction no sapphire said bitterly he got the disease sirius wasntentirely sure what he was supposed to say sapphire face or what he could see of it was in a carefully controlled expression of forced calm her eyes overbright well it not the end of the world he tried he can always quit sapphire stared at him for several moments so intently that sirius felt uncomfortable i dontknow why i telling you this she said at last i ve done it before it never worked with anyone else you know why she laughed harshly and sirius blinked this was an embittered side of sapphire that he had never seen before and somehow he doubted that anyone had seen her like this including both her current and former friends sapphire carried on her voice as bitingly cold as the night air around them you cantunderstand you never will unless you re in the situation she paused i didnteither i grew up and cigarettes were just these things that my dad had a lot of i knew they were bad for you really bad but i didntunderstand the whole truth blinking she brushed at her eyes you cantunderstand until your mother gets so desperate and worried that she turns to you to talk to because there no one else and suddenly the world isnta cosy cocoon any more you just have to watch powerless while one parent smokes their life away and the other worries their life away sirius watched as she walked to the balcony wall and leaned on it looking at the grounds below sometimes i wonder if it ll be my mum not my dad who ll go down first from the stress of it all she almost whispered raising his eyes sirius looked at her taut back silhouetted against the hills and mountains he had no idea why sapphire was telling him her history something told him that this wasntabout who she was saying it to but the fact that she was saying it it didntsound as though she had ever let this out before well i sorry he said quietly if he had been anyone else he might have hugged her but in his situation that was practically taboo and he would probably come out of it with a black eye and bruised ribs sapphire sniffed and when she turned round he could see that she had been crying i wouldnteven let my worst enemy go down to cigarettes she said just don t there are other ways to escape your life sirius stared how had she he opened his mouth sapph but she was gone he looked at the door as it swung shut and then back out at the stars when he had come here tonight he had wished that he had had something to think about to take his mind off himself now that his wish was fulfilled he wasntentirely sure it was a good thing meanwhile for lily concentrating on her work was horribly hard distracted as she was by a certain head boy who was paying absolutely no attention to her the owner of a pair of high heels who was coming down the stairs was about to make it even harder hello james a sultry voice purred when lily looked up she felt physically ill serena parkinson was sitting straddled on james lap

characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you a n thanks to all of you who reviewed because you all rock my socks enormously recap hello james a sultry voice purred when lily looked up she felt physically ill serena parkinson was sitting straddled on james lap trailing a solitary seductive finger down his cheek chapter 32 repairing the cracks serena disregarding the fact that she was still in the common room lifted the book out of james hands he shifted around as she made a show of leaning forward to place it on the side giving him a perfect crystal clear view of what lay down her top james she mused james james james she wriggled on his lap and lily saw james flush bright red clearly her movement was giving him an adverse reaction which he didntwant go away serena he said with less force than usual but james serena said in a husky voice she traced a finger around his neck and james broke into a visible sweat look at you you need to loosen up a bit she undid the top buttons of his shirt and lily realised that he had not undone them himself even though the top few were usually flung open after school hours now serena was undoing his tie and loosening that too i could help you you know she said fingers drifting over his neck before lightly brushing at his lips james swallowed hard serena he started in strained tones his voice gravelly but he got no further serena apparently tired of toying with him dragged his head towards hers and engulfed him in a searingly passionate kiss lily honestly felt like retching unable to tear her gaze away as she saw serena part her lips and deepen the kiss for a few horrible moments she thought james was going to encourage her but eventually he pushed her blindly away from him unfortunately the place in which his hands landed were probably the best place serena could have wanted them james pulled his hands away quickly serena stop it he said breathing heavily really you want me to she smiled wickedly rocking her hips so that james wriggled even more in discomfort something down here tells me you don t she placed her hand down below and whatever she did was enough to make james jolt out of his chair as if he had received an electric shock lily had had enough getting up she drew herself up to her full height and marched over excuse me she said coldly but can you take your little displays of affection away from the public eye serena smile turned snide of course we dontwant to upset those who arentas lucky as us james james who was still sweating heavily and wearing a somewhat dazed expression snapped his head up almost at once an expression of distaste crossed his face as he looked at serena and he stood up abruptly dislodging her sorry parkinson but i not your little lapdog he said brusquely he looked at lily but could not seem to find anything to say to her instead cheeks colouring again he walked out of the common room without waiting for more of serena poison lily turned on her heel and headed upstairs with the cry of hypocrite ringing in her ears the voice shouting it her own aargh this cry of outrage came from emma who was kneeling on her bed and glaring with all the force of a laser beam you she said pointing a finger at sapphire and you the finger swivelled round to lily you two are driving me round the bend both sapphire and lily had the grace to look ashamed emma face when she had come out of the bathroom to find not one but two of her best friends hiding out in the dormitory had been priceless she had said nothing until she was changed and ready for bed but now the tirade had let loose right emma barked let get things straight the finger moved back to sapphire you she said have a problem with sirius black you are incapable of having any kind of conversation with him to sort out your differences and i still dontunderstand why sapphire looked sheepish and you she turned to lily you are not telling us something i dontknow what happened in the heads room last night or how bad your fight was but whatever it is it was clearly a big deal you ve been jumpy all day whenever james comes near you you re avoiding him and what puzzling me most of all is that he seems to be avoiding you too then i leave you with tom hoping that he ll snap you out of it and fifteen minutes later i find that you ve hared it back up here again you re not telling me something feel like sharing lily arranged her face in a carefully blank expression but emma shook her head donttry that on me i ve known you for seven years i could practically write a book on your expressions in a neutral tone lily replied it nothing just an unexpected thing argument fight thing she walked over to sapphire besides isntthis who we should be worrying about this poor misguided soul who has conversational issues with lover boy eurgh sapphire stumbled backwards so fast she fell onto her bed how can you even say that without throwing up lily raised her eyebrows quite easily i want nothing to do with sirius black understood sapphire demanded funny emma said in a conversational tone when you mentioned sirius name there you did something i ve never seen you do before it was almost as if you were acting as though he was a human being she shrugged as though she were merely commenting on an everyday topic like the weather it a good thing really i was beginning to get quite worried you were under some odd spell that made you see some sort of three headed monster when you looked at him good to know you re normal aargh sapphire blocked her ears for a moment and then realising that no one was speaking because they were too busy laughing removed her hands i going to the bathroom she announced and then i going to bed to dream of sirius black lily whispered mischievously as the door clicked shut behind sapphire emma burst out laughing if only that were even remotely likely she sighed wiping her eyes pass the jam emma said lily gave no response i said pass the jam emma repeated raising her voice when lily still did not look up emma sighed lily she said loudly james is heading in your direction what lily head snapped up i asked you to please pass the jam emma said innocently sapphire stifled a laugh by taking an extra large gulp of pumpkin juice and promptly choked on it lily frowned down at the roll of parchment covered with messy lists of numbers which lay in front of her taking the place of an uneaten bowl of cereal which lay to a side it no good she muttered throwing her quill down in frustration and running her hands through her hair what isn t emma inquired patting sapphire on the back these accounts lily said gesturing at the figures which were interspersed with ink blots i hopeless at them i cantdo numbers she stared at the parchment hard as if hoping the numbers would resolve themselves emma she said finally in a wheedling tone of voice could you give these to james and tell him i said to finish them whenever you next see him nuh uh emma protested i not aiding you in avoiding him sapphire lily asked hopefully sapphire though still apparently unable to talk was able to manage a coherent head shake while massaging her throat fine lily grumbled rolling the accounts up and putting them into her bag i ll ask remus to give them to him some friends you are she pushed in her quills haphazardly i ll go give them now she said grumpily i am not carrying them around all day swinging her bag onto her shoulders she set off she was so busy cursing her luck as she walked down the corridor thinking how ironic it was that the one person who could help her was the one person she was going to any lengths to avoid that she did what she had done so many times before oomph she tumbled to the ground landing painfully on her bag and heard the soft crunch as parchment crumpled beneath her weight getting up hastily she dusted herself off before looking up to see who she had walked into typical she thought sourly my life is so over clich d james mumbled something as he bent down and began to pile up books what lily asked quickly bending down too and making a pile herself i said i sorry james muttered head down oh lily stood up and then realised as she looked at the top book that they were all james nevertheless she waited until he had straightened up before trading being careful not to let her hands touch his sorry i wasntwatching where i was going she said quietly busying herself with her bag james opened his mouth but then closed it again as footsteps sounded and a giggling ravenclaw fifth year walked by hand in hand with a hufflepuff sixth year there was a moment of silence where neither could quite bring themselves to look at the other finally james exhaled and looked in the direction that the couple had gone why is it that when everyone around is getting together we canteven be civil to each other he asked quietly lily found it a safer bet to look at the floor and shrug rather than have to meet his eyes which were burning into her or so she thought james was silent for a minute before shifting his weight awkwardly look about the other night he said hesitantly i know you probably hate me i don t lily interrupted quickly or are at least angry with me i not and have every intention of slapping me no but for what it worth i sorry i kind of came onto you like that i mean i don t i dontlike you as anything more than a friend and i dontknow where that came from it was probably just me transferring my frustrations i swear it wont happen again and even though you have every right to be as mad as you are james lily interjected gently i not upset with you james slowly met her eyes so why have you avoided me all week lily flushed i was embarrassed she said uncomfortably it it wasntsomething i was expecting obviously she cleared her throat besides i not the only one why were you avoiding me james flushed i was embarrassed too he confessed and and i thought you were angry with me for for he didntseem quite capable of finishing his sentence i wasn t i thought you were well i dontknow james exhaled again look what matters is that we re here now he took a deep breath i just want to say that i donthave any ulterior motive and i dont want to ruin what we ve managed so friends again he offered his hand lily tilted her head before shaking hands with him almost reluctantly friends a rush of warmth spread through her as they clasped hands awkwardly and she tried to ignore how warm and rough yet gentle his hand was when she looked back she would put it down to happiness that problems were sorted out well well bye i guess lily said uncomfortably i ll see you around her own voice echoed in her head i hug my friends when i say goodbye there was no way she was adhering to that protocol now yeah yeah james said they both turned and began to walk away from each other but several metres from him she stopped and turned around to stare at his retreating back as if sensing her he turned too what he asked n nothing lily said hurriedly well bye bye she turned and carried on walking but for some reason just as she was about to reach the corner she stopped and turned again james was still standing in the same spot one hand holding his books the other in his pocket wearing an odd expression on his face what she asked nothing he said vaguely ok see you around still feeling oddly as though their conversation was unfinished she headed round to corner and up the staircase it was when the bell went just as she reached the tower than she realised why she had left the great hall in the first place damn my stupid mind she thought annoyed when she did catch up with james again it was almost the end of lunch she thrust the accounts into his hand hoping that he would simply put it into his bag but to her dismay he unrolled it then and there for a moment he stared at it and then frowning slightly he turned it upside down as if rotating it would make the scribbles any more legible lily he said at last looking up at her is this were you drunk when you did this no lily said indignantly i had full control over my mental faculties really james studied the parchment again because this looks like you have the mental faculties of a five year old he screwed up his eyes in an effort to make sense of the mess of ink ok you know what lily pulled the accounts out of his hand and ripped them up into tiny pieces lily what all this is crap you ll be better off without it no it just there was a sheet of real accounts under that mine lily looked down at the fragments in her hand sure enough small lines of james handwriting were dotted around her own scribbles whoops sorry she apologised frantically trying to piece the shreds back together really i am can you james looked solemn for a moment but then his face turned into one big grin i was just messing with you that was a sheet of rough notes you idiot lily exclaimed cuffing him on the arm you really had me worried she began to laugh as they walked into the classroom and there i was wondering how the hell i was supposed to redo them for you james shuddered elaborately please you ll give me nightmares his expression made lily laugh even harder and she looked around for her friends her eyes landing on tom as she did so he saw her looking and gave her a brief smile yet somehow his eyes still wore a bitter expression as they looked at james and now all too soon the end of the school term was first in sight and then upon the the school population did not diminish in size as barely anyone wanted to go home when the prospect of the winter ball lay ahead indeed it seemed to double the entire castle was now filled with students doing precisely what they liked when they liked lily and james had decided that in order to compensate for keeping students at school in christmas day the hogwarts express would leave in the late morning on boxing day to take back the students so they could at least spend half of the holiday with their family a hogsmeade trip had also been organised for the coming weekend with the winter ball little more than a week away many girls were itching to go into the village and finalise their outfits sapphire was working hard on her costume for the finals of the fancy dress competition and lily and emma helped with suggestions wherever they could it was after one such session of costume planning that lily was sitting curled up in a chair by the fire with her friends relishing the fact that she had no work to do the common room was full and noisy and at least ten games of exploding snap and wizarding chess were going on at once life could be so peaceful lily thought dreamily as she watched the portrait hole swing open she was nowhere near prepared for the entrant a familiar black haired figure stepped into the room and lily gasped as she saw the person face properly oh my god a n finally free of school for life so expect more regular updates when i not out enjoying holidays to the fullest d and just as a quick response no my updates donttake forever because i wait for reviews they take long because i have a life outside fanfiction and i had life deciding exams to deal with anyway how about a review to pass the time the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i

you all rock my socks enormously chapter 33 christmas shopping what on earth are you doing here lily sprang off the sofa and hurried over to the newcomer why are you how d you get in lily emma and sapphire had come up behind her what going on em saffy meet madeleine a k a maddie she james little sister on seeing their blank expressions lily hastily elaborated she doesntlive here she goes to a muggle school and gets private coaching in magic long story maddie this is emma and sapphire my friends maddie flashed a brilliant grin at them and shook hands hi what are you doing here lily exclaimed again looking maddie up and down giving my big brother a heart attack maddie grinned no actually since james is staying at school over christmas and there some sort of party thing coming up professor dumbledore wrote to say it would be nice if i could stay until boxing day to socialise with others my own age so here i am lily looked around briefly and then turned to maddie her eyes glinting with unusual mischief i take it james doesntknow you re here maddie smirked back oh jamesie poo has no idea there is no escape from the dreaded little sister the two exchanged a look of mutual understanding anyway lily said covering her grin with a more casual expression do you want me to introduce you to the other fifth years oh no it okay maddie said jauntily although lily thought this might have been more an air than a real tone i can make my own way she turned round and headed towards a group of fifth years all of whom were staring openly at this newcomer and her apparent familiarity with the head girl a few minutes after introducing herself she was lounged in a chair discussing celestina warbeck lily smiled and returned to her own corner with her friends ten minutes later james himself climbed through the portrait hole looking distracted and headed directly for the boys dormitory lily saw him and felt an uncharacteristic smirk tug at her lips now was her chance to repay a little of the debt she owed him james she called she flashed a glance over her shoulder at her friends warning them to keep a straight face over here both james and maddie looked round at her maddie expression became an evil grin as james crossed over to lily having still not seen his sister what is it lily he asked vaguely i have to go find pad sirius and pete gone missing as well oh nothing lily said innocently just thought you should know that we have a new member of gryffindor good that great james said hurriedly running a hand through his hair and looking towards the stairs if that all i just thought you should you know welcome them lily said her eyes on maddie i mean just to make them feel at home since you re head boy mmmhmm james said lily heard a choked cough behind her and knew that sapphire was trying not to burst a rib laughing in the end james sighed giving in to lily supposedly pleading stare alright alright he said sounding almost exasperated for your sake i ll say hello where are they hello head boy sir a voice said from behind him i know that voi james said slowly the entire gryffindor common room burst into laughter as james suddenly wheeled around his mouth hanging open to come face to face with his little sister who was wearing an angelic smile and looking as though butter wouldntmelt in her mouth y you what are you doing here he spluttered why james arentyou pleased to see me maddie feigned hurt what are you doing here james demanded again maddie groaned that is the fifth time in ten minutes that i ve been asked that i ll repeat myself professor dumbledore invited me to come and stay until boxing day for your ball thing so i could improve my social life y you ll be here for over a week james looked horrorstruck and lily laughed until the tears poured down her face at his tone no duh maddie said sarcastically now if you dontmind she gestured at her new friends who were in fits of giggles and walked back to them calling merrily over her shoulder see you later james james turned back to lily still looking shocked i thought i was safe from her here he said in a hollow voice my life is over groaning he walked off upstairs leaving lily to dissolve into laughter once again the next day was the long awaited hogsmeade trip and it was with a definite sense of anticipation that lily pulled on a pair of jeans and a turtleneck before heading down the breakfast with her friends the hall was already full of students chattering about the prospect of a day out in the village finding seats across from james sirius peter and remus the girls began eating discussing plans looking forward to today emma asked cheerily leaning forward to kiss remus on the cheek mmhmm sirius said through a mouthful of bacon emma looked disgusted oh she announced clearly trying to change the subject did i mention that the boys are coming with us when we go robe shopping we re going robe shopping lily asked blankly we re going shopping sapphire said in a horrified voice remind me why we agreed to do this james muttered in a tone that was perfectly audible to everyone else because remus muttered back equally audible you re too nice and loyal to leave a lone marauder i e me on his own in a clothes shop full of girls emma rolled her eyes and turned to sapphire so what exactly did you think we d be doing in hogsmeade if not shopping of some sort i dontknow sapphire mumbled well i need to buy christmas presents lily said matter of factly there was a chorus of me too s so why not make it easy for me sirius asked jovially what do you all want think of what you think i d like and then buy anything but that emma said at once i dread to think what your idea of a present will be if it a prank of some sort especially when you consider it to be appropriate haha sirius said sarcastically it nice to know you trust me to make the right decisions when necessary only a fool would trust you to do that sirius emma said sirius huffed and chose not to respond as james snorted and remus coughed into his cereal lily watched sirius absently as he eyed the last breakfast muffin left on the plate in front of him just as he had established that no one else appeared to be have any interest in it he reached out only to see james arm swoop in from nowhere and grab it hey sirius protested fingers grasping fruitlessly at empty air that was mine james smirked clutching the muffin in one hand as he took a drink you snooze you lose ignoring sirius pout he tore off a piece and lifted it towards his mouth james james lowered his hand and looked at sirius warily what you re mean james rolled his eyes whatever he raised his hand again james what wontyou share it with me since we re bestest friends no he lifted up the muffin again james what james exploded all i want is to eat my muffin in peace and i can t because you keep stopping me and donttry that pitiful puppy look on me i a guy not one of your fan club he added glaring at sirius i didntsay anything sirius said injuredly i did another voice said james swivelled to see maddie behind him what he said tiredly what re you eating she leaned on his shoulder is that a muffin yes james muttered james maddie said in a warningly sing song voice are you or are you not a quidditch captain and did you or did you not spend more or less your entire life training to get to where you are today what did mum tell you about eating healthily you should be eating something like she pointed at a container of muesli that james made a disgusted face maddie gave him a look and lily sirius remus peter emma sapphire and all of maddie friends standing behind her began to snigger uncontrollably you know what the solution is maddie told him calmly she held out her hand come on hand over the muffin no two voices shouted in unison james and sirius glared at each other before turning back to maddie that mine james cried as maddie snatched at the muffin get your own if he canthave it i should sirius roared swiping at james hand too maddie stopped trying to get the muffin and folded her arms sternly look at you head boy and quidditch captain and you re behaving like a baby she took a step back what is with you james demanded every time i have food in my hand you turn up yesterday i came down with a chocolate frog and you suddenly popped up and took half of it off me today i get a muffin and you re behind me do you have me on a radar system or something yeah right maddie said sarcastically like i have nothing better to do i going to get ready for hogsmeade wear something warm james said unthinkingly it cold today james maddie hissed stop trying to be mum dontembarrass me in front of my friends shoving him in the back she walked off then stopped and came back i forgot deftly her hand twisted into his and the next thing james knew his little sister was walking away with a muffin in her hand his muffin the last muffin thanks she called cheerfully over her shoulder james turned back to the others who were all keeping determinedly straight faces my life was so peaceful at school he said mournfully now there really is nowhere left to run it was too much the table shook as six people burst into laughter you and maddie are a one of a kind pair lily said wiping her eyes james scowled at her and then looked up the table abruptly he got up and strolled down the length of it before almost snatching a place of muffins from under the noses of a bunch of first years all of whom stared eyes wide as he made off with them james lily scolded that wasntvery nice in fact it was downright mean to those poor first years well what maddie did wasntvery nice in fact it was downright mean to me but are you telling her off do i see any kind of head girl reprimand on your lips no so i fully justified and with that james took an enormous bite of his muffin to end the conversation leaving lily to roll her eyes at the ceiling after breakfast the seven of them left for hogsmeade teeth chattering as they stepped into the frosty air huddled into their cloaks they joined the multitudes of students walking towards the village soon they had separated into three groups emma and remus walking together at the front and sapphire and lily a few metres behind at the back lagged james peter and sirius discussing something in low voices it was a peaceful time and lily was having great fun talking bout aimless things with sapphire sirius however was not feeling quite so peaceful he had been having an inner battle with himself for a while now over whether or not he should ask sapphire to the ball most of him doubted that she would even say yes so really was there any point there was only the smallest of chances that she would even consider it i ll do it he decided hoping that he would not back out of his own resolution i ll ask her some time this morning eventually trying to take control of himself he attempted to listen to james words but his attention was soon suspended as he watched a tall figure break away from a group nearby and head in sapphire direction he saw the hooked nose and grimaced it was leon wilkes one of sapphire not so secret admirers honestly he thought disgustedly as leon inserted himself neatly in between the two girls lily looking put out as she was pushed to a side some guys just dontknow the meaning of being polite god help me if i ever act that desperate distantly he watched as sapphire face looked annoyed at the interruption she said something sharp and moved away but leon caught her arm and asked her something in a low voice as sapphire tried to shrug him off finally she stopped and shook her head hesitantly leon said something wearing a hopeful expression and after a moment sapphire leaned closer towards him a stab of curiosity shot through sirius as leon said something into sapphire ear she looked up at him tilting her head as if in thought but slowly nodded her head all of a sudden the pieces seemed to fall together in sirius head and he felt his mind freeze as he understood what was going on leon just asked her to the ball he realised and she said yes the bottom seemed to drop out of his stomach and he swallowed hard staring at the ground the tiny voice that had taken residence in his head to tell him that maybe just maybe he had a chance with her had closed up shop and disappeared all that remained was reality as cold and hard as the air hitting his face it a wake up call he thought grimly in his mind he scanned over the multitude of beautiful girls at his beck and call who could be potential trophy dates i just as capable oh having a horde of followers he thought harshly if she can pick a date out of them i bloody well can too and at least mine wonthave a deformed nose he stopped at the image of a pretty asian girl james words echoing back she got beauty and brains she d actually be worth your time he looked around how convenient madhura he muttered and lengthened his strides to catch up with her walking arm in arm with her two friends she was only a little way in front of him and he soon fell into step with her madhura hi he said smiling at her and her friends being careful to acknowledge all three of them unlike a certain other person he had recently watched hi sirius she responded looking at him questioningly listen i was wondering sirius said quickly although he was determined not to look at sapphire instinct told him they were catching up with her would you like to uh go to the ball with me madhura looked him up and down apparently considering before catching her friends eyes finally she looked back at him well i was sort of planning to ask ar she broke off as she looked at a dark head further off but i guess i ll go with you she smiled at him and sirius felt himself smile back it was nice to know someone so genuinely honest so where and when shall i meet you he asked madhura began to say something but sirius had inadvertently looked to the front where sapphire and leon were within a few feet of them within hearing range to sirius horror as his eyes fell on them sapphire raised her hand and slapped leon full in the face fuck off she told him in an even voice crawl back into whatever hole you came out of and with that the pieces fell apart again that was no ball date sirius realised more dismaying was the truth that was testified by the girl next to him i ve just lost any chance i had he looked back at madhura who was watching him expectantly s sorry he managed as they drew up right behind sapphire and lily i didntquite catch that how about meeting me outside my common room at about seven then we can walk to the great hall together y yeah sirius answered vaguely that okay see you then madhura said she smiled at him again and moved off as sirius turned round to the front again and straight into sapphire shocked face for one second he hoped against hope that maybe just maybe she had not heard his exchange but the expression on her face threw that idea straight into the bin they stared at each other for a frozen moment sirius trying with all his might to communicate anything that would contradict what he knew she was thinking but sapphire face had gone blank and as the crowd in front began to move again she turned on her heel and walked off to catch up with lily sirius was left with nothing to do but groan silently at his own stupidity meanwhile sapphire stalking on ahead was rapidly losing her concentration on whatever it was that lily was talking about it was only an infatuation she told herself sternly that was all it ever was i donteven like him so why does it hurt so much soon enough the village of hogsmeade was flooded with students christmas lights twinkled in almost every store window and the snow beneath crunched as they stepped through it it was like a scene from a muggle christmas card come to life and lily sniffed the air as the scent of pine wafted past she spun on her heel to face the others clapping her gloved hands excitedly as the christmas spirit infused her ok so what shall we do first emma smiled to see her best friend grinning as happily as a child on christmas morning robes first she replied since i dontthink any of you really want to do that this way we ll get it done and you wontspend the whole day dreading it without waiting for agreement she linked arms with her friends and maneuvered them in the direction of gladrags the boys following behind dispiritedly with a tinkling sound the door swung open and all seven people trooped into the warmth of the shop lily shook the snow off her coat and looked around the shop floor already there were several groups of giggling girls clustering around the store displays and racks of clothes it was the first time lily had ever seen anything but robes cloaks and hats in the store and she thought it looked decidedly odd full of dazzling arrays of muggle formal wear as it was emma needed only a few seconds to take stock of her surroundings before she grasped sapphire and lily and dragged them towards a rack of dresses sapphire and lily looked almost pathetically back at the boys as they were taken but could not be helped uncomfortably the boys loitered in the doorway for a while until a shop assistant took pity on them and directed them to the men clothing it was amazing lily thought yawning as she followed emma how many different ways people could come up with of designing the same piece of clothing the colours around her had to be every shade of the rainbow and yet she was feeling more confused than impressed at the onslaught f tones and textures eventually however the lure of the shimmering fabrics drew her in and she was content to lend her opinion as emma flitted from dress to dress holding them up against her friends and exclaiming in approval or disgust soon enough all three girls had stacks of dress slung over one arm as they headed towards the fitting area another new addition lily noted remus james sirius and peter turned up looking intensely bored finished emma asked brightly as she counted the number of garments she had yeah sirius mumbled he and the others gestured at identical bags which presumably held suits you were quick sapphire said her tone made it quite clear that she wished she could join them yes well james said sarcastically it so difficult to make a choice between suits you could get a black one or another black one or how about another black one there such a difference ok ok we get the point emma said well now that you re here you can sit down and give us your opinion on our clothes great remus muttered although he sat down anyway finding a changing cubicle each the girls began the long arduous process of trying on clothes emma naturally was the first person to find something she liked after deciding against a silvery dress with a strange bit on the back that sirius told her looked like a fish fin she came out in a sheer red dress made of satin held up by thin straps it fell straight to the floor hinting at curves emma examined her reflection turning to the side and smoothing the dress over her hips what do you think she asked questioningly looking round she focused on remus behind her on the sofa his mouth hanging open do i take that as a yes she asked almost shyly when remus made no response james leaned over and closed his mouth firmly before nudging in him the side recovering from his stupor remus quickly got up and walked over to stand beside emma the dress is nice he said slowly but to be honest i dontcare what you wear emma just being there with you is enough he bent down and gave her a brief unexpected kiss i going outside for some air alright choose whatever you like best emma blushed in pleasure as he walked away this dress it is then she said almost to herself looking at the mirror once more before going back into her cubicle in contrast both sapphire and lily were both having rather more difficulty in finding something they liked after trying on four dresses each in a different shade lily decided against them on the basis that one was too tight one too loose one too frumpy and one too revealing frustrated she stalked out of the fitting rooms to face sirius and james both lounged on the sofa peter had followed remus i hate shopping for clothes she stated in a tone of false calm i am dumping these and going out to find something else a few minutes after she had disappeared james too stood up i fed up he said at least out in the shop you can watch other silly students worry over how their legs look like car park pillars he kicked his bag over do us a favour and look after the bags padfoot without giving sirius a chance to protest he too was gone meanwhile sapphire was not faring much better than lily a cream gown a red dress and a greeny blue affair of silk had all been discarded picking up her fourth dress she examined it watching the way the pink silk caught the light simple cream embroidery adding a touch of stylish elegance with peach flowers and felt a ray of hope maybe this would be the one two minutes later the delicate garment lay in a crumpled heap in a corner where sapphire had unceremoniously tossed it after deciding that the colour didntsuit her growing irritated with emma for talking her into this and herself for being talked into it sapphire pulled on the final dress and stared at herself it was for the most part a deep midnight blue with one shoulder a full sleeveless fit and the other a thin strap from there it fell straight down until the bottom where one side flared out diagonally in strips of blue from dark to light it looked alright she decided more or less passable turning she looked at the side view still i should go and check in the big mirrors better lighting there she shoved the curtain of the changing room aside and crossed over to the waiting area looking at herself in the mirror how do i look she mused quietly good enough for her highness the queen of fashion there was a short pause and then all of a sudden came a low male voice you it looks lovely sapphire swivelled to face none other than sirius sitting alone on the sofa watching her with a strange expression a few seconds of silence passed as she opened and closed her mouth soundlessly well i certainly wontbe buying this one then she snapped finally before walking back to her cubicle forget it she thought as she put her own clothes back on i d rather go naked than go in something he approved i ll find something else easily wonti when she came back out there was no one left on the sofa and she walked back into the main shop to see emma and lily going through yet another rack of dresses stupid em lily was saying i ll just transfigure a dress i already have into something suitable we re wasting time what going on sapphire asked putting all her dresses back onto the rail lily cantfind anything emma replied she eyed sapphire and what happened to you missy uhm sapphire had the best intentions when she said the next thing i m going to come and get it later so i dontcarry it around and and drop it she looked around the shop for a change of subject why only james here the others are outside emma replied briefly come on you we re finding you something just pick anything sapphire said exasperatedly she thrust her hand in and lifted out a random hanger like i dunno this lily stared at the dress for a moment it pretty she said reaching out to touch it gently what i was only joking sapphire looked at the dress she was holding at first glance it was nothing special a simple dress of green satin with slim straps and a body that pulled in at the waist and then flared out certainly nothing that was radically different to any of the other thousand and one dresses but as lily held it up against herself sapphire realised why lily was so captured by it it was nothing special but it suited her perfectly it lovely emma said she circled the dress and then turned over the price tag and winced as long as you re wiling to spend the rest of your life on the streets lily looked at the price tag and shook her head i cantafford this she looked wistful as she put it back on the rail it doesntmatter i can transfigure my white dress and it ll look fine so i the only one buying anything now emma looked at their empty hands you two are hopeless she paid for her dress and they exited the shop dragging james away with them outside having agreed to meet up again at the three broomsticks in an hour and a half everyone went their separate ways to begin the arduous process of present buying for lily the main problem was not what to get anyone but how to get it without them seeing she walked into the bookshop at least three times only to see remus sapphire and surprisingly enough sirius in the shop at different times peter was both the easiest and one of the hardest people to buy for she had no idea what he would like and wondered about it for a while before giving up and buying him a box of honeydukes finest fudge sirius too was a puzzle lily debated over chocolate before remembering how hyper he got on sugar a joke book before deciding he didntneed any more cheesy jokes and a prank handbook before realising that a he was dangerous enough without it and b he had probably done most of them already eventually however she gave in to the inevitable and bought him something she knew she would regret later a discount card which gave the owner a discount off any item bought in any joke shop valid for a year sapphire and emma were relatively easy to shop for she bought a set of three friendship necklaces each with a third of a ring as the pendant the idea as the shopkeeper explained was that rings went on forever whereas hearts could be broken convinced lily paid and left the shop as she came outside she saw emma leave the bookshop and darted across and in before anyone else could get there inside she found the perfect present for remus 101 things to do when you re a creature of the night the book was filled with humorous suggestions and lily thought it would definitely put a different spin on things for him now there was only one person left james what on earth was she supposed to get him after checking out the quidditch shop and joke shop she lost heart and wandered along aimlessly hoping for inspiration as she window shopped after a while she looked up and realised that sapphire was doing exactly the same thing across the street hey she said walking over how it going not so good sapphire said i ve got one present left to buy but i i dont she stopped and bit her lip lily eyed her friend what up she asked sapphire fiddled with her fingers looking uncomfortable for a moment it it black she burst out i dontknow if should i even bother buying him anything lily looked at her friend for a long moment well i dontknow if i qualified to comment seeing as i have that problem with someone else but if you ve bought everyone else something then you should get him something too i mean whatever you think of him it not nice to be left out yeah i guess sapphire mumbled she stuffed her hands in her pockets so who your problem present person james lily muttered quietly i have no idea what to get him or even what appropriate to get him sapphire looked thoughtful but then shook her head sorry canthelp you i probably know less about it than you how about something from your past a photo or something something to commemorate your time at hogwarts lily face lit up suddenly the past that it saffy you re a genius she turned and walked off quickly calling a see you later over her shoulder shrugging sapphire turned her attention to her own problems sighing she pushed open the door of the shop she was outside figuring that she was just as likely to get lucky here as anywhere else the shop was an assortment of various random curios and sapphire wandered from one display to another the owner came out from behind the cash desk a tallish blonde witch in her early thirties with about seven scarves of varying shades of purple draped around her neck can i help you she asked cheerfully i dontknow sapphire answered vaguely i need to get a gift for someone only i dontknow what to get or what sort of suitable ah a difficult case eh the witch winked well when i confused i find there only one way forward close your eyes reach out and pick let your heart guide you not your eyes sapphire shrugged again i so desperate i ll try anything she shut her eyes reached forward and touched something that was cool and smooth beneath her fingertips opening her eyes she saw a strange kind of crystal ball with white fog swirling inside not bothered about what it was she promised to read the leaflet paid and left the shop hoping for a quick spell in honeydukes before she met the others again james was the first person to arrive at the three broomsticks having dodged maddie and her requests or rather demands for money for the third time wallet intact he opened the door with his foot and walked in the warmth hit him at once bringing life back to his hands and face and over the sounds of cheerful students having a good day out he looked around for any of his friends determinedly ignoring the giggly waves of some sixth year gryffindors he didntsee anyone but he did see something else tom was seated at the bar but he wasnt alone serena was standing in front of him hands on hips carefully james edged over to an empty booth and dumped his three bags on it watching tom and serena out of the corner of his eye for some reason the sight was making him uneasy even though tom didntseem the type to cheat on anyone it not the 1800s he reminded himself sternly boys are allowed to converse with more than one girl still there was a gut feeling that he couldntquite place as he pretended to busy himself with his bags he saw tom touch serena lightly on the waist and say something she laughed almost snidely james thought and walked off leaving tom alone idly playing with the handle of his tankard of butterbeer deciding that he couldntplay around with his bags any longer james went up to the bar on the pretext of ordering a drink alright tom he asked watching madam rosmerta get sidetracked by a demanding patron who also appeared to be more than slightly drunk yeah you cold but yeah alright james answered leaning on the bar top been up to christmas shopping tom asked nodding at the booth where his bags lay on the table yeah have you already got it done more or less tom grimaced it just hard to find a present for lily it our hundredth day anniversary on christmas day so i have to get something special how nice james said blandly she hasntmentioned it to any of us ah well tom gave him what james assumed to be a superior look matters of a serious relationship you know no one likes to publicise these things james shrugged true he said mildly cheers rosie he called as rosmerta set his drink down and moved away giving him a smile over her shoulder so any idea what i could get her you know since you re her friend and everything despite his casual tone james heard the slight inflection and grimaced inwardly you know i really wasnt aware of our relationship to each other until you clarified it so well no idea he said keeping his face carefully blank sorry canthelp you very much yeah i guess since you re not really in the same position now the look on his face was definitely smug mmhmm the door swung open oh sirius is here see you later tom bye came the reply there was still an air of uneasiness hanging over james as he made his way over but as sirius dulcet tones broke across the pub to him prongs whatcha get me he knew he would have to shelve his concerns for another day a n sorry for ever long delays between chapters life seems to catch up with me very suddenly hopefully you all liked deathly hallows definitely ended the series with a bang anyway only one chapter more until the ball and drama with a capital d so how about a review the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you chapter 34 presents galore i love saturday evenings emma said lazily from the floor she was sitting in front of remus who was reading a book on the sofa while james and sirius played chess lily lifted her head you do realise it not saturday evening she questioned yep emma said cheerfully but i like saturday evening the best as opposed to friday evenings remus asked he looked carefully at his girlfriend the expression on his face suggesting that he was wondering if she was quite alright in the head of course emma said she placed the brush back in the bottle of nail polish and wiggled her toes to make them dry think about it on friday night you re tired after school and you know you should get started on the weekend homework on sunday evening you ve just spent the day doing homework and have the prospect of another week to get through but on saturday evening you ve spent a day relaxing and you ve got a whole twenty four hours before you go back to school that why i like saturday best lily regarded emma for a long moment em she said slowly that was a very random thing to say are you aware of that i was just making a point emma said defensively it so qui dammit james groaned in frustration sirius was watching smuggle as his queen dragged the white knight off the board pretending to buff his nails on his t shirt sirius inspected his nails modestly never challenge a master my friend oh so that doesntinclude you then james retorted he stared hard at the chessboard move your castle to c5 lily said raising her chin from her knees james rolled his eyes i think i know how to play chess lily he said moving a pawn instead sirius bishop to f7 lily said offhandedly sirius stared at the board a faint line of concentration appearing on his brow before looking up lily you re a genius he exclaimed as he ordered his bishop which razed straight through the square james pawn had just vacated to take down his queen and drag her kicking and screaming off the board the white king turned around unhand us foul sir he bellowed at james who looked taken aback and allow yon fair maiden to direct our battle james turned fine lily you come sit here with me for a second lily looked as though she was going to contest him but then she shut her mouth and moved over beside james a little too meekly castle to h2 she said and the piece moved sirius studied the board suddenly he let out a whoop queen to f4 he said jubilantly checkmate the white king was forced to throw down his crown at the feet of the black queen james turned to lily in disbelief i thought you were helping me he said oh i was lily replied innocently i was helping you deflate your ego it needed a pinprick sirius burst into fresh laughter thanks lil i owe you one james scowled i demand a rematch he said without the chessmaster help done sirius smirked just dontexpect to win lily rolled her eyes and moved back to where she had been sitting as james and sirius began setting up the pieces again so emma said chattily who everyone going to the ball with when no one answered she pressed on lily would have thought it an innocent conversation had she not seen the gleam in emma eyes well remus and i are going together obviously she smiled up at remus whose arm was draped casually around her shoulder and he gave her a brief squeeze back how about you sirius madhura sirius said absently emma screwed up her nose that pretty ravenclaw the one whose friend just got her leg out of the cast it had been a school joke when the girl in question had broken her leg by falling off her chair and then tripping over a table two chairs and her own bag one after the other she was notoriously accident prone sirius nodded and emma carried on and saffy saffy isntgoing with anyone as far as i know she turned everyone down she stole a glance at sirius whose head was bent i cantunderstand why and lily what about you tom lily answered easily he asked me two weeks ago there was a cry as a chess piece was knocked off the board by james elbow it plummeted to the floor and james dived down to retrieve it taking his time under the table okay emma said thoughtfully so that leaves you james who the lucky girl perhaps it was a trick of the firelight but james cheeks looked almost glowing as he removed himself uhm er ouch he cursed as his head hit the table and backed up until he could stand up well there is none i going alone so to speak stag for some reason sirius snorted with laughter at this and tried to turn it into a loud coughing fit as everyone stared what so funny lily asked watching curiously as james glared daggers at his friend n nothing sirius failing to control himself got out in between spurts of laughter lily opened her mouth to ask more but just then a figure ran down the stairs and tripped over lily legs landing on top of emma what on earth going on lily asked raising herself to look across at the whirlwind that was sapphire now sprawled across emma lap sapphire got up sheepishly i er need you and emma in the dorm she said vaguely what for emma asked wriggling her toes again to make the polish sparkle just uhm homework but i need you really soon like now sapphire grabbed her friends arms and without further ado began to drag them off ignoring lily cry of but it the middle of the holidays you dontdo work in the hol her voice was cut off as they reached the stairs and the boys had no choice but to shrug and return to what they were doing when they reached the dorm emma and lily tugged their arms out of sapphire and stared at her expectantly as she knelt down and picked something up before shaking it in their faces it wa s a small crystal ball uh saffy you might need to give us some verbal clues to go with that lily said carefully this sapphire hissed how am i supposed to give this what emma asked you re going to have to be clearer if you want us to respond lily added sapphire took a deep breath okay lily remember i was having problems with a present for for she hesitated sirius lily finished for her yeah i remember well well i went into the shop and i didntknow what to get him but the lady said just to close my eyes and pick so i closed my eyes and picked this thing and it totally inappropriate because because idon tlikehiminthatway sapphire ended in a rush after pausing for a moment to try and understand the garbled mess that sapphire had just given them lily regarded the crystal ball which was still foggy it looks harmless enough she said i mean what the worst it can do display sapphire loves sirius inside when you look in emma sniggered sapphire scowled heavily i do not like sirius she said petulantly but in terms of the the thing you re uhm not far off she turned around to pick up a piece of parchment and handed it to emma who read it with raised eyebrows and then handed it back okay so what we have here is a crystal ball which reveals the feelings of the giver towards the receiver supposedly it goes through various stages of fogginess before displaying the word love at the centre in full clarity she sounded diplomatic but lily could see the glint in her eyes well i beginning to see where your predicament is she said delicately exactly moaned sapphire she stared wildly at the innocent looking crystal i can not give this to him not if it the last thing on earth picking up a bottle of perfume she examined it how about this i sure he always wanted a bottle of dolce and gabbana no he doesn t lily snatched the bottle off her because that my perfume and i practically paid half my bank account for it groaning sapphire sank to the floor clutching the ball as if by squeezing it she could change what it was look emma said sensibly we might be okay you might be worrying over nothing for all we know this could be a piece of cheap crap which ll never work anyway it better not be cheap crap sapphire protested hotly i paid good money for that then she realised what she was saying i mean i hope it doesnt work i can always she sighed forget the money well lily said pragmatically there only one way to check it we should test it on what emma saw the look on lily face and looked down at herself oh look at it this way em you re the only one of us with a boyfriend who can be completely trusted well no time like the present sapphire jumped up come on she walked out and down the stairs leaving emma and lily to follow hopelessly in her wake sapphire walked straight up to remus remus can we borrow you for a moment she asked innocently all three boys turned round and remus frowned in suspicion am i likely to get hurt or humiliated he asked sapphire put her hand to her heart i swear that none of the above will happen what in your hand sirius asked curiously gesturing at the hand she held behind her back a bomb specifically designed to dispose only of you sapphire answered sweetly remus coming remus lifted himself slowly off the couch but sapphire grabbed his arm and towards the girls dorms for the second time that night james and sirius were left to shrug hopelessly remus stopped short when he saw where he was being led but sapphire pulled impatiently come on i not actually taking you up there they came to a stop just before the stairs and the girls crowded in close making remus look unnerved have you got it lily asked breathlessly sapphire took her arm from behind her back and gave the crystal to emma remus raised his eyebrows as he saw its swirling depths you re thinking of trying to be a divination professor no sapphire said just please dontask questions emma held the ball for a moment and then passed it to remus who took it as if expecting it to blow up in his face it not going to work it not going to work sapphire muttered hopefully slowly the orb began to pulse gently and the mist seemed to dissolve into itself getting thinner and thinner a soft red glow began to emanate from its depths it getting warmer remus said looking slightly bewildered eventually the crystal became suffused with a warm light a golden sparkle appeared in the middle and traced a pattern which became in glittering gold cursive the word love it beautiful lily said in awe it works sapphire said shoulders slumping lily made a slashing motion to tell her to shut up and all three stood thinking of the implications the silence was broken by remus uh sorry to interrupt you but my hands are sort of burning off this thing is hot sorry sapphire said taking it well thanks remus she made for the stairs and disappeared lily following swiftly behind only emma remained to give remus a quick kiss on the cheek thank you she said softly do us a favour and keep this under wraps ok she walked off and remus still as confused as before returned to his book back upstairs sapphire sank back to the floor clutching the crystal so what do i do she asked despondently emma shrugged i dontsuppose you could swap it with any of your other presents sapphire thought for a moment then shook her head nope suddenly she looked hopeful couldnti switch it with any of yours both emma and lily shook their heads it wouldntwork lily said sapphire glared down at the ball and its instructions she picked up the instructions again maybe there some way to turn it off scanning through the instructions her face darkened okay maybe not she flung the sheet haphazardly and set the ball back in its box you know what i ll deal with this later i probably wontget him anything at all seeing that there was nothing to do about it emma got up suit yourself the three girls began to get ready for bed discussing the merits of a new song none of them noticed the instruction leaflet lying innocuously where it had been thrown under sapphire bed slowly the hours passed by minute by minute until it was finally christmas eve the only topic of conversation in the entire student body seemed to be the ball next day lily had never seen the school so engaged from gryffindors to slytherins from third years to seventh years it was possible to predict exactly what was being discussed in every conversation there seemed to be no exception to this rule and most people were bustling around cheerfully getting themselves ready with outfits the key word there was most two people in particular were not wholly able to join in the christmas spirit sirius and james were both uneasy although for different reasons had they confided in each other they would have found a willing listener but for james communication was impossible due to the nature of his worry and for sirius it was just too humbling sirius had been watching over the past few days with a deep sense of self mistrust the number of boys trailing after sapphire it wasntthat she was extremely pretty he convinced himself or that she was surprisingly nice to people who werenthim she had nothing outstanding in the way of personal attraction he told himself sternly but then why did boys follow her like flies it wasntas if she even wanted the attention more often than not she sent them packing with her sharp tongue or a sharp punch it must be the idea of forbidden fruit sirius decided she refused every boy that asked her so vehemently that it just increased her appeal that was all it still didntexplain why she was turning everyone down though aside from the usual pack of scavengers seemingly headed by leon wilkes there were several boys whom he was fairly sure sapphire would have a good time with yet all got rejected regardless of everything in their favour sirius couldntunderstand it at all meanwhile james was toying with a very different concern or perhaps not so different after all a tiny part of his mind was nagging at him telling him that he owed it to lily to tell her and yet every time he had had an opportunity he lost all courage and had chosen to remain silent so much for being a bloody gryffindor he looked up she was sitting opposite him right now attacking her pasta voraciously he didntwant to be the one to have to upset her as he knew his words would or worse still what if all his hears were ungrounded and she ended up hating him why was it so damned difficult to make a choice on the other hand he reasoned with himself what if he just cautioned her just warned her so to speak it couldntdo too much harm right he would have to hope waiting until she finished her dinner he asked if he could speak to her alone with a look of surprise she agreed and followed him out of the hall they stopped just past the doors and james turned to face her he tried to think of the best way to put it lily i i need to uhm warn you about something seeing her look of alarm he hastily elaborated it nothing serious just as a close friend i thought i should tell you what is it lily asked curiously it s james exhaled and ran a hand through his hair he avoided her wide eyes choosing instead to focus on the floor it just that you should be careful of lily tom was walking down the stairs he smiled at lily and then regarded james with only the slightest hint of distrust which james did not miss i ll catch up with you later lily called tom nodded slightly his eyes still on james who was attempting unsuccessfully to keep his expression as unhostile as possible unfortunately for him lily turned round sooner than he expected and saw his face she pursed her lips and looked back at the doors through which tom had passed then back at james clearly putting two and two together oh no not this she sighed james tom is totally safe he is not about to do anything that i dontwant him to do and we are perfectly happy together it not james bit his lip looking uncharacteristically unsure of himself it was no good now anything he said would be taken the wrong way no matter what it was about never mind he said at last it doesntmatter you sure lily scrutinised his face carefully yeah see you around as lily headed back into the hall to find tom james was left with the sinking feeling that as good as a chess player as lily was she was fast coming up against a player whose moves she would never foresee wake up wake up sapphire jumped onto emma bed emma mumbled something and turned over but this did not faze sapphire wake up she repeated cheerfully bouncing on the bed it christmas presents food chocolate did someone say food lily sat up suddenly wide awake yep sapphire sang out and presents and chocolate well i up lily said grabbing a towel emma groaned opening her eyes it s six thirty in the morning you two kids go down i ll follow later nuh uh sapphire protested she pulled the quilt off emma and then pulling her arms raised her to her feet you re coming with us with much grumbling from emma the three of them got showered and dressed and tumbled down to the common room presents in hand conveniently they gained a corner by the warm fire just thirty seconds later sirius bounded down the boys staircase followed by three weary looking boys presents food chocolate he sang out happily merry christmas all he woke you up lily asked casting an eye at sirius bounced on my bed and then pulled me out remus affirmed join the gang emma said she rubbed her eyes presents sirius called cheerfully give everyone your gifts soon enough everyone had a stack of parcels in front of them of different shapes and sizes oddly enough though james four all looked exactly the same even in different wrapping paper except for one peter s james looked up curiously am i that hard to shop for that you all had to buy me the same gift remus raised an eyebrow well if they all bought you what i did he looked around open them james james opened them one by one they were all the same a book by twisting her head lily could read the titles how to overcome your shyness you think james is shy she asked quizzically uhm sapphire mumbled well it was more about a specific case she watched as james opened the book to the first page he read the inscription and flushed red what does it say lily asked never mind james said quickly snapping the book shut he opened the front page of each of the remaining books before slamming them all shut his face growing redder with each one until he looked almost ready to explode what do they say lily asked impatiently i guessing yours were along the same lines as mine remus asked sapphire emma and sirius yeah came the general reply well sirius cut in briskly now that we ve seen what james got how about the rest of us much laughter was heard as the rest of them opened their boxes peter had bought everyone chocolate and was rather surprised to find that everyone had bought him exactly the same right down to the type i might as well have just kept the same things and saved myself the three hours it took to wrap these he grumbled it took you three hours to wrap six square boxes of chocolates lily asked incredulously peter looked uncomfortable i er got a bit tangled in the spellotape everyone snorted as emma looked at her present from remus oh remus you bought me shoes lily had to admit the blue box did look a lot like a shoebox not quite remus said with a smile open it emma carefully lifted the lid and gasped remus with the utmost care she reached in and lifted out a single hand blown glass rose it beautiful she said reverently watching it catch the light remus you re amazing she leaned over to kiss him the girls presents to each other were also surprisingly similar emma had bought her friends a mood stone bracelet each with all their initials linked together in an intricate design inscription on the inside sapphire had chosen rings which warmed when the person thought of the other wearers and lily had bought them each a necklace when put together the three pendants formed an unbroken ring each with a different stone set into it a sapphire for sapphire ruby for emma and an emerald for lily sirius as emma put it was set to be a downright menace after he had opened all his presents lily after wondering what she could buy in the joke shop that he didntalready have had presented him with a card that gave him a twenty percent discount at any joke shop sirius nearly kissed her when he worked out what the little piece of plastic could do in addition remus had given him an assortment of prank necessities including a large bag of dungbombs lily decided then and there to confiscate them as soon as humanly possible not to mention the pile of vouchers for free butterbeer that he had received from emma which clearly ensured that he would deprive madam rosmerta of her profits from him for a while to come sapphire present however was more of a puzzle sirius looked surprised when he realised who it was from he clearly hadntexpected anything from her although he had given her the same present as he had given emma a framed photo of the seven of them all squashed on and around the sofa in the common room carefully he unwrapped the box and picked up the crystal ball it very nice he said he examined it for a moment uh what is it isntthere sapphire began she looked cautiously at the mess of wrapping with a sudden movement across the floor that startled sirius causing him to jump back she reached for the wrapping and began searching through it untwisting it all and even shaking out the clear box having decided that there was clearly nothing to be salvaged in the mess of shredded paper she looked back at her friends with an expression that clearly screamed what the hell do i do emma jumped in have you forgotten saffy there was no uh gift tag with it that what you re looking for isntit sapphire picked up the hint quickly uhm yeah oh well she moved away it just a a uh crystal ball you know in case you ever want to take up divination remus was frowning isntthat emma turned around and with a surprising presence of mind leaned over remus remus she muttered sweetly if you dontsay anything now i promise i ll reward you later remus obligingly shut his mouth ok sirius said dubiously well thanks strangely enough sirius presents seemed to be devoid of tricks themselves his most suggestive one as far as lily could see had been a cologne he had given remus dangerous obsession that was of course until lily got to her own from him it was a fairly small rectangular box as lily looked at it it seemed to jump slightly and she put it quickly down sirius she asked warily is there anything alive in there sirius smiled open it slowly lily unwrapped it keeping her fingers clear of the openings she revealed eventually the green paper was off and inside was a small plastic box within it was a statue of a fairy it looked like a muggle version delicate coppery waves spilling over pale shoulders against an orange and pink dress a tiny length of gold tinsel was tied around its waist with a small bag dangling and it carried a sprig of mistletoe in one hand lily lifted it carefully out she pretty she said wonderingly looking at the realistic face perfect even down to long fluttery eyelashes as she held it the ceramic seemed to warm up from the heat of her hands lily turned it to a side to examine the delicate wings behind when she felt a sudden movement in her hand startled she loosened her grip but instead of falling to the floor the fairy seemed to give a little kick and its wings fluttered free bursting into life it soared upwards merry christmas all it trilled it real lily gaped upwards in disbelief so to speak sirius smiled again but there was a hint of mischief in his eyes merry christmas all the fairy sang again putting one hand into its little pouch it showered lily with a handful of green glitter lily shook her hair what is it a mistletoe fairy everyone watched as the fairy tossed another handful of green glitter over her hair a what a mistletoe fairy okk lily said uncertainly merry christmas all the fairy threw another handful of glitter over her lily began to look annoyed as she shook green specks out of her hair ok that enough now she said go and merry christmas someone else the fairy did not budge merry christmas all it said and threw another handful irritated lily got up and moved away but the fairy simply fluttered until it was hovering above her again showering her with glitter until the ground was littered with it sirius she said crossly how do i get it to stop chucking glitter you don t sirius said simply what lily stared at him there no way to get rid of it oh i didntsay there was no way to get rid of it sirius said smugly merry christmas all the fairy said cheerfully how then lily demanded sirius mock sighed it a mistletoe fairy lily use your brain i have to i have to kiss someone she questioned narrowing her eyes sirius nodded right in one lily stared again ok fine she turned around as conveniently tom walked down the stairs tom he stopped startled as she got up the fairy fluttered energetically to keep up with her as she strode over briefly she kissed him on the lips tom looked shocked although rather pleased at the sudden action but lily had already stepped away and was looking expectantly up well nice knowing you she said upwards the fairy just giggled and flipped her hair dangling the mistletoe merry christmas all she trilled sirius lily said in a warning tone explain uhm sirius was wearing his most angelic expression i might have added a few charms to the ones on it such as lily voice was steely like that you have to kiss a uh particular person who do you want me to announce it to the world lily sighed and walked across bending down sirius muttered something into her ears lily leaped backwards sirius she said dangerously tell me you re joking sirius shook his head vigorously oh god this is not happening merry christmas all another handful of glitter went into the air shut up lily yelled at the giggling figure she turned to sirius is there no other way of doing this well you could just live with tinkerbell for the next year or so sirius said innocently for a moment lily looked as though she was actually considering this until the fairy delved into its pouch once more for heaven sake james said impatiently who are you supposed to kiss snivellus lily stalked up to him until her face was no more than an inch from his it not snivellus she hissed she yanked him to his feet it you before he could say anything she had pulled him over and out of the portrait hole she let it swing shut then looked up ok i really sorry i know i make it sound worse than it is i d rather it was you than someone like severus she swallowed and then ignoring the smirk on the fat lady face stood on tiptoes and kissed him on the cheek as another wave of glitter cascaded down the fairy had just managed to follow her out the fairy giggled again as lily gave the password and the two climbed back into the common room getting back to her friends lily looked almost surprised and more than a little frustrated to see glitter still falling she looked up why arentyou going she looked back at sirius why isntit going there might have been something else i forgot to mention sirius mumbled lily looked like she was about to explode what more is there that you can make me do sirius she yelled annoyed make me undress and do a lap dance for him in my knickers the entire group snorted and james flushed bright red no sirius said innocently just a little thing just spit it out you have to kiss him on the lips in public lily looked deadly and she wasntthe only one james was sinking lower and lower in his chair his face drained of colour sirius he muttered i am going to kill you this is one of your worst present ideas ever lily confirmed really sirius questioned i thought i deserved a nobel prize for it in your dreams james mumbled merry christmas all the fairy seemed to decide that the best way to dispel the murderous look on lily face was to throw an extra large handful of glitter over her lily let out a scream of frustration that does it she said firmly james i sorry but get up no james began to protest but a glare from lily silenced him and he got up reluctantly lily stepped closer to him trying her best to ignore the looks of anticipation on the others faces james she said softly so that the others couldnthear i really really sorry if there was a way without all this embarrassment i would use it james shrugged and then shook his head as some of the glitter that the fairy was throwing landed on him she put her hand on his arm telling her brain fiercely to shut up and he bent his head towards her their lips brushed for only a second before lily pulled back fearing that it could turn into a repeat of last time even so she could feel a spark shoot up her spine making her shiver as if to emphasise it a blinding flash of white light erupted and she blinked as she backed away from james thinking it was the fairy she looked up to smirk only to see the fairy staring back down oh pooh it said indignantly before it disappeared in a puff of green smoke leaving a trail of glitter in the air lily looked puzzled but if that was the fairy going what was the white she and james turned slowly only to see maddie standing next to sirius wearing a grin of the uttermost wickedness and holding a camera it took a moment for what had happened to sink into lily mind james however was quicker on the uptake you you he spluttered nice doing business with you sirius maddie said smirking as she shook hands with him this is possibly one of your best present ideas yet you you collaborated with his little sister lily asked in disbelief maddie simply looked smug what can i say sirius grinned we re partners in crime give me that camera james yelled and leapt after her maddie dodged him and darted round the table hello help james called to lily who snapped to her senses and moved over the other side for a moment the three of them were frozen in a stalemate maddie feinting this way and that while the two older students started and stopped finally they both closed in at the same time it looked likely to be successful until maddie slipped under the table and crawled out of the other side going round remus emma and sapphire who were all helpless with laughter why did i ever teach you to play quidditch james moaned running after her but it was too late she pushed through the portrait hole and they heard the pounding of her footsteps down the corridor that girl is too fast lily said looking at the closing hole james rounded on sirius padfoot what the hell are you planning to do with the photos he demanded no thing sirius said in a sing song voice sirius james said warningly nothing that involves the public alright james subsided but shot him such a mutinous look that sirius backed away to the window he looked out hey he cried snow let have a snow fight there was a pause and then slowly a general consensus of agreement sounds fun emma said boys versus girls remus suggested but there are four of you and three of us sapphire pointed out well lily has enough aggression for two people so really we re even sirius said earning himself a face from lily okay emma said meet back here in ten minutes with cloaks and stuff agreed all seven people trooped upstairs to retrieve extra clothing against the cold lily was one of the first back down and walked back to where they had been sitting to tidy up her presents and the pile of wrapping paper she had discarded as she put all the jewellery into the empty fairy box her eye fell on james four copies of how to overcome your shyness and she remembered how odd it was that he had got the same book four times and his strange uncomfortableness when he read the inside page and yet she still didntknow what was in them a quick peek couldnthurt right she flashed an apprehensive look at the doorways to the dorms and then hesitated before overcome with curiosity she reached out to take the top book and open it to the front page she cringed with embarrassment as she read the inscription dear james merry christmas you d better use this book to deal with your issues about lily sapphire quickly she closed the book and reached for the next one her face burning surely they couldntall be this bad dear james stop being stupid and get a move on lily wontbe sharing a common room with you for much longer merry christmas yours emma james i know you usually ignore my advice but here something for you that it would be in your best interests to consider i want you to listen carefully my friend use this book with regard to a certain miss evans remus prongs only one thing i want to say get off your lazy arse and stop being so shy goddamit you know who i talking about the one and only padfoot as she read the last message a shadow fell over her hastily she slammed the book shut and turned only to see james looking down at her hands in pockets sorry she said guiltily standing up i just wanted to know what they said well now you do james face was red they can be such jokers cantthey lily babbled trying to fill the awkward silence that fell they obviously haventpicked up on the fact that we re just we re just friends yeah came the weak reply he looked rather odd lily thought a mix between embarrassment and slight despondency although she wasntentirely sure why to cheer him up she reached into a pocket this is for you she said handing him a small box james looked surprised but accepted it and she watched him smile as he unwrapped the box and opened it only to find a smaller box inside instead i know where this is going he said laughing as he lifted the lid off to find an even smaller box bet you dontknow what in the middle though lily returned eyes sparkling with a hidden smile as she watched james pull away two more boxes finally james was left with a parcel no bigger than the size of his palm with twirly ribbon tied around it pulling the ribbon apart he lifted the lid to reveal a small scroll of parchment he looked puzzled as he unrolled it but as he read the top his expression changed to both shock and well hurt lily knew what he was reading three hundred reasons why i hate james potter he scanned right the way down the list which hung down to his knees right the way down to number 300 he thinks he in a constant competition with every other boy in school to look good in my eyes and it doesntwork and the final words signed lily evans aged fourteen when he looked up his voice was quiet is this what you really think of me lily shrugged and placed a finger on the parchment lily evans aged seventeen she said clearly the messy script of a fourteen year old morphed into the smooth cursive of a seventeen year old the scroll lengthened until it was trailing onto the floor what the james started lily smiled look at the title now james james looked down when he turned his hazel eyes back on her face they were full of a joyful surprise six hundred reasons why i like james potter and down at the bottom signed lily evans aged seventeen lily he said his face breaking out into a grin how can i thank you it nothing lily said a part of her was hoping for something more in return but at that moment sirius and remus clattered down the stairs and james put the scroll back in the box carefully and turned away laughing to them nothing more was said and despite the warm glow it had given lily to see james enjoy his real gift a sinking feeling was fast settling in her stomach he hadntgiven her anything not even a hug of acknowledgement he doesntconsider me a friend a n the next chapter is it the big one the winter ball and ooh the things that are planned so to honour it i decided to leave you with some teaser lines of what coming it ll be interesting to hear what you think of them dontforget to leave a review pretty please maddie sighed and shook her head honestly james i ve known you fifteen years i spent eleven of them being one of your only friends at home and yet you still think you can lie to me and i wontrealise i know the truth i can see it in your eyes she looked searchingly at sirius and shook her head sirius if you felt this strongly why didntyou do something useful about it instead of acting like you did i not the one for you i realise that emma voice had taken on a note of real panic boys where is she the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you chapter 35 the ball the icy air snapped at lily face as soon as the door swung open and she shivered wondering if she was going to come out of this with frostbite she looked around at the knee deep expanse with anticipation as the others strode out blinking against the glare shivering or in james and sirius case cracking their knuckles with glee right sirius began as he pulled his gloves on more securely i vote we go for a but lily was no longer paying attention emma had caught her eye and exchanging a few meaningful glances they both carefully grabbed a wodge of snow and backed away from each other maintaining eye contact all the way one two three smack ten seconds later james and remus were spluttering and clawing snow out of their mouths while lily and emma clung to each other and laughed until they cried at the boys expressions you little remus shouted trying to rub snow out of his eyes this means war james roared snow battle peter called excitedly teams of two fight to the death death sapphire asked skeptically but no one seemed to care despite the fact she was still laughing emma had grabbed remus hand aargh james jumped and twisted wildly as sirius snickered having dropped a handful of snow down his cloak you right i taking lily she got good aim and you will pay padfoot pete you re with us remus called wait sapphire had taken a step back that leaves me with him she pointed at sirius who was no longer laughing no i won t remus glanced from her to his friend warily sapphire but sapphire was looking mutinous and now sirius had turned away from her kicking the snow okay reshuffle james said briskly trying to break the tension lily and i will split and and you wont be going with sirius lily interrupted firmly sirius had turned back now and both he and james looked more than a little disappointed no donttry it as james opened his mouth you d be on us like bats out of hell i donttrust you two oh that rich after the little stunt you just pulled sirius shot at her but he was clearly making an effort to recover his good humour as he stuck his tongue out so that leaves james and saffy and me and sirius lily finished immediately regretting it as sirius strode over and threw his arm around her causing her to sink a few inches into the snow we re gonna win lilykins these losers ll have no chance lily staggered out of his embrace and glared hands on hips rule number one do not call me lilyk mmph a snowball hit her in the face and james burst into laughter finally found a way to silence her he bellowed let the games begin two hours later the sleek expanse of the grounds looked as though it had been hit by a tornado with snow churned up in flurries and drifts that either could or could not be hiding trees bushes rocks or people emma remus and peter had set up base near a tree and were flinging snowballs with all the accuracy of small missiles protected by a white wall sirius and lily had spent the last twenty minutes fruitlessly trying to breach this by attacking from both sides but as lily stooped for another handful there was a sudden battlecry and james leapt out of nowhere onto sirius and she promptly lost them in an explosion of snow the next minute she choked with laughter as sirius rose up a ghostly white figure only to be tripped by remus covertly placed foot as he went down again remus sat on him and emma rapidly covered him over packing the flakes tightly by the time he had emerged spitting snow furiously emma and remus had abandoned their hide out for a bush further away and lily was almost on her knees with laughter completely unaware of sapphire behind her until a handful of snow found its way into her top she shrieked straightening up but sapphire was already out of aim oof another thump hit her in the back and she turned wildly again to see james like my partner he called grinning as he dodged lily hastily made snowball she got the quietest feet i ve ever heard but lily attention was focused on the giant ball he held in his gloved hands smoothing it over james you wouldnt he raised an eyebrow and a corner of his mouth quirked oh wouldnti she dropped to the ground uselessly as his arm came up and the ball simply crumbled above her showering her and she stood up grinning only to be knocked sideways again just as james was ow argh both looked round to see emma and remus wearing identically evil grins take them down together james asked looking towards lily you bet lily said grimly brushing snow off her eyelashes and they attacked it was a while yet until the five of them had finally given up and called a truce and now they were sitting on a snow bank comfortably heating charmed by james reliving the best moments a good ten minutes in there was a group realisation that sirius and sapphire had both disappeared and after much groaning there was a mass movement to investigate their whereabouts it was james who found them first he came across a double set of tracks and pushing his way through some bushes came out near the lakeside to find sirius and sapphire flinging snowballs at each other in deadly earnest throwing an arm out to halt remus who had come up behind him he watched them sirius wearing a look of wicked amusement sapphire eyes narrowed in a grim challenge both were circling each other and james had a feeling that were they to replace snowballs with wands this would not differ that much from a full blown duel ouch sapphire and sirius stopped dead in the act of compacting powdery handfuls and looked round to see james land face first as first emma and then lily collided into his back have you found oh groaning as emma and lily got up james rolled over girls seriously eat less i think you ve cracked a rib lily raised her foot want me to break another she questioned sweetly is that a challenge james countered sitting up you really want to see who d come off best in a fight emma remus sirius peter and sapphire all simultaneously rolled their eyes and gave up beginning the trek back up to the castle meanwhile lily crossed her arms and stared down at the ruddy cheeked head boy at her feet i d be quite willing to try dontunderestimate my size you her voice was lost in a shriek as james abruptly swung an arm into the back of her knees causing her to buckle beside him as she scrabbled for a handhold he leaned forward closer and closer until he was no more than a few inches from her face which was caught halfway between a glare and a smile almost in spite of herself she stilled and stared back so close that she could see every snowflake caught in his messy hair merry christmas lily he whispered his voice rough his breath warm on her face the next moment he had brought his hand up and blown a handful of snow straight into her eyes before standing up and taking off at a dead run for the castle further up the others and indeed every other student out enjoying the weather burst into laughter as a feminine voice echoed across the grounds and a dark tall figure emerged chased by a smaller one who was lobbing snow crazily behind james potter i am going to kill you the sound of bricks moving and a door opening pulled james out of his reverie and he half ran into the heads common room bare feet and all where have you been he demanded from lily who was looking both startled and tired he stared at her vest top which was covered with smudges of colour strange purply pinks and glittery blues not to mention a whole army of reds and why the hell are you wearing that on a cold december evening have you ever been in a dormitory full of girls trying to look presentable lily retorted do you know how warm it gets she straightened her top i was helping maddie and her friends get ready her eyes rested on james properly for the first time anyway you re one to talk what happened to you she asked surveying his sweaty clothes and messier than usual hair helping set up james answered briefly but werentthe professors meant to do that this time james shrugged i was stupid enough to walk past and got roped in no enchanting just the manual labour dragging tables and trees around they only sent me off because flitwick needed space to do the final part of our decorations lily smiled shaking her head bit difficult to say which of us got the raw end of the deal isntit she looked towards her room well i should go and no james interrupted i have to stay here okay dontmove as long as you re quick saffy and emma ll be here in ten so we can get ready it was a better idea than trying to share a room with a pair of professional mirror hoggers wait here james went back to his room and pulled out a bag from under his bed coming back he hesitantly offered it to lily this is er your present i uh didntwant to give it to you in front of everyone james lily exclaimed in surprise she was so shocked that he had given her something that it was a few moments before she remembered to actually take the large parcel when she did she frowned in confusion it was big and squashy carefully she opened the bag and put her hand in to feel something crumple beneath it and then beneath that a silky material that flowed beneath her fingers like water the next moment the bag fell away as did layers of tissue paper and she found herself holding a dress lily gasped it was the dress the beautiful gown she had seen in hogsmeade and had thought unattainable and yet here it was in her hands in all its glory she looked openmouthed at the boy opposite her who was waiting nervously for some sign of approval finally her voice came back it how could you james it beautiful thank you so much james grinned but was quite unprepared when she hugged him tightly ignoring his wet t shirt gently he extracted himself as an unpleasant pang reminded him of exactly who would be getting the full benefit of the dress you d better go get ready he reminded her yeah my room untidy they ll be here soon but this it amazing how am i ever lily stopped and laughed you ve got me lost for words she smiled at him and carrying her present carefully went into her room james stood staring at the door long after it had closed behind her until a sudden sound made him turn to see emma and sapphire struggling in with a whole host of bags and boxes she in there he said quickly jerking his head in the direction of her room and retired to his own feeling inexplicably pleased a hour later the girls had reached the halfway stage lily was sitting patiently as emma tested eyeshadows on her and sapphire was perched precariously on the end of the bed waving her hands in the air so that her nail polish would dry lily this is no good emma said in exasperation turning to wipe her fingers on a towel i cantfind any colour that ll go with your dress except gold or pink and if you dontwant either of those i stuck saffy she gestured her over which looks better gold or pink sapphire stood up awkwardly and came over to study lily face gold she decided but that what i wore at halloween lily pointed out i dontwant to look identical emma threw up her hands sapphire dodged before she was smacked in the face and groaned but that all that ll go with a white dress a white lily looked confused for a moment my dress is green no it white remember you said it was the dress you wore to the costume competition the white one lily shook her head uhm yeah except i not wearing that now i must have forgotten to tell you i have another one to wear it in the blue bag in the corner emma looking bemused turned in that direction but sapphire stopped her it alright i think my nails are dry now she took the bag and opened it carefully on the bed both she and emma let out a long breath as the green satin flowed out it lovely sapphire said almost reverently picking it up with care and holding it to the light a frown creased her forehead isntthis the one you found when we were shopping in hogsmeade the one you found lily corrected her she shifted uncomfortably it was my christmas present from james she said awkwardly if anything emma eyes simply got wider your present but this must have cost a fortune i know lily squirmed even more he just told me to shut up when i said that though well sapphire said finally placing the dress carefully back down he certainly is generous yes he is emma said musingly she turned to lily well this makes the eyeshadow problem go away clean your eyes off and i ll start again silence fell for a few moments as sapphire dug through a pile of cosmetics looking rather horrified at a pair of lily muggle eyelash curlers and lily began to wipe her eyes clear emma studied the green dress lying on the bed thoughtfully for a few minutes before turning to the mirror ooh sapphire said suddenly making the other two pause and look towards her i have some gossip the harmless kind or the bitchy kind lily asked doubtfully oh it nice sapphire assured her and very unexpected you know alice myers lily and emma nodded absently alice was an unconventional ravenclaw well known for her contagious bubbly smile guess who she going to the ball with sapphire paused a moment and then as if unable to contain herself carried on frank longbottom both emma and lily simultaneously gaped at their friend no emma said shaking her head that that cantbe true they hated each other you must have misheard lily looked carefully at her friend are you sure you didnttake one snowball too many to the head she asked sapphire grinned i had it from alice herself yesterday this was unbelievable alice and frank fights were second in intensity only to lily and james and only marginally less legendary the only reason they were ever less vigorous was probably because frank was a hufflepuff and alice a ravenclaw whenever they met outside their respective houses they inevitably clashed needless to say neither were high in madam pomfrey favour she had devoted the best part of her time knowing them dealing with curses they had cast on each other and restraining them from fighting in the hospital wing emma was still looking half incredulous how on earth did it happen sapphire shrugged she wouldnttell she was sort of dazed smirking she looked back at the mirror it turns out that even if you think you hate someone there can still be chemistry between you for some reason an unaccountable blush rose in lily cheeks though she wasntentirely sure why and she turned her head missing the expressive glance that emma and sapphire directed at each other as they looked back at the green dress lying innocently on the bed well there has been a precedent emma was beginning slyly when lily hurriedly cut in saffy we still haventseen your dress have we sapphire jumped as though she had been prodded with a needle there not much to see yes there is emma declared at the rate we re going your dress has probably changed shape style and colour no it still blue get it out anyway lily insisted you haventshown it to us properly yet sapphire sighed and gingerly removed her dress from another bag it was the blue affair she had found in the shop with one off shoulder strap and the flaring diagonals of different shades of blue at the bottom oh it pretty lily gasped she measured it up against sapphire and it suits you so well thanks sapphire mumbled so why were you so secretive about buying it emma asked again she was looking thoughtful but her gaze was directed at sapphire this time oh you know i just needed to think about it hmm emma looked at the two dresses and the two girls and raised her eyebrows but said nothing as she bent to find some green eyeshadow at ten to eight sirius found himself standing outside the ravenclaw common room waiting for madhura he adjusted his collar and tapped his foot wondering how long she would be and whether there was anything to amuse him besides the statue of selene the shrewd opposite the common room entrance he tapped it carefully wondering how crazy it would sound if he started talking to it in the hope of a response and then jumped as the stone features moved giving the wizened face an indignant look behind him madhura emerged from her common room straightening her dress just in time to hear selene splutter as sirius prodded her some more you be careful with him now the statue squawked i donttrust the looks of this one sirius recovered quickly dontworry selly i ll look after her he called back cheerfully offering madhura his arm and ignoring the outraged squawk of selly behind him madhura laughed as they walked away do you do that to all immobile objects do what sirius questioned innocently she loved me i have a diploma from the university of charm laughing again madhura looked up at him you look good she said almost shyly so do you sirius returned meaning every word of it her flowing lavender gown was brushing against his arm and as she turned her head the scent of the delicate white roses curving around her bun wafted across a solitary curl hung down her face which was glowing with anticipation as they walked up to the great hall she turned back to him so have you had a good christmas so far yeah sirius said and he launched into the tale of lily james and the mistletoe fairy when he finished madhura mouth was open and this was all because of your present yep sirius said smugly he looked a little nervously at her uh why are you staring at me like that madhura closed her mouth well she said finally in an admiring tone frankly i think you deserve a nobel prize i know sirius said excitedly that what i said he frowned neither of them seemed to agree though i wonder why madhura was still smiling as they came up to ground level where students were thronging the entrance hall waiting for the ball to begin hey maddie sirius called as a dark haired girl crossed his line of vision she turned and grinned looking good siri poo she looked round at james who was coming up to them and her face fell oh james didntyou tell us it was formal she wrinkled her nose and leaned forward conspiratorially although her voice was still perfectly audible to everyone around because seriously we are well off enough to afford clothes you dontneed to go rooting around in dustbins for things like this james looked down at his spotless outfit then back at maddie i think you need glasses more than i do madhura was grinning i take it you were sirius accomplice in the mistletoe fairy plot maddie nodded smirking as james groaned padfoot who else are you going to tell before the day is over mcgonagall actually sirius said thoughtfully james grabbed him joking joking he said hastily no really that a good sirius stopped as he realized that james was gazing in a completely different direction what he began and then saw what james was staring at ahhh lily was emerging from another corridor she was wearing the beautiful green creation james had given her and which she seemed to be trying very hard to walk gracefully in her hair magically straightened fell around her face as she focused downwards watching where she put her feet when she finally looked up her cheeks were pink but she managed to smile at james just being careful not to tread on the hem she said laughing self consciously i seem to be more clumsy than usual you re telling me sapphire said coming up behind her she already fallen five times on the way from the head rooms because she was so busy making sure she wouldnttrip on her dress that she tripped over her own feet instead shut up lily said in embarrassment swatting her friend you re not supposed to expose my inadequacies to the world it only james sapphire protested dodging another swipe the glint in her eye was not missed by lily his opinion doesntmatter that much does she was cut off abruptly by lily who covered her mouth with her hand and looked back at james i apologise right now for my friend amazing lack of tact she said apparently she has an unquenchable urge to be hit round the head more later given her propensity for embarrassing me james smiled if that her mission leave her to it he gave a mock sigh besides my ego cantdecrease much further i was just advised by my little sister no less not to wear clothes that came from the dustbin no you look perfectly nice better than nice even you look really that is you look very lily was turning seven shades of red and james began to feel his own face heat up as sapphire grinned wickedly and a word he would have liked lily to use popped into his mind enough he told himself sternly opting for the marauders classic way out i look what he asked mischievously come on evans out with it heal my bruised and battered heart by telling me i look like a sex god lily blinked that was james voice but those were more like sirius words still she could only laugh as she smacked him on the arm you re incorrigible she chided grinning i thought we got rid of the arrogant pig headed jerk james made a face no unfortunately lucius malfoy still well and truly around he laughed at her expression of mingled amusement and exasperation lily the laughter left a bitter taste in james mouth as tom caught lily arms and twirled her into his own i ve been looking for you for ages and this is where you were hiding all this time he looked at james who returned his gaze mutely you look gorgeous did i tell you that taking her arm he pulled her off into the crowd leaving lily only enough time for one parting apologetic glance tuh sirius appeared at james shoulder his date madhura was talking to someone who james assumed was a friend ten to one the slimy git only just turned up and wanted to make himself look good the crowd isnt that big just leave it padfoot james muttered a wave of tiredness washed over him and he wished he was back in his own bed and that this was all over suddenly something registered in his brain hold on he said turning why d you call tom a slimy git but it was too late sirius had glided back to his partner and the next moment the doors to the great hall had opened and people flooded in james sighed as he moved forward his good mood momentarily punctured this would be a long night lily felt a surge of pride as they walked in despite the fact that she still had an eye on her dress she heard the gasps of awe and admiration issuing from the people around her and looking up she could see why twelve huge christmas trees stood majestically at the edges of the hall all festooned with myriads of decorations in blue and silver with a real fairy perched at the top of each glowing many circular tables were arranged and candlelight gave the hall a soft ambience the real piece de resistance was the wall opposite the doors however as the doors were situated on the longer walls the wall opposite them seemed to dominate the room it caught the eye and held it steadfastly the normal stone had been transfigured into a giant pane of glass and behind it was a giant aquarium literally taking up the whole wall complete with rocks sea plants and azure blue water that sparkled alluringly fish both solitary and in shoals swam about inside of all shapes sizes and colours it cast a watery blue light across the room which added much to the atmosphere it amazing tom said in her ear his eyes wide how d you do it lily tapped the side of her nose mysteriously secret she said she doubted anyone would realize that it was all an elaborate network of charms played by professor flitwick when she and james and come up with the idea they had not wanted to share it in case it didntwork out professor mcgonagall had been skeptical to say the least but flitwick had been willing and even eager to take on the challenge of an afternoon of weaving complex and intricate charms together the result lily thought had done them all proud and she looked around for james wanted to share the feeling of achievement with him but he was nowhere to be found tom found a table and they sat down joined soon after by sirius and madhura and then remus and emma sapphire made her way over and sat down carefully as she did something odd happened sirius looked up sharply as she sat down cast his eye over her person and raised his eyebrows lily watching discreetly saw him shoot a look at her that was half challenging half suggestive before turning back to his conversation with madhura sapphire blushed angrily well aware that lily was now looking quizzically between the two of them if madhura had noticed she gave no sign of it in her welcoming smile to sapphire although she was watching sirius with a rather discerning eye as she talked sapphire blushed even more as she thought of what everyone must be thinking honestly she thought furiously the fact that i wearing the dress you said looked good means nothing keep your eyes on your date she settled herself with rather less presence of mind than usual there was only one space left open at the table beside lily peter had gone off to sit with his date a cheerful curly haired ravenclaw she looked around where was james almost simultaneously sirius looked around where prongs he asked he twisted to look behind him oi james over here lily searched the crowd with her eyes until she saw him seeming to look around as sirius called again he saw them and started in their direction lily decided enough was enough james get yourself over here before i make you she called instead of speeding up however james seemed to stop for a millisecond as his eyes passed over her before walking over what is it with that boy sirius said impatiently prongs he addressed himself directly to his friend as he sat down were you planning to get here by next christmas because if so you were going the right way about it james shook his head looking oddly reticent as everyone turned to him just a little disoriented he said vaguely he shrugged before allowing a more neutral and cheerful expression to spread over his face as he joined in a conversation with sapphire and remus lily nudged him as the doors slid slowly closed and dumbledore stood up we did a good job she whispered the place looks great james grinned well with me helping you why wouldntit be great he muttered back lily elbowed him in the ribs making him start that for being an arrogant jerk she said sweetly before elbowing him again and that for being an arrogant jerk with good taste and the ability to decorate james rolled his eyes and opened his mouth but just then tom recaptured her attention with a quick kiss on the neck it was amazing how his shyness seemed to have flown out of the window so to speak lily he whispered but was cut off by professor dumbledore beginning to speak welcome students to the winter ball he said opening his arms wide in an expansive gesture i am sure you will all have an enjoyable time tonight and wish you all a very merry christmas as much as i am tempted to it would be impossible to take credit for these magnificent decorations the feast which i am sure will be sumptuous and your entertainment later on for that we must thank our head boy and girl james potter and lily evans james and lily smiled politely as people applauded them the professors who gave up their time to help and advise and of course those students who were ah shall we say forcefully persuaded into giving opinions or hard labour you all contributed to the success of this event which i am sure will be memorable for many he paused to allow the applause to die away and now on a different note i would like to inform you all that spiking drinks is highly inadvisable considering the fact that i am sure you will be hunted down by irate heads of house later on a certain group of boys in gryffindor seventh year would do well to remember that he added his eyes twinkling at james sirius and remus whose faces were arranged into such pictures of virtuous innocence that lily along with everyone else had to laugh that said enjoy your evening he sat down and almost immediately food appeared on the plates in front of them dinner was an enjoyable affair lily squashed between james and tom dug into her food with as much eagerness as everyone else and a babble of chatter arose in between arguing with james about whether angelfish were white or yellow and carrying on an ongoing conversation with emma over what people were wearing it was rather surprising how quickly the plates cleared and lily soon found that the candles were dimming until the entire hall was bathed in the watery blue glow from the aquarium wall three wizards walked out onto a raised platform in one corner their clothes artfully arranged to show off just enough skin to drive girls wild let give a warm welcome to spirit 101 daniel jordan announced and the band smirked as girls erupted into squeals clapping their hands more than one boy looked as though he had just bitten into a lemon sirius was the first up as the beginning chords sounded would you give me the honour mademoiselle he asked offering his hand madhura accepted gracefully and they were soon lost among the twirling couples peter and remus soon followed suit with their dates and tom seeing his opportunity broke up lily and james argument still over angelfish to drag her up onto the dancefloor although initially frustrated that she hadntbeen able to finish her conversation lily soon lost any feeling of mild annoyance as tom twirled her onto the dancefloor they began to sway in time to the music and she smiled up at him he looked so cleancut and tidy with his neat hair and warm smile no quirked eyebrows or mischievous smirks here she told herself dreamily and all the better for her that there weren t you look so nice tonight she murmured into his ear tom smiled even more brilliantly i could return the compliment a thousand times over he replied your dress is lovely too even if it does bear no comparison to your own beauty tom lily scolded half flattered by his praise and half exasperated by its textbook ish tones where did you get it from i no fashion connoisseur but even i can tell it must have cost an awful lot lily bit her lip knowing she was treading thin ice it was a christmas present from a good friend tom raised his eyebrows very good friend indeed he bowed to her as the song ended and they drew apart a little as a faster song struck up meanwhile james and sapphire were both sitting at their table feeling excessively bored try as he might james could not tear his eyes away from lily for more than a few minutes she looked entrancing especially as the dress swished around her james if you look in that direction much longer your eyes will pop out sapphire said jokingly james turned around his neck slightly red ha ha he stuck his tongue out at her and sapphire responded in kind before seeing his eyes drift longingly back to lily you really do like her dontyou she asked softly james you ve been friends for a while now why have you never told her james turned back i he began and then stopped the song was drawing to a close and as a new one began he injected more enthusiasm into his tone you know what this is our last ball neither of us have dates and we both look like complete losers sitting here he held out his hand want to dance lily smiled as she saw james lead sapphire to the dancefloor and tom noticed the sparkle in her eyes what he asked teasingly sapphire and james are dancing she answered swinging him round as they moved so that he had a clearer view oh i so proud of him tom laughed what he done overcome a life long phobia of dancing nothing just haventyou noticed what an odd mood he been in tonight she felt a grin tug at her lips as she saw james invent evermore exuberant dance moves to make sapphire laugh emma and remus were watching in amusement from the other side as was madhura only sirius seemed to be wearing a grin that didntquite reach his eyes as he watched his best friend fool around when she turned back to tom however lily was surprised to find him looking suddenly serious his eyes were brooding even as he smiled at her again and as the song ended he asked if they could come off the dance floor for a while so he could get his breath back lily reluctantly assented and they made their way to a table in the back corner where tom quickly got involved in a conversation about quidditch with a couple of hufflepuffs eventually growing tired of the continual talk of player statistics lily excused herself to find a drink and wandered back across the hall sirius twirled madhura absent mindedly flashing her a smile whenever she looked at him his eyes were more busily occupied scanning the dancefloor and the people on it but when that yielded no results he turned his gaze onto the dinner tables he caught sight of lily and emma standing with remus near the drinks table but it wasntuntil he looked back at the table where they had originally been sitting that he finally spotted a tell tale flash of blue there she was watching the dancers dispiritedly and looking unaffectedly bored without thinking as they reached a corner sirius guided himself and madhura back to the centre where he had a clearer view and he could not stop himself looking continually around as a hufflepuff seventh year approached her a few moments later the hufflepuff walked away having apparently been refused and sirius fought to control his attention and focus it on he was doing it had no effect he was still moving mechanically still following an automatic pattern of moves the charms of a red dress had all but disappeared and been replayed by the far more beautiful promise of blue sirius sirius with another supreme effort sirius dragged himself back to the present to find madhura giving him a searching gaze her eyes followed his as he glanced involuntarily back at the table and the look she gave him as he turned back told him quite clearly that he had been discovered you are a complete prat sirius you know that she said softly and sirius felt an uncharacteristic stab of guilt i must be getting soft he thought uncomfortably madhura shook her head and rotated them round so that they remained in time with the music i not the one for you i realize that she said simply and i d have to be deaf and blind not to work out who you are set on much less not to hear the rumours and gossip going round though i didntbelieve any of that until i saw it for my own eyes sirius shifted awkwardly again but madhura continued on her dark eyes fixed on his face as they moved on auto pilot i dontknow whether anyone told you this sirius but the opposite of love isnthate it indifference now sapphire may not show much liking towards you but she certainly isntindifferent to you she led him off the dancefloor almost before he knew what she was doing and gave him a little push so go talk to her sirius looked at sapphire then back at madhura she not going to respond he muttered you have nothing to lose except your self esteem and god knows you have enough of that madhura gave him another push go on and dontget all chivalrous about me i ll be fine i have friends around how can i sirius started but madhura cut him off laughing you can t so dontbother with polite speeches but sirius had had a better idea taking her wrist he pulled her over to a tall ravenclaw who was sitting on his own at another table listen arjun i dontreally feel like dancing tonight but i dontwant madhura to miss out would you do me a favour and take my place thanks the blush that suffused madhura face as arjun led her back towards the dancefloor and the gratified yet amused look she shot over her shoulder at sirius was enough to make him feel that he had done the right thing at least once tonight and he began to edge his way round people and furniture to the other side of the hall it was tricky going the part of the hall that had been used for dining was now lit only by the blue glow of the aquarium wall which cast a soft watery ambience over the area a few girls smiled coquettishly and hopefully at him but he flashed them only a split second grin as he threaded through his eyes fixed on sapphire she hadntmoved more than a few inches from her position and her eyes were flickering lazily over the people around her he shoved past a pair of fourth years who were hovering awkwardly in the corridor one of them with their eyes glued longingly to a blond haired girl sitting by herself nearby sirius rolled his eyes at the inefficiency of teenagers conveniently forgetting that he himself belonged to the aforementioned group he was almost past them when he caught his leg on the corner of the table and staggered jarring his other left painfully and causing him to emit a loud yelp he righted himself grinned apologetically at everyone nearby who was staring and turned round rubbing his leg almost immediately his eyes met sapphire s bugger she saw me her eyes were wide as she surveyed him she swiveled back to the dancefloor presumably looking for madhura and when she saw her dancing with arjun turned back to sirius there was a glaring question in her eyes as she lowered them and turned back to the direction she had been facing that she was very aware of his presence however was evident in the way that she kept darting sidelong glances at him which increased in frequency as he drew nearer he was only two tables away when she suddenly got up and hurried away in the opposite direction sirius cursed as he watched her go he had been close and he had scared her off sitting down heavily in the seat next to the one she had just vacated he watched as she made her way over to where lily and emma were standing with as much haste as her dress would allow sapphire meanwhile was both congratulating herself on her quick escape and trying to calm herself as she approached the others breathe in breathe out hey guys she said reaching her friends hey yourself lily answered cheerfully what brings you over you seemed pretty comfortable over there yeah i was until about thirty seconds ago clearly lily hadntseen the person now sitting there uhm yeah i just wanted to stretch my legs everyone nodded and sapphire relaxed as they fell back into normal conversation she dusted herself off and looking down cursed the fact that she had had to buy this dress the one that sirius had complimented he would probably be reading all sorts of implications into this fact that it was this particular one she just wished she could manage to be near him long enough to heartily contradict every one really if you thought about it everything that was wrong was due to sirius if he hadntsaid anything she would have felt no compunction about having to buy this dress and wouldnthave had to sneak back to the shop while everyone else was at the three broomsticks so that she could buy it on her own with no comment because she hadntfound anything else as good this was she decided all sirius fault damn him not to mention that it was his fault for saying such ridiculous things she wished life could just go back to normal with both of them hating each other it made things so much easier shaking her head slightly sapphire attempted to look interested in the heated discussion going on between remus and lily over the efficacy of bezoars in some potion or other before long however she felt a hot prickling sensation on the back of her neck and twisting her head slowly she looked round to see sirius watching her from the table where she had sat feeling as though she was caught in a spotlight she turned hastily round and knocked into lily well of course lacewings wouldnthave that much effect if you only use what on earth lily turned to sapphire are you okay yeah sapphire said mentally cursing her own clumsiness she resolved to keep her gaze firmly fixed on the wall in front but less than a minute later she had turned around again in spite of herself sirius was still watching and as her eyes fell on him he raised his eyebrows meaningfully sapphire swivelled back hurriedly only to find lily looking at her penetratingly what she asked weakly and unconvincingly to her horror lily turned and looked in the same direction and from the twist of her mouth sapphire guessed she had seen the person sitting there so that what this was about was it she asked looking back to sapphire who mumbled something incomprehensible lily looked back at sirius a challenging expression in her eyes well if that how it going to be she placed her hands on sapphire shoulders startling her and swung her around completely to face sirius sapphire let out an inarticulate sound of shock and embarrassment and to her surprise lily saw a blush creep up her cheeks sirius had sat up slightly his eyes travelling over her it wouldntkill you to talk to him emma said she met lily eyes behind sapphire back and lily saw the glint of laughter in her face i wouldntbe so sure sapphire muttered to lily and emma surprise she began to blush even more violently as sirius continued to gaze and she stumbled away i need air she mumbled and she walked off placing a hand against her burning forehead she acting surprisingly lovesick lily commented watching her go funny when she doesnteven like him much emma said thoughtfully she doesntusually act this oddly around him she paused and i d give quite a lot to find out why he been giving her meaningful glances all night and she been avoiding his eye as a new song struck up emma perked up i love this song she announced well then remus grinned and exaggeratedly twirled her out of her chair emma laughing as he gave her a mock bow i live to serve my lady he tugged her hand almost making her tumble over especially if it means i have to spin you around and whisper things in your ear that would make our dear head girl blush to hear shut up you emma scolded even as she laughed if you trip on my dress and rip it i ll be waking up in azkaban for the murder of one remus lupin she was about to follow him to the dancefloor when she stopped and turned oh lily i cantleave will you be okay on your own lily flapped her away with her hands go she said smiling i fine emma cast her one last look before remus pulled her into the throng of people and lily sat on one of the tables behind her pulling her feet up onto a chair and shifting the tablecloth beneath her turning around she could still see tom in the other corner now deep in discussion with serena callie and a few boys who she assumed were their dates although it would probably look better than sitting alone lily couldntbe bothered to pick herself up and go to join them she couldntspot james but sirius was sitting slouched at a table not far from tom and his friends on the opposite side in the back corner alone that was not like him usually he would be in the thick of things chatting up five or six girls at once lily reflected and she wondered absently where sapphire was and what on earth was james doing james was in fact in the hall he had retreated to a table alone in the shadows at the back almost directly in line with lily s which would explain why she couldntsee him several had asked him to dance but he had turned them all down suddenly finding himself not in the mood to be among people he was so caught up in his train of thought that he didntrealize he was being called james huh james snapped out of his reverie and turned his head he relaxed smiling as he saw who it was alright maddie how many guys am i going to have to beat up tonight for daring to so much as look at my baby sister ha ha very funny maddie said scathingly adjusting her dress as she sat down beside him besides my sociableness is simply making up for your lack of it she scrutinized him closely even as he turned his head back to what he had been looking at before you re not usually one to sit in a corner when there are girls to flirt with and drinks to spike what gives she had no response james wha what james swivelled back to see maddie looking inquisitively at him oh yeah uh what was the question again maddie however was following the direction his eyes were being drawn to you really like her dontyou she said softly turning back to look at james who donttry that one on me you know who i mean lily you really do like her a lot james swallowed his throat had suddenly got dry what well yeah of course be a bit hard to work with her otherwise maddie sighed and shook her head honestly james i ve known you all of my fifteen years i spent eleven of them being your only friend at home and yet you still think you can lie to me and i wontrealise i know the truth i can see it in your face then why re you asking james snapped it came out harsher than he d intended and he grimaced meaning to apologise but maddie waved him off just go and ask her to dance she said bluntly she sitting on her own most likely bored out of her mind you d be doing her a favour and it might get you out of this mope you re in and as for the rest give her time she ll see eventually her advice was almost more than james could bear from someone who was three years younger and yet three times more capable of handling his personal life than he was but he sighed and stood up you know if there was an olympic event for assuming things you would take bronze silver and gold hands down but i ll go if only to shut you up maddie grinned and stood up as well well now that i ve sorted you out i off to deal with your best friend she gestured at the table on the other side where sirius was sitting he in a mood too or else my name not madeleine potter she rolled her eyes honestly if one of you goes down the other does too do you have to do everything together james laughed affectionately as she walked off he was curious and more than a little worried about what was plaguing sirius but knew that he was in such a bleak mood himself that he d probably only depress his friend further and induce suicidal thoughts for all he knew much better to let maddie go over and work her bouncy magic besides if he was honest his own problems were a lot more absorbing at the moment lily left sitting on the table on her own sighed if she was honest with herself this was not the way she had envisioned spending her evening emma and remus were dancing james was nowhere to be seen sapphire was somewhere outside and tom who had spent the past half hour talking to other quidditch minded people had just mimed going to the toilet and left sirius too had disappeared and she felt like a complete twit sitting alone just then a shadow fell across her and she looked up to see james himself trying to suppress an immediate smile of relief she moved over and james leaned onto the table beside her hands in his pockets they sat in silence for a few moments before james spoke you know lily i think it official this ball is a roaring success lily smiled i think everyone else would agree yes there was a pause and then james looked around everyone else what about you his perception caught lily off guard no i just meant well obviously i think we ve done ourselves proud with this she nudged him with her shoulder it was a pleasure working with you james james raised an eyebrow you ve still got six months of it to go come back and say the same thing in june and i ll be shocked lily laughed absently and watched maddie pull a boy to the dancefloor giggling where she abruptly said something to him and pushed him towards another girl your sister playing matchmaker a lot today she in her element for some reason james rolled his eyes and paused yeah she good at that he shook himself and stood up where re you going lily asked quickly unable to keep a tinge of disappointment out of her voice it had been so nice having some company james hesitated to dance with you he held out a hand if you ll say yes lily was only too happy meanwhile sapphire hovering in the shadows at the door was gazing cautiously around the hall to assess her chances of running into a certain individual he was nowhere immediately visible so she judged it safe to slowly walk into the hall she hurried across as fast as she could trying to avoid notice and inwardly cursing sirius for causing her to act like a fugitive taking a butterbeer she exhaled loudly as she leaned back against the table her eyes still darting nervously around there was no clear sign of his tall form but still there were plenty of shadowy corners where he could be hiding out she sipped again james and lily were talking together quietly a little way away and she wondered absently where tom was as she watched them smiling to herself she doubted that anybody but lily could be blind to the challenging glances passing between him and james and considering the glow on lily face just now it seemed like there was good reason for tom to be wary of his competition looking back at the tables she spotted an empty one where she would be less exposed than up here and so slowly headed towards it where she sank down feeling sure that she would either go to azkaban for the murder of sirius black or be hospitalised for a stress hernia fifteen minutes later sapphire let herself relax as she leaned her elbow on the table and rested her chin on her hand there was still no sign of sirius thank heavens remus and emma were just visible in one corner dancing together they hadntleft each other side for more than a few minutes all night sapphire thought smiling absently her eyes fell on another pair and she stiffened her mouth breaking into a wide grin oh how wonderful she murmured watching lily laugh as james said something in her ear this is perfect about time isntit said a voice behind her and sapphire elbow slipped off the table as she whipped round to see sirius sitting behind her his eyes also on lily and james black she ground out and made to get up from her chair sirius however was too quick for her his hand shot out and grasped her wrist firmly pulling her back down into her seat oh no he growled you ve been pulling this on me all night without even knowing what i want and what do you want sapphire said mutinously a quick snog and fumble in the gardens because if so you re barking up the wrong i want to talk sirius said he eyed her and the fight seemed to drain out of him just one conversation one proper conversation that all i asking for if only to pry her arm out of his hand and regain her circulation sapphire nodded reluctantly he loosened his grip and took a deep breath right so well first i just need to apologise no wait he held up a hand as sapphire opened her mouth i ve been treating you horribly for a while now and even though it wontchange much i want to say sorry for that i dont i not most girls donttake much to win over for me and the only exceptions to that rule are lily because she saw through us all from day one and emma because she only ever had eyes for remus and then you turned up and were a bit of well you were a bit of a shock to the system and i sorry for the way i reacted sapphire was staring at him so hard that he had to fight the urge to look away but eventually she spoke well i dontquite know if i ready to to forgive you yet but i ll try not to hold it against you sirius let out a breath it a start he paused second thing look i know this is going to sound absolutely unbelievable but i do really i mean i think you re he stopped floundering in his effort to form a coherent sentence spit it out sapphire said impatiently i look this is hard sirius retorted i not someone who does this on a regular basis what i trying to say is whatever i may have done or said to the contrary i do really like you and even though i guessing you d throw something at me if i asked you out i was hoping maybe we could call a truce just be friends sapphire regarded him for a long moment and why would i do that she asked slowly because sirius said unnerved by her gaze even if i a prat i a good hearted prat ask james and though it was my mistake i think it would be a very good idea to start making up for lost time sapphire continued to look at him for a long moment and then finally held her hand out truce sirius took it marvelling at how smooth and cold it was and they shook solemnly a minute later they had both broken into awkward laughs more borne out of nervousness than anything else sapphire shifted uncomfortably in her chair not quite able to grasp the idea of a friendly sirius and sirius was toying with his cufflinks for much the same reason so sirius said in a conversational tone i might as well throw us in at the deep end straight off sapphire looked at him curiously why are you sitting here alone instead of dancing up there with a date sapphire raised her eyebrows er because as you full well know i donthave a date well it not for lack of asking is it how many times did leon wilkes ask you before he got the hint twelve fourteen sapphire sighed heavily sirius smirked then sobered up okay so i wouldntblame you for saying no to him but what happened to everyone else i happen to know from my extensive spy network that several guys asked you who even i wouldnthave been ashamed to be seen with if i swung that way that is he added hastily as sapphire turned her laugh into a hacking cough so what was wrong with all of them sapphire shrugged dontknow just wasntinterested sirius studied her intently you know what i going to ask a question which practically earned me a slap the last time i voiced it so bear in mind that if you do it again it ll be your fault for having ruined what could ve been the beginning of a beautiful new friendship he was smiling but there was something in his eyes which told sapphire he was quite serious go on then hit me with it how long has it been since you had a boyfriend the words were softly spoken but they struck a chord and sapphire felt herself flush the implied intimacy of the question irked her but a niggling voice at the back of her head was quietly murmuring that even if she told the truth the boy sitting opposite her would not use the information against her she turned to look at the aquarium wall heathleigh he was leaning forward slightly now waiting for her answers and his eyes emerged from their shadows as he altered his position silently sapphire sighed she might as well say it i dont i ve never had one she said grudgingly flashing her eyes up at him daring him to taunt her instead he merely leaned back i know sapphire stared at him so what was the point in asking it strange enough that we re being friendly black without you probing into my personal life and then telling me you have it all on record anyway sirius held up a hand to placate her what i ve always been curious about he said calmly in a low voice is why you ve not got involved with anyone for all this time sapphire eyes when she finally processed his words were both angry and incredulous how can you she sputtered indignantly making to rise before sirius pulled her firmly back down it just a question well it more than a little impertinent dontyou think sirius shrugged you know that practically my middle name sapphire rolled her eyes in spite of herself i should have known not to expect anything more from you she muttered absently watching serena swan out of the hall smirking as she pulled a brown haired boy behind her that not fair sirius protested you re assuming things i he stopped suddenly his eyes on the crowd in front of them and a frown creased his handsome face sapphire startled by his sudden silence turned round to see him gazing into the middle distance looking both thoughtful and disturbed what wrong she asked unsettled sirius looked at her briefly as if surprised to see her there but then stood up looking unconvinced but determined i sorry excuse me for a moment he abruptly walked off sapphire watched his retreating figure oh what have i agreed to she muttered before getting up irritation and heading off for a drink remus spun emma around as the song came to an end and they laughed mock bowing to each other this is turning out to be one of the best nights i ve ever known emma murmured as a slower song started up and she moved closer she felt remus smile into her hair true if i d know this could happen i d have dropped a pumpkin on your head years ago emma laughed and swatted him as they swayed dontpush your luck the only reason i even let that go was because because i such a charming and amazing person not to mention being heart stoppingly good looking no actually i dontknow why i ever let that go remind me to be angry at you later yes ma am they carried on dancing for a few songs enjoying each other company when remus noticed something very odd sirius was standing on the edge of the dancefloor bouncing up and down apparently trying to catch his attention as remus looked at him fully he brushed his nose three times and blinked very slowly and obviously urgent i ll explain later remus raised his eyebrows at him just as emma caught sight of his friend what does he want she asked remus swung them around so that her back was to sirius nothing he replied smoothly well he paused other than maybe a lifetime supply of chocolate and sapphire emma burst into giggles and swatted him he still trying to catch your attention you know she said as they turned again remus looked up frowning and sure enough sirius was still there staring fixedly at him the song ended and remus sighed i d better go see what he wants he said tiredly i sorry em excuse me emma watched him make his way over and rolled her eyes in amusement as he was practically dragged out of the hall sirius talking furiously all the while meanwhile although the song had ended by mutual silent consent lily and james remained on the dancefloor the pleasant haze of music and conversation was only broken when james looked over lily shoulder to see sirius and remus both standing on the edge of the dancefloor signalling at him both looking most impatient for a moment he opened his mouth about to make his excuses to lily and then shut it again damn it he thought i not going to get to finish this dance any other time blankly shaking his head at his friends he carried on with lily what wrong lily asked as he found his gaze once more attracted to where sirius and remus were standing and gesturing she turned her head and they froze mid gesticulation before shooting equally unconvincing and toothy grins at her lily looked back at james you sure you dontwant to go see what they want she asked her tone quietly amused nah james answered easily i know they feel worthless without me but it more fun here he winked at her making her laugh and frowned at remus and sirius both of whom looked disgusted with him as they realised he had no intention of moving as the tune ended james felt a pang of conscience as they left the mass of couples i really sorry lily he said i should go find out what they wanted lily shook her head and laughed i was quite impressed you didntleave me mid step to be honest she waved her hand go feeling slightly bolstered by the fact that he seemed to have made the right choice with regards to her at least james walked off and lily watched him weave his way between the tables only to be accosted halfway by callie who started talking brightly at him james was answering politely enough but what callie was clearly after judging by her repetitive hair flicks was a dance lily thought or she was no judge of girls feeling a strange sort of mean pleasure in the fact that calling was wanting so badly something that james had given her for free lily surveyed the rest of the hall and felt a sudden twinge of annoyance where was tom he d completely disappeared in fact she couldnteven remember the last time she d seen him the group he d been talking to had dispersed and she could see neither hide nor hair of him clicking her tongue in irritation she decided it was best to go and find him rather than continue sitting and accordingly slid off the table and began making her way around the crumpled napkins and knocked over goblets that littered the floor across in a corner she spotted emma and sapphire emma looking rather alone without remus and waved at them as she continued round it was when she reached the doors thinking vaguely of asking someone to check the boys toilet as she looked longingly back at the dancefloor that she ran into sirius and remus almost literally both looked rather flustered and uncomfortable and she noted with some surprise that there was snow in their hair boys where have you she started no never mind i donteven want to know but uh james is looking for y lily we need you to come with us remus said stepping forward and taking her arm lily blinked in confusion at the solemnity of his tone what going on she questioned looking from him to sirius who also looked uncommonly serious the boys exchanged an awkward look and then sirius spoken in a tone that could almost have been called gentle we you re not going to like this lily but you need to we canthide this come on he seized her arm as well and lily found herself being pulled unceremoniously out of the hall where are we going she demanded and where james who cares said remus impatiently lily come on but what going on why wontyou tell are we going outside she cried as they neared the huge doors my i ve got bare arms my shoes i ll freeze i think that ll be the least of your worries sirius muttered wryly he and remus escorted lily out into the moonlit gardens ignoring her protests and through clumps of twinkling snow laden rosebushes their dark green leaves shaded to black once finally through they stopped over there lily remus said pointing his voice tinged with regret he pushed her and she took a few steps forward her arms wrapped tightly around her body in an effort to stay warm a pair of figures materialised gradually in the half dark embracing closely it took only a heartbeat for lily to realise who they were tom serena she let out a gasp of pure shock and stared unable to turn her gaze away as tom raised his head at the sound and stared straight back at her he swore as he realised who it was and started towards her but lily had already turned her back on him and was marching back the castle as fast as her numbed mind and shaking legs would permit her she was just past the doors of the great hall through which the sounds of music and whooping still echoed when a hand closed on her arm and she whirled around to see tom standing there lily please he began the numbness left her to be replaced with a wave of fury and disgust that she had not thought it possible to feel so strongly dontyou dare touch me she hissed yanking her arm away violently tom stepped back his brown eyes almost hurt lily he started again this isntwhat it looks like really lily shot back her voice sharp enough to cut diamond because i think it exactly what it looks like no lil it not she made me dontcall me lil they stopped and stared at each other lily actually shaking from sheer contempt and anger as well as the icy breeze that billowed through the still open castle doors how could she not have seen what had she missed please let just sort this out and talk it through the raised voices were beginning to attract attention and a small crowd was gathering all of whom watched wide eyed as lily let out a noise which was almost a snarl of exasperation i dontknow how stupid you want to look but let me make it crystal clear sorting things out doesntwork so well after you ve fastened lips with another girl and that looked like you were enjoying it quite a lot right now you re feeding me lines so you can carry on the act and jerk off which i guess is fitting given that right now you re the biggest jerk i ve ever met tom was shaking his head lil y it wasntmeant to be like this please oh lily questioned her tone unmistakably sarcastic so who was i supposed to walk in on you snogging callie and was it meant to be in the common room so i wouldntget too cold while i watched tom face suddenly hardened donttry and act as if you re as pure as the driven snow lily evans everyone knows how much time you spend with james potter donttell me that all the stories are false i ve been ignoring them or trying to lily stared in amazement what stories she began before her eyes fell on james himself he had pushed his way to the front of the crowd cheeks flushed tie askew hair messier than usual but his face registered complete shock as tom words resounded a bolt shot through her as she remembered his words from so long ago maybe i should warn you lily tom isntperfect it just he tends to uh be one of those people that listen to rumours and take them seriously with a sickened feeling she looked across to see serena smirking at her realisation set in and she gritted her teeth for a moment we are the head students she said in a low and controlled voice it our job to work together he been nothing but a good friend to me and she broke off and glanced at james again i dontneed to explain myself to you tom she glared at him i was more of a fool to believe you than you were to believe stories about me mustering as much dignity as she could she turned on her heel and walked off tom swivelled to face the rest of the crowd what re you looking at he barked in obedience to his baleful stare the students began to retreat all muttering about the shouting match lily evans the head girl had just had james turned with the rest of them and returned to the ball scanning the room for emma and sapphire who he was sure would want to be informed of these new developments stopping just inside the doors he surveyed the space filled with twirling couples and the clusters of students talking in huddles finally he saw a flash of red in a corner by the aquarium wall and on advancing spotted emma remus and sapphire hey ja emma started before james cut in lily broke up with tom what what both girls spoke in unison just now in the entrance hall i think he might have been cheating on her where is she now sapphire demanded james shrugged she walked off not in here though you d better go comfort her do the girl thing right emma turned to remus sorry do you mind if i remus shook his head gesturing her off and the two girls with james in their stead turned to the entrance hall just as they approached the stairs sirius came down them he turned a keen gaze on them is lily not with you he asked no emma said slowly ah sirius glanced at james quickly and meaningfully unfortunately emma caught it her voice took on a note of real panic boys where is she a n finally hope the length made up for the insane delay in getting it up since this first started and thank you for all the positive reviews i ve had both from new reviewers and ones who remember me from way back also apologies for the broken up style it quite difficult to keep multiple storylines running together when important things are happening in different places next chapter up soonish hopefully the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you the two girls with james in their stead hurried to the entrance hall just as they approached the stairs sirius came down them he turned a keen gaze on them is lily not with you he asked no emma said slowly ah sirius glanced at james quickly unfortunately emma caught it her voice took on a note of real panic boys where is she chapter 36 repercussions well she not in the common room i just checked sirius said but he added hastily that still leaves a lot of places she could be sapphire was looking at sirius a little strangely you actually went up to the common room yes sirius retorted defensively you may not think so sapphire but i do care about lily as a friend i not completely heartless could have fooled me sapphire muttered under her breath but she looked remorseful a moment later as sirius turned an unreadable gaze on her hold on james held up a hand you were there i was in the doorway sirius laughed a little bitterly and i was the one who saw tom and serena in the first place the only reason i got remus to tell her to go was because i didntthink she d take me seriously why are you being so calm about this emma demanded sirius shrugged i ve had my suspicions about them for a while now so why didntyou say anything emma wailed i did james said dully she wouldntbelieve me thought i was jealous and told me to mind my own business you knew too emma cried turning to him look sirius interjected sharply while you sit here playing twenty questions with james and me we still dontknow where lily is good point emma face changed from indignant to worried what everyone so panicked about it for sapphire questioned i mean the worst she can be doing is crying right maybe i should clarify emma said quickly last time lily got into a really bad state she made a voodoo doll stuck it full of pins burned the clothes in the fire and nearly fell out of a fourth floor window trying to throw it into the lake sapphire paled okay i ll go check the girls dormitories you wouldnthave got up there or would you she walked quickly up the stairs brushing past sirius who only then realised she had actually joked with him his mouth quirked as he came down to ground level emma turned i ll have a look around too she and remus disappeared james turned to sirius remembering his glance what really going on sirius looked uncomfortable she not on the marauder map he said finally james swore are you sure sirius pulled a tattered piece of parchment out of his pocket and james scrutinised it rapidly where on earth is she he said his nose barely a few inches from its surface as he checked it again she cantknow about the secret passages to get to hogsmeade so then and i hardly think she one to go drink her sorrows away sirius joked weakly his eyes suddenly lit up oh i still have that firewhiskey stashed really not the time right now james cut across him he rubbed his forehead i dunno the map shows everywhere in the castle if she not on it then she not he and sirius stared bleakly at each other both racking their minds the torches lighting the corridor shivered as another gust of wind blew in through the open doors and james noticing this went to heave them shut you seen lily anywhere the oh so familiar tones had james spinning on his heel to see none other than tom addressing sirius i wouldntbe telling you even if i had sirius face hardened haventyou done enough damage here jacobs i haventdone i need to talk to her tom said defiantly make her see reason she didntsee what she thought she saw sirius lip curled mate i saw what she thought she saw it was pretty convincing james came up beside him and tom gave him a glance of contempt this is between me and her black if you dontknow where she is fine forget it jacobs leave her alone both boys spoke at once and tom face creased into an ugly and uncharacteristic sneer i knew about potter and his little obsession he said snidely but i didntknow you were sweet on her too black amazing how such a stuck up little prude can have us all hanging after her sirius lunged at tom and james only just managed to haul him back by the sleeve of his jacket despite wishing that he could let him go at least she got principles and some decency he spat trying to shake james off more than can be said for you tom who had stepped back in some alarm gave them both scornful looks get away james said through gritted teeth just leave us tom opened his mouth again but at another lunge from sirius seemed to think better of it and walked off why d you stop me sirius hissed yanking his arm away from james and glaring how could you let him say that that filth james rubbed his eyes tiredly i can t he said but slugging him one in the face wontachieve anything helpful it just a waste of time let just find lily sirius still glowering mutinously shrugged and they both started walking but had got no more than a few steps before they were accosted by another unwelcome passer by none other than severus snape he emerged from a side twisting his hands together his ball attire looking entirely too much like his usual bat like robes what do you want snivellus sirius said narrowing his eyes one hand already on his wand snape stare at them both for a couple of seconds out of his fathomless black eyes the firelight reflecting unfavourably off his hair is it true he said at last that that boy jacobs and lily evans have broken up what it to you you greasy git sirius snapped snape bridled at the tone but james shook his head he seemed to have lost the energy to attack leave it padfoot he said in a low voice and then louder what does it matter is she alright he asked still in that new low tone of ambiguity what does it matter to you sirius questioned again his face ugly i was just curious snape responded in his usual smooth tones there is much talk in the hall his face curled into a customary sneer but i sure she ll be fine with two such chivalrous pet dogs defending her honour you for the second time in ten minutes james had to haul sirius back as he lunged this time for his wand just get away sna snivellus he shot through gritted teeth get back to the ball snape looked supremely unconcerned at the fact that james was still hanging onto sirius arm to stop him reaching his wand very well it might interest you to know black that they are running the costume contest final now and that you are supposed to be in it let the head students look after each other he turned and walked coolly off james let go of sirius arm and sirius massaged it glaring furiously the nerve of him who is he how did he have the nerve to come up to us i should have just hexed him into next week james however was staring into space head students he murmured padfoot she in the heads common room he smacked himself on the forehead it the only place in hogwarts we wouldnthave put on the map because we never knew it existed sirius gaped at him you sure james shrugged dunno but its my best guess well go on then check you re the only one who can get in mate without waiting any longer james took off at a run towards the common room by the time james had reached the corridor with the doorway to the heads quarters he was beginning to pant and wrestled impatiently with his tie as he gave the password oculis claro and climbed into the common room the room was dark and flickering and at first he thought that she had gone safely to bed and he was unneeded after all and then a low voice sounded to his right hi swivelling hastily he saw lily curled up on the sofa next to the fire and didntknow whether to be relieved or disappointed that she was still awake hey he said walking tentatively over and sinking into the sofa opposite as he tossed his jacket to the floor did you uh did you leave straight after discovering lily interrupted quietly there was a strange quality to her voice that james couldntquite place she took a sip of the butterbeer she was holding and looked up at him yeah i did still struggling fruitlessly with his tie james eyed her carefully are you okay i i mean he stumbled as she raised her eyebrows at him do you want to you know talk about it lily shrugged not much to talk about she said flatly she watched him pull at his collar for a few minutes before setting her bottle down and getting up to come over you ll tear it she said quietly unknotting the offending item and proffering it to him thanks he said taking it an uneasy silence fell uneasy at least for james who could not work out what mood lily was in had she been in floods of tears or storming with rage it would have been easier to cope with than this passive silence it was lily who finally broke it you donthave to stay you know she said quietly i quite as happy by myself nah james answered honestly i was kind of getting bored of watching sirius get all the girls anyway fine by me there it was again that odd drawn out way of speaking you might want to change though it was only then that james realised she was no longer in her dress but in a pair of trousers and a t shirt suddenly the prospect of wearing more comfortable clothes seemed extremely appealing give me a moment he told her and bolted for his room having switched the uncomfortable trousers for jeans he came back unbuttoning the collar and cuffs of his shirt with a new approach in mind do you hate him he asked bluntly as he sat down again lily took a moment to respond staring into the flickering flames no she answered at last she drained her bottle and conjured another you want one james shook his head and she shrugged i dontthink i can actually bring myself to feel that strongly there was a pause as james regarded her searchingly so what he asked quietly lily tilted her head placing the cool bottle against her cheek before drinking she gazed at the fireplace for so long that james began to wonder if she d even heard him in the first place lily he tried again disappointed she said finally part of me she tore her gaze away from the fire and looked speculatively at her butterbeer heaving a sigh part of me wants to know why he did it why i wasntgood enough for him not good enough james said incredulously standing up lily he crouched in front of her lily if anything you were too good for him you know that dontyou a non committal shrug was all the answer he got truly he insisted firmly moving her chin so that she was looking at him cheating is the ultimate unforgiveable you have to be pretty low to do it and to do it as arrogantly as he did too lily looked at him for a long moment yeah she said she squared her shoulders i dontwant you to think i upset i not upset never said you were james countered sitting back on his heels lily drained the last of her bottle conjured another and emptied it halfway spose i owe you an apology she mumbled james looked up in confusion huh you tried you tried t tell me she looked rather puzzled as she placed the bottle back on the table but i didn t listen wonder why she looked up at him and he was startled to see that she was having difficulties focusing on him a suspicion began to form in his mind and he looked more shrewdly at her before turning his gaze to the butterbeer lily where are you conjuring these from lily shrugged downstairs t hall t ball she leaned forward clearly intending to have another sip but james snatched it out of her reach before sniffing it and gingerly taking a drink sirius what lily asked blinking at him he spiked the bottles james said in exasperation trust him he looked speculatively at lily then raised his wand and summoned a small glass vial from his room which he handed to lily no more butterbeer drink this what is it lily questioned holding it to the light a potion that ll take away the worst of any hangover you get tomorrow since i actually dontknow how heavily these are spiked and how many you ve at drink and then you re going to bed lily made a dubious face as she looked at the murky green solution but nonetheless removed the stopper and obediently gulped it down james suspected this was purely because she no longer had the wits to formulate a coherent argument against him that tastes like sick she announced flinging the bottle onto the floor and slumping back into the sofa well it tastes exactly how you d feel tomorrow if you didnttake it james muttered grimly he pocketed the little tube then got to his feet hastily seeing lily eyelids drooping no lily you cantsleep here let get you to your room lea me lily mumbled swatting weakly at him as he shook her shoulder no lily come on get up it only a few steps away he prodded poked coaxed and threatened in vain finally the only way he could manage it was to pull one arm over his shoulder and hoist her up attempting to let her go proved to be a bad idea as she swayed dangerously and he finally settled for looping her arm more securely around his neck and walking her towards her door trying not to drag her too much sirius i am going to kill you he muttered as he tried to open the door whilst simultaneously supporting a now half asleep lily he d forgotten the narcotic effect of the potion but it was making lily usually a very light graceful figure become a lumbering awkward weight in his arms entering her room he looked around for a bed which at first sight didntappear to be there in fact the entire room was so different from his own deep blue and cream room opposite that for a moment he simply stopped and stared lily had created a fairytale dream in this space the ceiling was hung completely with festoons of a white gauzy floating material which gave the room an ethereal look and beneath his bare feet was a soft carpet of dark green there was a tall antique looking wardrobe and opposite was a dressing table the surface littered with a frightening array of little multicoloured pots and a mirror illuminated with tiny candles which was all the light in the room there were boxes and bags scattered around on various comfortable looking cushions and seats james guessed they were from earlier shaking his head in amazement at the explosion of creativity he looked around again wondering if she actually had forgotten a bed in all of this and then realised he was staring right at a four poster hung with more gauzy white fabric but with no actual bed he pulled lily forward and pushed the fabric apart to stare in astonishment the bed itself was sunken into the floor still trying to understand the concept of this sleeping arrangement he gently laid lily down deciding against trying to change her out of her clothes from the impracticalities and made to disengage her arm from his neck at this her eyes fluttered tiredly half open no james don t she mumbled so quietly that james had to lean down to hear her please just not after dontleave me alone james stared down at her torn no lil he said trying to sound as firm as he could despite the tremor in his throat you ll be fine i promise you ll regret this he tried again to unloop her hand but then her other came up to join it no she mumbled please dontleave me not you too james swallowed hard and looked around before looking back down again at her then he slowly crawled in and lay down beside her on what turned out to be a very cosy bed on his back staring up at the misty ceiling lily beside him was nothing more than a dark shape her back to him already breathing deeply he tried to relax to fall asleep in fact it took less time than he expected and he was almost completely asleep when he heard a stifled sniff from beside him turning his head he saw by the dying candlelight a slight shake of her shoulders and another little sound there was a moment of indecision and then he rolled over so he was facing her back and gently slid an arm across her waist shh he whispered and felt her relax back even as another sniff was repressed trying not to think about what would happen the next morning james fell asleep when lily opened her eyes the next morning her head was still throbbing faintly and it took a moment for her to remember where she was squinting against the daylight filtering in through the drapes she rolled over and buried her face in the pillow thinking that she couldntdeal with memories of the ball just yet but as she did so and odd unfamiliar scent hit her nose her pillow smelled unusual of soap and grass and cologne james her stomach actually felt as though it had done a somersault as the final moments of last night washed over her and she sat bolt upright staring at the place where he was or rather where he had been there was nothing left now but a small piece of parchment folded over and bearing her name in his slanted scrawl she picked it up tentatively and then lay back down concluding that since her head was still throbbing and the smell was quite comforting she might as well read while horizontal lily hope you re feeling okay when you get this woke up early so went to see the others off to the station will be back soon and find you then james p s dontworry about last night she put the note down again and sat up slowly there was an uncomfortable feeling she couldntquite place which had nothing to do with the spiked butterbeer and everything to do with a certain messy haired boy having showered and pulled on some fresh clothes she wandered around her room absent mindedly tidying away the relics of ball preparation prodding herself for some emotion at the discovery of tom duplicity last night she was half shocked half relieved to find that in fact she felt nothing more than indifference now mixed with a residue of disappointment that she had been so misled embarrassment that half the school had had to witness the altercation and that james of all people had to pick up the pieces james warmth flooded her face and she leaned her forehead on the cool glass of the window staring out unseeingly at the snow that fallen overnight how could she have let herself put him in such a position even with spiked butterbeer she should have just gone straight to bed when she came up not lingered to think and to end up clinging to james forcing him to stay with her to sleep with her however innocent it was he must have been so uncomfortable no wonder he had left early she turned over these thoughts for a while feeling more and more unsettled the more she thought about him until it occurred to her that right now even more than the cosy comfort of her room the snowy white expanse outside had never looked more inviting swiftly her mind made up she collected her cloak gloves and scarf and methodically put them on before heading out praying she wouldntmeet anyone along the way as this truly wasnta time she felt she could answer questions luckily she was unobstructed and soon enough she was out standing in untouched snow which glittered in the weak sunlight it was beautiful the dazzling white spread up to the lake where she could see a thin layer of ice over the top she turned around and began to walk vaguely across the grounds tripping ungracefully over rocks hidden in the snow several times it wasntuntil a few moments later that she realised she was heading directly towards the quidditch pitch an overwhelming memory of waking up to james cologne in the morning rushed back and she blushed so violently that she was almost surprised the snow around her didntmelt with the force of the heat stooping down as she entered the pitch she gathered a double handful of powdery flakes and pressed it against her cheek what was wrong with her why was she so completely unsettled by last night events when her only feeling regarding the break up was of overwhelming relief she began to pace the edge of the pitch as she struggled to think through her feelings logically she was relatively free from issues as far as tom was concerned it seemed beyond a resentful desire to feed him to the giant squid but those emotions were practically post breakup rights there was mainly relief but relief about what lily asked herself about not having to choose between spending time with friends or with him this last year about not having to fend off his affections in public but being affectionate in public was what couples did and she d been like that often enough with past boyfriends people would see so people did see it wasntas though it was unusual or as if her friends cared remus and emma did it often enough but james lily flushed again and took a deep breath hands clenching unconsciously images of the past term began to flash across her mind of tom of james of james in all his moods laughing sober furious concentrating worried stressed mischievous and with that as she searched her heart for the real truth a wave of realisation crashed over her and she stopped abruptly in shock sinking until she was kneeling in the snow it was always james that i felt uncomfortable being with tom in front of it was always james i didntwant to have to spend time away from it was always james all her efforts for something with tom and all along it had been james who had truly been in her heart lily stared at the snow her fingers idly tracing patterns on an unbroken patch as she tried to process her thoughts the next moment she realised she had traced l e 4 j p and scrabbled it out as fast as she could disgusted with herself so she liked james and she d been rather a fool she told herself sternly trying to shake herself up before she sank completely into being a soppy love story heroine so what was this going to change anything she still didntknow how big this was and okay so they might have had their moments but that was what you would expect with two people with their history he d probably given up on her a long time ago but what if he hasn t her heart whispered but if he hadn t if he hadn t he must have been through complete torture lily thought softening having her closer to him than she had ever been before but unable to take that final step well that was past she told herself firmly mentally shaking herself for the thousandth time he d probably got fed up by now any normal person would and she wasntabout to toy with him the best thing to do would be to act completely normally not think about this too much and then and then maybe it would go away maybe probably and if it doesn t a little voice in the back of her head said shut up lily said out loud and she pulled herself upright brushing snow fiercely off her now damp legs normal normal normal she muttered as she paced briskly back towards the castle teeth chattering as the cold finally set in normal normal normal echoed through the corridors towards the heads common room normal normal norm the words died on her lips as she stepped through into the room and came face to face with the man of the moment himself despite her strict injunctions to herself she flushed desperately and an uncomfortable feeling shot through her where ve you been james asked coming forward i got back ages ago oh the others say to give you their love and emma and sapphire say that if you dontwrite to them today they ll send howlers and good lord woman you re dripping snow are you not cold go dry in front of the fire lily bit her lip yes fire letters i will just got to go change she stalked into her room shut the door and leaned on it and made a despairing face as a waft of james cologne hit her normal my foot she groaned a n finally she gets it this chapter was shorter than i expected surprisingly for organisational reasons but seeing as i ve had it written for well over a year now i sorry it didntget put up earlier life seems to keep getting in the way anyway thank you all for all the lovely reviews which make me smile a smiley me more writing feel free to write another now and tell me what you thought the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you a n thank you guys all so much for your reviews it nice to know i haventbeen forgotten i would do review thank yous but if this fic gets taken down again for anything it wontbe going up again so i wontrisk it there ve been a few more alterations than before in this chapter with regard to some of the dialogue because when i reread it i thought it seemed a bit stilted so i redid bits anyway enjoy chapter 4 again chapter 4 prefect business owls swept into the great hall the next morning just as emma and lily were getting up to leave to their surprise a handsome but unfamiliar barn owl flew down and dropped an envelope into emma arms which was strangely heavy emma slit the envelope open and read it as they walked to charms what does it say lily asked i i a prefect emma said weakly what no yes lily nearly dropped her bag well done em emma shook the envelope out onto her hand and a small badge fell out a p superimposed over the gryffindor lion she held it out to lily who took it and examined it that definitely a prefects badge but why d you only get it now because you became head girl emma held up the letter they had to find someone to take over the prefect job since you cantdo both so i got it well congratulations em there no one i can think of in the whole year who deserves it more than you lily hugged her best friend emma continued to read the letter leaving lily peering into her bag until a soft gasp made her look up emma was staring at the parchment her mouth open what is it lily asked impatiently when emma did not say anything are you working personally with narcissa or something no i i have to work with remus emma voice had gone very quiet yeah obviously i thought you already knew that lily raised her eyebrows and gave emma an arch look is there something you re not telling me no said emma a little too quickly nope nothing nothing at all yeah right lily said emma you re not telling just then the door opened and lily forgot to continue as they were ushered into the classroom for a demanding hour of charms after potions the last class of the day another thing occurred to intrigue lily sirius pulled her aside and asked if he could speak to her in private startled she agreed and waved emma past once everyone had left the classroom sirius dragged her up several passages until they were standing in a small alcove off a rarely used corridor he turned to face her ok i know we dontknow each other very well and i know you think i just a prankster but you have to believe what i going to tell you okay lily said uncertainly james told me what happened last night and he said that you nearly got into another fight i right so far arenti lily nodded he said that for a moment he nearly lost his temper that why i got you here he paused for a moment look i know this sounds insane but when james really properly loses his temper it scary i ve only been on the receiving end once but that was enough because it is bad so let me get this straight you re telling me to be careful because james has a bad temper lily said incredulously he usually so cheery yeah because he keeps it under wraps go and ask daniel jordan in the year below us he was given a dose of it two years ago and he still scared to come near james my point is just take care i warning you in advance here why are you telling me this now lily had no idea what to think then suddenly another thought occurred to her and arentyou a bit late we ve been arguing for years now are you seriously telling me that he never been angry with me before because i have a hard time believing that lily the boy spent most of his time arguing with you because his ulterior motive was to get you to go out with him and the only way you d talk to him was to fight with him it was all just fun for him anyway he never seriously lost his temper with you for another thing you two are going to have to work together for the rest of the year whatever happens and i know that james lik respects you so i dontthink he d want you to get hurt sirius appeared to be talking with such sincerity that against her better instincts lily felt herself believing him i dontknow what you re like when you get angry actually wait a minute maybe i do lily smiled thinking of the many times that she had yelled at the marauders but anyway just try not to get into a big fight although for some reason lily found herself accepting that he wasntmaking things up there was still a part of her that rebelled against his advice perhaps it was this part that made her reply so snappishly ok thanks for this but if you think that i going to back down from something that i think is right just because james has a nasty temper then you clearly dontknow me very well dontsay i didntwarn you muttered sirius but he let lily push past him and walk off wondering why she was cursed with classmates like the marauders after the first week the days passed swiftly and lily found herself caught in the everlasting tangle of classes homework and arrangements for the contest two weeks before halloween the notices went up inviting everyone to take part in the fancy dress competition with plenty of food and mystery entertainment afterwards emma being fairly artistic had helped with these painting and duplicating the notices as far as co operation went lily discovered that she was beginning to like james more as a friend true they still had at least one fight every meeting these were becoming more friendly than aggressive and james had proved to be both resourceful and funny what astonished lily most of all was that the arrogant air that she had associated with him for the last six years had gone completely and he had not asked her out once during the time they were forced to be together he was much nicer for it astonishingly enough he seemed to have gone right to the other extreme he had not been seen flirting with girls since the beginning of seventh year despite sirius usual girl chasing antics now lily and emma found themselves eating with the marauders at least once every few days although for six years lily had done her best to maintain a distant relationship with james she now noticed that she was running into him more and more often the situation was not helped when two professors decided to shift their students around professor flitwick seating plan meant that lily and emma were partnered with james and remus respectively then professor astor growing tired of james and sirius everlasting inattention to lessons switched james with peter leaving james and remus sitting directly behind lily and emma lily observed that she was not the only one who was becoming slightly disgruntled with the whole thing emma looked like christmas had been cancelled when she found out who she was to be working with in charms though lily could see no reason why a week before halloween disaster struck in the form of professor mcgonagall lily was perfectly aware that she had issues with the subject she had only just scraped an e on her owl and things had not got any better after yet another problematic lesson on animal transfiguration that friday she packed up resolving to do something about it over the weekend when professor mcgonagall cornered her miss evans i am sure that you realise that you have some difficulties regarding this subject lily launched into an explanation professor i know my grades arentvery good it just that i i need some practice on animals which i will do over the weekend and i thinking about getting someone to tutor me just to help me out mcgonagall face visibly relaxed yes i was going to suggest that perhaps someone like mr lupin it does not need to be permanent i just feel that some extra help might clear up a few of your problems of course professor and with that lily hurried out of the classroom she spent most of defence against the dark arts and charms contemplating the idea of a tutor and after dinner she caught up with remus james and sirius who were heading up the stairs remus hey remus remus looked back and waited for her to catch up what the matter he asked when she had got her breath back nothing it just that i have a favour to ask you the thing is the thing is lily stumbled over her words i sort of having some problems with animal transfiguration so i was wondering if you would mind just helping me out like next thursday or something remus brow contracted i really sorry lily but i busy all next week i know someone who could help though they re much better at it than i am hang on he raised his voice oi prongs it took a few moments for her to process this but when james turned round her worst fears were confirmed no it alright really she protested weakly but remus ignored her prongs would you help lily with transfiguration next thursday she got a few problems james eyes swept lily up and down as if expecting her to say it was a joke lily help lily evans recovering herself lily rolled her eyes no james the other lily evans in your class sorry just wouldnthave expected you to be asking for help from me he shrugged whatever and for the record that was remus asking not me the point is can you help james nodded sure library eight o clock ok see you there with that lily walked off ignoring the whoop that came from sirius as she turned the corner suddenly she very much dreaded thursday a n so there you go feel free to leave a review anything will do the next chapter will be coming very soon the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you a n thank you guys all so much for your reviews it nice to know i haventbeen forgotten i would do review thank yous but if this fic gets taken down again for anything it wontbe going up again so i wontrisk it chapter 5 angst in plenty monday evening cane and went lily and james frantically well as frantically as james could manage finalising the schedule and arrangements for halloween they made time on tuesday for an extra meeting and with all the work that she had put in lily felt confident enough to put the contest aside and concentrate on her neglected homework in the library early on thursday evening she had managed to secure a corner table one of the more secluded study areas with a large table ensconced on two sides by the walls and on the other two by tall almost floor to ceiling bookcases with a small gap in between so that students could enter and leave and also so that madam pince could keep an eye on what was going on all in all it was very private and lily was feeling fairly content as she worked peacefully on a charms essay trying hard not to think of the upcoming tutoring session suddenly emma stalked into the lily alcove almost threw herself and her bag down and buried her head in her arms lily eyed her cautiously em she asked in a whisper long moments passed distantly lily heard the library door swing open and footsteps enter come near them and then stop at the tables next to their area em what wrong she asked again emma finally lifted her head and lily was startled to see that it was tear streaked what could have happened at a prefects meeting to make emma react like this she moved over to emma side and put her arm round her em what happened did malfoy or narcissa say something emma shook her head mutely it not them she swallowed it remus lily heard a soft gasp somewhere but was too confused to register it her eyebrows furrowed did he do something to you em because if he did i swear i ll emma smiled shakily but her mouth soon drooped it nothing he did lily well not really lily still looked and felt bewildered ok seeing as i cantunderstand anything let start at the beginning what happened in the prefects meeting to make you so like this it nothing m much emma swiped at her eyes fiercely just that we were organising who would help with what for halloween so me and remus signed up for setting everything up with you and james and afterwards everyone was really happy because mostly everything was sorted so we were all smiling and hugging each other and and remus h hugged me she dissolved into tears again and lily was shocked to see how helplessly her friend was crying emma was always so calm and composed and self controlled i canttake it anymore she mumbled through her tears comprehension dawned em you dont do you like remus i dontlike him emma sniffed i hate him i hate that he can do this to me i hate him so much i i think i love him lily gaped openly what i i should have should have told you b before i nearly did when i first found out i was prefect and you were asking me i ve i ve liked him since fifth year and i ve t tried to handle it through all the meetings and lessons but this was the last straw i worked so hard to hide it and i cantdo that anymore lily stared she had sometimes suspected that emma was hiding something but she had no idea that this was the reason that her friend always seemed so tense about prefect meetings she put her hand on emma shoulder oh em emma again swiped ineffectually at her cheeks and swallowed i ve decided she said in a stronger voice i going to dumbledore first thing tomorrow to hand in my badge i dontwant to feel like this all the time around him no you can t emma please it no good it too difficult trying to act all the time i think i might ask professor flitwick to move me as well lily thought fast look emma cantwe at least talk about it come on let go to the dormitory hastily she shoved her things into her bag and emma wiped her red eyes with a tissue lily pushed her out and picked up her own bag but emma had frozen a few steps ahead moving forward lily saw what the problem was remus lupin had been sitting at the alcove next to theirs in one horrified glance lily took in everything the parchment scattered over the table proof that he must have genuinely been working the bottle of ink that had spilled over the table as he stood up hastily worst of all the proximity of the table to the bookcase that divided the areas there was no way he could not have heard everything emma had said one bookcase separating two tables a foot apart was not enough to block sound that much was evident from the way that he was staring at emma with his mouth open emma stared straight back at him for what seemed like an eternity her face aghast then with a terrified sob she fled from the library taking a last glance at remus gobsmacked expression lily followed only catching up with her friend on the stairs to the dormitory half an hour later lily had managed to calm emma down convinced her not to hand in her badge until at least after halloween and even persuaded her to go down and eat something emma rinsed her face and went leaving lily to bleakly realise that it was time to go down herself and meet james here comes the tutor from hell she thought as she opened the library door james was waiting for her in the same alcove where emma had recently made such a dramatic confession and lily could not help but feel a slight sense of foreboding little did she foresee what was about to take place as she arrived james was unloading a heap of books from his bag he grinned as she stared in dismay at the pile dontworry these are just a few books i got out for remus good lily said in relief still feeling a slight twinge at the name dropped well let do this then and with that he drew out a small white mouse and placed it on the desk holding its tail lily looked nonplussed i know how to do that i ve known how to do that since fifth year exactly james said so you should start with what you do know and then get to what you don t he pointed his wand at the opening between the bookcases and muttered something a silencing charm he explained that way we can talk and pince wonthear three quarters of an hour later lily had successfully transfigured five mice three newts and one fat bullfrog all of which james had magically a n no pun intended produced from his bag oddly enough lily was actually feeling comfortable with the situation james still laughed at her mistakes but it was more of an unsarcastic one and he had kept her spirits up fairly well reaching into his bag once again james produced what could only conceivably be a chicken except that it was limp dontworry it fake enervate the fake bird rose up and began to scratch and peck at the table very realistically for the millionth time james rooted around in the bag damn i ve left the next bit up in my room he looked warily at lily who was sizing up the chicken i ll go up and get it if you think you can handle this by yourself lily nodded ok then be right back you get to work she watched his disappearing back as he left the library and then turned her attention to the chicken which was now flapping its wings in a despondent way she cleared her throat aura metamorphi she said what happened next was slightly confusing the chicken exploded soundlessly and yellow gunk spewed out onto lily for seconds lily stared motionless at the remains of the bird lying on the table her mind blank slowly she lowered her wand just as james came back in carrying surprisingly another bag he stopped short at the sight in front of him and his mouth twisted into a grin what the hell happened as if in a dream lily looked past him in the direction he had come from and saw sirius and peter faces peering in between books doing their best to hide smirks sirius peter james lily mind flicked from one to the other and something clicked this had all been a joke a big joke she turned round and began to put her books and wand into her own bag lily james sounded puzzled scourgify the yellow stuff disappeared from the shelves and floor although it was still on lily robes she stood up your friends are over there she said coolly james looked at the bookcase confusedly acting innocent a voice in lily head said and a look of understanding broke out on his face you think that i can explain i had save it potter she said evenly head held high she walked calmly out of the library past madam pince past staring students and out through the double doors into the cool air of the corridor only then did she begin to run she ran blindly behind her she could hear distant shouts of lily and feet pounding as james raced after her in hot pursuit or perhaps that was not just feet but the pounding of her own heart as well her head whirling in a flurry of confused thoughts and emotions to match the pace of her legs in such a turbid state of mind it was no wonder that she lost her way several times and was beginning to get a stitch when she finally reached a passage she recognised she hurtled the length of the corridor and skidded to a halt in front of the fat lady amica fidele she gasped at the portrait clutching her side lily the voice sounded closer as did the footsteps what on earth have you been doing said the fat lady curiously lily wait lily looked back to see james turning the corner his face red with effort please just open she begged desperately she could feel a tingling sensation in her throat and cast another panicked look behind her if she didntget away she was going to oh very well said the fat lady sniffily and she swung open just as james reached it the portrait closed and the few seconds that it took him to say the password were all that lily needed she sprang across the common room attracting even more attention and was halfway up the stairs when james scrambled through the hole and sprinted after her please wait he shouted but it was too late lily had already reached the top and the staircase smoothed out into a slide transporting james all the way down to the bottom disconsolately he flung himself onto the bottom step and put his head in his hands mind working on autopilot lily darted down the corridor leading to her dorm she had to get there before throwing open the door she entered the silent dark room and hurled her bag haphazardly onto the bed not noticing as all the contents spilled out she slumped against the wall and slid down into a sitting position despite the mess on her robes she rested her head on her arms and began to cry a n so there you go basically the same just a few minor alterations where i ve noticed a grammatical mistake feel free to leave a review anything will do the next chapter will be

else which now needs only to be fully typed up its already half done before it can go up the next chapter of this will be sooner i swear important unfortunately due to some sort of problem with editing which has never yet been fixed i having a bit of a problem finding a symbol that can show a break between events if you see then that is the equivalent of a line between the paragraphs to break up the passage got it good chapter 6 a most uncomfortable day lils said a voice uncertainly emma stepped into the dormitory and flicked on the light lils are you in here cause james is sitting at the bottom of our staircase and he says he wontmove until you come down she trailed off as she caught sight of lily almost completely hidden behind the bed oh my lily look at you what happened rushing over as lily lifted her face she scrabbled on the bedside table for tissues and handed them to her as lily mopped her face covered in snot and tears and her swollen red eyes emma attempted to get the mucky robe off her once done she held it up and wrinkled her nose in distaste lils what going on you were right em boys are prats and they re too hard to be close to wiping her nose again she related the whole sordid story to emma whose calm face got paler and paler as she carried on regardless of the fact that tears were beginning to fall again even as she spoke oh lily emma murmured at last sympathetically she handed her another tissue look the best thing to do will be to completely ignore this they just have a sick twisted sense of humour and you got caught on the end of it so you should just forget about them it not that lily shuffled back on her bed and crossed her legs i for a while until now i was actually beginning to to like james in a way i trusted him to help me now i feel like such an idiot because i shouldnthave expected anything to change yes you should emma scooted closer leaning in conspiratorially but earnestly james has changed i dontknow how many times i ve told you this but he has he doesntgo out with anyone anymore i haventeven seen him flirting with girls he isntso arrogant and he doesnthex people for no reason there something different now lil the next day was exceptionally awkward lily woke up and the memories came flooding back into her head getting dressed quickly she sneaked down to the kitchens and took a few things back to the dorm she and emma shared a quick breakfast on their beds as luck would have it it was friday meaning that they had several classes with the marauders lily and emma got to charms early and lily put her bag down next to emma when james sauntered in he looked surprised lily you sit next to me in this lesson lily pulled out a piece of parchment and scribbled a message on it which she held up i sitting with emma get lost potter but lily please i really need to talk to you she scribbled something else and held it up tough luck go away i tried to find you before classes but you werentanywhere i could see you where did you go go away just then remus came in and a look of surprise flitted over his face as well he walked straight up to them emma i thought we sat together emma avoided his eyes choosing to focus instead on her bag yeah well we arenttoday but remus began just as professor flitwick came in and said cheerily good morning class do sit down there was no choice but for james and remus to take the empty seats in front of the girls judging by the amount of whispering that the two spent the lesson doing lily guessed that each had so far been unaware of the other situation lunch was another tricky affair although lily had planned to eat quickly and get out james was too fast for her just as she was halfway through her shepherd pie he came and seated himself next to her with the determined air of someone who intended to get his own way lily if you would just listen he began so emma have you finished your potions essay yet lily said over james in a loud voice turning her back pointedly on him i lost track of what i was doing about halfway through i just waffled on about nothing for about two feet emma gave james a quick look before replying softly i haventdone it yet just then remus strolled in he looked around before noticing them and although he faltered in step when he saw emma he resolutely put his bag down emma looked round and jumped slightly as she saw him smile hesitantly at her dropping her fork on the table she hastily stood up i should really get started on that essay now in fact she climbed over the bench i ll come with you lily finished her last mouthful and rose casting an eye at emma who was already halfway across the hall she smiled sympathetically at remus gave james the dirtiest glare she could muster and left thankfully herbology passed without incident and lily was able to spend a peaceful hour repotting dreamy dandelions with emma and a pair of friendly hufflepuffs she was not expecting any trouble in defence against the dark arts either because the boys sat behind them as opposed to beside them but there she was wrong she had been sitting down for five minutes when an unfamiliar middle aged woman came in and set her briefcase down on the desk i am your substitute teacher today as professor astor is ill my name is professor stuart now i have work for you within a quarter of an hour it became apparent that professor stuart was completely incapable of controlling a class having set them a few pages of questions from the textbook she retired behind a large blue tome with no title and the class was left to its own devices more or less which obviously did not include studying lily and emma were the only two writing industriously pausing to consider an answer lily was startled to see a piece of parchment fall onto the book curiously she opened it and read the contents before screwing it up again and pushing it to a side in james messy scrawl it had read lily would you please listen to me minutes later another ball of parchment landed on the desk this time lily didntbother reading it she simply moved it to one side and continued working the more she ignored the notes the more that came and soon emma who had been opening them all and trying to put them where lily would read them had built up an entire one sided conversation just give me a chance to explain and you can hate my guts in peace after that if you want to cantyou listen to anything i ve said lily any answer at all would be good here please stop ignoring these and emma remus says he needs to talk to you at this last note emma snorted and wrote something on the parchment lily looked over her shoulder her interest at last aroused if he really wants to talk to me he doesntneed you as a mediator emma the reply came back as fast as lightning fine emma this is remus i need to talk to you scribbling furiously emma wrote something else and threw it behind again well i dontwant to talk please leave me be although the note came sailing back emma ignored it lily took this as a sign that the brief exchange was at an end and returned to discussing the finer points of hex deflection she made very sure that james was in a perfect viewing position at the end of the lesson as she ripped up each of his notes separately into tiny pieces and threw them in the bin before stalking out emma appeared at her shoulder as she went lily that wasntfair what wasn t lily asked innocently what you just did i know you re angry and hurt but wasntignoring the notes enough if you wanted to throw the notes away then you didnthave to do it that way that was just spiteful dontbring yourself low just to make him feel bad what would you know about it em lily yelled suddenly making people around her jump you like someone and it your own fault that you wontdo anything about it i thought you were on my side i am on your side lily said emma in a voice that was much cooler than usual but that does not mean that i can support what you did it was downright mean lily subsided a little all right she said in a pacified tone i wontdo it again but i still refuse to acknowledge that he exists a flicker of hope had crossed emma face as she said the first sentence but it faded again as she said the second she was wise enough not to push it they walked on in silence lily could almost feel the cold waves of hurt radiating off her friend emma she said in a small voice i sorry i shouldnthave said what i did about you i didntmean it i was just angry she touched emma on the arm and swung her around to face her friends to her relief emma smiled forever she pulled her into a hug but then let go and stood at arms length just be careful what you say in a heated moment lils you might regret it afterwards she looked at her watch and sighed now can we please go to dinner a n so there you go basically the same just a few minor alterations where i ve noticed a grammatical mistake feel free to leave a review anything will do the next chapter will be coming very soon the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you a n thank you guys all so much for your reviews it nice to know i haventbeen forgotten i would do review thank yous but if this fic gets taken down again for anything it wontbe going up again so i wontrisk it apologies for the lateness of the chapter i working on something else which now needs only to be fully typed up its already half done before it can go up the next chapter of this will be sooner i swear chapter 7 halloween i the morning before a dreamy landscape blurred into reality blinking james rolled over and taking his glasses from the bedside table he peered at his clock a split second later he had swung himself out of bed and dashed to the bathroom he swore as he attempted to brush his teeth and wash his face at the same time back in the dormitory he noticed remus neatly made up bed opposite why didnthe wake me up he wondered as he frantically pulled on a pair of jeans and the first t shirt he could find he had known just as well as james that they were both due to help set up in the hall for the halloween festivities that evening yanking any two socks on and stuffing his feet into his trainers james scrambled down to the great hall where he was met by a very disapproving mcgonagall and just where have you been mr potter sorry james said apologetically running a hand unconsciously through his hair he followed her past the doors into the hall remus was already there doing something to a heap of pumpkins emma stood about five feet away apparently using her wand to charm candles into having different coloured flames seeing as you are late mcgonagall said curtly you may as well begin moving the tables and chairs she indicated with a wave of her hand the stacked tables around the edges of the chamber you will do it without magic but professor james began no buts mcgonagall said firmly now the positions for the tables are marked on the ground james gaze around the room was suddenly arrested in a corner he had been wondering distantly where the head girl herself was but he had obviously not recognised her lily had climbed up onto a pile of tables and appeared to be attaching strings of decorations to the walls her long red hair was loose falling straight down her back it was her clothing that made james suddenly feel so dizzy he had never seen her wear anything quite so casual yet so provocative and so revealing she was dressed in blue denim jeans black trainers and a white tank top with spaghetti straps it accentuated her slender figure perfectly while mcgonagall droned on james watched lily fiddling with something his stomach did a flip flop and he almost had to stifle a groan as she stretched up to put it on the wall as she raised her arms a few inches of creamy skin at her waist were exposed and her slim waist and narrow hips looked even more obvious james couldntunderstand how he hadntnoticed before what a beautiful figure she had then again he reasoned with himself wizarding robes didntreveal much and neither did the baggy sweatshirts that she usually wore james felt a blush rise in his cheeks as she extended herself again and that wasntthe only part of his body that reacted to the sight six chairs will be quite sufficient mr potter are you listening james looked guiltily back at professor mcgonagall yes professor sorry well then you had better get on with the job mcgonagall was quite clearly still miffed with him but james gaze had drifted back to lily she had stiffened in mid reach when mcgonagall had shouted out his name and there was no way that she could not know that he had arrived mentally forcing himself not to look at her again he made his way over to remus and began pulling a table from a stack remus looked down at his feet and smirked nice socks prongs is it a new way to pick up the girls james looked down as well he was wearing mismatched socks one with a pattern of snitches on it and the other with pumpkins well i would have been able to find a proper pair if you d woken me up on time he said through gritted teeth i did remus said serenely you called me a wanker and rolled over having no reply for this james simply snorted and lifted up the table again to begin his arduous task as he positioned it over one of the yellow dots on the floor which mcgonagall had said were marked on to show where tables should be placed he surveyed the stacks around him this was going to take a while half an hour later james was aching all over the circular tables pretty as they looked were very heavy and although he was almost three quarters of the way through his arms were killing and his head was aching from trying not to stare at lily too much as she continued to work remus had finished charming the pumpkins and was now positioning them to float over the tables in mid air while emma placed candles in and lit them it was quite obvious to even the most innocent and uninformed bystander that she was putting a great effort into not exchanging more than a few sentences with remus as they worked invariably she would find something else to concentrate on or somewhere else to go every time he came near more than anything james now wished that he had woken up in time to get dressed properly the t shirt he had thrown on had already been one of those which were too tight in the chest region and now soaked with sweat as he was it was clinging uncomfortably snugly to his body revealing rather too much of him he felt horribly exposed and if it were not for the wrath of mcgonagall and more importantly of a certain red head he would have gone up to change long ago as it was he simply gritted his teeth again attempted to pull his shirt down again and began dragging another table again thump james whirled round in time to see emma crumple to the floor and a pumpkin roll away he swore and started towards them remus had knelt down beside her very pale trying to wake her up emma lily cried lithe as a cat she sprang off the table lightly and ran over carefully she lifted emma head from where it was lying in remus lap and examined it there was a gash on the top which was bleeding freely onto her hair remus groaned but lily smiled at him sympathetically she ll be fine what hit her a pumpkin her eyes moved round the hall pointedly avoiding james and came to rest on the stray orange ball lying in the middle of the floor that one i i was levitating the pumpkins and i sort of lost concentration and it fell remus smiled weakly nothing happened to the pumpkin of course it has an unbreakable charm on it it just emma he gestured at her well madam pomfrey can heal stuff like this in a minute so you d better take her to the hospital wing james said lily fished in her pocket and produced a piece of cloth james had no idea what it was for put this on the wound and put pressure on it remus stood bringing emma prone form with him are you sure you shouldnttake her i mean i hardly the first person she ll want to see she ll probably kill me when she finds out lily put her hands on her hips remus lupin stop being such a coward she will not kill you because i know what she like and besides do you really think i would be able to carry her take her up gingerly remus lifted emma into his arms supporting her unconscious head on his chest he slowly took her out lily and james were left standing there watching the empty doors lily turned round to james for a moment he thought that she was going to say something her mouth opened but then she gave him a sad look and walked away to clamber back up on a stack of tables and continue decorating sighing inwardly james went back to hoisting the tables despite the fact that it had been quiet before the tense uncomfortable silence that now pervaded the hall was deafening james knew it was no use talking to her he needed to wait until he was in a situation where she had no way of avoiding or ignoring him but he still felt thoroughly depressed as he wiped his forehead this could have been so much more fun and less like work if they were being normal they would have been laughing together and joking not standing at opposite ends of the hall trapped in their own silence eventually james looked round and groaned quietly reluctantly he approached the final stack of tables upon which lily was standing he cleared his throat to announce his proximity and she froze at once uhm i need to move the tables that you re on i mean lily turned and shot a glance round the room when she had satisfied herself that there were indeed no other tables that he could move she sighed dusted her hands off on her jeans and slid down without a backward glance she marched over to the remaining pile of pumpkins and began to continue what remus and emma had been doing james finished the tables and started on the chairs taking up a pile of cloths lily began to polish the tables and spread tablecloths on then she managed to completely stay away from any area that james was working in and did not open her mouth once finally around two o clock the job was finished and james appraised the room with no small feeling of contentment lily turned on her heel and walked away acting on impulse james hurried after casting around for a statement a question anything lily he said as he caught up with her do we need to be there early tonight no lily said so quietly that he barely heard her and she lengthened her strides and quickened her pace unfortunately for her james being taller had no problem in matching her speed are you sure he queried as casually as he could manage yes cantyou just leave me alone please lily was beginning to feel very much in need of something to soothe her nerves it was the effect that james had had on her for the last few days since the library incident james did not reply he slowed down allowing her to walk on ahead and then headed up to his dorm only to be met by a very excited sirius have you heard about fay fletcher people say she going to dress as a hooker i cantwait for the whole contest thing mine is going to be the best he began bouncing around the room singing loudly albeit slightly off key oh i just cantwait for tonight a n this is to the tune of oh i just cantwait to be king from the lion king and yes i know that sirius wouldntbe likely to know this but who cares oh yeah james thought sarcastically as he followed sirius past the beds picking up anything that fell down i really cantwait for tonight a n so there you go basically the same just a few minor alterations where i ve noticed a grammatical mistake feel free to leave a review anything will do the next chapter will be coming very soon the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you a n thank you guys all so much for your reviews it nice to know i haventbeen forgotten i would do review thank yous but if this fic gets taken down again for anything it wontbe going up again so i wontrisk it apologies for the lateness of the chapter i working on something else which now needs only to be fully typed up its already half done before it can go up the next chapter of this will be sooner i swear chapter 8 halloween ii the evening after a clock ticked unceasingly as lily carefully turned the page of the book she had been attempting to read grimacing slightly she skimmed halfway down the page before giving up rolling over on her bed she pushed the book underneath and reached for a magazine a quarter of the way through how to curse your ex to pieces without breaking any laws emma came in though she looked her usual calm self something was not normal there was an air of suppressed joy about her her eyes looked bright and she had what could only be described as a spring in her step lily looked up em she cried getting up are you alright totally blood free emma grinned madam pomfrey healed it in about a minute apparently and i came round half an hour later she looked round where is everyone gone to hogsmeade last minute necessities they called it lily sat back down on her bed i have everything i need already her eyes fell upon the clock on her table and she frowned emma if you were okay after half an hour then where have you been for the last one and a half hours emma avoided lily keen stare uh that i was you know going places meeting people doing things lily eyed emma fast reddening complexion yeah right emma vance you are hiding something from me and i am exercising my full rights as best friend to demand that you tell me what it is nothing just remus she touched her lips tentatively he kissed you oh my lily suddenly found herself speechless shh emma said but she was smiling too the whole house ll hear when did this happen demanded lily breathlessly having regained her voice how where emma sat down comfortably on the bed and grinned well i woke up in the hospital wing and the first thing i saw was his face looking all anxious except when he saw my eyes open i think he must have jumped back about a foot because he fell right off his chair she laughed and so did lily then once he d picked himself up he started asking me how i was feeling but when i said that i had a bit of a headache he looked all depressed and told me he had dropped what was it a pumpkin lily supplied helpfully that it he said he had dropped a pumpkin on me and i had gone unconscious i still dontremember that emma shook her head bemusedly as if to clear it go on lily urged yeah so then after we had got past that he suddenly gave me this really serious look and said emma we need to talk about the other day and at first i was really confused because i couldntremember anything and then it all came back to me so i rolled over because i really didntwant to have to look at him you know and he said i honestly didnt mean to overhear what you were saying that night so i went but you did anyway didntyou that the problem the thing is i do believe him at least now because well he sounded sincere i think then what happened lily asked eagerly then he goes it just that that i got kind of irritated because i was thinking if he wants to tell me he hates me he should just do it and i said that what and that when he said that i feel the same way as you emma cocked her head slightly and for a moment i just couldntbreathe i turned over to look at him and went is this a joke he just gave me this look and said really quietly i meant what i said then he looked at his watch and goes really fast oh damn i have to go meet uhm james so i ll see you around and he half ran out no no no no stupid stupid remus lily groaned letting herself fall onto her back a few seconds later she sat up again sharply hang on what am i saying there more to tell right keep talking well as soon as madam pomfrey let me get up i went off and i figured i would find remus because i couldntjust leave the whole thing hanging i looked everywhere and i mean everywhere emma scowled at the memory the library the owlery the kitchens the hall the common room the lake and the quidditch pitch i even got peter to check the boys dormitory then i got tired of searching for someone who was so obviously trying to avoid me so i just wandered around that when i found him he was sitting on the floor in the middle of a corridor staring at his hands she shifted uncomfortably and lily got the feeling that it was becoming harder to express in words what she had felt he looked well lost so i walked up to him and said something like i meant what i said that day in the library he jumped and then he got up really slowly and gave me this look it felt like he was trying to read my mind or analyse me emma looked very distant as if she were reliving the past as she told it and then he said quietly really and i think i nodded she laughed softly i said something like always but it didntmatter because then he he kissed me she looked at her hands lily lowered her own hands which had been over her mouth that is the most romantic thing i have ever ever heard and the best thing about it is that it true what did it feel like emma laughed again it was wonderful he was nervous at first but then he relaxed and his lips are so soft she closed her eyes briefly then opened them again to shoot a wicked grin at lily he has a very nice body too lily mouth fell open too much information em he your boyfriend not mine he said he liked me since fourth year when i had to spend so much time helping him with astronomy homework remember lily smiled you two must have either been very good at hiding it or completely blind she looked at her watch the others ll be back from hogsmeade soon we might as well start getting ready for the contest now you know what serena like when she hogs the mirrors besides we should get decent seats tonight as well emma looked uncomfortable yeah about that lils would you mind if we sat with remus lily opened her mouth to say yes and then closed it again that means sitting with sirius james and peter yeah emma fidgeted as lily began to shake her head i am not sitting with them especially with that prick of a head boy you sit with remus i ll find callie or something callie west was one of their dorm mates no lily i am not letting you go off by yourself look if you want me to i ll tell remus i can t or else just sit with us you can still talk to me and remus please lily looked at emma beseeching expression and relented ok she said grudgingly but do not leave me with those jerks or i will walk off and i will not come back done said emma happily this is going to be perfect by ten to six the seventh year girls dormitory was loud and noisy with everyone rushing around emma however was ready and so was lily who was just adding the finishing touches to her hair didntanyone tell you that catsuits are so out of fashion serena said nastily as she passed by emma turned didntanyone tell you that i dontcare she questioned innocently serena made a huffing noise as she turned to the mirror ignore her em you look great lily said and it was true she was wearing a black leather catsuit which looked stunning on her slim body and daring high heeled black ankle boots her chestnut hair had been straightened and a streak of eyeshadow completed her look strangely enough lily had noticed that since her meeting with remus she seemed a lot more relaxed and self assured and it was doing wonders to her already calm demeanour and i suppose you look awful emma said sarcastically lily looked down at her simple costume and sighed she wished she had had the courage now to wear something more adventurous we d better go she said absently emma slipped on a pair of shades and grinned mysteriously come on laughing the two of them made their way down to the great hall james saw her the moment she walked in and his heart seemed to freeze up for a moment she and emma had paused just inside the doors to look around and from where he was seated he had a perfect vantage point she was dressed in a white dress with drooping sleeves which seemed tailored to fit her and emphasise her naturally trim in james eyes figure a n think of the white dress that eowyn wore in the lord of the rings the two towers at rohan just when theodred died and grima tried to get his ugly paws on her her skin glowed and her hair hanging straight down her back had highlights of different hues of red in it giving her a thoroughly individual look above her head a magical halo glittered interwoven magical sparks of gold emma spotted them and began to walk over lily following beside him james heard remus shift uncomfortably emma reached them first and smiled at remus who blinked and then leapt out of his seat and bowed before kissing her hand remus lupin at your service milady emma vance international spy she removed her sunglasses and raised an eyebrow a tudor nobleman but of course he turned to lily and we have the princess lily in our company tonight actually lily tucked a strand of hair behind her ear it an angel she reached behind her but where are your sirius began just as lily found what she was looking for without warning a large pair of shimmering wings unfurled from her back causing remus to step back in shock wings sirius finished lamely they re a bit cumbersome arentthey lily smiled amicably but it was quite apparent that it was only directed at two people emma and remus that why they fold up she reached behind again and a moment later the wings closed up again yet when remus looked at her back there was no evidence of there having ever been any sort of apparatus to release wings she merely appeared to be wearing a dress they sat down and very soon the table had become split into two groups lily emma and remus were talking together and on the other side james sirius and peter had their heads together or rather sirius and peter since james was in his own world of thought the silences that inevitably occurred were still rather painful and despite every attempt remus made lily refused to join in any conversation involving james soon enough the contest started the five judges professor dumbledore and professors mcgonagall flitwick sprout and singrey respective heads of gryffindor ravenclaw hufflepuff and slytherin sat at a long table and the students paraded past as their name was called out faye fletcher had indeed come dressed as a prostitute and received a large share of shocked looks at her raunchy outfit sirius caused a big stir among the girls as he sauntered along dressed as he was like an american gangster with the accent to match and james got much the same response in his neat black and white tuxedo although lily still had no idea who he was meant to be as she had blocked her ears to avoid hearing his voice when he told the judges emma too got several whistles from the boys in her catsuit lily herself found that while she got no whistles the brilliancy of her complexion and her innocent manner got her a lot of compliments some people had obviously made a lot of effort on themselves and it was a happy crowd of trolls fairies magical creatures and characters from history literature and films that sat down to eat after she had finished her apple pie lily excused herself to go to the bathroom growing tired of the awkward silences when she got there however she was startled to hear a loud sob as she washed her hands she looked cautiously around the otherwise empty room is that you moaning sorry i mean myrtle she called out tentatively she was answered a few minutes later by another sob this time more muffled advancing on the toilet at the end she pushed at it to find that it was locked who is it she asked go away the voice sounded strangely familiar if you dontunlock the door i going to climb up and look over it anyway she pointed out go away lily racked her brain trying to match the voice with a name sapphire she asked in amazement it lily open the door for a few seconds there was nothing then the lock clicked and lily pushed the door open to see sapphire heathleigh one of her dorm mates and callie best friend sitting on the toilet her face streaked with tears saffy what wrong sapphire shook her head nothing come on tell me nothing just that callie broke up with me a single tear made its way down her cheek what why lily exclaimed furiously racking her brains to work out what was going on werentcallie and sapphire best friends but sapphire began to cry again and lily sensed that this was probably not the best time to inquire instead she hauled sapphire to her feet come out you can come sit with us let just clean you up a bit she offered her some tissues and soon sapphire face had returned to normal except for a few red blotches on her cheeks dusting both their dresses off lily talked cheerfully to sapphire as they headed back that a lovely costume she looked admiringly at her sleeveless grass green dress of sheer gauze which hung loosely on her willowy frame and the circlet of daisies in her pale brown hair are you an earth maiden or something a dryad replied sapphire seemingly grateful to hear a friendly voice you know the tree goddesses from the lion the witch and the wardrobe oh i used to love that book lily said in delight arriving in the hall as the food was cleared away lily led sapphire to their table get an extra chair will you remus sapphire going to hang around with us for the evening a chorus of hi resounded and sapphire smiled tremulously as she sat down leaning across james began a conversation with her although sirius seemed unable to look at her and appeared to spend a lot of time gazing at the floor instead for her part lily was feeling fairly content with the fact that she was only talking to three people on the table or so she told herself and she watched contently as daniel jordan ascended the stage and now ladies and gentlemen for your evening entertainment we have a performance from the charmed ones three witches walked out onto the stage to wild applause and immediately struck up a bouncy tune as the lights dimmed it had been a stroke of luck that lily and james had been able to hire such a popular and well known group girls were keen on them because of their singing and boys liked them because of their well looks how superficial lily settled back in her chair and sighed halfway through the concert lily decided to visit the toilet again she had just come out of the hall quietly when she realised that there was someone blocking her way a greasy haired someone out alone mudblood he sneered go away snape oh but why would i do that you re not even being polite snape get out of my way lily knew she was getting riled you haventeven said please i dontintend to something in her voice made snape tense then maybe you should learn how without warning he whipped out his wand and suddenly lily felt her arm being twisted behind her back she opened her mouth to cry out with the pain but could not make a sound snape had put a silencing charm on her she writhed helplessly grimacing as her arm began to cramp snape was watching her in a kind of miserable satisfaction the next thing she knew the pain in her arm had suddenly abated and snape had been thrown to the ground lily spun around massaging her freed and painful arm to see james standing there fury radiating from his darkened hazel eyes and his wand trained on snape what makes you think that you have a right to curse someone who is innocent he said his voice dangerously low and cold snape sat up slowly and began to move towards his wand james jerked his own and snape wand rose in mid air and flew another few feet away i know that was an unprovoked attack for a fact fifty points from slytherin for that alone then there was the fact that you were intentionally causing another student harm another fifty points gone from slytherin his voice shook slightly but the hand that held the wand was quite steady snape made an unexpected dive towards his wand go it and scrambled to his feet he opened his mouth to curse james but james was too fast for him expelliarmus he said and snape wand soared to james you ll get this back tomorrow when i ve reported you to mcgonagall go snape didntneed to be asked twice he shot them a look of pure hatred and walked off not towards the great hall but the dungeons at the top of the stairs that led down to them he stopped and turned i ll get you for this potter and you mudblood with that he was gone james lowered his wand and looked warily at lily who gazed straightforwardly back at him she was the first to speak i not some damsel in distress i know and you re not a knight in shining armour no so you dontneed to come and rescue me all the time ok because i could have handled that perfectly well on my own if i d been prepared that good james turned and began to head back to the hall but he swivelled round again thank you she smiled at him i would have been much worse off today if you hadntturned up no problem james was reaching breaking point can we talk in light of recent events i suppose so look lily about that whole library incident i wasnt involved i swear sirius and peter planned the entire thing they were the ones who suggested that i use the fake bird they had made to help tutor you i sorry because i should have realised that they were plotting something because they were so interested in all the details of where when and how but apart from that i sick of this all of a sudden james heard his voice rising as the frustration of the past few days poured out i sick of being ignored when i didntdo anything wrong when i tried to explain everything i dontknow how many times all i got was a cold shoulder it s it ridiculous i know i haventexactly been a model person over the years but that does not amount to this much so why dontwe just go inside forget this whole thing ever happened and you can go back to hating my guts in peace like you have done for the last seven years maybe we should just stay away from each other he began to move away towards the hall but lily hurried forward and pulled at his arm james please wait a shock passed up her hand as it made contact with his robes and she withdrew it instantly willing her eyes to convey the message instead it was the use of his first name as well as the spark that had passed between them that made him turn round and look at her reluctantly i i sorry so sorry lily tried to keep her gaze steady i didntknow and i know it my fault that i didntlisten and i am honestly and truly sorry she blinked trying to choke back the unexpected lump in her throat but please forgive me i donthate your guts and i dont want to stay away from you because i can t we re friends she added hastily james eyes softened as he looked at her pleading expression and he raked a hand through his hair just then lily focused on the doors behind him and james swung round to see sirius head appear hi people he said jauntily look lily before you slap me i just wanted to say that you should forgive james me and peter here sirius turned round to look behind and frowned okay peter run off since he a chicken no pun intended he added quickly as lily flinched we take full responsibility for the whole uh event so you and jamesie can get back together seeing as i being so mature and everything james neck went red as he glared at sirius padfoot he said through gritted teeth yeah go away oh am i interrupting something here confusion spread over sirius handsome features yes lily groaned oh whoops sorry he disappeared and lily looked back at james who was staring at the floor and running a hand through his hair distractedly please she repeated softly she stretched her arm out again but realising what she was doing stopped halfway her hand suspended in mid air friends masking his bitterness james finally nodded after a long moment grasping her hand and trying to ignore the sensations that told him how warm and soft her hand was or how perfectly it fit into his he looked her squarely in the eyes friends lily grinned happily looks like you re saddled with me again mr potter her eyes fell upon the top two buttons of his shirt undone alluringly and she swallowed again oh well i ll blame it on the butterbeer james responded teasingly er who or what are you meant to be anyway lily asked curiously james assumed a serious expression and put on a posh accent bond james bond charmed to meet you he lifted her hand as if to kiss it but then for no reason that lily could see dropped it suddenly instead he bowed dramatically lily laughed and began to walk towards the hall oh well come on mr bond sweet as this reunion is i dontwant to miss the whole concert because of you likewise james replied as he followed her friends he thought friends with a smart beautiful funny girl i an idiot a n so there you go basically the same just a few minor alterations where i ve noticed a grammatical mistake feel free to leave a review anything will do the next chapter will be coming very soon n b originally the song colourblind by darius was part of this chapter but it now been removed by me because i know of the sudden spate of removing fics due to song lyrics that been happening recently and i want to save this fic before it becomes a casualty again because if it does it wont go up again as i ve said before and i dontwant that the truth of the heart summary lily evans has always always hated james potter so when they become head boy and girl nothing could be worse but could working with him change lily opinion has she been ignoring the truth in her heart all along disclaimer i dontown any of this except a few minor characters so please dontsue me jkr cause i have nothing you want unless you re into human flesh you re not are you a n thank you guys all so much for your reviews it nice to know i haventbeen forgotten i would do review thank yous but if this fic gets taken down again for anything it wontbe going up

this will be sooner i swear and this chapter is earlier than planned as a celebration because lady a is back in the country well she back from houston meaning she near a computer meaning we can talk again grins yay yes i slightly hyper too much sugar today chapter 9 he loves me he loves u not the next day had a very tranquil air about it although school was still on most people got up late and lazed in the common room for at least half an hour yawning before doing anything else lily was the first to wake in her dormitory she padded over the thick soft carpet to emma side and shook her gently but emma groaned and huddled under the duvet le me alo deciding it was no use lily went off and took a long shower a she let the warm streams of water run over her head and soothe her she couldnthelp but wonder about serena the girl had glowered at her for almost the whole evening after she had returned with james in tow laughing and talking although serena usually acted rather catty she had seemed to dislike her even more last night and lily was quite at a loss to understand why she pulled on a pair of jeans and a green turtleneck and grabbing a book headed down to the empty common room where she curled up in front on the fire on a squashy old sofa and began to read for the next hour the common room was silent and peaceful deserted except for lily oblivious of time she read on while the fire crackled merrily beside her and cool daylight crept slowly across the circular room at one point she looked up to hear footsteps hoping it would be emma but instead tom jacobs and keegan adams the other two seventh year boys who shared a dormitory with the marauders came down the stairs talking quietly they were dressed in tracksuit bottoms and lily supposed inattentively that they were going out for an early morning run keegan simply nodded at her in acknowledgement while tom greeted her with a smile and a hey lily before he too vanished through the portrait hole a short while later lily was once again deep in her book when she heard the portrait hole open again and someone clambered through assuming that it was tom or keegan come back for something or just another early riser she did not bother to look up footsteps sounded towards the middle of the room then stopped oh look it the red head whore what lily raised her head to see serena parkinson glaring at her hands on hips need your hearing checked do you i suppose you would after all the shouting a certain person did in your ear last night during the concert carefully lily put her book down and stood up she looked serena coolly up and down from her straight honey blonde hair that reached just below her shoulders all the way down to her high heeled pink sandals even though it was a cool october morning and not yet even breakfast in fact barely past sunrise no weather for sandals excuse me she asked coldly who or what are you talking about you know perfectly well who i mean you two faced slag serena voice was getting higher and louder lily raised an eyebrow no actually i don t she said calmly would you like to uh clarify who it is that you re talking about you are so thick serena sneered all right i ll tell you does the name james potter ring any bells sleeping with him now are we for a moment lily stared at her in disbelief convinced that she had heard something wrong then she began to laugh that is the single most ridiculous thing i have ever heard she gasped clutching her side as she laughed you cantcover up whatever it is that going on by just laughing evans i not stupid well you obviously are if you honestly think that for one thing i would never never get involved in po james love life or his tangled string of girlfriends for another last time i heard you werenteven going out with him anyway so what it got to do with you serena snorted dontplay innocent with me you ve had him eating out of your hand and following you around since fifth year you ve got him wrapped around your little finger and you know it you re practically raising his hopes by spending so much time with him when all a bitch like you is doing is stopping him from going out with real girls she took a step forward menacingly and narrowed her eyes you dontown him neither do you came a voice from the staircase lily and serena turned as one to see james potter descending his hair its usual messy self wearing a crumpled pair of jeans and a sweatshirt giving him a very much just got out of bed look serena entire persona shifted jamesie she cooed she took a few paces towards him swaying her hips provocatively and practically radiating waves of flattery lily had never felt so sickened and how are you today fine james answered shortly he eyed serena with great dislike what do you want parkinson you already know the answer to that james i want you her eyes were fixed on his face hungrily well i not interested parkinson and that something you obviously didntpick up the other five hundred times we ve had this conversation see you he indicated the portrait hole but jamesie serena cried do not call me jamesie bye bye serena snorted again angrily and flounced towards the hole as she passes lily she shot a glare at her and mouthed bitch then she was gone lily collapsed back down onto the sofa to her surprise james came over sank down next to her and sighed what was all that about she asked you really want to know james yawned well seeing as she verbally attacking me over something that i know very little about yes i do how much did you overhear anyway enough so what the story we went out together in fourth year i dated her for exactly two days before i found out what a bitch she was and for a week before i found out that she was cheating on me with some ravenclaw so i dumped her after she got dumped by the other guy and found out that my family is fairly wealthy she came crawling back she doesntseem to understand that i not interested lily looked at him doubtfully holding her book against her and all this comes from the master player of girls himself james turned round sharply and looked back at her raising his eyebrows i didntknow you believed everything you heard it just a rumour is it i may have gone out with quite a few girls but i dont two time or cheat i not that dishonest lily smiled slightly but james brow had contracted as he reached his hands out to the fire and turned away from her again what are you doing down so early for i was hoping for at least another hour on my own james slid off the sofa and down on to the rug in front of the dancing flames the heating in the boys dorm gone off apparently they forgot to restart the heating charm the others haventwoken up yet but i was cold so here i am i suppose that why tom and keegan left so early lily mused she glanced at the boy leaning casually against the arm of the sofa and how exactly do you know so much james grinned mysteriously i have connections he saw lily expression ok ok i know one of the house elves who looks after the dorm he the brother of our house elf topsy and their sister tipsy works in sirius house topsy tipsy and tolly sounds like a children show yeah there was a few moments reflective quiet james he looked up yeah would you mind not telling anyone about the snape thing last night but james protested i d just rather that no one else knew other than emma i suppose they d probably react the way you did and i dontwant that james regarded her in silence oh all right he said finally my lips are sealed but sirius already found out that i had a run in with snivellus though he doesntknow details keep it that way lily said relieved she was about to say something else when footsteps sounded once again on the girls stairs and emma appeared looking worried lily saffy woken up i think she wants to talk lily got up and followed emma giving james a brief wave hey lily james called after her she turned round halfway up the stairs you go the quidditch matches dontyou yeah lily replied confused well then you d better be there for the next one to watch us whip slytherin next saturday lily smiled alright he grinned a farewell at her from his place on the floor and she continued up contemplating give it your all girl give it all you got you can take a chance and take your best shot i see what you want girl and what you do he never gonna gonna make it with you you re pulling petals off a flower trying to get your way keep pulling til it says what you want it to say girl you can pick a field full of daisies but he d still be my baby i

not lily class had been very much set in its social groupings since first year lily and emma had become friends after being partnered in a particularly disastrous charms class james and sirius had befriended each other on the train to hogwarts when they had both simultaneously attacked snape in the corridor and had soon found remus to be a worthy ally peter had been the one who had flattered his way into their good books willing to do anything until he had been accepted that left tom jacobs and keegan adams together and they had become friends as well as far as the other girls had been concerned sapphire heathleigh callie west and serena parkinson had once been a single unit and completely inseparable callie and serena had known each other since babyhood as their wealthy mothers had moved in the same social circles then in third year a disagreement had arisen between mrs west and mrs parkinson and cracks had appeared between callie and serena resulting in a fight that had nearly blown the roof of gryffindor tower off the end of it was that serena had let the group and began to hang out with a group of fourth years well known for their bitchiness and tarted up view of themselves as lily put it to emma once in a rare moment of sarcastic humour they had their heads so far up their own arses that it made it a bit difficult to talk to them all the hate and anger she had was now directed at her own dorm mates with a vengeance as if despising the fact that she no longer fitted in what could have caused the sudden break between callie and sapphire lily wondered dragging sapphire to emma bed they shut the door and settled down comfortably both girls wanted an explanation of what had been going on last night and now that sapphire was ready and the dormitory conveniently empty there were no obstacles left despite her tears in the toilets sapphire remained dry eyed as she poured out her tale it was probably around when the contest was nearly over we had both finished out turns on stage and callie was looking kind of i dontknow how to describe it not right so i asked her what the matter was and she turned round and said you i didntreally understand her at first so i was just like huh she started saying stuff about how i was so boring and serious and i never wanted to have any fun and that i was a prude because i donthave a constant line of boyfriends like her she she said a lot of other stuff actually about how i was poor and things like that i d rather not remember them sapphire bit her lip so i said why are you saying all this and she said i have better people to hang around with consider our friendship and she pulled off the the best friend necklaces we got each other in fifth year off her neck and held it up broken so she dropped it on the floor and went to serena table to sit down i tried not to get all emotional but i felt like well such an idiot so i left that where you found me she looked at lily and then sighed pensively i suppose i should have seen it coming callie mother sorted things out with serena mother over the holidays so they were talking to each other a lot more this term and besides callie always seemed so snide about everything she put her head in her hands wordlessly emma and lily looked at each other and then moved forward to engulf sapphire in a tight hug dontworry about callie emma reassured her once they had let go i dontknow what going on with her but she had no right to say what she did especially because it not true you can hang with us we d love to have someone else to talk to lily added sapphire smiled wanly thanks just for being there anytime there was silence for a few seconds are we having a moment you know of sympathy and understanding lily questioned not anymore you idiot emma groaned speaking of moments what were you and james talking about downstairs you two looked very cosy shut up nothing was going on and if it ever does you can go get peeves to chuck a load of dungbombs on me in person lily threw a pillow at her and emma reciprocated the three of them were just getting into a very enjoyable pillow fight when a voice echoed up the stairs lily abruptly all the pillows dropped what the said sapphire puzzled is that sirius lily exclaimed it was from the top of the stairs lily saw sirius standing at the foot his hair flopping into his eyes panting lily you have to come mcgonagall punishing james for something he didntdo and you re the only one who can stop it lily came down halfway and looked at him suspiciously come on reaching up he grabbed her wrist and dragged her down the stairs across the common room and out of the portrait hole he was walking fast lily had to jog to keep up so much for a restful day after the contest she thought sarcastically as she followed sirius loping gait it got something to do with whatever happened last night james wonttell her why he used magic on snape so mcgonagall thinks it just because he doesntlike him and she threatening a month of detentions and to take away his badge oh dammit lily said frantically that because of me she turned on sirius how do you know this much were you eavesdropping well duh sirius snorted what else did you expect me to do it a good thing i did they reached the transfiguration classroom pausing for a moment to catch her breath lily heard james voice defiant you can take the badge if you want and i dontcare about points or detentions but i cant tell you why i won t lily pushed the door open professor mcgonagall was seated on the desk looking infuriated while james slouched in a chair his face sullen he did not look up as she entered professor dontpunish him mcgonagall turned to her and raised her eyebrows i fail to see what this has to do with you miss evans it not james fault lily gasped she clutched her side trying to ignore the stitch she could feel snape was using magic on me to hurt me and james saw what was happening and stopped him he didnt do anything unreasonable i swear he was just defending both of us is this true mr potter mcgonagall inquired her eyes back on him james looked up unwillingly and nodded then why did you not see fit to tell me this before james looked at lily for a moment his expression unreadable then back at the teacher lily made me promise not to hmm professor mcgonagall eyed the two teenagers in silence as much as i do not believe you are telling me everything i shall let this pass and have a talk with mr snape consider yourself let off with a warning potter and by the way professor dumbledore wishes to see the two of you tonight at seven o clock the password is ice mice james got up to go oh and potter james turned five points to gryffindor for doing the right thing james smiled and followed lily out how d you know i was here he asked sirius told me lily looked round he must have gone back to the common room he said he was listening outside she stopped for a moment why didntyou tell her you asked me not to james responded matter of factly yeah but still i mean she was threatening to take your badge so james looked at her straightforwardly lily i dont have any idea what you think of me but you appear to be wrong so you should get three things straight i dontcheat i dontlie and i dontbreak promises whatever the consequences he started walking again away from her using much the same long strides that sirius had lily looked after him for a minute and then hurried forward to catch up with him well thank you and i sorry she said awkwardly james shook his head s alright lily looked at her watch shall we go join the others for breakfast of course james said and laughing for no particular reason they headed for the great hall halfway through eating however emma who was sitting next to her prodded her in the side and leaned over lils i need to talk to you she whispered a n chapter nine redone and dusted yay and i dontknow how well the song works but i found it thought it suited and i ll leave it up to you to decide whether it applies to lily although she doesntknow it yet or serena and her twisted view of things now how about a review
