 disclaimer do you really think i j k rowling i flattered really but i definitely not alas i can only lay claim to brenna runa and marianela my original characters which i do reviews pleione thanks for following my story i really really appreciate it you ve been a lot of help glad you liked the t shirt sayings iamsiriusgrl thanks to you too for following the story and reviewing of course here what happens when they see runa devious work notice that i never mentioned what was on brenna shirt only that it embarrassed her none of my reviewers did but that only 3 plus one verbal shrugs roguehobbit i hate trying on dresses too but only because they dontfit you re right wackiness is never appreciated enough well perhaps in my circle of insane friends i had a comment that runa and brenna reaction in chapter 2 when harry was introduced as lily son needs work if i ever rewrite this story i hope to fix it but that person is right it probably is too late to fix now oh well brenna is strangely insightful at times unless it has to do with her own romantic life now without further ado i give you chapter 10 much ado about hogsmeade part 2 do you think the charms will work brenna whispered to lily all four of them looked completely different than normal not to mention more average well except for a small mole on runa nose lily couldnthelp enjoying herself with that after the disaster with the t shirts have no fear if it doesn t at least we tried besides this is zonko s they encourage stuff like this right she whispered back how should i know brenna asked i ve never been here come on sal time to go in whatever nellie the two of them entered zonkos ginny runa and hermione were to follow exactly fifty nine seconds later they laughed when a raven flew straight at them then was jerked back it was a magical pop up mechanism to surprise or scare newcomers the shelves were covered with pranking goods there was everything from the notorious dung bombs to itching powder to love potions lily glanced briefly at a trick mirror that exaggerated one least favorite features and then moved on to the fake vampire teeth wow i bought a pair of these in a muggle shop once hermione whispered joining them they were phosphorescent have you found anything yet loads of stuff lily replied it a good thing i had a job over winter break not only did i earn money i was away from petty all day hermione grinned ginny is going crazy some of these things must have been retired and she wants to use them on george i think she raided ron hoard harry gave him some money but then obliviated the memory so ron wouldntbe ashamed that was nice of him she whispered back where runa she is staring in horror at the trick mirror it a good thing that she not seeing her real self in that she whispered oh look here a book of rare charms hexes and their antidotes ooh i want one of those too lily said adding that book to her growing pile oh this will be fun uh oh look who coming brenna whispered sure enough three marauders and two unofficial marauders had entered the store hey mates the proprietor of zonko said what brings you to my humble shop we need a few more dung bombs among other things sirius winked at him that sounds great not everyone can wreak havoc like y all and some are even better ginny whispered come on let check out i can always come back some other time she added g gerrie lily protested quickly inventing a name for her to save her slip up hey you know me she smiled come on let pay and leave we want to get to the three broomsticks sometime dontwe runa asked a rhetorical question besides i getting sick of well you know all right the others agreed once at the checkout register the girls made their purchases unfortunately ginny wasntquite sure she had enough galleons accio galleon she whispered pointing her wand at harry pocket immediately one shot out to her hand amazingly none of the guys noticed as they were distracted by zonko amazing products ahh a weasley life for me ginny thought to herself before following the others out of zonko s the marauders and co strolled into the three broomsticks excitedly as they clutched their bags of zonko goods and looked for a good place to sit oy runa evans sirius called mind some company i mind yours runa retorted but i doubt you care mind if we join you remus asked more politely go ahead brenna gave them permission you owe us something though runa added all right drinks are on us james sighed he immediately found a seat next to lily who inched away from him as much as possible remus sat catty corner from brenna and sirius found his way across from runa ron sat in between harry and hermione who was next to ginny come on lily flower james protested such treatment at least i buying you a drink compared to all the times you put pranks on me and dyed my hair various colors that a mere down payment on a huge debt aw forget it lils runa suggested i across from black she muttered distastefully and you re enjoying every minute of it sirius added cheekily he dodged her hand which reached across the table to slap him brenna was pulling her already fastened over robe closer to herself as if to hide something come on brenna runa scolded you cantwear that thing all day it way to warm in here you re flushing from the heat runa was perfectly comfortable in her my other boyfriend kisses better t shirt which revolted brenna more than the other girls who were torn between laughter and disgust brenna sighed and removed her robe revealing a green t shirt that proclaimed kiss me i irish runa hexed my t shirt she explained her face a deep shade of red remus blushed and quickly looked away i ll fix that sirius offered he muttered an incantation immediately her shirt saying changed to do you know the muffin man the girls laughed however remus was blushing madly and staring at her shirt what wrong with her shirt lily inquired it just a saying from a muggle nursery rhyme he turned to sirius who was grinning i told you i d get you back mate he whispered to remus for although everyone but the marauders and co read a more innocent saying the marauders could see property of remus lupin on her shirt change that or you ll regret it padfoot remus told him i told you to save it for the girls james added honestly you re embarrassing him he knew that remus was antsy about girls due to his lycanthropy i doing him some good sirius retorted i still dontsee what wrong with do you know the muffin man lily inserted unless of course you spelled it so that remus reads it differently why do you have to be such a clever witch sirius complained to keep prongs on his toes why else harry retorted aww how sweet son defends hismother while insulting his father james commented sarcastically you ll get over it dad harry assured him rosmerta a blonde server chose that moment to interrupt them what ll you have she asked erm 10 butterbeers if that all right with the rest of you james replied the rest nodded thanks james lily told him all right rosmerta replied she levitated ten glasses of butterbeer to the table without spilling a drop then smiled and moved on to another table so m ladies what did you find today sirius asked anything good that for us to know and you to find out when it too late runa retorted runes be nice brenna protested it okay brenna remus assured her he deserves it why she asked erm he just does he muttered not wanting to tell her about the hidden saying on her shirt say lily would you like to no james no i just wanted to ask dontworry about it james she ll go with you to the v day ball runa told him what lily asked ok that sounds great james said beaming i was just going to ask her if she wanted to get some chocolate somewhere after we finish he knows her secret ginny whispered to hermione who hid a smile sorry james lily apologized so will you go with me to the ball too or just to get chocolate he asked both brenna and runa insisted she glared at them why dontwe see about the other later lily suggested however i d appreciate some chocolate right now all right james replied cheerfully you know why dontwe all go shopping together after this hermione asked craftily after all it would be fun to torture the guys through shopping despite what people at hogwarts in the future thought hermione liked to have fun she just thought that reading was fun too sounds good to me ron said we ve already been to z yeah it does sound like fun remus interrupted however we should let lily and james get her chocolate first i might have to stay out of this ginny commented i ah spent all of my money already that okay gin i ll lend you some harry offered thanks she replied smiling that girl is a leech when it comes to money ron mumbled hey ginny protested watch it before i tell everyone your full name you wouldntdare ron threatened um sibling rivalry is well and good when it isnt here hermione interrupted aww come on mione you re such a spoilsport both ginny and ron said before glaring at each other methinks it time for prongs and evans to leave our presence temporarily sirius announced methinks that i should be allowed to finish my last sip of butterbeer lily retorted look what happened to you when you gulped yours down the last time she added with a smirk sirius pouted get rid of the poochie lip mate remus suggested the rest of the guys minus sirius plus ginny and hermione burst into laughter you know about sirius asked the two girls of course snuffles ginny replied grinning what else do you know sirius asked we shouldnttalk about this in public hermione replied someone might hear she added looking pointedly over to a table of slytherins several feet away honestly padfoot remus admonished him you should know better than to talk about that in public but but they know about me he protested probably about prongs too he added what on earth are you talking about lily demanded n nothing sirius whimpered that right james added it nothing that you need to worry about you ll know in time hermione assured her we only know because of some things that happened in the future when i dead lily mumbled what james asked worried it nothing i i think i need some chocolate james she smiled weakly all right you can get your chocolate and then come back here i on my fifth butterbeer sirius announced stop being so rude runa scolded him and drink more slowly she added as lily and james exited the three broomsticks as you wish runie he grinned shut up she responded cantyou two stop fighting brenna asked he she started it runa and sirius protested yeah whatever harry muttered remus clinked a spoon against his half full glass hear ye hear ye one and all remus announced now that we are separated from lily and prongs we shall now commence our first meeting in plotting their demise i mean discussing how to get them together hear hear runa responded raising a toast the others also raised their glasses now what shall we do sirius asked do you have any good pranks in mind moony we could just let things happen naturally brenna suggested timidly no sirius protested i sick of their yelling and if you knew how much prongsie talks in his sleep you d understand behave padfoot remus scolded that or beware ginny added already feeling a bit protective of brenna threatening a marauder sirius challenged yes she replied boldly watch out mate you dontwant to get on her bad side ron warned she my sister i should know ginny smiled modestly now since snuffles insists that we ah act how shall we go about this ginny asked we could use a love charm runa suggested oops they re not exactly legal she muttered force them to work together on a project hermione suggested nothing like research to mione not everyone is a bookworm ron protested we could put a spell on d prongs to make him say exactly what he thinking harry suggested oooh sounds fun runa exclaimed rubbing her hands together excitedly you know we girls should start up a matchmaking business i d hate to see what you d put us poor blokes through remus muttered i am not going to demean myself in such a way ginny added setting up something with lily and james is all right but i will not oh shove it gin hermione interrupted everyone else gasped i d didntknow you d use phrases like that ron said shove it hermione clarified honestly ron it not like i saying bloody or even worse words twenty times in a row hey mates did we miss anything james called striding towards the table with two heavy bags n no everyone quickly responded of course not now i know something going on lily mumbled taking a seat next to runa spit it out but i already swallowed my butterbeer sirius protested eww gross brenna said just shut up sirius lily ordered why dontwe go shopping now hermione suggested um lily brenna timidly asked may i have a piece of chocolate i cantbelieve i had so much fun with those guys lily announced as she flopped onto her bed i cantbelieve harry bought me this necklace ginny added thoughtfully fingering a delicate necklace with celtic knots and a green stone called aventurine i hope ron and the other prats donttease me about it she added oh we ll handle them runa assured her of course brenna dear couldnttake her eyes off remy she teased yeah right brenna huffed i stared at him as much as you stared at siri i did not stare at him runa protested i was just teasing bren why are you so defensive today the problem is that you re too close to the truth hermione explained she sighed when they heard a knock on the door who is it she called it marianela responded a timid voice on the other side is ginny around ginny rushed to the door and opened it hey nela she greeted her what up um the ceiling she asked bewildered sorry it a muggle saying i learned from mione it means something like how are you and what going on she explained did you have fun at hogsmeade oh um i kind of didntgo marianela muttered what why not ginny asked shocked well i i had news from home she mumbled ginny examined her more closely and realized that her eyes were a tiny bit puffy if it was bad news then you should have come to distract yourself well it nothing she mumbled hey you re still standing in the hallway sorry nela come on in and join us ginny insisted this is lily hermione brenna and runa she pointed to them respectively and this is marianela she a ravenclaw nice to meet you lily greeted her the others nodded in agreement the sorting hat almost put me in ravenclaw she added would you like a piece of chocolate um sure she muttered taking a piece thanks it really is good to meet you hermione put in ginny mentions you off and on marianela smiled slightly it kind of nice to have a friend here she took a bite of the chocolate oh this is good i d never really had much chocolate before my mam no doesntcare for it she added so what did you do at hogsmeade i only went there once people kept on bumping into me when they saw me at all they just made fun of me for my nationality we got some muggle style dress robes supplies from zonko s that a joke shop and some butterbeer at the three broomsticks we also tortured the guys through more shopping after that runa laughed you should have come you re coming with us next time she added actually we are going to have to find you a dress robe she added dontlet her nela ginny warned her i want to wear my flamenco dress she replied smiling slightly unless you think that too strange i want to see it runa exclaimed excitedly i ve heard about that spanish dancing you should have come there will always be stupid gits around but dontworry about them hermione told her not everyone is like that my sister hates me because i a witch lily added did the marauders make fun of you brenna asked no i do not know if they ever see me they are how do you say it preoccupied with pranks you couldnthave described them better lily laughed so what news did you hear from your family nela ginny prodded marianela looked down my family is dead and my betrothal is broken she replied starting to cry ginny hugged her i am so sorry she murmured that not all she sniffed after a few more months i am told i must go ahead in time how far ginny asked you can come home with mione and i if you wish and dumbledore agrees marianela stopped crying you are you re from the future she asked surprised i thought you said you came from an irish school yes we came back in time by accident and met harry parents along with some other friends she explained marianela tilted her head skeptically and you would not mind having a foreigner come home with you she narrowed her eyes suspiciously are you sure you re from the future ginny and hermione nodded emphatically why couldntyou come with us hermione inquired why did whoever kill your family anyway well mi pap es de la familia royal y el dictador no quiere tener she stopped when she realized she was speaking in castilian spanish nevermind this general franco does not like my family and most of them have been executed my father moved us to andalucia from castilla y leon when i was little but that did not prevent she shuddered it does not help that one of his men has a tie with voldemort ginny flinched at the name do you always make s sounds that way in spanish hermione asked curiously it is why it was hard to pronounce english at first there is a legend that says castilians used to pronounce the s properly but then there was a king who has a speech impediment a lisp hermione inserted yes a lisp he did not wish to be mocked for his lisp or to sound less like anyone else he demanded that everyone speak with the lisp therefore we say words like cathtellano pronounced with a th instead of an s that a pretty cool story lily commented i wouldntmind learning some spanish myself me too brenna agreed hermione nodded as well she liked to learn everything well everything but divination start with this me estremezco she said carefully pronouncing the s and z as a th i can teach you some gallego as well she added my mother speaks spoke it at home and i also took courses in catal n at school me ethtremeth what a tongue twister lily said you did that on purpose marianela grinned it fun though what it mean ginny asked i shudder she smiled cool i like it lily announced me estremezco i can use that on pot i mean james she smiled mischievously will you teach me to say dontyou understand the word no in at least one language marianela smiled of course marianela replied will all of you tutor me in english people stared at me as if i had three heads when i said someone was pulchritudinous everyone in the room burst out laughing honestly you may know english better than some of them brenna replied still laughing mione and lily taught us that word a few days ago three heads you dontlook anything like hagrid dog he has three heads too ginny added giggling as well marianela put off thoughts of her family for a moment and joined in on the fun it nice to have friends she murmured so what do you think please let me know it shouldnttake thatlong there a pretty blue button below that you can click on it wonteven give you a virus and it will make me very happy unless you are flaming me then i will make a converter to turn that energy into heat energy in order to make hot chocolate or perhaps tea or chocolate covered pretzels mmm that sounds good to me auramistealia disclaimer i auramistealia do solemnly swear that i do not own harry potter i will let j k rowling and the fangirls take care of him as long as she lends her characters to me for fanfiction i do however own marianela brenna and runa arentthey lucky jessesgirl11 i so glad you liked my story and my comments it where i allow my wackiness and randomness to come out and to think that many people think i have no sense of humor i wish i knew how to make that type of energy converter hot chocolate sounds good to me too yum pleione strange ending sorry i just had to get marianela back in there somehow shrugs hopefully this chapter wontend so strangely i glad you liked the hogsmeade scenes thanks as always for reviewing iamsiriusgrl yes marianela is cool after all how can she not be with such an awesome name as for sirius well he definitely got his revenge on remus thanks again for reviewing roguehobbit nope i dontpersonally know the muffin man i d like to though especially if he the one who makes those chocolate and chocolate chip muffins they had at church this morning ah shrek that was a wonderful movie thanks for reviewing and reliving the shrek moment with me ha ha ha ha stayin alive stayin alive b g and whatshisface in shrek are you expecting me to put a chapter here well i d better not disappoint you chapter 11 a place to belong marianela opened her eyes and rubbed them it was early in the morning but she always woke up early where am i she wondered realizing that she was clearly not in her ravenclaw room she glanced around and spotted three others sleeping before she realized where she was the head girl room all five girls had been so nice to her last night when she had found out that her parents had died a quick tear slid down her cheek before she could stop it i cantbelieve i almost told them my secret marianela thought to herself at least it came out in castilian so they dontknow as much she sighed nela you awake ginny asked groggily did you sleep well all right i guess she sighed i ll have to sneak into ravenclaw to get some clothes though why dontyou move in here i a ravenclaw gin ravenclaws have to stay with the other ravenclaws not gryffindors remember says who ginny challenged face it you dontlike it in your room you implied that when you mentioned feeling practically invisible well you managed to stay here last night without a problem didntyou i fell asleep marianela argued i thought ravenclaws were smart ginny muttered what did you say she snapped i said i thought you were smart you re intelligent enough when it comes to classes why dontyou stay here where you re wanted because i dontbelong she yelled waking the other two occupants of the room i dontbelong anywhere not in my school in espa a where the galicians think that i not good enough simply because i only half galician not in ravenclaw or anywhere else in hogwarts where i invisible or just some stupid foreigner who has no right to be here and i ve found out that i donteven belong in my own time i have to change times ginevra weasley how would you like that she demanded yeesh could you be a little quieter lily grumbled we were trying to sleep she yawned before deciding to get up anyway hermione however had pulled the covers over her head now what is this about not belonging anywhere she asked you heard marianela answered brusquely yes i suppose i did she sighed well how would you like to find out suddenly that you ll have a son who has some significance with an evil wizard on the rise to power that you would marry someone you thought you hated and that both of you would die lily challenged i wouldntlike that at all she answered i didntthink you hated james potter she added lily sighed look marianela i sorry that i was so grumpy i always am when i wake up lately it seems she sighed i enjoyed your company last night and i think everyone else did as well i going to make an offer to you you can join our group of friends for as long as you re here you ll have people to talk to people to yell at you can even sleep here i stuck with the others she smiled why did the sorting hat put you in ravenclaw the sorting hat never makes mistakes hermione grumbled before rolling over again it didn t it was strange it told me she sighed it told me that i didntbelong in ravenclaw but it was putting me there anyway it said she paused unsure whether she could continue or not why did it put you there then ginny asked curious it said that i had not found my courage yet that after i did i would be resorted into gryffindor so you can stay here ginny cheered it almost put harry in slytherin but harry begged it not to ginny commented i didntknow that and he one of my closest friends hermione said you know ravenclaw really isnta bad place to start besides it been telling the houses to unite you learn a lot when someone saves you from death ginny laughed bitterly tom riddle isntexactly the best person to be possessed by who lily and marianela asked v voldemort his real name is tom marvolo riddle and i found his diary in my first year she shrugged it not my most pleasant memory i assure you see nela we re a bunch of misfits maybe i will move in she murmured perhaps i will find my bravery well it would be nice to have a pulchritudinous flamenco dancer in here lily teased perhaps you can teach us a few dance moves hermione suggested do you want us to help you move your stuff marianela smiled in your pajamas why not ginny smirked afraid we ll run into mcgonagalll or some snotty slytherins not really where will i sleep though i cantuse your cot every night ginny oh there are spells to make rooms bigger lily smiled we can get another cot too actually we should get real beds for all of you i dontwant anyone groaning about being sore in my room i ll leave a note for the house elves she added donttalk about spew ginny mentally begged hermione thankfully hermione did not use this opportunity to bemoan the fate of the house elves let get her stuff before the ravenclaws wake up hermione suggested i dontwant to use sleeping charms you know what sirius muttered to himself i sick of james no pranking evans alone policy he paced the room bored out of his mind and not ready for breakfast she is never going to fall for him anyway so i might as well go pester her wand in hand he strode out of his room and into the gryffindor common room to his surprise lily was just entering perfect he thought to himself with a flick of his wand he turned her hair electric blue sirius black she screamed how dare you wingardium leviosa she lifted him in the air now turn my hair back to normal she demanded no let me go you know i can just do it myself she remembered it not as if i dontknow the counter hex lily let sirius go all right straight to the floor ow he complained as she returned her hair to its normal color meanwhile a crowd had gathered ooh head girl hexed one first year giggled do you want to be lily challenged ugh black is going to pay for this she thought to herself sirius black looked so funny dropping from the air like that a fourth year told her friend all right maybe this isntso bad so sirius why did you turn my hair blue she demanded because you deserved it lily snorted in derision right and in what way did i deserve it you re not treating my friend right dummy i no dummy sirius black if i were i d be groveling before you like all of your fan girls like i even want fan girls sirius grumbled they re just annoying stalkers many girls in their audience gasped in horror had lily put sirius black under a spell admit it you like the attention only to an extent he paused for emphasis now as i was saying you are going to treat prongs with respect or i ll what will you do james asked mildly as he walked into the room i just trying to help you sirius said defensively chill padfoot i can do my own hexing he said winking at lily the crowd dispersed afterseeing that there wasntgoing to be a huge fight to watch oh you need to get a life lily grumbled before walking away it wontbe complete without you in it lilikins james called after her so what was that all about he asked sirius i am sick of tiptoeing around lily we need to play another prank on the girls we re marauders arentwe obviously padfoot honestly we re going to prank them again however it helps if there actually a plan not to mention the whole group needs to be in on it now i dontknow about you but i want some breakfast it helps to have energy when plotting mischief besides we have potions first thing ugh sirius grumbled slytherins severus snape sat in his seat at potions warily watching potter and his gang especially the other potter the rotten quidditch star cousin a n that is snape opinion not necessarily the author s dealing with james potter and sirius black was bad enough add remus lupin and those two transfers and life was worse last time sirius had used the jelly legs hex on him and james had thrown scourgify towards his hair well severus snape liked having greasy hair it was a sign of prowess of brilliance after all what type of brainy person had time to wash his hair when there were potions to brew and potters to bother it was just like a potter friend of the blood traitor black to fancy a mudblood or perhaps it was his way of torturing her snape didntcare why should he head girl or not he was a pureblood and therefore superior to her but he might as well let her be after all muggle borns were usually saner than people like bellatrix black and rudolphus lestrange lestrange definitely lived up to his name it was too bad that someone as loony as he didnthave a conscience not that severus had that much of one the transfer muggle was answering too many questions correctly snape allowed only himself or other slytherins to act like know it alls therefore she must be punished as soon as she finished telling the potions master that mandrake roots which were also thought by muggles to be an aphrodisiac blech were used to unpetrify people severus snape pointed his wand and said the spell for a jelly legs jinx however he was thwarted the weasley blood traitor scum said expelliarmus at exactly the right time not only did this deflect the hex the weasley had snape wand professor i saw weasley helping potter with his potion snape called out thank you severus five points off gryffindor that should do it the weasley was spitting mad he sent a gloating glance towards the weasley and found a wand pointed at him wadiwasi the boy said a ball of paper flew up snape left nostril good one mate black congratulated him snape tried to take the paper out but to no avail oh ron why are you picking on him that mudblood with the bushy hair snapped honestly just because he is a git doesntgive you an excuse to act like that i no git or if i am i have the right to be snape thought but mione he sent the jelly legs jinx at you so i know the counter spell you could at least thank him for deflecting it by taking his wand james inserted well all right she huffed before concentrating on her potion again thanks ron anytime mate snape wanted to vomit but decided that he would wait until the end of class perhaps i ll vomit on pettigrew he thought before remembering that he was visiting his mum stupid chump attached to his mother realizing that he had put too much dragon tooth in the potion he let out a string of profanity severus such language ten points from slytherin the teacher rebuked him ah well all well that ends well ginny weasley knew that the boys had taken her diary she had torn apart the entire room looking for it still it could not be found for this reason she was now skipping lunch to raid the head boy room where james had enlarged the room so that all the marauders could sleep there if they accuse girls of only going to the bathroom in herds i ll accuse them of only sleeping in packs she thought to herself i bet my diary is in here i hope harry didntread it she muttered only hermione knew that she still cared for him and she wanted to keep it that way after all if lavender brown or the patils knew then they would go nuts cho chang would sneer and tell her to go ahead and take her leavings ginny shook her head and threw those thoughts to the back of her mind business weasley she scolded herself now what did i hear ron say again ginny searched her mind oh right of course they re so predictable snitches she whispered the door opened ha she muttered to herself the room was a complete wreck how can anyone live like this wait i used to she reminded herself accio diary she flicked her wand and said immediately ron trunk flew at her ginny fell over backwards as it landed on top of her ouch she mumbled darn i broke the fifty seventh weasley prankster rule no using the accio spell until you know that what you want isntinside an object that will crush you she groaned and was glad to realize that her wand was still in her hand she pointed it at the trunk wingardium leviosa she wheezed as the trunk was still on her chest she levitated it to back to it normal spot still lying down to catch her breath at least i know where it is now stupid prat she thought moments later she pulled herself to a seated position alohomora she said unlocking the trunk she crawled over to it and searched for her diary she found it toward the bottom wrapped inside a paper bag trying to avoid a hex i see mr weasley she grinned mischievously well no one steals ginevra weasley diary with impunity now what can i do she wondered what would embarrass ronniekins and the others the most she dismissed several pranks as too complicated she would have to act now for one thing they would notice her diary was missing and change the password i know it cheesy childish and the oldest prank in the book but it ll still embarrass them she grabbed ron oldest pair of underwear and put it in her purse i ll have to clean it later eww she then moved on to all of the other trunks noting whose unmentionables each were ugh i cantbelieve i sinking this low she thought wait a minute they re the ones who stole my diary they will pay now i just have to get out of here hope you dontmiss them boys she smirked walking quietly out of their room see ya she told the ballerina dancer that guarded the entire head suite her stomach grumbled well it looks like i ll have to visit the kitchen she murmured as she pranced down the hallway chapter 11 is now officially over so what did you think i know it might be a little short anyway the blue button calls you and homework calls me alas i must flee i ll try to update soon remember that as duke ellington would say it dontmean a thing if you aintgot that swing i ve had that in my head all day well if it was good enough for glen miller

little too crowded in here lily observed yeah hermione sighed i mean the three of us are used to sharing a dorm room with people but it would be nice to have more space not to mention our own sitting room not one we have to share with the guys ginny added how about bigger armoires or walk in closets nela suggested hmm that sounds nice lily said snatching a notebook and writing everything down i know that the hogwarts staff has used charms to modify the rooms for each head girl and while unfortunately we cantget another bathroom for us four i sure we can do something she flipped back a few pages in the notebook i ve been studying the spells used on the room ever since the beginning so that we could have the portal may i see that hermione asked eagerly lily handed her the notebook should we let bren and runes in on the plan marianela asked no but i ll be nice enough to add a small room with lots of mirrors and places for runa to torture us with i mean do our makeup lily replied it our room for goodness sake she added how about a place for each of us to be alone ginny suggested are the walk in closets good enough lily asked perfect runa will kill us if we have walk in closets hermione commented she ll get over it ginny assured her at least she d better i know i donthave half enough clothes to fill one of those things but she shrugged it might come in handy all right let draw the floor plan lily insisted i never imagined i d get to stay in a place so nice marianela said as they sketched the dimensions um how are we going to expand the space without taking some away from the others it a spell i found lily explained it the same way that ginny purse works we need to have some hidden compartments marianela suggested that way if the boys come raiding again those ladrones they wontfind our most secret things ladrones hermione asked thieves did you find your diary while you were missing lily suddenly asked ginny finally and yes it was in their room you told lily where you were going but not me marianela inquired slightly hurt i sorry nela i only told her because she caught me going away from the cafeteria marianela smiled relieved you could have told us hermione insisted that all right though thanks it was in ron trunk marianela added i dontthink ron himself stole it though ginny added one of the marauders must have taken it because i had not yet updated the hexing list and ron wasntcompletely green ginny hermione scolded he isntthe worst of your brothers oh dontworry charlie and bill would get warts and boils the twins would have the tickling charm plus boils and percy the ultra prat would have all three plus be petrified i had no idea you were so vindictive marianela commented do you know how many secrets i have in this diary ginny demanded i cantlet them out i understand lily commented i have a charm that makes people forget what they read on mine not to mention a little surprise for marauders she smiled i might let harry read it though if he finds it she added i just have a spell to move the letters around marianela confessed maybe i need some more security me too replied hermione what if someone learns euskara euskara you mean the language of los vascos que the basques who have that terrorist group we have a story that says the devil tried to study the language for seven years and only learned to say yes ma am that just a myth really it not that difficult and i figure that just in case voldemort has a tie with the eta we need more people who know the language and since no one else at school knows euskara including dumbledore then i could make it automatically appear in that language more power to you ginny inserted let start the remodeling lily announced we only have so much time before dinner and we all have homework the rest groaned all right all four girls got out their wands and began saying the proper spells for the remodeling oh prongsie sirius called do you have all the ingredients yet dontbe so loud james scolded him myrtle being nice enough to let us use her bathroom to mix this up and no we donthave all the ingredients harry and ron are coming with the dragons bane root sirius squirmed as james opened the door and pushed him in moaning myrtle but she s ohhhh no one nice to me moaned the ghost splashing oh please aunt myrtle james pleaded he didntmean anything by it aunt

banshee that not an animal remus protested and to think you re in a school of magic well something with claws then how about hermione hopefully not a cat like mcgonagall now my sister i think she a vampire bat doubtful harry responded i think you ll be a spider he teased his friend ron eyes opened wide and he grew pale except for his freckles sp spider he asked i dontthink so th they re evil he

flesh eating spiders you d understand sorry ron he added stirring the contents of the cauldron all right one more ingredient james announced who gets to put it in i do sirius remus and ron shouted

have to find a way to get the girls to drink it james added dontforget about us ron protested with an injured look sirius decided to break up the pressure building in moaning myrtle bathroom and started doing the hokey pokey meanwhile lily walked by as she did her evening head girl rounds of the school you put your left foot in you put your left foot out she heard male voices say cut it out lils she muttered to herself there really cantbe guys doing the hokey pokey in moaning myrtle bathroom wouldntshe drown them if they entered she sighed lily next time you make rounds you are getting caffeine first to wake you up so you donthear things she moved on as the unsuspecting males put their right foot in and out of the circle to the rhythm of moaning myrtle giggles and splashes an so

reviews would make me very very happy more would make me ecstatic auramistealia disclaimer auramistealia would like all readers to know that j k rowling owns most of the characters etc used in this fanfiction however she does own brenna o brien marianela perez y prado and runa soleine she also notes that although talking writing about oneself is considered a sign of insanity one cannot expect much better when one is assigned homework and that switchfoot is good reviewers pwr2purple thank you very much i know reviewing twice in a chapter must be irritating since you have to delete the review and re review sorry the update took so long i ve had a very very long week oh and i very glad you enjoyed it that one of the reasons i write the others because i enjoy it and i go crazy when i

while maybe that a good thing have you ever seen it done at a roller skating rink as always for this much thanks nightwing 509 thanks i like how they prank each other too and it is nice to see the

dontworry too much no man of la mancha isntsomething one wants in his or her head forever still it wasnttoo bad i ve seen worse movies thanks for your patience well without further ado i present chapter 13 transformations aka lily unknown heritage the field outside hogwarts was calm and covered with snow fluffy white flakes dotted lily hair and coat and landed on her face as it fell softly to the ground she smiled winter was so fun this same beautiful phenomenon known as snow could also be used for snowball fights and sledding two of the most fun activities in the world ah i ll miss winter when it over she thought then again spring isntso bad either she was about to go inside and find a place to read by the fireplace when an owl flew towards her she barely avoided colliding with it what this she asked strapped to its leg was a waterproof envelope the owl hooted impatiently for her to remove it then circled her until she handed it a knut the envelope was addressed to misses lily evans hermione granger brenna o brian marianela perez y prado runa soleine and ginevra weasley she rolled her eyes and ran towards the castle she couldntwait to find out what was in it it was probably from the guys but who knew as she ran through the halls towards the head room she found hermione on her way from the library mione i just got a letter it business she said gasping for breath catch your breath lily i sure we can find everyone she added after lily could breathe normally again they made their way to the head girl room hey ginny nela we just got a letter it business all right ginny shouted i wondered when those silly guys would act she added let me fetch bren and runes marianela suggested oh and wait until you see what ginny found she popped through the portal and returned several moments later with runa and brenna in tow this better be important runa insisted i didntget a chance to put on a second coat of mascara oh come on runes you look fine lily told her impatiently we received a letter which i was nice enough not to open until we all assembled so the guys are finally acting that what i said ginny announced as lily ripped open the envelope a letter fell to the floor by brenna feet she snatched it and unfolded it dear misses evans granger o brien perez y prado why do you have two last names soleine and weasley we the official and honorary marauders dare you to do the following 1 go to the whomping willow at 11 00 p m make sure that you are unseen 2 use a very very long branch to touch the knob at the bottom of the tree this will temporarily stop its branches from whomping you to bits once it is still enter 3 we will meet you there with further instructions harry wishes to inform you that nothing that will harm your reputations will occur within padfoot calls him a spoilsport so are you up for it or are you as the muggles would say chicken messieurs moony padfoot prongs harry and ron so what do you think brenna asked an odd glint in her dark eyes bring it on runa shouted they re just goading us hermione commented no duh ginny retorted we just have to be prepared hey gin show them what you found in your bag marianela suggested oh she grabbed her purse and started digging through it the rest of the girls started laughing when they saw the ziploc bag with the guys underwear that not what i meant to show you ginny mumbled no but it will come in handy runa laughed brenna was blushing you actually someone must sacrifice themselves in such dire situations ginny joked still digging through her purse ah here they are she picked up some wireless objects that looked strangely like mini recording devises with microphones what is that a mini tape recorder lily asked this ginny replied is what happens when fred and george weasley inherit arthur weasley obsession with gadgets in fact they are mscd s magical speaker communication devices they also can record things oh and they are soo much better than walkie talkies or even those amateur radio operator equipment hermione keeps blabbing about fred and george made me buy them in bulk she added pausing for a breath what are they for communication silly she explained it either that or find a way to become telepathic or whatever i have six of them by the way it perfect it sounds kind of cool brenna said dontdiss amateur radio operators though i g3hwb by the way an i hope whoever that is wontsue me i needed one for england ooh cool i ve been meaning to get my license i wonder if i could take my novice technician general advanced and extra class license tests on the same day hermione rambled i wonder if the equipment could be magicked or work at hogwarts she added thoughtfully an those were formerly the american licenses now america only has technician general and extra class licenses it will and yes you can i studied really hard and passed my morse code test as well as the technician and extra tests on the same day do you want to see some of my homebrew equipment i have a cw transmitter that fits in an altoids box it sweet when history of magic gets boring so that why you rarely pass notes with us runa observed anyway how shall we send our answer hermione asked oh and may i see your equipment later bren sure thing mione brenna replied as for the response we ll just find an owl and send them a letter can we add some sneezing powder in there for whoever opens the letter ginny asked sure that perfect lily replied getting out a quill and paper messieurs moony padfoot prongs potter and weasley no one in their right mind relates us to domesticated avian creatures bred on farms for their eggs and delicious taste i e chickens however miss runa would like to comment that she always known that you are all insane miss granger wishes to add that the cretins had better know what they are getting themselves into miss evans the head girl wishes for them to realize that if anything goes wrong she can deduct points she also adds that in said scenario professor mcgonagall will be displeased and to beware her wrath as it is a certain time of month for her miss o brien offers her condolences for miss evans bluntness then withdraws it saying that the nincompoops deserved it miss weasley refuses to comment as she is too busy laughing her head off and miss perez y prado wishes to inform the marauders and co that she has two last names because she gets one surname from her father and one from her mother and that they would know that if they actually paid attention in international muggle studies see you at the whomping willow misses evans granger o brien perez y prado soleine and weasley after the others looked over the letter runa sealed it in an envelope and went to the school owlery to dispatch it to the marauders achoo hey moony what a cretin sirius asked scanning the girls message to them idiot remus muttered not bothering to look up from his homework dontcall me an idiot just because i not a bookworm like you moony sirius yelled remus slammed his book shut well perhaps you are one he grumbled for one thing you interrupted me while i was busy besides he was just telling you what cretin meant james added just like you asked padfoot oh sirius replied why did you want to know anyway remus asked the girls sent a response let me see that james demanded all right prongs although shouldntwe wait until harry and ron get here james sighed well you read it that because i received it whatever is it a yes or no yes definitely yes the two marauders gave each other high fives while the third remus turned his attention back to his studies ginny led the way into the shrieking shack cautiously she had stilled the tree thrashing branches by pressing the knob with a stick but she was still nervous the boys were up to something and as sure as she was a weasley there would be trouble lumos she whispered lighting up her wand hey gin do you see anything brenna whispered not yet bren i need more light we ll give it to you then lily also whispered lumos brenna also lit up her wand is that enough light yes i see someone up ahead wands ready everyone ginny walked bravely towards the cloaked figure then noticed another person there as well both had their backs to the girls hello lily called tentatively the first cloaked figure turned around and pulled down the hood revealing himself to be harry hi mum i see you came he grinned the second figure ron turned around as well the girls kept their faces stoic while they were surprised that only the unofficial marauders were there they knew that the others could be hiding anywhere the others are further along and will be here momentarily ron inserted now we would like to explain the dare ron and i will also participate in this dare harry explained james remus and sirius have mixed up a concoction which we will all drink if you arentchickens that is ron interjected ron weasley unless you ve lost your eyesight i believe you can tell we re not chickens hermione reproved him honestly do you really trust one of their potions at that moment the three marauders appeared at the other end of the shrieking shack with the potion in a bottle and eight cups thought you d never come runa my love sirius smirked although i d prefer not to see your hideous face i decided that i still have my honor to uphold she retorted hideous a marauder sirius asked aghast i believe that what i said runa retorted thank you for showing up remus said i believe that harry and ron have explained the dare the girls nodded and have you agreed james asked oh ms perez y prado why do you bother keeping both names sirius asked i already told you in our note marianela replied why are you bringing this up are you having second thoughts she smirked no of course not sirius whined you re being as mean as runa is that because you deserve it now can we get this over with runa asked impatiently all right remus replied agreeably now why dontyou eight circle around us marauders james will hand each of you a cup and i will pour the liquid james promptly levitated a cup to each person cheater remus added affably he poured an equal amount into each cup what is this stuff lily asked it smells like a skunk no it smells like ten dead decaying skunks brenna corrected her now now a dare a dare on the count of one two three drink it all sirius demanded one two three ron harry and the girls brought the cups to their lips and grimaced as they tasted the potion gross lily muttered before finishing her drink immediately they all found their bodies to be twisting and changing shape and then became woozy pot james what have you done lily moaned before fainting lily are you all right james asked prodding her lily huh she muttered groggily moving her right wing hey what am i doing with wings she muttered what was that potion you re a phoenix james replied gently take a test fly and look around she would have smiled at the thought of having wings but birds can t she flapped her wings experimentally before swooping around the shack the others were stretching and getting used to their new shapes hermione now a huge maine coon cat was clawing at the floor of the shrieking shack ron a fox was running around in circles runa a silvery grey wolf was chasing ron for the fun of it marianela was an iberian lynx which lily recognized from a book she had read wasntthat the most endangered wildcat brenna pranced around as an adorable roan horse with a dark mane i guess i named brenna for a reason she neighed at lily who landed on her back carefully to rest are my claws hurting you she asked brenna shook her mane where harry and ginny hey lils ginny called from the air this is weird i a bird of prey yet i friends with a domesticated cat and a wildcat not to mention a phoenix how ironic yeah well ms golden eagle you can just stop trying to land on me harry called lily glanced down to see a white stag with an odd scar the same scar she had noticed earlier but harry your prongs are the perfect perches ginny objected what are we doing in these animal forms she asked remus an enormous black dog and another white stag without a scar you took animagi potion remus replied prongs you take over the stag smiled as much as a stag can and pawed at the ground all right concentrate on what it is like to be a human and change back to your human form most of them tried and succeeded lily however merely became extremely dizzy she took off and flew towards the door which was cracked open she attatched her talons to the door pulled it open and flew off into the forbidden forest she tried to imagine what her human form was like red hair two legs no wings but something prevented her from changing to that lily she heard james voice she tried to respond but was too weak she finally managed to transform to what she did not know her world was going black and she felt woozy again ah so you re awake now little one a voice greeted her lily opened her eyes and rubbed them then focusing on the violet eyed face above her wait she not a woman she looks so young and yet she has silver hair she mused she sat up the being backed away and hovered in the air her wings glistening in the moonlight you are one of us can you not tell the melodic voice asked before talking in a language lily could not understand one of i a muggle born witch and i have no clue what who are you lily asked do you speak more english can you not see you have fairy blood and your fairy form has been awakened my dear i am fainche your name would be lily aranya evans lily fainche tested the name on her tongue a flower no come look at yourself let me help you up the first transformation is always hard she soothed she held out her hand lily accepted it now try out your wings fainche commanded rising off the ground lily was surprised to feel wings flapping wow she murmured wait until you see yourself fainche smiled gently here is the stream lily bent over to see herself she was still short but her skin was pale in the moonlight her emerald eyes seemed more probing than ever her flaming red hair was even longer than normal but it had silver streaks in it and her wings were silver like fainche s wow she gasped what is i a muggle born she protested this must be a dream no lily how do you think fairies multiply they must disguise themselves and take a human form i mean you dontsee many male fairies around fainche laughed musically but no one else in my family is magical lily protested yes well even if there is the potential to find the fairy form not all do you must have a brave loving spirit to do so lily and that you have i wonder her voice trailed off i must leave you soon and you must find your human form i will see you again you may transform anytime you wish but fairies must transform at least for a moment for the full moon and half moons lily you will be weakest on the new moon now that your form is awakened but there is a potion find a book in your school in our language about fairies it will tell you i must go fainche zoomed away lily stared at the place where she had been momentarily before doing as she asked it was easier to find her human form now in fact lily knew that she could change back anytime now however she was tired she closed her eyes and immediately fell asleep unaware of voices calling her name lily lily james called stumbling over sirius the grim leg oof he changed into his animagus form then continued calling for lily harry ron and the girls were checking inside where could she be sirius grumbled it not like evans would know her way around here true remus mumbled lily evans he yelled what if she was captured by something james worried or what if she fell in the lake lily evans hey is there anything behind those trees remus asked maybe i ll check he quietly approached the area it was silent except for the sound of running water he apprehensively peeked around the nearest tree only to see a still pale form by a stream he stepped closer lily he whispered he prodded her with his prongs she did not stir but only mumbled something unintelligible he changed into his human form picked her up and ran toward where remus and sirius were waiting oi prongsie i thought we d never find her sirius grumbled albeit good naturedly shove it padfoot remus replied look on the bright side prongs at least she made it back to her human form why did it make her so tired though he asked his friend perhaps she tired out from head duties james shook his head doubtfully as they walked towards hogwarts maybe look there the castle got the map padfoot map oh i think i dropped it awhile back james jumped back almost dropping lily just kidding prongs sirius changed back into his human form fished around for the map and held up the piece of blank parchment good otherwise you d be dead lighten up prongs she ll be all right at least we got her out of the forest remus told him i solemnly swear i am up to no good sirius said as he tapped the marauders map to see who was around the coast is clear mates let go in remus grabbed james invisibility cloak and threw it over all of them all three marauders plus a sleeping lily evans then made their way through hogwarts halls until they reached the heads quarters sirius pulled off the invisibility cloak and said the password for the main door see you later james told them as he walked up to lily door he felt like his arms were going to fall off after carrying her so far well here goes he muttered kicking the door who there ginny demanded although she knew she had hidden an mscd on james to hear what was going on with their search and contact them if necessary james i have lily all right where was she ginny found it useful to humor people even if she had already discovered the information first through various means the forbidden forest where else he sighed accio mscd ginny muttered while james was preoccupied with placing lily on her bed and looking at their new remodeling job is that all she asked him if so i need to find the others and tell them lily is safe just ask lily to help me redesign my room when she wakes up sirius snores too loudly and it would be nice to have some quiet ginny grinned are you sure it isntron snoring she snickered i ll mention it to her if i remember goodnight prongs goodnight ginny he left the room hurriedly as soon as he was gone ginny reached for an mscd to contact the girls then collapsed into bed it had been a long but exciting night light streamed through the window waking lily she opened her eyes slowly and sat up in bed the previous night events replayed in her mind becoming an animagi then transforming into a fairy none of it could be real lily thought it must have been a dream nonetheless she felt euphoric as she recalled the wonders of flight she shook off these memories and glanced at the clock she had overslept for an hour everyone else had gone to breakfast if i hurry i ll still make it she realized she felt strangely weak but nevertheless she pulled herself out of bed and grabbed some clean clothes after changing throwing on a school robe and snatching her books she ran to the dining hall lily you re awake ginny greeted her excitedly we couldntwake you up even with water we were so worried after last night hermione sighed what happened lily asked as she spread jam onto a piece of toast everything a blur i had a really weird dream though well for starters the best prank that the marauders could come up with was giving us animagi potion amazingly lacking for their pranking talent and you fainted then after awhile you disappeared and we all were looking for you runa explained whatever possessed you to go into the forbidden forest brenna demanded what lily sputtered you mean all that it was true i suppose so what did happen to you marianela asked dontsay nothing we all know you made it back to your human form and you disappeared as a phoenix james found you in the forbidden forest and carried you to our room it really complicated lily told them swallowing a bite of her breakfast i not completely sure myself well you d better become aware and tell us hermione insisted someone tapped lily on the shoulder she turned and saw that the guys had come over to see her as well lily how are you james asked worriedly what happened to you it a long story she hedged canta woman oversleep sometimes oh shove it mum harry scolded let me eat breakfast lily growled i just woke up after a confusing night and boys what were you thinking about last night she would have gone on but she did not want the people around them to overhear after all if the two heads were known to have broken multiple school rules well it would mean more than mere detentions for them come on lils we did you a favor sirius protested considering that i fainted twice you ve been working hard remus told her other than that i have no clue why you passed out but i might lily suddenly thought am i really part fairy the full moon was three nights away and fainche had said that she must transform ugh this is going to be hard with two other people in my room what did she say about a book lily snap out of it brenna interrupted her musings we have to get to class lily jumped from her seat startled and spilled pumpkin juice over her robes oh thanks sorry she gasped scourgify after cleaning her robe she grabbed her books and hurried with the others to class i wonder if history of magic will be as boring as usual she commented to distract herself the marauders harry and ron strolled outside after their classes it was long past time for a snowball fight especially after history of magic and arithmancy james yawned and glanced up then choked in horror hey prongs are you all right remus asked n look up james coughed all of them obliged then groaned in unison their underwear was hanging off of the ramparts of the castle their names were written in sharpie along with smiley faces ginevra rose weasley ron muttered angrily you are going to get it how do you know it was ginny harry asked it could have been all of them simple her diary isntin my trunk accio underwear james called nothing happened remus sighed he wasntespecially fond of having his unmentionables on display for all of hogwarts to see let go inside before everyone else sees this he suggested all right mate sirius growled but someone is going to be very very sorry that she messed with the marauders however one ginny weasley giggled into her robe as she hid from the marauders and eavesdropped at last my diary has been avenged she thought ok i had an extremely long note at the bottom but it somehow got deleted stupid does anyone remember how to change fahrenheit to celsius i think 5 9 and 9 5 have to do with that somehow i haventdone it since 8th grade really you should listen to switchfoot please ignore any j and lack of smileys microsoft word makes the

love hmm yes i do sort of wish i could have thought of something else but when i was writing that i couldntthink of anything and my friend told me to just reuse the stag yeah thanks for reviewing chapter 14 pranks a fairy and a flamenco dancer sirius sat in his cozy chair in the room of requirement and moped how could they do this to us he asked no one in particular can you believe that there were girls who wanted to buy our underwear eww most guys would kill for that james smirked but you re right it gross besides that one was pure ginny ron added her diary is missing from my trunk remember yeah but how do you know that the others didnthelp erm ron was at a loss for words she was too vindictive to wait that not good enough for me remus interjected of all of them he was the most embarrassed in fact he was uncharacteristically morose even for the day before the full moon harry however was merely grateful this had not happened at hogwarts in the future when people would have gone nuts about the boy who lived unmentionables he shuddered at the thought harry are you okay james asked why wouldnti be harry hedged well how should i know you had a funny look on your face all right marauders and soon to be marauders we need a prank remus yelled slamming a book of hexes on the table aww moony is finally imitating me james teased shut it prongs remus warned him i serious these girls are not getting away with that no of course not james sighed so shall we make them turn red or something that not good enough remus yelled the others stared at him slightly frightened by their good natured friend mood honestly remus you re starting to scare me harry interjected it was just a prank if you want we can give them zits or something but i agree with ron ginny probably did it alone well maybe this isntabout your crush on a certain o brien as a third year is it moony sirius asked feigning innocence padfoot remus growled deep in his throat moony settle down james scolded no fighting in front of harry feeling fatherly all of the sudden sirius joked relieved that remus would not kill him yet it was close to the full moon remus was always on edge then and therefore dangerous right now he was flipping through the book of hexes looking for the perfect revenge i ve got it remus exclaimed as he slammed the open book on the desk all right marauders here the plan he explained it in detail and was rewarded with slaps on the back after they finished plotting they left the open book on the table in the room of requirement he had ignored the small print for once in his life under the spell was written in tiny letters caution spell may have adverse effects on those with awakened fairy blood lily browsed the shelves in the library slowly she did not know quite what she was looking for but for some reason she felt that there was something here that she needed could it have to do with that dream lily asked herself no that impossible there is no way that i could be an animagi and a fairy much less become both in one night she sighed and moved to examine the next section of books she picked up the booke of loste charmes which was dusty for the lack of use no one save lily normally checked out charms books and this one was written in middle english lily shrugged her shoulders her father worked with ancient languages and had taught her several over the summers however it was the book next to it that really caught her eye a guide to fairy magic was written on the old leather binding in a foreign tongue that lily had never seen before but still seemed vaguely familiar despite the strange runic alphabet it was written in wow she whispered maybe that wasnta dream as she picked up the book a spark of magic swept through her body causing her to leap involuntarily and land with a loud thud lily dontjump in the library madame jaden protested as she swiftly approached her honestly miss evans i d expect better of you sorry madam lily replied meekly i lost my footing madame jaden smiled that all right lily would you like to check these books out yes thank you lily replied hmm the booke of lost charmes i ve never been good at middle english so i haventeven read this one let me know if you find anything interesting in them oh and why are you reading about preserving herbs you re not taking herbology this year since you tested out of it lily blinked slightly surprised yes well i thought it would be interesting she murmured with a slight smile it good not to forget things you know true madame jaden responded satisfied with her answer you know if you werenthead girl i d have made you my library aide my dear of course brenna o brien is just as good with running this place she beamed she a blessing lily smiled again nodded and excused herself then she went to the gryffindor common room and sat down in a cozy chair by the fireplace to study the strange book it was written in runes which lily somehow recognized the first section was full of vocabulary and grammar in the silvanic or fairy tongue most of which she did not know underneath the first page was a spell to help lily learn the information while she slept if need be however she decided to flip through the book for now even though she had to flip back to look up words now and then the book was fascinating however some of it was unbelievable fairies are envied for their ability to do wandless magic while there are no male fairies males whose mothers have fairy blood may learn wandless magic if they are also good of heart this however is very rare lily read on engrossed in the book until someone tapped her on the shoulder she jumped into the air and landed on the floor ouch hey she protested turning around and glancing at whomever had poked her in this case it was runa you missed dinner lils are you all right runa asked sure runes i just was caught up in reading five hundred and one ways to magically preserve herbs lily why are you reading that even you dontstudy that much runa protested at least not that she added it fascinating really it is lily insisted her stomach growled did i really miss dinner she asked that and a prefects meeting runa replied lily groaned oh no i ve never ever done that she moaned what kind of head girl am i oh forget it lily at least you didntmiss a class james covered for you and said that you had a headache no one missed you except for brenna and the other gryffindor prefect you wouldntbelieve it bren says that james managed to give out all of the information she lowered her voice let go to your room she suggested all right lily sighed allowing runa to pull her from the cozy chair and drag her to the room cocoa lily whispered to open the door runa dragged her inside where the rest of the girls had assembled now are you really all right after last night lily shrugged what happened last night why wouldnti be all right you fainted twice we think hermione informed her of course it the marauders fault the cretins gave us animagi potion to drink as a dare and for some reason it didntsit well with you and you passed out then you disappeared into the forbidden forest where james and the rest of the marauders found you asleep so that wasnta dream lily asked no we ve been practicing our forms she added transforming into a large fluffy cat just think about being a phoenix and pop you ll be one brenna added transforming into her horse form come on lily try it lily nodded and concentrated this time she had no trouble becoming a phoenix maybe we should practice outside tonight runa suggested ginny however had found lily book honestly five hundred and one ways to magically preserve herbs what a horrible sounding book i cantbelieve you were reading this ginny raged lily evans you need to get your head checked lily groaned you donteven know half of it she mentally replied before starting a detailed explanation of why she was reading the book brenna turned on her small radio which only operated with morse code to listen for her ham radio friend g3zgm they had never used names but she always enjoyed talking to him well she figured that he was a guy by the things he said sometimes but she didnteven know what house he was in at hogwarts g4hwb de g3zgm are you there brenna keyed this is g3zgm yes how are you fine and you she responded although she wasntsure whether or not she was doing all right first lily had fainted twice and now she was acting strangely lily hated herbology classes as good as can be expected what wrong nothing you need to worry about are you sure you are fine brenna scowled at the last comment males were so self sufficient and yet inwardly vulnerable and yet he could be so sweet for a guy she knew who she wished he was but also that this would be the least likely thing in the world a friend is acting strangely other than that i suppose i am all right hang in there things will get better i hope so i have a question ask away i ll try to answer brenna barely kept her hands from shaking with nerves as she keyed her question what is your name she waited impatiently there was no reply after thirty seconds are you there yes i am just not ready to tell you i sorry brenna sighed disappointed but strangely relieved after all she too could maintain anonymity no problem i am in gryffindor this response came quickly very quickly could i actually know him she thought to herself me too perhaps we know each other we do here at least i suppose do you have a date for the vday ball trying to get up the nerve to ask someone someone special yes she is great what is your favorite color blue you the same what do you think of the pranks going on lately again there was a long pause until g3zgm transmitted again amusing what is the beginning of eternity the end of time and space the start of every and the end of every place brenna laughed as she copied the long transmission e and it would be harder if you asked someone in person you are a worthy conversationalist must you use big words when communicating via cw sorry maybe i should be in ravenclaw maybe i should defenestrate you she smiled it would be hard to do that since she didntknow his identity of course she could look it up but that was rather difficult an no internet that why look who talking g3zgm de g4hwb hey low battery pwr need to go 73 g4hwb clear on your final talk to you later 73 g3zgm clear brenna smiled talking with g3zgm always cheered her up especially when she had been thinking about remus she wished she knew who he was perhaps he would help her get over her pointless crush or was it a crush for now though she had to find lily and ask for help on her charms homework she had procrastinated for far too long then again she had done the other assignments right after she received them so why not procrastinate for once only cats had seven lives after all marianela flipped through the channels on her muggle television irritatedly listening only to snatches of each show and movie but marcus i looove you an overly dramatic scantily clad blonde cried click yooou are doomed a voice boomed the monster was green and slimy looking its huge jaws open as it cornered its prey ugh she muttered click you aintgot no place in my heart country ugh they have even worse grammar than i do and english is my fourth language marianela groaned click but i got trampled by a hare and eaten by a bear oh wontyou dance with me bluegrass how can you dance when you ve been eaten she thought irritated click l amour c est la vie another scantily clad blonde was fainting on a couch i hate cheesy romances especially in french click yeeee haaaaaaaaw with one last click she turned the television off honestly she raged who would watch this stuff she sighed and took out her dancing shoes she was lucky that her former fiance couldntdance which her family had considered a fiasco now she could take relief in it without thoughts of that pompous jerk she had imagined herself in love with not that she had had much choice since the marriage had been arranged she placed a record into her magical record player and started dancing to the spanish music ahh this is contentment she thought when a slower song started in the middle of the song yellow submarine blasted down the hallway ay yo la aborrezco esa canci n marianela shouted as she burst out of her room qui n est tocando esa canci n what did you say asked a hapless first year as he turned down his music i was j just playing the beatles he added there were rumors that this spanish foreign exchange student was sent to england to recover her sanity which made him nervous i hate that song marianela informed him this time using the right language if i ever hear that repetitive ridiculous song about los drogas or anything like it again i will personally break your record y yes ma am he mumbled turning his record player off what are you doing here though arentyou in ravenclaw he added before thinking she glared at him he flinched just dontplay that horrid music she yelled before turning around and running back to her room ugh she muttered i hate that song she turned on some spanish guitar music to get rid of the repetitive lyrics in her head lily wake up ginny ordered pulling her blankets away she had already spent ten minutes attempting to arouse lily to no avail mnnn lily mumbled rubbing her eyes what did you do that for she asked groggily i couldntwake you up ginny responded did you get any sleep at all last night you even went to sleep early indeed lily looked as if she had not slept at all last night she had dark circles under her eyes and stared vacantly into space i slept i uh had a lot of interesting dreams she had used the incantation to learn the book contents by osmosis overnight which had not allowed her body to actually rest really what were they about hermione asked as she packed up her books i cantremember lily mumbled too tired to think of a story different things magical things well now that you are awake hermione said in a businesslike manner we can go down to breakfast marianela went to the room of requirement to practice flamenco she said she was interrupted by someone else music and to meet her there all right lily replied walking toward the door wait you might want to change into robes first ginny protested grabbing lily by the arms right she muttered i hate coffee but i think i need caffeine she yawned hermione nodded understandingly but ginny just gave her a blank look before throwing a robe over lily pajamas time to go hermione announced i starving as the girls walked down the hallway towards breakfast the marauders and company were waiting behind a corner for them when are they coming remus grumbled soon moony they re girls remember they have to fix their hair sirius reminded him i getting a little worried about you remus james commented you seem a bit obsessed with this did you even sleep last night remus shook his head here they come ron whispered three two one go remus counted down before they all said the hex in unison each of the girls found themselves bright purple and covered in green warts ginny was the quickest to react ron and harry found themselves under the jelly legs jinx before they could even sneeze at the dust in the hallway runa also was furious and put half a dozen hexes on sirius marianela shot random hexes at the marauders before dragging a stunned brenna to the bathroom hermione was screaming at the pranksters at the top of her lungs lily however had turned green under the hex and was vomiting are you okay lils james asked worried moony i told you this was too soon after she you know remus grumbled something about his unmentionables oh for goodness sake give us the countercurse at least for lily hermione screamed cantyou see she sick i the only one involved in the last prank anyway ginny added glaring at them you deserved it too after stealing my diary lupin i cantbelieve this from you and to think you become a professor she spat out silencio she added with a flick of the wand toward remus who started talking again but could not make a sound lily was turning increasingly green now that there was nothing more to throw up her stomach merely retched painfully she felt strangely light headed we ve got to get her to madame waxley you prats runa snapped right james mumbled sorry lily i didntknow just use the counter curse and get her there before she passes out brenna growled having returned with marianela james jumped into action immediately muttering the counter curse she stopped retching and returned to her normal color thanksh guysh lily muttered grinning oddly then walking into the wall where sh the door she slurred lily are you all

floor to clean it up scourgify look we re sorry lily is sick that shouldnthave happened i dontknow what up with evans lately sirius snapped ron and harry groaned trying to get up with the jelly legs jinx removeo runa muttered as she flicked her wand let get to class ladies and gits she shook her hair the only thing that wasntpurple and covered with warts and stomped down the hallway toward the dungeon brenna and hermione each held one of lily arms and guided her as she sang drunkenly do you think we should take her to madame waxley s hermione asked nah let try this first soberus nothing

breaking her favorite hairbrush in the process before running out the door without her books i hope i can catch the marauders before they do she thought to herself meanwhile ginny pounded on the bathroom door hermione louise granger get your sorry self out here right now ginny yelled xxx lily rapped impatiently on james potter door she stamped her foot as she waited what a groggy voice

girls turned around to discover that the marauders were trailing them shut up black she not in the mood runa snapped neither are we but it her new nickname get it feathers i think i prefer firewings james commented lily barely kept herself from saying they re silver oh like the phoenix she muttered i cantbelieve i actually like that po james it suits her runa added approvingly whatever howler sirius grumbled what she asked oh sirius spent last night trying to come up with nicknames for y all he kept me up that and ron snoring he added most of them are pretty horrid i like feathers he whined and runes always howls at me and the moon i claim moony so you cantbe that remus added hey ms o brien have you thought of a nickname for yourself yet he asked politely windchaser she suggested i dontknow oh and please call me brenna she lowered her eyes yeah moony you know her name sirius was about to say more but harry clapped a hand over his mouth remus unlike someone doesnthave the manners of a dog he retorted before removing his hand whatever prongslet he grumbled brenna stared at the floor embarrassed about causing this much commotion over nothing in front of remus hey dontworry about it black is always rude brens runa assured her that messieur padfoot to you howler he retorted and that is lady nighthowler to you sirius black i am a wild untamable proud type of canine and bother to groom myself she stuck her tongue out at him well you sound like a howler he muttered and i couldntthink of anything else ginny you re claws ron told her i am stealth he announced proudly riiight ginny snorted i ll use my claws on you klutz now let see nela what about you runa asked warming up to the subject of nicknames let just call you wildcat whatever i not the only catty one around here though she joked i ll have you know that the maine coon cat which is one of the oldest breeds of now domesticated cats in north america is very intelligent hermione announced as they entered the dining hall trust mione to know that ron muttered we could call her bandit harry suggested are you kidding me well it better than fluffball ron defended him well how about pouncer that what cats do brenna suggested and you always pounce on the right answers in class erm crookshanks was mainly interested in attacking a rat animagi ron mumbled ron hermione scolded him that in the future we are not and it not crookshanks fault pettigrew was a rat in more ways than one whoa whoa are you talking about wormtail james demanded protectively yes harry replied evenly hermione dontgive me that look hermione who had been glaring at him sighed you re right it neither of your faults that but honestly harry will someone tell us what going on lily interrupted no hermione replied i mean maybe later just donttrust rats and you ll be fine whatever pouncer sirius muttered as he tried to find a way to get them to tell about wormtail something told him that the information might be important at least it not pounce like that evil mouse ginny told hermione she was very relieved that her hair had grown out the day after pounce attacked her hair but had not visited hagrid again there was something irritating about having one hair eaten that ginny disliked even if it was red in the gamekeeper cabin one mouse named pounce was squeaking around hoping that the human with the red hair would come back and maybe the other ones as well he could use some more hair for his collection xxx history of magic class 7th years messieurs padfoot moony prongs prongslet and stealth invite firewings windchaser pouncer and howler to join them in conversation during this lovely history of magic class it lady nighthowler to you stupid runa that a yes by the way lily aka firewings wildchaser agrees completely as long as she gets detailed note from prongslet pen brenna windchaser pouncer would like to ask if the marauders were in firewings company all of last night and advises the marauders to tell the truth hermione alias pouncer the pulchritudinous why the sudden interest in firewings whereabouts james aka prongs i agree with prongsie why should we tell you she has been

night blackmailing the marauders that what it looks like lily we are worried about you we re your friends and after you fainted when some inconsiderate gits in this conversation pulled a few pranks that affected you badly no one blackmails the marauders and wins ok well there was that one time shove it padfoot and i ll let remus answer this one wow windchaser you certainly said a lot are you ok moony requests that the marauders stop picking on windchaser and apologizes for going overboard although he has no clue why it affected firewings in such a way he also wishes to state that firewings by chance joined us in the kitchen for a mid night snack but that he has no clue as to her whereabouts for the rest of the evening what wrong with a midnight romp what he said no one blackmails the marauders eh every piece of mail that padfoot gets is black mail ba dum chiing that a horrible pun i love it oh thanks moony i knew it spoilsport you just had to tell them didntyou oh by the way

said as soon as they had spotted and approached her hermione set her quill aside and turned toward them and what proposition may i ask is worth interrupting me while i am doing my homework we have that muggle chocolate stuff you like ron put in hermione mood brightened immediately hershey s yup harry confirmed hershey krackel milk chocolate dark chocolate you name it so what would i have to do hermione asked warily her eyes narrowing decode windchaser note for us and it all yours james told her hermione turned back toward her papers and started scribbling something no can do hermione replied lily will use it as a loophole to get out of it you should know that being the marauders james face fell but hermione turned around again i wonttranslate it for you she interrupted but if i were you i would look on page 352 in an introduction to muggle codes it on that shelf over there oh and here she handed ron a scrap of paper give this to remus for me will you oisb what is that supposed to mean figure it out yourself ron she retorted she pulled out a silver paperclip to hold her now finished transfiguration essay together what that sirius asked it a paper clip hermione responded it a rather useful muggle product if i do say so myself a what see you use it like this to hold papers together here she paper clipped her essay again and then handed him another one thanks sirius said fiddling with it in his hands oops i bent it well they can be re bent look it a camel sirius announced happily after messing with it oh it looks like a hat this way only you padfoot remus muttered what are you doing james demanded standing here and messing with a paper clip sirius replied all of you we have work to do put the paper clip down and everything will be okay we must decode that message i think he gone a bit crazy in the head sirius whispered to ron and harry what was that james demanded sirius clamped his mouth shut tell me ron or harry ron shrugged i am disinclined to acquiesce to your request harry replied quoting pirates of the caribbean which hermione had forced them to watch dozens of times whaaat james asked get the stupid book yourself and let me study hermione yelled gaining an audience and a glare from the strict librarian xxx sirius stalked quietly through the hallways under james invisibility cloak after a trip to zonko for reinforcements after checking the marauder map quickly he erased it and simply held it with all of the bags mrs norris and filch were on a different floor and he had too much to carry and use the map in fact he was carrying five heavy bags of zonko supplies he had received twenty galleons of free zonko supplies for spending sixty galleons on one purchase he could easily afford this having found the account number of his relatives and figuring that some of the black fortune should be spent on something other than the dark arts unfortunately sirius black had made an error in judgment one lily evans ran down the hallway turned a corner and crashed into him causing him to fall and drop all of his goodies three dungbombs broke in the bag sending a putrid smell down the hallway ugh what a smell lily muttered as she lifted herself up from the ground i could swear there was someone here sirius heart beat wildly while he could stand detention he did not want the goods taken he quickly stood up picked up the bags and walked backwards silently as lily glanced around hey what this lily asked herself when she spotted a piece of old looking parchment she picked it up for inspection later and continued toward the kitchen she had skipped dinner to study transfiguration and her stomach was grumbling from hunger uh oh sirius muttered when she had left we re in trouble now he sighed and continued on he had to get to his room and remove the stench of the dung bombs xxx so what did you think please let me know reviews are wonderful unless they are flames constructive criticism can be

weird in what way i glad you enjoyed the chapter though thanks for reviewing iamsiriusgrl glad you liked the chapter the review danilupin thanks for the review and for typing in my language i dontmind any grammar or word mistakes at all since it not your first language however you piqued my curiosity what your native language actually they did interfere somewhat in prisoner of azkaban according to my memory before they went back in time buckbeak was beheaded what was strange about lily talking please let me know pandas rule the world yes sirius had wiped the map clean that why he didntknow lily was coming hermione knows how to work it but it wontbe worked in this chapter simply because i forgot about that hp lova the tilda wontshow up so that why there a space there instead um there will be much more r hr in the sequel than in this because i have too many couples to write about ditto h g misao13 muchas gracias me alegro que te la encantara buena suerte en su fic no lo entiendo porque nunca le ranma 1 2 y por eso no escrib un review lo siento s que no hablo escribo en espa ol muy bien pero quer a contestar en tu idioma chapter 17 discoveries you what james roared at sirius the next afternoon how could you lose the map padfoot evans has it sirius responded it not lost just in someone else possession maybe we can steal it from their room i doubt it harry grumbled they changed the password we ll just have to break it then remus replied you haventeven broken windchaser code yet sirius objected oh er i have something that mione told me to give you ron interrupted pulling a crumpled scrap of parchment from his parchment and handing it to remus that wonthelp unless you know what oisb means james muttered remus stared at it for a moment and then his face lit up it not oisb prongs it o is b smashed together so each letter must stand for a different letter in the alphabet now we just have to figure out what the other letters are harry interjected i wonder what runa dared brenna to say anyway you mean howler and windchaser sirius corrected he enjoyed using this variation of runa nickname whatever moony get decoding james ordered what the magic word remus asked while he was as eager as james to figure out the message he did not want to let anyone push him around please what else erm all right moony i ll do your stupid transfiguration essay for you good boy you remembered remus beamed he sat at his desk with brenna note hermione hint and a blank piece of parchment o is b he mumbled as he fiddled with different letter combinations and closed himself off from the outside world hermione granger stood at the head boy door and rapped quietly i hope lily doesnthear me she thought to herself she tapped her feet impatiently until sirius opened the door ten seconds later hey pouncer what brings you here he asked loudly ssh i need to look at your book of hexes the page i need was ripped out of mine she added you have a book of hexes ron asked astonished of course i do i need one when i spending time with people like you now may i come in sirius shrugged sheepishly and moved aside hey remus can she see your book he asked poking his friend huh what are you still working on that message hermione sighed it simple really i know o is b and b is o but i dontknow anything else it a straightforward code it not like she had time to do anything else she added with a huff now may i see your book of hexes or not err i guess so he muttered now scribbling the new alphabet on his paper and decoding the message with a new vengeance thanks she flipped open the book and searched for the hexes that the marauders had used on her found it she skimmed through it and then found what she needed in the small print at the end of the spell caution spell may have adverse effects on those with awakened fairy blood wait that it hermione shouted what it james demanded what does that have to do with anything i d better double check something else she grabbed a mythical creatures book and flipped through it faeries while these creatures may or may not exist legends say that they may have seduced or married men disguised as humans in order to further their race legends also claim that faeries with human blood must transform on the nights of the full and half moons and that faeries exist to fight evil many humans both wizard and muggle claim to have been haunted by these most likely mythical creatures throughout the centuries literature about faeries includes a midsummer night dream by the muggle playwright william shakespeare and a faery dance by an anonymous witch or wizard hmm hermione muttered thoughtfully this book is quite skeptical she flipped through it to look up veelas then dragons when the book insisted that they existed she rolled her eyes why is the author so assured that veelas and dragons exist when they practically deny that fairies exist why does this even matter remus snapped he was working on the last word by now yees he shouted after reading the letters he had absentmindedly written well at least you figured it out hermione sighed what does it say james asked yeah what does it say sirius demanded hermione spiel was forgotten err nothing remus replied putting the paper in his pocket quickly tell us james pleaded come on moony after we worked so hard on getting you information we deserve it ron added right harry before remus respond someone pounded loudly on the door harry opened it cautiously as he was the one closest to the door and found a frantic runa standing outside oh no you ve got to help me she gasped flashback runes may i borrow your broomstick lily asked i ve heard that a silverwings is a pretty good model sure runa muttered absentmindedly as she read a chapter in her arithmancy textbook have fun i will lily replied before rushing out of the room runa read three more pages before realizing what lily had asked her oh no she gasped lily cantfly realizing that she was broomless and could not help lily she ran to the marauder room and rapped on the door frantically after what seemed like eternity harry answered the door end flashback oh no you ve got to help me she exclaimed gasping for breath wha huh it lily i lily james interrupted where is she what wrong with her i said she could borrow my broom and she cantfly what did you do that for ron asked i was distracted and forget about that let go find lily before she kills herself runa screamed the marauders ran out the door and headed towards the quidditch pitch followed closely by runa and hermione they made it there in record time only to find lily evans sweeping and diving around the quidditch pitch like a pro but she couldntfly three weeks ago runa protested unable to believe her eyes lily aranya evans what are you doing up there she screamed what lily shouted flying toward them around 100 miles per hour i flying it wonderful she quickly sped out of hearing range unable to slow down and circled around how do you slow down she called down to her gaping friends as she flipped around just pull back and james called however when lily pulled back she simply soared higher at an alarming angle and speed accio broom james said as soon as his broomstick was in his reach he grabbed it mounted quickly and took off after lily who was currently leaning down and spinning around to change directions lily just kick your legs back and brake slowly lily obeyed his order and managed to stop five feet from the ground james joined her what were you doing lily evans runa demanded you barely passed the flying class and that was because the professor got sick of sending you to madame waxley i was flying lily replied i just wanted to fly and i forgot that i didnthow to slow down or stop well next time you try to kill yourself what do you mean she awesome sirius exclaimed did you see that agility that speed those dives runa glared at him she really did well harry interjected how did you learn how to fly and not learn to stop a broomstick mum it was just natural she replied uneasily hermione narrowed her eyes mandatory emergency meeting after dinner in the room of requirement she snapped but why remus asked we have an important matter to discuss she replied levelly despite the fury in her eyes lily it would have been a lot easier if you had told us she added then again if any of us were like peter pettigrew hermione shuddered lily bit her lip all right i ll explain everything tonight lily responded just make it after 8 30 and i ll move up the prefect meeting good hermione replied the rest however had caught her previous remark about the worm an i loathe him what about wormtail sirius demanded hermione glanced warningly at ron and harry but harry temper had ignited with his memories he a traitorous murdering groveling rat he growled and donteven try to deny it if you knew that he was going to hermione put her hand over his mouth come on mione ron protested dontthey deserve to know about scabbers dumbledore didnttell us to keep their future a secret hermione grudgingly took her hand off of harry mouth what would wormtail do sirius asked while lily muttered i knew there was something creepy about him oh nothing much harry grumbled he just betrayed mum and dad hiding place to voldemort while under the fidelius charm and after voldemort killed you and attempted to murder me he accused sirius of murdering you killed fourteen muggles faked his own death and hid as the weasley rat for thirteen years while sirius was stuck in azkaban now he working for voldemort again he added peter wouldntdo that james protested that that rat sirius growled i ll i ll rip him in two i ll see what i mean hermione moaned are you sure you know what you re talking about remus asked quietly yes he is hermione replied evenly and ron is right perhaps we were allowed to stay so that we could tell you things to prevent but if harry doesntget that scar and doesntgrow up with those disgusting dursley s then he wontbe our hero harry and voldemort would still have been loose of course he has found a way to come back to life and i still haventkilled him yet harry admitted growing up at the dursley s well it given me a taste of hardship and i honestly dontknow what to think or do they re evil ron protested and you d still be harry and have to kill him or die james and lily fell down and fainted sirius and remus stared open mouth and speechless i beginning to wish i hadnttold you about the prophecy last year harry sighed he flicked his wand at his parents first lily and then james enervate you know what i think we ll have to find dumbledore he ll know what to do hermione sighed perhaps she heard a voice behind her and spun around only to find albus dumbledore behind her what h how did you do that professor dumbledore ron asked the rest nodded equally surprised ah well i have a way of becoming invisible myself lemon drops anyone i have a bag with me no thanks everyone replied it was unwise to take food from a genius pocket who knows where else it has been is there anything you would like to tell me dumbledore asked an quote from cos no harry replied not especially but there is something you need to know we let something about their future death slip hermione explained ah i see is that all you have to say james demanded angry about wormtail fickleness it is usually unwise to change things in the past however if something as disastrous as your death can somehow be prevented dumbledore shrugged would i still have my scar harry asked that my boy is destiny but why if my parents were alive then voldemort would have to at least knock them out in order to avada kedavra you everyone winced upon hearing the killing curse you dontmean lily gasped this is so so freaky first i find out that i marry him she growled pointing to james and then i find out that both of us are going to die young and my son will survive the killing curse everything is in a pattern dumbledore responded time is not actually how we experience it it can be tweaked somewhat by our decisions but there are several things such as harry scar that cannot be changed however one of you has found a way to tweak it a bit his eyes twinkled briefly at harry are you sure you dontwant lemon drops oh bugger it runa muttered this is a depressing conversation that a funny phrase sirius commented well you re an idiot and i can use whatever phrases i choose black runa growled i hungry you have such a wolfish appetite sirius sighed and you eat like a dog actually you re more like a hog both of you shut up remus demanded he did not like the references to their animagi forms in public much less in front of the headmaster he she started it they said in unison look you two lovebirds will have to fight later hermione interrupted gaining a glare from runa and sirius lily has to change the time of the prefect meeting dumbledore flicked his wand and muttered something under his breath already done ron stomach growled as soon as dumbledore finished talking when is dinnertime he asked oh ron hermione sighed actually i believe there are fifteen minutes until dinnertime dumbledore vanished in a poof and walked away silently leaving them alone well that was interesting harry commented we need to find the others who wants dinner he asked me everyone else responded in unison woo hoo it dinner time sirius called momentarily forgetting about wormtail last one to the dining hall is a rotten egg lily called sprinting toward the castle the rest started running as fast as they could you wouldntactually turn me into a rotten egg would you sirius worried two hours before the meeting brenna decided to take a break from studying and use her altoid box radio there was something about using morse code that still fascinated her plus there was often another ham in hogwarts on she didntknow his name but she enjoyed talking to whoever it was g4hwb this is g3zgm you there g3zgm this is g4hwb yes how are you fine nervous why i not sure i should tell you as i do not know your name it would be hard for me to spread the reason but as you wish friends pressuring me to find a date for the ball so ask someone or tell them you want to go stag it isntthat simple why not it just isn t that one thing i canttell the girl i want to ask is really wonderful and not just beautiful she sort of asked me already but there a reason i cantexplain why i shouldntgo with her did i ever ask what year you were in no 7 you 7 as well do you have a date to the ball no why just curious if you re not asking me why did you want to know i donteven know oh ok have you ever tried to avoid doing a dare well there was the time i was dared to run around hogwarts in my pajamas but i borrowed a friend invisibility cloak hi hi so it didntmatter hi hi i wish i had an invisibility cloak sometimes i feel like i am though not to my friends but to others hmm well that could be a good thing at times you could play pranks easily perhaps but mrs norris sees everyone it seems that cat is pure evil hi hi i try to stay on her good side behind her so she cantsniff me out for misdeeds hi hi good idea feeling better a bit talking to you always helps me think things out same here what would you do if someone pulled a prank that hurt your friend pretty badly prank them back so they wouldntforget it what if you kind of fancied the person prank him anyway he ll get over it if he worth it what happened to your friend i not sure hey listen i ve gotta go my friends are non hams and i dontwant them near my radio it illegal for them to use it 73 g3zgm clear on yr final 73 g4hwb clear brenna sighed sometimes she wished she knew who he was he was a bit quirky but a good conversationalist and very sweet when she had told her friends about him last year they advised her to find out who he was but they didntunderstand she would have to give her own identity to find his if he knew who she was he might stop talking to her like the pen pal in primary school and that was the last thing that she wanted approximately one hour before the meeting remus trudged slowly toward the gryffindor common room in search of brenna i ve got to tell her he thought to himself but if i do and nothing happens or she rejects me he didntwant to think about that at all what do i say he thought aloud hey i d love to go to the ball with you and maybe do more but i happen to turn into a monster about once a month wanna go out with me yeesh this is harder than i thought it would be remus told himself he said the password for the gryffindor halls bertie bott s and waited until the pink lady in the painting opened the door for him he spotted brenna almost immediately she was sitting by the fireplace with a notebook in her hand as he walked closer he saw a pensive look on her face as if she were thinking of something very important i hope it not homework remus thought to himself after all although he made sure he got his homework done it was not his favorite pastime ms o brien brenna he called tentatively she looked up and dropped her quill startled oh hi she greeted him smiling slightly as she slammed the notebook shut and picked up her quill what brings you here remus oh er i kind of have to tell you something he responded nervously um okay i listening she told him how do i say this remus thought yet again er um i decoded the message but i dontworry if you dontwant to go with me it fine it not that it just that he shrugged his shoulders helplessly spit it out she told him i mawerewolf he muttered quickly huh she asked blankly i couldnthear you do you want to go somewhere else she asked no no one else is around so it fine no one else will hear i m i a werewolf he admitted quietly his voice barely rising above a whisper he watched the expressions on her face first shock then acceptance is that all she asked what do you mean is that all remus demanded well i suppose it will take some time to get used to but i she blushed and looked down i still like you remus wanted to do back flips around the castle brenna likes me brenna likes me er i like you too an awkward silence fell between them as they looked nervously at each other um here he told her as he handed her a piece of paper this is something i ve got to go i ll see you later she smiled all right she responded i ll see you then she smiled at him again as he said goodbye again and walked away brenna heart was beating wildly from excitement remus likes me she shouted mentally i can hardly believe this she unfolded the piece of paper nervously not knowing what it would say kre v q rzwak funf ne xazt ne kag dr ivxxvzt dryge he wrote it in the code she whispered to herself as she quickly translated it that was sweet she smiled and quickly translated it before folding it carefully and sticking it in her pocket it not a love letter or anything like that but it a start she thought to herself unable to rid herself of a smile plus lily will give james a chance he so sweet now that harry is here then again so are remus and even sirius realizing that she had work to do she pushed any romantic thoughts out of her head and reopened her notebook let see bucket check in the room zonko special slimy stuff check now i just need to set this up warn the other girls and everything will be great she reassured herself once again closing her notebook she stood up and scampered toward the room of requirement she had to set things up so that none of the other girls would be caught under the slime oh this will be fun she thought to herself notes hi hi used for laughter on cw morse code 73 good luck 88 is i love you btw ok i know that j k rowling would be infuriated that i allowed harry to slip up and tell the marauders and lily about peter pettigrew some of you are probably irritated as well to say the very least but before you flame me and burn me at the stake please listen to my line of reasoning i did not even mean to have that happen it just did i contemplated rewriting that part and discussed it with a friend but in the end i decided not to here are my reasons 1 if you knew that your parents or some close friends would die and were sent back to a time when they were still alive wouldntyou want to warn them i dontthink i d be able to stop myself as long as harry managed to besides you all have seen his temper at the end of the order of the phoenix save roguehobbit although time travel like that is impossible i am still trying to stick to realistic human behavior poor hermione she was torn between basic rules and emotions in these past few chapters 2 j k rowling did allow harry hermione and ron tweak things in time in order to save lives in the prisoner of azkaban because of hermione time turner buckbeak escaped and lived and none of them were given the dementor kiss if after reading this you are still infuriated by the turn of events please try to refrain from flaming me it makes me feel barbecued or something yeah and as always feel free to review constructive criticism or any other comments it my school prom tonight it raining on prom night from the musical grease fits pretty well here teehee literally except that i going for better or for worse thursday i have my literature advanced placement test at 8 00 in the

hope things are slowing down so you ll have a chance to r e l a x thanks for reviewing chapter 18 a truth revealed lily paced nervously across the room of requirement several sofas were placed in front of the warm fireplace and there were tables with tons of food against the wall for the meeting where she would be forced one way or another to divulge her secret however she figured that she might as well be comfortable as she did so brenna opened the door and skipped into the room obviously excited i bet remus asked her to the dance lily thought to herself well she could do a lot worse hey lils she greeted her excitedly you wontbelieve this let me guess remus asked you to the dance brenna nodded her shy smile stretching in her euphoria he wrote it in the code too she explained and well there something else but you ll see she added with a mischievous twinkle in her eye i hope it works probably lily responded before gasping and banging her head on the wall no no no no no she yelled brenna grabbed her arms from behind and tried to pull her away what wrong i have to go to the ball with him it cantbe that bad lily brenna assured her he been nicer since the others came it really is sweet how he sweet my foot lily responded unless you coated it in sugar i doubt it would be firewings sirius remarked as he entered i bet your feet stink from wearing shoes all day wanna smell lily challenged lily sirius please brenna pleaded with them sirius shrugged his shoulders and then took off toward the refreshments mmph thsh sgh dgohtu dheht esfoih he said around a mouthful of food chew with your mouth closed swallow and then talk lily ordered what did you say this is good food you really did a good job lily shrugged and reached for some caramel corn you all right now lils brenna asked yeah she sighed you re right about what we were just talking about sort of i guess i just nervous of course she responded before glancing at sirius hey why huh he asked nothing she replied with an innocent smile oh right i spelled it only to fall on filch or remus oh well brenna thought fortunately for her hermione ginny marianela harry and ron walked in ooh look food ron yelled pig ginny muttered try not to choke on it bro she sprinted toward a sofa and sprawled herself across it oh this is nice i a fox not a pig ron replied indignantly whatever she responded hey would you pass me some caramel corn i love that stuff oh and a chocolate frog get it yourself hermione responded is there any hot chocolate ginny shrugged her shoulders and levitated herself some food what hot chocolate sirius asked before shoving more food in his mouth it a muggle drink harry replied as he piled a plate with food you should have brought some spanish food marianela commented you donteat snails there do you wildcat sirius asked no stupid that in france runa responded having entered the room just in time to hear his comment well i know that i wouldnteat a snail padfoot but i sure we can find some for you marianela smirked at him she decided not to let them know snails were one of many basque specialties an really some of their food sounds gross no offense to any spanish or basque people i ll pass oh howler help yourself there plenty lady nighthowler runa corrected him the next time you call me that i swear i will shave your head but but sirius protested that a bit drastic hermione commented ginny could you scoot over ginny curled up to make room for her where are prongs and moony ron asked shouldntthey be there seconds later they entered and remus was covered in greenish goo what happened to you lily asked failing to hold back a snicker a bucket poured goop on me he responded scowling unfortunately it missed prongs after her first sight brenna looked away unable to keep a straight face well we should get started harry suggested are you kidding me prongslet i cantsit down like this he protested erm scourgify james attempted to take off the goo but instead found himself covered with it as well brenna grabbed a camera and snapped a picture before grabbing her wand and saying limpius that was classic she explained before tucking the camera in her robe y you did this remus questioned but why me and not them he pointed at his companions you were behind the spell that hurt lily she explained and i didnthave time to spell it for the rest of the marauders she smiled shyly before reversing the spell with a magical code come sit over here she invited blushing just dontslime me again he responded smiling back at her all right lovebirds james interrupted while i understand your need to well be together we need to find out what wrong with lily sorry brenna responded lily please go ahead hermione sent her a sympathetic look lily inhaled deeply and somehow managed to find her voice i not sure how to say this you wontbelieve me but anyway i cantlet this go around hogwarts if you want to know you ll have to swear in blood what runa snapped honestly we re your friends none of us would betray you i would like to think not but i remember what harry said about peter and i can t she shrugged and stared at the floor honestly firewings arentyou being a bit dramatic sirius asked what with this swearing in blood thing if you swear in blood you canttake back the oath without severe consequences hermione explained of course there are a few exceptions such as when it would save the life of the person who proposed the swear mione can you speak english ron asked i was look more than my reputation is at stake if people find out that we are animagi we will get thrown into azkaban but this i cantimagine how disastrous it would be honestly chica get to the point what do you want us to swear marianela asked swear that you wonttell anyone about my secret unless it will save my life they stared at her shouldntdumbledore know hermione asked cautiously swearing in blood is a big deal even in the muggle world harry added if you swear that i will tell dumbledore myself lily replied steadily oh let just swear already brenna snapped the others blinked what did you say james asked the normally soft spoken brenna i trust lily and i think you should as well if she wants us to swear it for a good reason she explained wormtail is reason enough remus added oh you re just backing up your girlfriend sirius grumbled remus and brenna faces turned beet red i ll swear hermione decided i already know anyway she pulled out a set of pins from the sewing kit she always carried around and pricked her finger with one anyone else i already said i would brenna replied she took a pin from hermione and pricked her own finger the pins were passed around until everyone including lily had a bloody finger i solemnly swear that i will tell dumbledore about my secret lily announced now it your turn she quickly wrote down what she wanted them to say i solemnly swear that i will keep lily secret as long as she tells dumbledore and it does not cost her life her companions said some more reluctantly than others then lily pressed her bloody finger against each of theirs i have fairy blood she admitted quietly runa stomped her foot cantyou at least tell us the truth after all the trouble we ve gone to she yelled calm down james told her lily please stop joking i like pranks but i told you i a fairy lily interrupted him see while i not a pure blooded fairy only the oldest are because there are no male fairies it doesntreally matter unlike in the world of wizardry or so i ve been told anyway my fairy form was awakened when i took the animagi potion right ron muttered sarcastically brenna caught lily gaze to search for truth in her eyes lily had never been able to lie to her i know it sounds ridiculous she admitted but it true fairies dontexist remus protested even our mythological creatures book says so moony partially right hermione affirmed i have not seen anything about them in magical history past the 1300 s however the nasty hex that made lily sick said it would have adverse effects on awakened fairies it not in there sirius and remus both protested even if it were it could be a joke remus reasoned any magical history before the 1400 is prone to exaggeration read the fine print hermione responded to his first statement well muggles believe that magic isntreal it only found in legends and it is lily reasoned could you be mistaken about that if they did why would a muggle born be one ginny asked well humans are humans to reproduce fairies take human forms if you re a fairy you only have to transform on the half and full moons and it possible to hide that of course the power has to be awakened and fairies cannot be evil for some reason lily shrugged i ll be weakest on the new moons fairy shmary sirius grumbled is there any more popcorn lily sighed see for yourself she told him okay well how else would you explain my sudden ability to fly well when i didnteven know how to slow down or find the brake on a broom harry ruffled his hair prongs style as he thought about that that makes sense you re an awesome flyer oh pul leez this is balderdash runa protested how can i prove myself lily asked transform ginny responded promptly lily sighed it harder inside she thought to herself but oh well here goes nothing she concentrated on what it was like to be a fairy and soon found her body and attire changing now do you believe me she asked in a melodic voice they stared at her in shock james was the first to find his voice lily whatever i should call you i sorry i doubted you you re beautiful he added i don t it not he stammered her eyes beamed in spite of herself it nice to be believed she mused did you know everything automatically marianela asked no only a little just a few words in silvanic and a few other things that another fairy told me that night i found a book in hogwarts in silvanic and there a spell that allows you to learn while you sleep i sure could use that ron interjected you dontget much rest that way lily changed back to her human form and plopped down onto a sofa anyway i exhausted what do fairies do harry inquired i dontknow everything yet lily explained i had a lot of fun on the full moon but there much more i have to learn i in training now she responded wearily the explanation and indoor transformation had sapped her strength can i have something to drink maybe hot chocolate i parched james immediately grabbed a mug and poured hot chocolate from a teapot thanks she said after taking a sip runa walked up to lily and hugged her i sorry i doubted you she told her honestly me too remus sirius harry james ron ginny and marianela added can you teach us some of those flying moves ron asked lily who was becoming increasingly incoherent nodded naptime she muttered before falling completely asleep here we go again james groaned it too bad you lost you know what padfoot he added sirius ignored him threw one of bertie bott every flavor beans in his mouth and choked bleah liverwurst he sputtered james sat dejectedly in his favorite chair and reviewed the night events everything confused him well almost everything lily a fairy he thought to himself well part fairy anyway he remembered her flaming hair with silver streaks her even more piercing green eyes her luminescent wings how can i ever hope that she ll care for me honestly yeesh she even a better flyer now he sighed he needed to go for a walk but as sirius had lost the map he would never know where filch was oh right i head boy i can just say i patrolling duh he got up made sure his wand was in his pocket and walked out of his newly designed private office an he got sick of sharing a room with the fellow marauders and wanted a cave decorated with quidditch posters dad where are you going harry interrupted him patrolling he replied shortly what put you in a bad mood harry demanded if it about mum fairy form then forget about it she still lily evans and if you re mad that she can do something you can t well get over it why would i care if she can do something i can t james yelled she always been better at charms then what is it you dipwad remus asked as he entered the room we really should get this place soundproofed he added none of your business i going for a walk petrificus totalus remus yelled as he flicked his wand at james who immediately fell to the ground now prongs be a good boy and tell dr moony all your problems he transfigured a hamper into a long comfortable red bench and levitated james onto it harry formed two chairs from some of the laundry and put spellotape on james so he couldntget up then they finally revived him grr there got to be something against this he grumbled i going to get you you re going to get me candy to thank me for helping you remus retorted dr moony wonteven charge this time especially since dr prongslet is assisting now talk so how did this make you feel he added just to use a common shrink clich james scowled harry you should be more obedient let me up it for your own good dad harry responded considering that i yelled at dumbledore after fifth year i believe i capable of at least matching another potter temperament now spill it you yelled at dumbledore shall we administer the veritas serum remus asked harry good idea moony harry found a bottle of veritas serum on a nearby shelf and held it threateningly over james mouth now do you obey or do we get to find out your deepest darkest secrets remus asked mildly james muttered something incoherent about violating rights intolerable acts and coercion prongslet open the bottle all right already james shouted just get that away from me no one will ever know that that what sirius prodded as he entered the room this isntabout that time a muggle doctor put you on benadryll and everyone thought you were drunk is it james glared at him but sirius paid no attention his mum grounded him and tried using a soberus charm on him but of course it didntwork remus and harry fought to control the urge to laugh no it not padfoot james responded so just shut up what is it then harry demanded as i was about to say before padfoot rudely interrupted me it just that now that lily is even more powerful she ll never love me he blurted out quickly it took the rest of them a few seconds to process that you dolt remus muttered is that all that wrong well there the fact that i ve been forced to confide in my son about my lack of a love life he grumbled oh and being unable to move do you really think mum would care about that harry asked she just hates your big head like we ve been telling you unfortunately your inflated head is also pretty dense hey james protested he tried to reach for his wand but couldn t as the spellotape still bound him to the bench besides whatever happens you can still transfigure things better than she can harry continued shall we let him go moony no sirius answered before remus had could speak this is too much fun remus ignored him and released james from the spellotape finally he grumbled now on other business how are we going to get back the marauder map stealth come in here there a meeting sirius yelled he heard you padfoot james responded still irritated at least no one else will know about any of that he mentally reassured himself however unfortunately for james the girls had hidden an mscd in the room and it had picked up the entire conversation lily was rooting in her pocket for a quill when she found the strange scrap of parchment that she had picked up i never did find out what it was she thought aloud what was that runa asked ooh what that paper say nothing unless it written in invisible ink hmm let me see it runa tapped the parchment with her wand i runa soleine demand that you reveal your secrets they watched as words appeared on the parchment as if they were just being written mr moony professes his compliments to runa soleine and requests that she immediately drop this parchment as it is the private property of others mr prongs agrees with mr moony and is disturbed at her low morals the thief mr padfoot wants to know if the beautiful ms soleine would agree to accompany him to the ball after returning this parchment of course and warns her that there may be dire consequences of keeping this mr wormtail thinks runa soleine is a stuck up ugly priss and advises her to use more makeup she might look better then what runa demanded ugh pettigrew is a git anyway but what is this and no no no i not going to the prom with black it something of the marauders and they obviously value it let me try lily suggested she too tapped the parchment with her wand i lily evans head girl at hogwarts command this parchment to yield its secrets again the scrolling words appeared although they were somewhat different mr moony sends his regards to lily evans and does not understand why she thinks the words head girl will impress him mr prongs agrees with mr moony and would like to add that lily evans is his dream girl mr padfoot wishes lily evans head girl to get her flaming hair out of ours and would like mr prongs to stop mooning over lily evans long enough to reclaim this parchment mr wormtail thinks that lily evans head girl needs to dye her hair and get a life well this teaches us a lot but nothing at all lily mused it appears to be programmed with each marauder likes and dislikes not to mention level of intelligence lily evans wishes to bash mr wormtail into little bits and stop speaking in third person she added shall we try it on lucius malfoy runa asked hermione chose that moment to walk in shall we try what on malfoy this paper lily responded look at it hermione smiled oh that it just a hidden map but it is a bit comical at times harry almost got in trouble with what it said to professor i mean snape snape a professor runa asked in disbelief maybe of the dark arts no he actually a potions professor at the moment but he wants the dark arts position oh while it might be fun to try the map out on lucius malfoy we really cantrisk having this lost as insufferable as he is he not stupid well we could always make up what they would say lily suggested mr moony requests that lucius malfoy donate his hair to locks of love as it would look much better on someone else an i dontknow how long locks of love has existed but his hair would be perfect for that mr prongs agrees with mr moony and adds that the dark mark ruined his skin and therefore his only chance to be a male model which has saved the world from the disgust of seeing him on billboards runa added by now all three of them were laughing crazily mr padfoot expresses his shock that lucius malfoy could actually lower his ugly pure blooded nose enough to read this thereby sparing the rest of the world the sight of his nose hairs for several seconds hermione chimed in still giggling let skip wormtail runa suggested he an idiot anyway she paused so how do you work this map anyway hermione tapped it with her wand i solemnly swear i am up to no good she announced immediately the map of hogwarts began to appear wow this tells where everyone is look filch is by the room of requirement i wonder if he will get slimed lily said hopefully runa chimed in i should feel sorry for him since he has to put up with the marauders but he too obsessed with punishments anyway you wipe the map clean by tapping it and saying mischief managed hermione told them okay runa responded you know what we need one of these she decided we also need a group name we already have our nicknames from our animagi forms but it would be useful to have a map like this she tapped the map mischief managed she muttered so what do we do with the map lily asked i like your idea of making our own but we ll have to figure out what spells they used to make this we should also make sure that no one can read it but those we write in the spell hermione suggested perhaps the marauders will tell us what they did if they won t i ll just have to use my feminine charms runa responded jokingly or we can always look in the library she added sarcastically let find brens nela and ginny lily suggested then we ll go visit the marauders before breakfast thank goodness i ve already finished my homework i was really zonked out last night no kidding runa added oh no i need to finish my charms essay she dashed through the portal to her room and desk then proceeded to scribble with a vengeance an about the benadryll that really did happen to me i got an allergic reaction to a medication and i went to church in a bad mood because of that well by the time the service ended the meds had kicked in my cheeks were paler than they were the reaction didntshow and i felt happy also i couldntwalk straight and i appeared to be stoned or something not the best way to be at church oh well well goodbye until next time please review with any suggestions comments etcetera that are nonderogatory in other words i can accept criticism but flames i haventfigured out how to make an energy converter yet auramistealia tiger tiger burning bright in the forest of the night what immortal

liked that play oh and they used pins different pins so there no way they could have gotten infected from each others blood pleione thanks i glad you liked it chapter 19 background checks oh miss weasel may i have a word with you asked a strangely cultured voice ginny turned around to face gilderoy lockhart resident dumb blond it weasley she responded i on my way to lunch it a bit late for that and this will only take a moment would you kindly accompany me to the valentines day ball he grinned as if this were a compliment well perhaps it would be to another airhead i sorry but i afraid i can t ginny replied searching for an excuse she quickly gave marianela and lily a pleading look you re not going with anyone i asked first he tapped his foot impatiently actually marianela interrupted she is it just that ginny a rather shy girl and she didntwant it all over the school ginny face turned red with suppressed laughter and nervousness which gilderoy lockhart took as a blush and who would this lucky person be he asked ginny and marianela bit their lips harry potter lily interjected ginny blushed genuinely this time as alarm bells went off in her head anyway i afraid we must go or we wontfind any seats in the great hall we ll see you around all right goodbye ms weasel unless the portuguese spanish marianela responded coldly and her name is ms weasley if you cantget something that simple right well it no wonder you donthave a date or anything else she spun around grasped lily and ginny arms and led them away lily ginny whispered what were you thinking i was thinking that there is no way i would allow a friend to suffer through an evening with him and that i can probably convince my son to help me out oh she replied shortly just make sure that ron doesntkill him and that he knows i not i ll talk to him lily assured her by the way did you find the guys password on any of the tapes bugger bites ginny replied eww i will never understand guys marianela muttered as they walked they were almost to the great hall when they saw students pouring out of the doors i knew we should have gone to the library later lily moaned as her stomach grumbled oh well i off to potions see you bye lils firewings whatever marianela responded well at least i have some sugar quills ginny said it ll be easy to eat in binns class ugh this is so boring ginny aka claws i know how much longer until class ends marianela wildcat thirty minutes i dontthink i can take any more notes on the toothpick what should we do screaming is not an option um pass notes like we re already doing all right so what shall we torture the guys with next um we cantget much worse than displaying their underwear which you already did i think that pink hair might suit them well i cantbelieve it i a weasley and i cantthink of anything good we re going to have to use that potion that makes them talk like animals all day soon to inspire me you never told me about that sorry i guess it never came up do you have a charms book like firewings with you nope sorry i dontthink anyone has a book like hers except perhaps pouncer besides you know i horrible with charms i wonder if it possible to make up spells i think so my fiance ex fiance mother worked with that type of thing well until she was divorced for refusing to work with voldie how exactly did you manage to get engaged and dumped before age 16 it was more like a business contract although i did kind of well anyway not one of those stupid pureblood things right and why was it broken they didntwant to have any alliances with a family voldemort disproves of stupid gits you re better off without them definitely although i couldnthelp having a little fun when i returned his token of affection weasley sensor is reacting all i did was add a bit of itching powder well i may have sold the stone for pocket money and replaced it with glass and i may have put an exploding spell on the glass wait there also the tracking spell in the metal that may come in handy someday i bow to your deviousness were the perezes or prados known for that like the weasleys err well i ve had a bit of practice in that sort of thing why the tracking charm if he or his family actually allies with voldemort which is likely i ll always be able to keep track of whoever has the ring plus i can tell whoever the person wearing the ring is my father was a jeweler ooh wow my dad is a ministry worker he fascinated with muggles but the jobs with them dontpay well so we have to do without a few things sometimes yeah well who cares anyway the death eaters didntmanage to get the family account i ve had it transferred to gringotts death eaters you d think they d have bad indigestion good one claws thanks wildcat so how do you feel about being set up with harry potter claws erm i guess it better than lockhart what dime la verdad translation please i think you re not saying something true so qu piensas i mean really i wish he would ask me and mean it maybe someday or maybe he is just shy or dense even if he were interested you should meet my brothers say no more i wish my brother was still around finally class is over only one more class to go woo hoo firewings nighthowler windchaser and pouncer request a note passing session but we just got detention in potions dontlisten to him shame shame a marauder turning down an opportunity for detention i a bit suspicious myself padfoot what are you up to tsk tsk look prongslet pen is taking notes so we might as well talk whatever i myself was planning to catch up on my reading list sorry about the detention moony i really didntmean to drop it but it landed on malfoy foot by accident actually i may have redirected it slightly before it crashed but he deserved it and the idiot didnthave to give all of us detention whoa shorter notes please you guys should be happy that you have the mm back anyway i need to talk to prongslet what for i smell trouble prongslet not prongs i wounded prongs be careful lily knows where you sleep remember and windchaser dontworry about it accidents happen what do you need mfirewings just a little favor you dontmind do you a favor huh watch prongslet she probably wants you to sneak into filch office or something you re so ridiculous did you know that wait rhetorical question so does anyone want to go to the kitchens after class good idea windchaser hey pouncer you haventsaid anything in awhile i borrowing a book about celtic myths from claws it quite interesting it even has information about the different runes eh did someone call me oh brens the kitchen idea is wonderful obviously not you re so mean howler p so what the favor windchaser they re right great idea look who lovesick now moony prongs anyway i ll ask you after class prongslet no just spit it out unless it something illegal why candleflame you really shouldntbreak too many rules um prongs you do realize how ironic it is that you said that dontyou well he is head boy now so he behaves more than he used to which isntsaying much it firewings and look who talking anyway claws was cornered by lockhart who wouldntaccept no for an answer until i told him that she already had a date to the ball that git i ll kill him just dontkill me stealth i d like to live thank you very much why would i kill you you re my best mate because mum obviously wants me to take your little sister to the ball oh well we already discussed this before didntwe just donthurt her in any way or you will face the wrath of many weasleys in the future aww prongslet got a date we ll have to prepare him potters always fall for the redheads it seems oh and firewings candleflames are pretty and fiery and so are you get the connection yaddayaddayadda i hope your mum didntsend you another book of poetry to culture you honestly padfoot you could learn something from it take shakespearian plays for example i knew that it was bad when you took a muggle correspondence course a few years ago actually some of it not bad you understand shakespearian english well he reads my copies of the play which has translations in it i dared him to read the merchant of venice around 5th year and i afraid he got hooked i should have known you d read that one by the way you act hmm i way too busy for that hey is that amos diggory who is making out with that blonde in class ewww gross yep that diggory all right i never thought binns was that oblivious why runa ignored the note and jumped up from her seat amos diggory you you cheating dimwitted scoundrel you vile insignificant speck of dirt you psychopath runa yelled it all off miss smith why are you interrupting my class professor binns asked she pointed to the couple oh detention mr dogworm he said now as i was saying the goblins were amos you said you werentdating anyone the girl slapped him and walked out of class professor binns paid no mind only earthquakes and screaming could rouse his attention after all he was a ghost i cantbelieve he did that grr me neither that was disgusting were you really dating him shudder seventy points off of ravenclaw for cheating on my friend lily said quietly thanks lils you re a pal i think you need to get some chocolate or something let get you to the kitchens fast after class he trying to be nice i also am sorry you had to deal with that chocolate is a very consoling thing though yep i ve got quidditch practice but after that the field is free feel free to fly stop pitying me he asked me to the ball that all i ve been so busy with you guys that i shouldntbe upset you re turning down chocolate frogs where hogwart kitchen and diggory still a jerk definitely so prongslet will you help me out sure it not like i have a choice the bell rang and hermione closed her book to write a quick note hey there was a bit of commotion earlier what going on class is out and i getting chocolate not to mention breaking amos diggory nose do you mind after she finished writing runa jumped up walked over to the aforementioned ravenclaw and proceeded to thrust her fist into his face thus knocking him to the floor with a crack unconscious never mind i dontwant to know she just needs to get something out of her system class is over we can stop writing now duh to the kitchens windchaser firewings why dontyou see if you can grab lady nighthowler methinks the exertion will have given her a wolfish appetite i didntknow howler could punch that hard sirius said for what seemed like the billionth time true she usually just hexes you james responded only half listening you know what we need to do another prank i couldnthave said it better myself remus said well perhaps i could sirius interjected oh yeah then do it james challenged we the marvelously mischievous marauders need to carry out another brilliant prank you didntexactly say it better you just elaborated harry commented whatever prongslet now what shall we do something big after all we need to celebrate the return of the marauders map ginny had felt guilty about how harry was trapped into going to the ball with her and had convinced the others to return the map sure why not ron agreed but what i dunno but we haventplayed a prank on the slytherins in awhile sirius commented and there a game between gryffindor and slytherin this weekend but lily hates it when we pick on them james objected especially snivvely besides i think i should try to make amends if he hates harry in the future because of me she dislikes it when you hex snape she played pranks on us remus reminded him impatiently besides putting him up in the air and turning him upside down so that his underwear showed like you did in fifth year was unreasonable you were being as she said a bullying toerag but he hexed me too it took forever for some of those gashes to heal james protested although that the maddest i ve ever seen her and that still snape worst memory in the future harry put in as i said before he loathes me because i your son he paused that the only time i haventbeen proud to be your son he added james looked ashamed look we re going to do something general against the slytherins and no bodily harm besides snivelly is so so he a git ron growled come on ron stealth harry protested can we just do something with the gryffindor colors remus asked i believe that a decent compromise all right james agreed with an excited grin let see ohh we can add their green to the mix too make them green with envy remus groaned good one dad harry told him oh and dontyou think our potions classroom needs a bit of decoration yeah maybe we can make it less of a dungeon for us remus commented thoughtfully and more for the slytherins all right ron shouted hey i just thought of another pun that might help we ll make them see red the rest of the marauders groaned then slapped him on the back good one stealth sirius approved it took a while to update i know but i really have been busy and will continue to be busy i stayed up until 11 and rose at 3 to work on an essay last night and i will need to do more work on that plus a few projects oooh well some of them sound like fun sort of hmm i wasted time over the last few weeks trying to get rid of spyware and it turns out that all i had to do was delete all the files in my temporary internet files folder oops well it gone so that all that matters and i have proved that microsoft is defunct on the side of evil i didntsay that if you re going to go after me bill gates their anti spyware beta program did not catch it i begged my mom to let me stay home today and sleep but she insisted that i go to the straight a breakfast thing at school i er didntcare that much about free food when i was that sleepy but they made me go and i found out why they had wanted me to go i got the foreign language student award which is a framed piece of paper but hey it was kind of nice to be recognized and two of my friends also got awards yaay well stick around if you like the story there will be more to come review if you wish to but no flames i dontknow how to convert it to heat energy yet auramistealia first of all thank you for reading this disclaimer harry potter not mine i am waaay too poor for that however my original characters are plot harry messes with hermione time turner and gets sent back to the marauders time hermione ron and ginny soon follow as does chaos i mean what else do you expect with the marauders lily and co please read and review and try to enjoy the story i prefer honesty but i also dislike flames thanks thanks to reviewers pleione thanks so much i glad you liked the first chapter i hope you like the rest too congrats on being the first reviewer roguehobbit should be interesting yeah i like working with these characters they reso well fun to work with and yes if ron were in charge of getting harry back when he hungry you re right harry would probably be stuck i like ron well enough though lilaznangel23 thanks so much yes i had too much mythology last year between ancient history and latin perhaps blackmail is useful it sure works for you and now for chapter two chapter two meet the parents part 1 i see you have been admiring my wizard chess set dumbledore voice boomed ginny turned around slowly almost fearfully until she saw his twinkling blue eyes hello professor dumbledore she greeted him it a pleasure to see you here ms weasley would you like a lemon drop he asked pulling out a bag of yellow candy no thank you sir well you might as well make yourself comfortable have a seat is there anything you would like to tell me ginny bit her lip as a matter of fact i would she replied steadily it wouldnthappen to do with a certain missing person would it he asked n yes sir she replied ducking her head i thought it must be well he added looking at his watch it almost time for ron and hermione to arrive he added just then the door creaked open ah being right is one of the simple pleasures of old age dumbledore what are you doing here gin ron demanded none of your business ron weasley why dontyou all take a seat dumbledore asked mildly they immediately followed his order now ms granger would you mind informing me about your presence here professor dumbledore harry was playing with my time turner earlier today and now he is missing we have idea what year he fled to sir and do not know whether or not he is in danger ah how unfortunate well we will have to remedy that situation we want to go after him ron announced boldly that is hermione and i he added in a more subdued voice i coming too ginny insisted no you re not ron objected what would mum say we donteven know what year he in hermione interrupted anyway why cantshe come with us well before this lovely argument results in major injury i have something to say dumbledore said quietly the room was immediately quiet i believe your friend harry is in his parents seventh year perhaps in the winter yes i do believe he came there in the winter can we bring him back ron asked it might take awhile as i recall all four of you made an extended visit his eyes twinkled how precise of calculations can you give us for how to find harry hermione asked time travel is always an imprecise act dumbledore replied wait ron interrupted did you just say the four of us that means i coming too ginny shouted so take that prat what will mum say ron moaned she ll be fine after all wontwe meet her possibly ron looked horrified at ginny comment oh ron hermione muttered so how are we going to pinpoint harry hermione asked try seventeen turns on the time turner perhaps you ll get to see the first stones laid for hogwarts foundation hermione groaned yes seventeen turns should do it dumbledore added satisfied with his estimate make sure you all travel together what did you just say lily evans asked harry amazed at the potter look alike facing her are you my mum lily evans harry asked i got thrown back in time what in merlin name are you talking about i i harry muttered i was playing with my friend time turner and found myself here i d know you anywhere from the pictures dumbledore gave me and the mirror of erised so you re my son lily asked but you look just like that prat potter she protested yes well that because he my father harry muttered wondering whether or not she would believe him if she didn t he would assuredly be hexed where some veritas serum when you need it lily muttered look i ve got your eyes is that enough proof harry pleaded he felt like an idiot then again it not every day you are thrown back in time to meet your parents lily shook her head in amazement i believe you harry lily told him but i didnteven tell you my name harry objected arentyou my son she smiled harry smiled back relieved look harry you ve got to disappear potter will be back any minute to vex me why dontyou lily was interrupted with a pop in which ron ginny and hermione appeared with their luggage what are you doing here harry demanded before they could say anything really harry is this how you thank us for saving your lost little self ginny retorted i cantbelieve i didntpull that thing away from you you re so hermione started to lecture mione cantyou stop shouting for one moment ron protested come follow me to my room lily demanded we can talk there without eavesdroppers she added glancing pointedly at a painting of a lady in a tutu would you mind making sure potter doesntfind out she asked it oh sure thing lily anything to keep you from shrieking at him for a day or so lily sighed in relief all right off to the head suite lily announced and harry do try to make sure the marauders dontsee you i sorry about my temper back there potter seems to set it off and leave it there for the next few people i meet lily apologized no problem hermione responded all males can be prats sometimes especially if they dontget their way oh is that rideo ramblis a guide to obscure charms that i see on your desk she asked excitedly i ve heard it has all kinds of interesting things in it but i haventmanaged to get it from the restricted section yet lily smiled yes i ve been poring over it in my spare hours it kind of hard keeping up with everything as head girl between that and potter i done in speaking of dad how shall i introduce myself to him harry asked his green eyes lit with mischief ever wanted to play a trick on a marauder lily eyes matched his exactly oh yes there was the time i stuck potter in his broom for a day before finally letting him out that was a stitch although he always attached to it anyway she smirked he knew about that one but the rest well i ve always been good at charms she added modestly you re bloody amazing ron put in lily blushed so ronniekins any ideas for how to bother harry dad ginny asked dontcall me ronniekins ginny ignored him so is there a way to say make harry invisible to everyone save a few people asked ginny hermione brightened that right lily could you trap him in a mirror where only james can see or hear him bloody brilliant mione said ron i think i could do that lily mused the hard part is adding the anti tracking hex onto the chain of charms say what shall we do if potter tries to track us she asked flipping through rideo ramblis if you stick me in the mirror how will you get me out if he tries to hex me harry asked could you add some sort of protection to that hmm this is complicated we ll have to map this out why use an obscure charm ginny interrupted with a smirk wouldntit make james feel more humiliated to be under a spell that almost everyone has heard of hmm you do have a point there how about the habenarum charm ginny suggested that so easy to resist countered lily not if you combine it a strengthening charm hermione argued try vehementer harry suggested lily and ginny both smiled habenarum vehementer that just might do the trick this is going to be fun lily smiled now we had better plan this out operation prank marauders known from here on as p m is go next chapter harry meets james lol as do the rest i ah have the first ten chapters written already dontknow how long until the muse comes back though well i hope you

actually i dontowe him anything chapter 20 sequestradoras dedicated to mary powell lily walked into the dining hall yawning still half asleep she had stayed up late reading a charms book hermione and ginny had barely managed to drag her out of bed after piling waffles on her plate smothering them in syrup and taking her first bite she then realized that the dining hall was not anywhere near as quiet as it normally was in the morning in fact the slytherins were screaming and running around and the rest of the houses were laughing like crazy she rubbed her eyes to make sure that she was seeing correctly their skin was green their hair was gryffindor red and gold and their robes were the same their house banners had been transformed into gryffindor ones one the one in the middle was written cheers for gryffindor may the bravest win the match she burst into hysterical laughter when she realized what the slytherins were screaming nooo everything is red get it away it evil i cantbelieve someone did that she thought to herself that is just too funny when she could finally stop laughing long enough to speak she turned to brenna who was sitting next to her the marauders did this didntthey she whispered into her ear who else brenna replied also laughing so that what remus was so busy with last night unfortunately i see several of the puns they must have used in planning their prank what they re green with envy and seeing red brenna rolled her eyes we ll have to congratulate them she responded then get them while they arentlooking brenna o brien i so proud of you lily exclaimed speaking louder the cafeteria had quieted down by now the slytherins were sulking and now she could be heard proud of her for what sirius asked i built a new transceiver last weekend brenna replied she had so that wasnta lie it was just a bit misleading you re a ham radio operator remus asked yes i g4hwb remus gaped at her you re darling you re brenna blushed this was the first time he had called her anything like that before then something else clicked you re g3zgm brenna gasped wow we ve been talking to each other for all these years without knowing it she smiled remembering their conversation before he had asked her out where he was talking about her well in reality he only answered her note but she still couldntstop smiling oh great lovebirds lily groaned the day dragged by for the girls while it was funny at first to see the slytherins going crazy but after awhile their hysteria became annoying it was hard to concentrate in class when people were muttering red red everything red gah 5 gryffindors under their breath they noticed that even the marauders were starting to get irritated ginny sent a message mid day that they were having a mandatory meeting after dinner complete with refreshments from the kitchen when they had finished in the dining hall ginny and marianela went in search of refreshments for the meeting they arrived at the room with their arms full of chocolate chip cookies brownies peanut butter fudge and many other chocolate products mm chocolate hermione exclaimed when they entered she lily brenna and runa were sitting on the beds but immediately found a tray for the snacks i wish i didnteat so much for dinner runa commented oh well i ve still got plenty of room in my stomach she popped a piece of peanut butter fudge in her mouth yum this is addicting leave some for the rest of us lily protested as she too filled a plate with refreshments yeah especially the carriers ginny added dontworry there plenty marianela consoled her that is there enough if we can keep runes from eating all of the fudge she teased so what the meeting about gin brenna asked well it past time to pull another prank on the boys do you remember my potion that makes them talk like an animal for a day everyone nodded so you think we should do it tonight runa asked does anyone have their password bugger bites lily ginny and marianela replied simultaneously dontask ginny added eww gross hermione runa and brenna responded why are males so immature brenna asked i think that the ultimate question although i doubt the answer is 42 hermione joked huh runa interjected why would 42 be the answer it in a hilarious muggle science fiction book that hermione made me read ginny replied it called the hitchhiker guide to the galaxy oh brenna responded i ll have to read it so who will take the potion to their room it has to be someone who knows remus secret she thought mentally erm why dontwe draw names from a hat marianela suggested sure lily grabbed a sheet of parchment tore it into six pieces and wrote their names on them hermione supplied the hat why dontyou draw runes she nodded and reached over to grab a piece of parchment from the box after unfolding it she grinned with relief it our very own phoenix fairy lily evans runa announced lily groaned oh well i can do it she shrugged i know the password and i can put sleeping charms on them yeah just remember to make sure you dontgive any to remus brenna responded why not runa asked he deserves it he has an allergy to one of the ingredients hermione supplied wait snape announced at the end of my second year shove it ginny brenna told her if remus wants runes and nela to know he ll tell them runa and marianela rolled their eyes at each other hmph i see they want to leave us in the dark after all we ve done for them marianela joked ungrateful wretches hey we need a name runa announced the marauders have their own name so why dontwe what shall we call ourselves las secuestradoras marianela suggested huh ginny asked what that the kidnappers she translated lily burst into laughter that would be funny except we haventreally kidnapped anyone and that might freak professor mcgonagall out she said we could call ourselves the vagabonds runa suggested maybe hermione replied thoughtfully i kind of like secuestradoras myself though i kidnapped their underwear so it would work ginny threw in they all laughed you know i think it ll work brenna said all right lily agreed is anyone opposed no one spoke up then we re the secuestradoras watch out marauders woo hoo as our first act under our new identity i hereby knight firewings to carry out our first prank runa announced she tapped lily on the shoulders with her wand lily laughed then did the same to her soon everyone was knighted all for one and one for all hermione exclaimed quoting the three musketeers pulchritude pranks provocateurs and intelligence instead of asking what provocateur meant they raised their brownies in a toast and bit into them nothing like chocolate to complete a naming ceremony runa commented happily is there any more peanut butter fudge hermione do you remember the little performing arts prank you suggested a few days ago lily asked suddenly oh let just eat some chocolate ginny grumbled one prank at a time secuestradora oh can you pass me some butterbeer lily stalked over to the boys room with apprehension at two o clock in the morning it was hard to tell whether or not they were all sleeping the loud snoring emanating from several of the occupants could have woken one of them after setting a silencing spell on the door so it wouldntcreak she said the password to open the door it immediately obeyed and she walked in as quietly as she could she put sleeping charms on the four boys that she could barely see in the dark where was the fifth bed lumos she whispered her wand lit up she saw a door that led to where she supposed the fifth person was she walked over to the first bed she saw which turned out to be remus she stuck a note on top of the blanket where she hoped that he would find it before the others awoke next was ron who was one of the loudest snorers that she had ever heard she carefully opened the bottle and used an eyedropper to put some of the potion in his mouth she moved on to sirius the other loud snorer in the room and then harry who was talking in his sleep oh boy he ll never be able to hide anything she thought to himself she thought she may have caught ginny name among the mumbled words but it was hard to tell with sirius and ron snoring that would be good if it was she decided now where james she jumped slightly startled that she had started to think of him on a first name basis then shrugged i ve got to get on with this just one more person and i done she crept toward door and peered in james appeared to be sound asleep which she was thankful for this should be easy she assured herself approaching him quietly she noticed that he was smiling in his sleep i wonder what he dreaming about she thought she leaned closer holding the eyedropper then tried to recoil when he grabbed her wrapped his arms around her and pulled her to his chest oh no he awake she moaned to herself i knew i should have put a sleeping charm on him she blinked and then looked more closely at him from her uncomfortable position no he sleeping he breathing deeply and his eyes are closed she noted with surprise i love you lily he murmured in his sleep lily blinked again shocked her grandmother had told her once that when people talk in their sleep they often let out the things they guard most closely she had no time to think about this she knew carefully she freed herself from his arms and hoped that he wouldntwake up he didn t he was still sound asleep again she took the eyedropper and let a drop of potion drop into his mouth her mind muddled with mixed emotions she could barely keep her footsteps silent as she made her exit goodnight james she whispered under her breath before opening her own door where she was greeted by the rest of the girls in her room how did it go ginny asked did anyone wake up no but i forgot to take the sleeping charms off them she admitted and i was too lazy to put one on james you look a bit in shock marianela noted are you all right yes i suppose she looked down for a moment james hugged me and said he loved me hermione blinked surprised i thought you said no one woke up he was sound asleep he talks in his sleep so does harry she laughed softly it must be a potter trait as for sirius and ron well they were snoring up a storm ginny marianela and hermione burst into laughter as well i told you he snored ginny snickered good ol ron oh hermione has he asked you to the ball yet yesterday she responded i figured i might as well say yes since he shut up about my going with victor krum the enemy fourth year ginny snorted he only shut up because vicky cantwrite you while we re in the past do you even like the bugger which one vicky the one who cantpronounce your name marianela laughed hermione is easy to pronounce she objected not to vicky krum the best he can do is herm ninny i believe now dontmake fun of him he a foreigner and no i dontlike him that way he just a friend whatever ginny replied i still think it funny that he cantpronounce your name so did harry say anything yes but i couldntunderstand much of it ron and sirius were snoring too loudly i may have caught your name though she winked at ginny who blushed and buried her face in her pillow so maybe my setting you up with him will be better than you thought although i should think you d be grateful not to be spending the evening with lockhart they all shuddered at the thought marianela yawned i going back to sleep she whispered lily yawned a few seconds later good idea goodnight everyone she said sweet dreams she found her bed and climbed under the covers hermione turned out the lights they fell asleep quickly dreaming of how hilarious their prank would be xxxxxxxxxxxxx james woke up stretched and yawned sleepily he yawned again something didntsound right he got dressed quickly then went out to the main section of his room to find that remus harry sirius and ron were still asleep he went to wake up remus with a shout it would be fun since he was normally the first one up eeauuhh he yelled he jumped back startled he had meant to say wake up moony he now tried to say his own name eeeauuhh came out again he pinched himself to make sure he wasntdreaming and then prodded each of the others none of them woke up what the heck is going on here james wondered it must be a prank he narrowed his eyes how did they get in here this is not good not at all he grabbed a notebook exited his room and knocked on the head girl room hermione cracked the door open while holding a hairbrush in one hand and a notebook in another good morning what brings you here she asked he scribbled a note on the paper and showed it to her moony and the others are still asleep and i canttalk right prongs are you sure she asked suspiciously why cantyou talk i guessing that you know something about that james scribbled dontbother keeping a straight face i cantdo magic when i am like this take the sleeping charms off of the others hermione smiled at the note why should i please pouncer maybe she responded hey mione who at the door lily asked walking over to the entrance when she saw james she blushed and looked away what was that all about he wondered is remus deflate the head plan working she never blushes at me surprised by this he forgot to scribble eeauuuhh he said meaning good morning lily and hermione burst into laughter what wrong with your throat today james she asked still not looking him in the eye you know james scribbled will one of you please take the sleeping charms off of the others you know moony goes nuts about missing class and we cantafford to have detention with the quidditch game this weekend all right i ll take the charms off of them she agreed at least they had pleasant dreams why arentyou looking me in the eye none of your business she yelled come on let go she dodged hermione grabbed james by the arm and dragged him to the door bugger bites she whispered knowing that james couldntopen the door himself he scowled at her how do you know our password she glanced briefly at the note that for me to know and you not to find out she responded she pointed the wand at harry excitate she said he immediately sat up in bed eeauuhaauuh he immediately said what going on here eauhhr huhhe aeeuuh james responded the girls played a prank i dontknow the rest hi harry she said stifling a laugh she then woke serious raarrf woof woof arf he said what are you doing in here lily he looked around horrified and pinched himself to see if he had heard himself correctly arf arf what huh ar rar rarf why isntmoony up lily was laughing crazily right now sirius we cantunderstand you she said i dontspeak barkish or whatever you call the doggy language she moved on to wake up ron saving remus for last rhuihr he said ehh good morning what rhuiiiiiirr i cantspeak aaahh eeeaurhh harry responded not quite used to the spell we ve been pranked and under sleeping charms i suppose ron just stared at him strangely so he reached for james notebook the girls pulled a prank on us and put us under sleeping charms now we can only make animal noises ron nodded and scowled now i ll wake up remus lily said excitate remus sat up and rubbed his eyes what what lily what are you doing here and what this note in my hand eaeuuuhhhh james and harry roared in unison sirius was barking like mad and ron was also protesting why isnthe under the prank not fair if you want to know why remus can speak normally it because the potion can have adverse effects on werewolves i wouldntwant to send you into another transformation she said matter of factly so basically i should pretend to make animal sounds all day he clarified not pretend lily responded she flicked her wand now remus sounded like an angry squawking goose swuiahhhhk he said what did you do that for woof arrf that more like it remus saw james notebook and quill and grabbed them padfoot did you say that more blood stick remus sirius howled in response wow you just said no fuzzy spleen i need to get used to your dog accent again remus you mean you can almost understand him james not quite dogs always have a weird accent hold on james warf woof sirius said try now try now got it ha remus so what do we do harry get ready for class and go to breakfast that what lily told them speaking of which i starving she marched out of the room leaving the chaos behind why wasntshe looking at you prongs sirius scribbled on a new piece of parchment you re nothing compared to me but you dontlook that bad how should i know grr females we have got to get rid of this james stomped off again to lily room to pester the girls stags made very very loud noises at times mainly mating season that sounded like roars and he felt like irritating them until they took the spell off when no one answered the door he returned to his room to find sirius running around and barking like crazy when remus saw him he started scribbling madly in james notebook please stop him he driving me crazy and with his accent james tried to sigh but it came out sounding like eauih he motioned for remus to grab sirius right arm as he passed james grabbed his left arm and both of them dragged sirius to breakfast forgetting in their haste and irritation to bring any paper with them xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx the marauders came to professor mcgonagall room breathless panting and twenty nine seconds late they scrambled into the only empty seats thankful that they had transfiguration with the ravenclaws and not the slytherins mr black potter potter lupin and weasley why are you late to my class james grabbed his quill and notebook and tried to write an answer but she transfigured his quill into a parakeet are you now for some reason dumb that you do not answer my question the marauders nodded wildly james forlorn watched his favorite quill fly around the room i seem to remember your voices working extremely well yesterday now speak they shook their heads and clamped their mouths shut would you like me to take away points they shook their heads even more wildly by now half the class was tittering lily and the rest of the secuestradoras were laughing the loudest then i would suggest you speak before i take fifty points arf ar rar rarf sirius protested irritated and not thinking not fair it not our faults we canttalk the whole class burst into hysterical laughter excuse me she asked her face growing even sterner if that was possible mr lupin would you care to explain this behavior remus opened his mouth to reply then closed it i waiting mr lupin squaawwwk he said we canthelp it it a prank james quill chirped in reply above the students laughter runa had fallen off her chair and was holding her side as she gasped for breath between peals of hilarity mrs mcgonagall realizing that the boys could not help it could barely keep her face straight pardon squuuakakak squaawk didnti make myself clear stop embarrassing me already james quill parakeet chirped its amusement well mr potter one or two would you care to add anything as your friends seem to be a bit beside themselves eeaauuuuggheeieh they said in unison no lastly mr weasley he shook his head well in that case you may as well sit down so that we may commence with the lesson i dontsuppose you can do magic today she turned away momentarily remus and the girls sensed that she was hiding an amused look the rest of the students did not think her capable of such an action now she said open your books to page 562 today we will be discussing how to transfigure our quills into birds as you will see the incantation will change depending on what type of bird you would like the creature will last one day before returning to a quill oh miss evans please do not blow up your quill the last time that happened it took two weeks to clean this room lily blushed and got out her second favorite quill brenna had given her this one for her birthday and she did not want to ruin it just as she was about to say the spell james passed her a note so firewings why arentyou talking to me james shut up and let me do transfiguration lily she threw this note to him scowled and flicked her wand again instead of a parrot she had a squirrel like creature with feathers miss evans why arentyou concentrating professor mcgonagall demanded she turned the squirrot back into a quill i sorry i just not very good with transfiguration she apologized you do well enough when you concentrate now concentrate and do the incantation to make an owl lily obediently concentrated on the owl of her dreams small golden brown clever loyal to her and spoke the words of the spell creo bubo she said an owl appeared in front of her and perched on her shoulder ow you have claws she complained to it professor mcgonagall was staring at her strangely lily gave her a puzzled look and glanced around the rest of the class save the marauders were practicing the new spell and paid no attention to her even the marauders were oblivious as they were busy passing notes lily evans may i speak with you after class lily nodded and bit her lip bewildered and nervous of course professor she glanced at brenna who had decided to turn her quill into a peregrine falcon like the pictures she had seen in an american book very good miss o brien mrs mcgonagall praised her she blushed thanks she said with a smile she and lily turned to look at where hermione and runa were sitting hermione was stroking a parakeet and letting it nibble on her thumb runa however was still struggling with the spell grr she growled stupid spell creo canis she shouted as she flicked her wand immediately a cute fluffy brown and white spotted puppy appeared aww she murmured petting it sirius looked slightly affronted but then the puppy jumped off of her desk and scrambled to him ar rarf it said hi are you a dog too rarrf sirius responded just a dog animagus woof ar roo well we ll have to play you re fun so is that wolf girl sirius grinned and scratched it behind the ears before realizing that his classmates were staring at him i was just playing around sirius wrote on the nearest piece of parchment he could find you didntthink i was actually communicating with the dog did you fooled you ha the marauders still rule he handed the piece of paper to remus and then james who threw it across the room to a random hufflepuff arf ar ar rar the dog questioned why cantyou do human speak are there any biscuits around ar roo he responded ask the wolf girl the dog trotted back to runa black you really donthave to try that hard to pretend to be insane she told him we already knew you were he glared at her he would have written a note but mrs mcgonagall was staring straight at him finally the bell rang harry ron and the rest of the marauders shot out of their seats in a flash brenna however stayed with lily even after the rest of the class had filed out she gave a nerve wracked lily a quick hug lily gave her a small smile and inhaled deeply professor mcgonagall y you wanted to speak with me she stammered yes the formidable lady replied miss o brien you may leave brenna sent lily an apologetic look see you later lily mouthed to her quickly while brenna packed up her books after she was gone mrs mcgonagall sat down in her chair and motioned for lily to find a seat what did you want to speak with me about lily asked as she stroked her transfigured owl miss evans do you realize what you did when you transfigured that owl lily bit her lip um i actually got the spell right on the second try she guessed mrs mcgonagall narrowed her eyes i honestly dontknow what i did wrong would you please inform me you honestly dontknow mrs mcgonagall asked her eyes wide with amazement lily shook her head and gave her another puzzled look you not only managed to transfigure your quill into an owl on the second try but you did so without a wand oh lily muttered surprised and panicked oh no i in trouble now she may figure out i a fairy but wandless magic i ve never done that before i ve never seen such a thing in my life lily evans and i afraid we ll have to make a visit to the headmaster lily groaned not for punishment she tried to reassure her it just that this is such an odd circumstance and i do not want you or anyone else to be in danger she paused come along she stood and exited the room lily followed numbly as mrs mcgonagall led her to dumbledore office squiggles and squids she said stiffly the door creaked open and they entered when she did not see dumbledore at his desk she shouted his name no need to shout said a voice behind them they turned around and saw professor dumbledore professor we didntsee you lily stumbled obviously now what brings you to my office lemon drops anyone both mrs mcgonagall and lily shook their heads i afraid we re here for business mrs mcgonagall responded then miss evans will have to find herself some lunch ah well have a seat ladies and make yourselves at home lily immediately sat down still numb with nervousness mrs mcgonagall however began pacing the room albus have you ever heard of anyone doing wandless magic before she asked lily blinked surprised to hear her address him so casually she was even more surprised to see him blink in astonishment you dontsuppose suppose what lily asked miss evans mrs mcgonagall scolded no problem at all well perhaps there is a problem he amended lily stroked her owl which was still perched on her shoulder i take it that you managed to use magic without a wand lily nodded apprehensively never in all my years do you know how you did it i simply said the spell sir and forgot to use my wand she responded her calm tone of voice belying her emotions i see albus are you blind to the problem mrs mcgonagall demanded do you know what this could mean what danger this could put her in if you know who i mean voldemort finds out i do indeed however we will do everything we can to make sure that it does not now lily are you sure there is nothing else you know i never said there was or wasn t she replied let me rephrase that do you know what gives you the power to do wandless magic i had never tried it before which implies that you knew you could possibly do that lily bit her lip yes sir so what gives you this power neither of you would believe me if i told you she responded well we will try she gulped have you ever heard of fairies now lily this is not history of medieval literature mrs mcgonagall scolded five points i said you wouldntbelieve me she snapped her red head temper finally kicking in i have fairy blood that was somehow awakened a few weeks ago she added in a calmer voice i have to transform on the nights of the full moon and half moons miss evans you cannot possibly expect me to believe this preposterous tale can you mrs mcgonagall demanded lily sighed no i did not but it the truth you ll get nothing different if you give me veritaserum i had presumed that fairies were mere legends professor dumbledore confessed thoughtfully however there is a note of truth in your tale is there any way you can prove your word lily nodded she concentrated on her fairy form and transformed in his office managing to awe both her headmaster and transfiguration teacher in fact this was the first time in 96 years that dumbledore had been caught with his mouth hanging open an how old is dumbledore how many know of this dumbledore asked the marauders minus pettigrew but including harry and ron marianela hermione ginny runa and brenna i plan to keep things that way she added i made them swear in blood mrs mcgonagall and professor dumbledore both looked at her seriously very good lily we also will keep this absolutely secret what about when she goes out to transform and whatever else fairies do i head girl professor mcgonagall lily replied doesntthe head girl have the right to make rounds the professor caught on quickly right that will be perfect miss evans now what exactly do fairies do fight evil lily responded simply i start training the next time i transform well i would like you to train yourself in wandless magic i ll provide you with a fake wand i d appreciate your knowledge in the years to come lily smiled sadly i will help as long as i am able but i already know i will die young professor dumbledore nodded gravely i suspected as much with harry visiting as he is what does harry potter have to do with anything mrs mcgonagall demanded lily would you like to explain or shall i dumbledore asked the familiar twinkle returning to his eyes he my son sent from the future by a time turner the rest of the exchange students are his friends mrs mcgonagall shook her head in amazement she had already been numb with shock from lily transformation and would not fully realize what was going on for several hours are you all right lily asked her transfiguration teacher timidly yes i suppose i should learn to expect the unexpected she sighed seeming weary one more question why exactly are the marauders unable to speak today and making such ghastly noises lily put on her best innocent look nothing much really i sure they ll be their normal selves tomorrow she replied mysteriously oh goodness donttell me you found some animagi lumos potion she laughed that is what they used on me before they let me start learning to transform she explained i won t lily responded may i be excused professors yes of course dumbledore replied by the way fifty points to gryffindor for your excellent work and courage lily blushed she realized that she hadntreturned her human form yet transformed herself quickly and exited with a wave and a smile before racing down the hallway with her new owl flying behind her she was famished lily where were you ginny asked lily had just sat down at their table and was quickly spooning food onto her plate i had to see mcgonagall and dumbledore about something she replied how did that go brenna asked i sorry i couldntstay have some chocolate pudding it delicious it was interesting i donthave detention if that what you were wondering her pet owl still on her shoulder swooped down and grabbed a carrot stick hmm i ve never heard of a vegetarian owl you should take that to the owlery ginny protested honestly what if it poops on me then you can say scourgify lily replied i ll only have this owl for twenty four hours and i going to enjoy it while i have it my temporary dog and brenna parakeet are in my room runa said i wish we could do that in transfiguration marianela commented enviously we ll show you how later brenna reassured her why arentthe marauders here lily asked oh they re in the kitchen plotting mayhem ginny informed her casually hey hermione could you pass the milk sure she replied oh why did dumbledore and mcgonagall have to see you lily you didntdo anything wrong did you not exactly she hedged what do you think the marauders are planning mayhem and you re avoiding the question marianela told her why did mcgonagall have to see you much less take you to the headmaster office is this pick on lily day no it find out why lily is being so secretive is it about your secret runa asked lily sighed and nodded i er forgot to use my wand for once in my life she admitted they immediately stared at her in shock but no one is able to hermione protested lily interrupted her those with my secret can she replied donttell anyone anyone she added sternly i ll tell harry and maybe the other marauders sans pettigrew but that it they glanced at each other and sighed this is still weird brenna admitted we also shouldnttalk about any of this here dontworry i put a scrambler on our words earlier hermione confessed you re right though people will find it odd if we obsess about makeup celebrities and literature for much longer runa laughed only you hermione she said so how shall we protect ourselves from the marauders next attack ginny asked i donthave an mscd in the kitchen i donthave enough pranks are getting boring too hermione added i ve even had to give up my foreign language studies the rest gave her a blank stare i er wanted to learn italian on my own and you didntask me to join you the rest demanded simultaneously er she stammered she was saved from responding lily owl who had been hooting throughout the meal seemed to be even more intent on getting lily attention and had started diving at her hair what lily demanded wait am i really talking to a transfigured feather the owl hooted louder huh what do you mean you ll last more than a day yet another you know what thing ginny grumbled admit it you re perfect so perfect i blow up things every other class in transfiguration lily grumbled the owl was still hooting all right already yeesh i ll name you loudmouth if you dontstop this brenna runa mione may i see your pets later the owl appeared to be satisfied and landed on lily shoulder um sure brenna replied if that means we can keep our pets longer the bell rang for them to go to their next class where are you headed claws muggle studies she replied ugh we have history of magic runa complained well have fun oh we will marianela grinned it quite fun especially when ginny corrects the professor can you believe she thought that muggles sleep sitting up and have high beds to stay away from bad spirits that dwell lower to the ground they used to hermione responded in we ve got to get to class pouncer lily insisted come on we ll be late they all hurried out to their classes no one enjoyed detentions no time for long note reviews are nice but not my

what are you doing remus asked calmly sirius has done stranger things before i being bored to death that what even worse we marauders have been made fun of in front of the whole school and all our prongs can do is wonder why firewings is avoiding him well i say that we take action and revenge our honor he pumped his fist in the air while remus and james stared at him like he was crazy what um padfoot it avenge our honor not revenge remus responded mildly well excuse me mr i don t have a life because i can t stop studying sirius grumbled actually one could argue that he has more of a life harry commented as he and ron entered they had only heard sirius last remark for one thing he has a steady girlfriend is this pick on sirius day he grumbled well as a matter of fact it is james announced anyway padfoot thinks we need to avenge our honor does anyone have an idea ron paced the room deep in thought runaway books would drive herm pouncer crazy but howler wouldntcare he mused umm something to do with words since they denied us speech for a day good idea stealth james said we could make them say the marauders are awesome every time someone calls their name no we need to be more creative than that remus insisted let give them different phrases oooh howler can say sirius black is a genius sirius proclaimed do you really want her to kill you harry asked skeptically if you do go right ahead she wontkill me sirius protested he delusional that one james commented to ron who nodded in agreement hey sirius protested look who talking and look who here james responded nodding toward harry sirius stuck his tongue out at him back to business marauders remus insisted the rest sat up straight on their beds oh padfoot a certain lady nighthowler still doesnthave a date for the ball sirius immediately shot up and his head on the ceiling woo hoo ow he complained as he rubbed his sore head hey prado where have you been marianela stopped and turned around to find three of her former roommates behind her hi sara annie and rosa she greeted them by name i ve been in my new room girls she added sweetly rosa and annie flinched they did not like her using their first name but they pasted their fake smiles back on their faces we ve missed you sara told her marianela held her tongue in check sara had been the only decent girl among her housemates honestly dear how could you worry us like this rosa scolded she had been the cruelest to marianela and annie had backed her up i believe the only worry to you rosa is your inability to get a free slave marianela replied coldly

her annie is that her necklace you said that amos gave it to you accio necklace marianela said pointing her wand the necklace immediately dislodged itself from annie neck and into marianela hand but rosa and annie protested i donthave to let you bully me anymore darlings she replied thankfully i had the rest of my jewelry under a charm oh are you still dating diggory even though you two were cheating on runa soleine sara gasped again honestly skipping class to be with him in history of magic was extremely idiotic why oh sod off rosa demanded one would think you were a hufflepuff no i a ravenclaw sara replied steadily you you should be in slytherin oh go live with the fifth years annie told her you obviously arentmature enough to be a sixth year you re obviously not mature enough to be beyond first year marianela retorted look who talking spaniard rosa sneered watch how long you keep your face that way tonta it might stay that way marianela would you mind helping me move sara

asked quietly we both have blood in us that isntenglish she paused you know what i through with this conversation ciao gunther and kilden she grasped marianela hand and they walked to the ravenclaw rooms you know i actually do miss you sara admitted do you mind if we hang out sometime sure marianela responded i dontmind at all perhaps you d like to meet my other friends that would be wonderful she replied simply before saying the password to the ravenclaw corridor marauders rock they hurried and steadily packed up sara many things then carried them to the fifth year girls room when they were finished it was very late and both of them were exhausted especially after having been bombarded by the excited fifth years buona sera nela thanks for the help sara said gratefully you re welcome sara she replied buenas noche y duerme bien see you tomorrow she strolled back to her room very careful not to be seen the others were already sleeping soundly marianela was too tired to change into pajamas and instead crawled under her covers she fell asleep almost immediately but couldnthelp thinking that she needed to do something however she could not remember what that was lily woke up with a start at 3 15 in the morning immediately sensing that something was wrong she got out of bed wearily grabbed her wand and stumbled to the mirror she pointed her wand at herself and tried to say lumos but instead i got a d on my charms test came out horrified she screamed she could still manage to do that the others immediately woke up it dontmean a thing if you aintgot that swing ginny protested in a sing song voice she meant what did you do that for rule breaking is fun hermione said before putting her hand to her mouth in shock and horror is it morning yet she meant to say miren el pepino marianela chimed in oh no that what i was supposed to do check the mscd tape from tonight she wanted to say lily turned on a small lamp so that they could see reached for a notebook and began to write a quick note wildcat did you forget to check the tape last night yes sorry i was helping someone move to the fifth years room in ravenclaw and forgot idiotic marauders just wait til i

immediately sprung up and turned it off she hated the sound of alarms figaro figaro figaro she sang she meant to say runes get up now if you want a shower runa glared at her however when she tried to speak she could not express her ire at the italian singing sirius black is a genius she found herself shouting she tried to speak again i know a song that gets on everybody nerves what on earth is happening to me the marauders rule brenna said when she tried to speak again she flipped on the lights and searched for the nearest quill and piece of parchment before scribbling a note it obviously the marauders she wrote grr they are going to get it i honestly sick of pranks and it is less than two weeks before the ball well too bad and it a week and a half marauders grr let see if the others are the same way parchment in hand they passed through the portal to find the others getting ready for school most of them waved but ginny was still scowling you too runa unfortunately yes ginny honestly i say either miren el pepino gryffindor rocks or snape is a big nosed git which he is all i ve said so far is figaro three times and the marauders rule at least you do not have to say rule breaking is fun potions is horrid or bonzai although the second is true with the current professor hermione pouncer i ve got you all beat i say i love james potter i got a d on my charms test or it raining on prom night lily firewings well those gits have me down to sirius black is a genius and i know a song that gets on everybody nerves unfair runes runes bren maybe you should change before

can i borrow your hairbrush lily sure why not ginny are you ready yet oh do you have some epoxy hermione what on earth is that marianela glue i have some why do you want to put one of them through torture by attaching them to one of us lily brilliant minds think alike oh and it wontwork for all 5 they ll suspect something so whom shall we target let do it once this spell ends ginny let not embarrass remus and brenna hermione all right let see how runes likes being stuck with sirius all day nela so what do you say hey nela find runes and bren and we ll meet outside the dining hall in 10 minutes ok hermione marianela nodded in response to hermione note and waved her goodbye before passing through the portal the girls irritated by the prank boycotted the marauders table at breakfast although they could sense stares coming from the marauders table none of them looked back instead they busied themselves with their food and a conversation via parchment at least we wonthave to talk in potions i hope brenna lucky you i have an oral report in muggle studies nela wildcat me too hey i wonder if someone could take the stupid prank off ginny claws hopefully mcgonagall might be able to

heels are notorious for causing blisters and other discomfort i myself was planning to wear an older pair of shoes hermione oh blah ugh i suppose we should break them in tomorrow brenna but that means dressing up for school lily honestly runa you are being cruel nela oh blah blah when you re in class no one will see your shoes under your robe ginny you can wear that black dress so you can freak ron

just the way i am brenna because brens just because he likes you doesntmean you wontenjoy seeing his eyes pop out at how gorgeous you look as for you lily i think you may be falling for a certain marauder whose name starts with j and ends with ames runa upon reading runa note both brenna and lily faces turned a deep shade of crimson they quickly passed the note on as if it were a hot potato i ll have you know i have been saving money for useful spells for intelligent witches ever since i came back in time it out of print in the future you see not many people bought it hermione whatever oh runes i do not want or need a new wardrobe i do not have much money i have already been tortured through shopping and i like that shirt ginny i too will dress how i like oh it time to go to class grr nela we ll see about that runa cruelty ginny pass the strawberry jam please brenna lily was seething of all the days their potions master had to ask her a question it was today today when she couldntanswer properly almost everyone had laughed when she said i love james potter and the professor had given her detention well she would have to talk to mcgonagall or dumbledore because there was no way she was serving that detention honestly it was not fair at all she turned her head when someone poked her shoulder it was james are you all right he asked concerned she glared at him since she could not say of course i not you idiot and you know what it your bloody fault he winced come on lily he pleaded it just a prank we ll take it off at dinner and i sure dumbledore will take away your detention lily shrugged in response she wished she could still avoid him especially since it had been a few days since she had given them the potion but she still felt nervous and panicked around them this she could only cover up with irritation lately although the current hex she was under also irked her speaking of which there is only an hour before dinner remus commented from behind her where he and brenna walked hand again lily shrugged oh let just take it off now harry grumbled i getting sick of their stony glares where the fun in that sirius and ron protested together um possible conversation james suggested we can make them promise not to yell or scream at us remus and harry nodded their agreement no offense padfoot but i have sensitive ears remus said all right sirius agreed reluctantly spoilsports ron muttered they took the spell off the four girls and then harry went to find marianela and ginny see you at dinner he called while no one was looking lily mouthed a message to runa tomorrow well that covers chapter 21 wow i graduate soon but after my last day of school i have at least 3 degradation i mean graduation practices i honestly dontunderstand why we must toil for hours upon end learning how to walk if people dontknow how to walk by 12th grade excluding those with disabilities they deserve to make fools of themselves hmm today was odd the teacher was in her office closeby and someone actually allowed another person to duct tape her arms behind her back that frightened me a bit but it really isntmy place to worry about her sanity thanks for sticking with me despite the fact that you often have to wait a week maybe a week and a half for updates or in the case of malgramer author hides behind tree trunk to avoid gunshots and punches ok the action stopped well i mreally sleepy so i signing out until next time auramistealia disclaimer the authoress declares that the plot words and some of the following characters belong to her auramistealia however j k rowling owns the setting and the rest of the characters darn it responses to reviewers dontletmegetme thanks hmm i ll have to go back since i forgot the niffler thing sigh i too young for memory loss unfortunately nela wontbe in chapter 24 just in the last scene there i ll try to write her in more in ch 25 marianela has a bigger role in this chapter though and she ll be in the sequel i glad you like her i like most of my o c so far i think everyone should have a role in ousting voldy wart and his peruvian death pepper eaters will think of a better name to call the death eaters i have seen death munchers and death nibblers about and i like those jessesgirl11 tell your parents to order the laptop already as always i glad you reviewed and no this isntthe last chapter but i dontplan to have an 80 some chapter story like a magical journey and i hope the stuff i want to publish in a few years aka when they ve been finished is even better since it isntshadowed by an angst freak pardon that comment angst and j k rowling lovers i admire her writing ability but i wish she would stop killing off people like sirius black wow i really should move on cya jessesgirl11

else to call you but my mom told me that was 4 times three times two times one 24 question marks is a feat 4 hmm that was a rather threatening message i appreciate your ardor though bleh where are these words coming from ardor approbation obsequious oh right classes dontworry i had to look the last word up all right people i know this chapter a little short but bear with me please at least it 7 pages long chapter 23 just like glue aka beware of girl talk aka the day before veritas durmiendi i couldntdecide on a title the next day ginny weasley found herself running late after taking a quick shower drying herself quickly and throwing on clean clothes she grabbed her books and scurried out of the room she reached the great hall in less than a minute breathless the gryffindor record was 1 minute and five seconds and found her companions the only seat available was to harry left groaning inwardly she sat down and started piling food on her plate good morning ginny marianela greeted her from across the table morning gin harry added quietly the other marauders and secuestradoras also added their greetings including ron what took you so long mornings arentgood when you wake up twenty five minutes late ginny replied i hope i have all my books she shook her wet hair out splattering water all over harry hey he protested before eating another forkful of french toast she merely shrugged her shoulders you know the drying charm she replied before dousing her french toast in syrup yummy she added pass the sausage please you know it to harry replied in between bites of breakfast she just shook her hair again and dug into her breakfast honestly you re eating as fast as they are hermione scolded indicating the males minus remus ginny swallowed quickly can i help it why didntyou wake me up earlier she added um ginny we tried twice marianela responded cautiously ginny shrugged again and took another bite of sausage then she felt a sticky substance in her right hand she looked down to find the epoxy glue that she herself had used yesterday oh no she moaned inwardly then she heard someone she didntknow who whisper manus habere she groaned audibly this time as she found her hand reaching toward harry s harry looked up startled her face turned red even the tips of her ears but she knew that she was stuck sorry she said weakly some cruel victim of mine yesterday decided to uh she tried to pull her hand away in vain oh no she groaned she chanced a look at harry only to find that he too was embarrassed it all right he replied maybe we can figure out how to get it loose we re not telling lily and runa said in a sing song voice you got us into that yesterday claws and now you have to deal with it sirius added thanks for bringing me into this harry told them sarcastically you re welcome james responded not everyone gets to hold hands with a gorgeous redhead although i myself prefer a different one both redheads and harry turned red and lily rolled her eyes but what are we going to do about classes ginny moaned the rest shrugged they hadntthought of this but werentabout to let her off ask mcgonagall marianela suggested she may know ginny finished her last bite of food before glancing at harry let do it he agreed maybe she ll know how to er undo it together they stood up and tried not to trip over their seats before going to the teachers table mrs mcgonagall looked up at them with obvious surprise i assume you have a legitimate reason for bothering me during a meal potter and weasley she said crisply er yes harry replied you see someone glued our hands together with a prank and oh dear she muttered probably the marauders although haventthey made you one as well harry shrugged she then tried several powerful anti stick charms but their hands still remained glued together well i suppose you ll have to wait until it wears off she told them that is unless you wish to tear the skin off your hands but what about classes ginny blurted out well i suppose you ll have to go to mr potter s dumbledore answered her question as he entered the conversation professors pay attention miss weasley is now excused from all of her classes until further notice the potions professor scowled but the rest nodded in acquiescence i foresaw a calamity such as this the divinations teacher intoned professor mcgonagall rolled her eyes and muttered something inaudible before turning back to her students well i suppose i shall see you later but if i may finish my breakfast although she used words that indicated a question this was a command having noted this harry and ginny nodded before returning to their seats in a hurry it was not a good idea to tick professor mcgonagall off because she could turn them into pincushions marianela was lonely in history of magic class without ginny but at least sara was there she had been sitting with her and ginny ever since the night when marianela confronted her former roommates as professor binns droned on marianela sketched ideas for jewelry on scraps of parchment more and more she was thinking about opening a jewelry shop on diagon alley when moldie voldie had been defeated that way she could do something that she enjoyed and still be useful to any auror friends in her own way psst nela sara whispered where ginny in class with the seventh years she whispered back without looking up someone glued her to harry potter hand she so lucky they look so cute together shh dontstart giggling marianela warned her binns isntcompletely oblivious just mostly sara rolled her eyes and indicated the other ravenclaw girls across the room annie and rosa were giggling loudly eating sugarless peppermint toads which tasted awful but were the only sweet they would eat for fear of gaining weight and looking at worldly witch magazines i wonder what would happen if the guys saw the magazine sara whispered marianela stifled a laugh let do it wingardium leviosa she said pointing her wand and watching as one of their magazines floated to the nearest boy desk the boy immediately choked with laughter and horror as he saw the pictures of male models in the magazine rosa and annie were furious but marianela had moved her wand give me that annie hissed leaning over and trying to yank back the magazine nope the boy replied before incinerating it with his wand that disgusting by now annie and rosa had turned red but they did not know who had done that to them hey nela i transferring to a school in italy marianela glanced at her friend surprised i ll be closer to my family and away from them besides i think you ll be gone along with ginny marianela nodded guiltily i ll owl you in a few decades she whispered back why a few decades marianela blushed oh i didntthink they were from our time sara mused you re going with ginny she nodded i ll miss you marianela told her quietly same here maybe i ll be married by then and dontworry i ll be fine she interrupted just promise me that if you see federico hern n cortes y garc a that you ll have someone pulverize him your fianc former fianc i wontmarry an idiot sara clapped a hand over her mouth to muffle her laughter we should be taking notes she whispered i will and you can draw i want to see that when you re done as you wish marianela responded before returning to her sketch ginny followed harry into mrs mcgonagall transfiguration classroom and tried not to blush all morning they had been taunted by various idiots in the school that or endured the oohs and aahs of the most romantic students ginny felt like throwing up especially since she knew harry probably felt nothing but embarrassment but there always hope part of her said she sighed unconsciously are you all right harry asked sending her a concerned look as they found seats by their friends she started visibly um yeah she said this is just a little bit weird being stuck with my brother best friend she thought she saw pain flash across his face no disappointment and bit her lip you re my friend too she added defensively it just dontworry about it he cut her off are these good enough seats she nodded of course they sat down just in time for professor mcgonagall liked to start her class on time sure enough the imposing woman stepped up to the front of the classroom only moments later good morning class we have a guest today ms weasley but pay her no mind here she sent a warning glare at all of the students save ginny and harry now today we will be performing a very complex transfiguration that involves serious concentration yes this will be on your newts she added sternly most of the students in the room grumbled quiet she insisted softly but with a sense of power behind her speech now everyone take out your wand and a scrap of parchment plus a spare scroll of parchment for notes ginny tried to fiddle with her things one handedly without bothering harry but found that this was harder than it sounded especially for a klutz dontbother he whispered to her indicating his quill i have plenty of parchment and my quill takes notes by itself she blushed slightly and thanked him for the parchment now point your wands at the parchment and say complico professor mcgonagall ordered ginny did and found her paper folding up to form a neat envelope she harry hermione james and remus had managed to do so easily but lily was having a harder time half of the ravenclaws were struggling and it took runa two times before getting it right professor mcgonagall walked around to observe the students try harder diggory she reproved him miss evans please concentrate on what you want the paper to do i know you can do this lily blushed nodded and focused on the paper and her wand this time she managed to transfigure her paper very good miss evans oh miss weasley very good job especially for a sixth year did you have a good transfiguration teacher at your old school she was a lot like you ginny answered mainly because she is you she added mentally i ve learned a lot close one harry whispered when she was gone hermione nodded in agreement ginny looked away and nodded before focusing on her parchment once more complico alae she whispered it refolded to create an origami like swan wingardium leviosa she added directing it toward leslie ling cho chang mother it hit her on the head with a thud before ginny put it under her invisible charm leslie looked up with surprise only to find nothing what was that for harry asked dontworry about it hermione assured him before ginny had a chance to speak although really ginny in a classroom when else would i get a chance to she asked hermione shrugged and sighed exasperatedly i suppose you and ron are ron shot his head up from his parchment upon hearing his name huh what about me he asked i didntdo anything hermione and ginny just shared an amused look males ginny mouthed silently before glancing at hermione book a few minutes later class ended it had seemed like forever but in reality it had been less than an hour she quickly tried to pack up her few things and get up momentarily forgetting about harry when mrs mcgonagall called her name miss weasley please stay there for a moment you too potter ginny tried not to give her a strange look the rest of the students including her friends and brother rushed out quickly but her fellow secuestradoras gave her encouraging smiles before they left so what did you want to see me about ginny asked when the rest had gone you have considerable transfiguration talent for a sixth year mrs mcgonagall replied i was wondering if you would consider extra training to catch up with the seventh years er that would be nice ginny admitted but i not sure how long i can do this if you come here at half past three for forty five minutes each day you can probably catch up in less than a month if you wish i can also teach you about animagi th that ok ginny stammered i d like to catch up but becoming an animagus she could tell that harry was trying not to laugh but she wished he would control himself more at the moment being an unlisted animagus was illegal and she didntcare to go to azkaban potter what do you find so funny professor mcgonagall asked curiously um nothing he said calmly i was just imagining what kind of animal she would be you re just jealous ginny told him thank you for the offer professor once i separated from this creature i d be glad to come for training for as long as i can hey harry protested but ginny just shrugged her shoulders mrs mcgonagall looked pleased overall but ginny noted a slight suspicion mixed with that what if she can tell just by being another animagus she worried thankfully the teacher said nothing well then i will see you tomorrow ms weasley she said crisply so then i will see you half past three tomorrow ginny nodded then she and harry rushed out of the classroom after a brief thanks goodbye that was close harry whispered as soon as they were out of hearing range ginny nodded in agreement let see if we can force them to let us know how to get rid of this glue she suggested harry grinned at her that the weasley in you i suppose although it would be nice to use my other hand again where are they where are who runa asked they turned around to see that the group had snuck up on them you now tell me how to separate ourselves without harm or i ll hex you to jupiter ginny growled temper temper james teased well shall we tell them yes no lily and sirius responded simultaneously haventthey suffered enough lily asked harry innocent no runa and sirius responded but since we re nice we ll separate you come on it time to go to our room when will malfoy and snape be free ron asked curiously the rest shrugged just get the glue off ginny and harry shouted ooooooooooooooooooooooooo so why exactly did you do that ginny asked runa once they were separated from the guys do what runa asked innocently glue our hands together i surprised ron didntthrow a conniption you re lucky fred george bill and charlie are stuck in the future otherwise they would send harry to st mungo s why wouldntthey kill him if they re so overprotective brenna asked prophecy hermione interrupted you see cassandra trelawney who is mainly a fraud will make two genuine prophecies the first of which regards harry and voldemort supposedly shut up ginny growled the rest of them had gone pale besides they might just decide to castrate him yeesh lily grumbled can we discuss a less gruesome topic shopping runa suggested hogsmeade tomorrow please dontremind me brenna begged remus and i are going on our first date how uncreative runa interrupted tomorrow night brenna finished and glared at runa hermione what do you know about diagon alley in the future marianela asked how much would it cost to open a shop with or without advertising she asked without much advertising it depends on the size and location you see if your shop were around weasley wizard wheezes you might get a discount hey ginny protested anyway i ll have to ask fred and george they ll know have you transferred all of your funds yet lily asked half marianela replied i have to go to spain to do any more can you take us runa asked excitedly it would be fun marianela tilted her head right death eaters lurking about under cover ex fiances pretending that they have the right to breath air hoity toity wizards and witches looking down on people of lower birth that sounds like a lot of fun oh that sounds like here present and future ginny replied besides with all of us along you have more of a chance to embarrass your ex fiance if we come across him i cantcome lily mourned i head girl you could for a day runa objected none of us can until we ask dumbledore permission marianela reminded her well i know all the spanish i need runa laughed d nde est los chicos guapos donde est n los chicos guapos marianela corrected her where are the hot guys right here a familiar voice called down the hallway go away sirius black runa yelled we are participating in girl talk and all trespassers will be hexed spoilsport he replied quietly behind her before jumping back as he thought she whirled around angrily you he teasing you hermione interrupted sirius we ll see you and the rest later now go away runa ordered go away or we ll make you eat snails if you ever do get to spain ginny added or is that in france france lily and hermione replied while marianela said both cooked or raw sirius asked see ya he added not waiting to find out girls he muttered as he left males the rest groaned after he departed well i suppose we should ask dumbledore lily sighed torturing him was more fun runa objected yes runes but it espa a brenna reminded her besides we may get to torture nela ex fiance which would be a blast since he basically grime ginny added powerful grime marianela corrected so why did leslie ling look like something hit her in transfiguration today lily prodded because something did hermione replied obviously mione lily sighed ginny why are you asking me she asked i am interrogating you because i saw you glaring at her earlier in the period well i hate her daughter ginny replied oriental beauties who are airheads runa inquired yes that would be annoying let me guess let just go to dinner marianela interrupted i hungry and this conversation is sounding sickeningly like the gossip i heard in ravenclaw minus the witch worldly magazines racism and er what do you call it oh right it called brainlessness if ginny felt the need to send an object flying toward double l there a reason thanks nela ginny responded you re a pal runa stomach growled it definitely dinnertime runa agreed let go we re off to see the wizard brenna sang author disclaimer lyrics from the movie the wizard of oz not until after we eat hermione reminded her wow yeah i know it only seven pages i also didntwrite much when i was on the percocet because somehow it

durmiendi potion took over then she saw herself in the future with long manageable curly hair poring over a charms book wow i look nice she thought before concentrating on remembering her dream no matter how horrible it would be she wanted to remember it so that she could change herself if need be a timer went off and hermione marked the page before closing it oh great i have my charms newt in fifteen minutes hermione groaned a flash of panic flew over her face i going to fail going to fail going to fail ginny weasley stepped over to hermione and gave her a hug relax mione you ll do fine you studied and i sure you ll do better than anyone else but hermione was still paranoid and was biting down what was left of her fingernails you will do fine ginny reiterated grr i d get ron in here but he ll just make things worse hermione looked up and if possible became more panicked ginny rolled her eyes don t please she begged that would be outrageously cruel dontdiscomfit me even more she moaned hermione jane granger listen to me ginny yelled finally losing her patience first of all you will do fine you ve even tutored people second of all my brother loves you so stop denying it and do something about it other than talk about vicky krum whom you re not even writing hermione looked shaken but also excited a are you sure hermione asked timidly as if someone was giving her a fancy gift on the spur of the moment yep ginny replied now get in there and ace that test mione granger here are your things they hugged and hermione left still nervous but not half as paranoid hermione woke up and stared into the darkness am i really like that she asked herself i dontwant to be that paranoid didnti tell harry and ron there were things more important than cleverness she sighed quietly and sat up in bed i i wonder if ron really does care and if has ginny ever said anything hermione thought back but couldntremember only that one day she had burst into tears and blabbed about ron one day and confided in ginny ever since now what does my hair mean is this how i secretly long to see myself minus the pandemonium or does it show my potential just as the paranoia shows my ability to be hermione yawned lay back down and snuggled under her covers again she closed her eyes and fell asleep exhausted sirius was so tired that he rolled right into bed and started snoring about an hour later the veritas durmiendi potion kicked in and took over his dream whoa this is weird was sirius last subconscious thought before he became a mere observer sirius was standing in a classroom dueling with a professor he was swift on his feet dodging curses and sending hexes attempting to disarm the professor finally he managed to put a full body bind on the professor he had won the duel after he took the body bind off the professor rose to shake his hand you re going to make it black you ll be a good auror and one we need why i remember when your great uncle orion taught me he was a great duelist sirius face tightened at the mention of his family isnthe the one in st mungo s he asked yet another dark wizard the professor looked surprised not all of the blacks have been like they are today you re an example of that you and andromeda tonks he was a great auror and although your mother put him in st mungo for insanity we took him out he past his prime but sirius face stayed impassive but one could see his inner turmoil in his eyes are you sure you re talking about my family he asked positive black a name is a name not all your ancestors were dark you have a name to be proud of as long as you stay away from the pureblood rules philosophy and now that you re engaged to ms soleine i believe you should you will do fine the dream stopped there and sirius woke up he reached for his wand and said lumos to give himself some light he noticed that ron was sound asleep and snoring loudly but harry and remus were not breathing deeply enough to be asleep you awake he said somewhat quietly yeah harry grumbled i wanted to go back to sleep though same here padfoot if i do not gain the proper amount of rest i assure you that i will be extremely irked and you may find yourself incapacitated remus said before pulling the covers over his head and rolling over fine sirius grumbled i going to the library spoilsports 777777777777777777777777777 brenna had trouble falling asleep even if she hadntbeen restless she could hear the others tossing and turning in their beds after a half our of insomnia and watching the minutes pass by on her glow in the dark watch she gave upand grabbed the nearest book which happened to be fact or fantasy a closer look at hogwarts founders she grabbed her wand said lumos and opened the book to a random page that happened to be in godric gryffindor section twenty pages later she was sound asleep brenna hid behind the sofa and watched mutely as the stranger an ira member was dueling with her father her eyes were filled with pain pain and determination she ducked down even farther behind the couch although she felt squished she could not watch her father dodge curses any longer she pressed her hands against the wall behind her to get rid of some of her energy and almost gasped in surprise when the wall was pushed back and her hands met a cold metal object it was heavy after all she was only eight and small for her age but she managed to bring it to where she could see it it was a pistol like in the western movies her father watched that brenna hated so much she slowly raised her head and the gun until she could see her father and that strange man dueling again the man screamed a strange word and her father collapsed to the ground daddy brenna younger self screamed in the dream she raised the gun and a stream of white light enveloped the room with a loud cry the strange ira man fell to the ground immobile and in pain she pulled herself up from behind the sofa and tubled over the first thing she saw was the terror in his eyes then she saw her father she pulled the wand from his frozen hand and pointed at him then said ennervate a word that only a bookworm would know at age eight her father got up with a serious look in his eyes let find you re mother we re leaving he told her sharply something more was wrong but the girl could not figure it out the scene faded and the brenna was older perhaps 11 at the most this time her mother was with her and the girl was holding her hogwarts letter i not going she insisted i not valiant enough i canteven make myself hit the girls at school when they pick on me but you taunt and dodge them her mother reminded her brenna o brien you are braver than you think you are the dream ended and brenna woke up these had been her memories it had taken her years before she believed her father when he said she had not fired the gun as for the scene with her mother brenna had doubted those words for years now she was starting to realize that her mother had been right she had been too hard on herself she was much more confident now especially since the time travelers came and remus helped as well even the rudest of the slytherins such as malfoy helped although they did not mean to they gave her someone to stand up against and after all it was rather fun to turn their hair pink for insulting muggles why did these memories come up brenna wondered this is supposed to bring hidden truth not something i already know then she remembered the look on her father face after she revived him some of the curses that she had not understood then and how her father disappeared on the full moon he a werewolf like remus brenna realized how could i not have known it was so clear silent tears trickled down her face first remus and now daddy too i wish i wish i could do something she wiped the tears from her cheeks with her right hand and stared determinedly into the darkness i wish i could help them one day i ll try there has got to be a cure for lycanthropy she whispered sighing she snuggled under her covers and closed her eyes she could think about memories later but for now she needed to sleep somehow she did not think that her teachers would appreciate it if she slept through their classes besides she needed to develop a spell to keep remus out of her chocolate unless she let him have it as much as she cared about him chocolate was chocolate and he could get some himself ron normally slept like a rock albeit a snoring one and tonight was no different at first dreams about winning quidditch matches accompanied his stertor but eventually the veritas durmiendi took over his subconsciousness ron was walking down diagon alley in robes that actually fit him looking into the displays of various stores he even passed weasley wizard wheezes but paid little attention to that then he saw her walk out of a shop called ravin robes with heavy bags in her hands ron walked up to her duly noting how her softly curling hair cascaded down her back and from an angle he could hardly tell her from the girl she used to be hermione wait up he called let me help you with those bags hermione turned to face him smiled and set her bags down ron she responded excitedly it so good to see you and not just because these bags weigh a ton what a ton ron asked she smiled never mind dontworry about it i was just er shopping she told him ron stomach grumbled why dontwe get some lunch he asked oh ron you are always thinking about food that does sound lovely though ron picked up her bags and they walked down the alley in search of a caf ron could hardly keep his eyes off of hermione to him she was beautiful ooh look hermione said excitedly there a new caf open i think susan bones owns it let go there um okay he replied they went into the restaurant and were seated by susan herself have fun she said with a smile and a quick wink at hermione so how have things been going with your job hermione asked him fiddling with her nails erm fine good ron replied i ve managed to avoid fred and george newest invention too ugh biting chocolate bunnies you should have seen that one girl when she tested the candy i just glad i couldnthear her hermione responded hey why are you fiddling with your nails he asked are you all right hermione just gave him a frightened look before hiding behind her menu ron bit his lip mione he pleaded then she and the restaurant disappeared ron rubbed his eyes sleepily that was weird he muttered then he remembered the dream i knew i liked her but i thought it was just a silly crush i could get rid of if i asked her to the dance i mean she thinks of me as her best friend oh great i have more chances of surviving the biting bunny candy than than oh never mind i tired sighing ron rolled over and fell asleep again soon the room was filled once again with his stertor which would have reminded a muggle of a chainsaw oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo lily was lying down on her bed not quite asleep but not quite awake tomorrow night was a hogsmeade day and the half moon and she knew that she would need all the sleep she could get however she was nervous about the veritas durmiendi potion and what it would reveal she already knew about james and harry and she strongly suspected that he would be their only child she also knew that the potion would not harm her she looked it up in a spellbook shortly after drinking it if it had been she would have had to make the antipotion short for antidote potion as the veritas durmiendi took over she fell into a deep sleep but somehow was still able to think as she observed her dream a young fairy barely matured was trying out her adult human form for the first time she had flaming hair similar to lily s although her eyes were a vibrant blue the fairy tiptoed carefully at the edge of the forest trying to get used to walking instead of flying not many had been in this part of the forest alone since the humans had started building the castle outside the town but she had not grown out of being curious dontgo around the humans until you know your powers completely that is how to use them in your other forms her teachers had warned her but she almost couldnthelp herself she wanted to see what the humans were building and more importantly who was building it as she came closer she saw that the foundation had been finished and they had begun one tall section built with many stones a tower lily mind supplied there did not appear to be anyone around so she stepped closer ever so carefully it was hard to keep from falling in these awkward human feet which were sore and bloody from the rocks twigs and leaves that she had been stepping on finally she was only twenty feet away but now she sensed human presence she shifted her head and sniffed but she could not tell exactly where the scent was she did not do well with locating scents in human form she focused her eyes on one point and opened her mouth slightly obviously about to perform a locating spell but then she heard a voice who there the voice called oof the fairy muttered quietly as she stumbled she quickly rose turned around and attempted to flee despite her sore feet turn invisible silly lily wanted to tell her wait stop accio intruder the low voice said obviously a man he came into lily view as the fairy was drawn toward him by the spell at first lily could not tell who he was but at a second glance she recognized him godric gryffindor sorry about that he said affably as he distanced himself from her still holding her hands however i a bit nervous about intruders who are you and what are you doing here his voice was calm but commanding and even the fairy was slightly intimidated but godric could not tell as he was not used to reading fairies expressions who are you she retorted i asked first he responded now will you tell me or do i have to give you veritaserum the fairy looked curiously at him veritaserum what in morgan name i ve never heard that epithet before but veritaserum forces you to tell the truth now please answer my question honestly and look at my eyes while doing so he replied the fairy detected a strong will and a sense of humor as she looked into his hazel eyes all right she replied i was simply taking a walk because i was curious about what you are building and my name she paused momentarily you may call me aranya his lips curled up slightly in the hint of a smile she looked down this human had a strange power she had heard of magic but human always had to use sticks or at least words aranya you may call me godric would you like to have a tour he asked letting go of her hands she stared at him probing his eyes for motives finding no ulterior motives she nodded that would be nice he then proceeded to show aranya evandra le fae what they had built so far in hogwarts and how he hoped it would be she found herself fascinated with his dreams as he talked about a place for other humans to learn about magic and how to respect the other magical beings during the tour she tripped yet again she was almost used to her human form by now but her bloodied feet pleaded for rest he helped her up but noticed the blood on the foundation your feet are bleeding he commented incredulously i cantbelieve let me transfigure you some shoes he suggested the word shoes was not listed in their human vocabulary studies but she quickly figured out that humans wore them on their feet especially when he gave her a small but comfortable looking pair that he had transfigured thank you she replied as she fumbled with this odd object let me show you how to put these on he suggested i forgot that i ve modified the design you see all you have to do is say aperio and a flap will open up see there then you can put them on your feet and they will stay on once you press them down it very useful much more so than the other fastenings people have been using thank you the fairy replied yet again your kindness will not be forgotten she muttered a quick spell to heal her feet before putting the shoes on then looked up to find him looking at her strangely oops she thought lily subconscious was also wary where your wand he asked his eyes narrowing you expecto patronum a silvery lion came out and circled around him then around her but did not attack her at all hmm he muttered why didntit i didntintend to harm you she responded amusedly you re not the only one to know magic no he replied what are you he asked what is it she questioned slightly offended i no less less she paused let see you re not a ghost even if you are a little pale you re not close enough to the water to be a sea nymph if they even exist there are wood nymphs though according to myths you re no veela well actually he admitted you could be they ve never affected me but i ve never heard of a veela doing wandless magic veelas she muttered scornfully honestly they used to lure men to their death dressed in horrid birdsuits now they are not so bad although will i see you again he asked she nodded slowly the moon had almost sunk below the horizon smiling she bid him goodbye thank you for the shoes i ll have to find some way to repay you she told him then she turned around and left him as soon as she was out of sight and knew that no one else was around she changed into her fairy form storing her shoes somewhere in space now her feet could heal now i know what captivates some of us fairies and the undines she murmured as she flew to her home but how to repay him she wondered the potion wore off and lily dream ceased she forced herself to wake and felt under her pillow for her diary this was something that she must write down and if possible research how much had hogwarts influenced fairy knowledge and vice versa what happened to aranya evandra le fae were there still undines around hogwarts or other sea nymphs lily sighed and began scribbling down everything she remembered using her wand for light harry wasntexactly delighted with the prospect of having potion induced dreams and did not want to know what the potion would reveal he especially did not want voldemort to gain any information so he used the occlumency that snape and dumbledore had taught him to shield his mind from any outside intrusion then he opened quidditch through the ages and began reading until the potion set in a young girl with bright red hair and freckles stomped into a cluttered room fred and george weasley you are going to get it she announced the two boys who had the same vibrant hue of hair as the girl smirked at her impishly right gin gin the twin on the right said as if you could get us in trouble without tattling the other scoffed oh the girl ginny asked i dontknow about that i am not going to subject myself to your condescension have you been reading mum dictionary again one of the twins asked that not good for you you ve got to be a weasley girl which is why i wontlet you get away with putting a spider in ron bed ginny responded it still there and mum is planning to clean his room any minute now the twins panicked no they protested we ve got to get out of here get out of the way shorty one added she just stood her ground get out of the way or i ll hex you no underage magic she replied in a sing song voice besides mum would kill you if you harmed her little gin gin so either give me 100 of those acid pops or you re in trouble they groaned we donthave 100 acid pops one groaned how about we tell you about the boy who lived again hmm she considered not good enough i need acid pops er how about you test out our newest invention the other twin suggested no the other protested those are what would this be she asked her interest piqued canary creams we er tried it on scabbers but he seemed to be in a lot of pain and he turned into a purple canary perfect how about twenty of those and telling me about the boy who lived again she asked eagerly deal they shouted just let us out of here she moved aside grinning impishly they removed the spider only moments before molly weasley entered ron room close shave eh gred one of the twins asked the other as soon as they entered their room they did not see ginny in the corner yep but that what we weasley twins are good at forge that how we keep up our war with filch at hogwarts yet another thing mum would maim you for ginny drawled they jumped why you sneaky little they screamed mrs weasley was immediately on the scene are you threatening your little sister she demanded no ginny replied they were just about to tell me a story right brother dears she asked sweetly yes mum they added oh mrs weasley responded well then go ahead boys ginny be sure to call me if they pick on you thanks mum she replied bye she added as mrs weasley left say er thanks one of the twins muttered what do you want for that what makes you think i didntdo it out of good will she asked they just stared at her all right i want one of those canary cream treats once you ve perfected them because it will not work well if i don t er done the other twin replied their eyes twinkling mischievously i always like a good prank who it on she shook her head and smiled impishly i ll tell you after i manage to pull it off i might need a little assistance in the set up though my little sister is following our path forge arentyou proud the twin on the left asked only as long as we remain five steps ahead of her gred the other twin answered the scene faded out and then he saw ginny in a classroom with nineteen other students she was standing nervously at the front of the room obviously waiting to recite something her face was almost transparent which made her freckles even more apparent all right ginevra the teacher said say the poem she gulped and took a deep breath red and y yellow blue and gray m make a gr grad great and lov lovely bou bouquet by this time the whole class was tittering even the teacher honestly cantyou stop stuttering redhead i guess the fire in your hair burnt your brain one boy taunted the teacher was trying unsuccessfully to hide her pride in his mocking capabilities now phosphorus please refrain from insulting ginevra ginevra continue she added by now ginny was furious and her face had turned from white to a dark red aww little nevvie is embarrassed one of the girls cood ginny glared red and yellow pink and grey i guess those flowers are kinda neat add some arsenic and i d say it ready for you all to eat she yelled the students and teacher looked surprised and soon the students started laughing again really ginevra you are rather strange arsenic what in the world would that be dear the teacher asked oh it a special spice she replied sweetly i read about it in a muggle book my dad has the others continued laughing well now that you ve mentioned food the teacher announced i might as well tell you that ms blackhousen has sent us goodies now why dontyou all come and get some she asked bringing out a canister ginny shoeved herself through the crowd to the canister and pretended to pull a sweet out having taken it from her pocket oooh these look good one of the students said hey let see who can eat it the fastest yaay the other students cheered the teacher counted off and they all popped the candy in their mouth ginny felt her body becoming more compact as she turned into a canary and marvelled at how much her classmates and teacher were groaning she could tell they were in quite a bit of pain this continued for fifteen minutes which was when they all turned back to normal however the rest of the students and the teacher looked a little green class we d better dismiss early the teacher gasped i feel a bit er sick so scram i mean please leave as quickly as possible she sighed and put her hand on her head the others slowly walked out of class moaning about their stomachs mission accomplished ginny muttered under her breath as she departed once she was out of sight she skipped for three miles along the roads until she arrived home harry woke up and was choking down laughter ginny little poem had been hilarious for someone her age although it was a bit frightening that she knew about arsenic he had always heard that ginevra weasley was as mischievous as the twins but now he had seen it in action no wonder she had idolized this boy who lived that was supposed to make things right when she had all of those idiotic people ridiculing her bullying her it was satisfying to see her fight back while he wondered why he had dreamed about her he was glad he did not have a flashback of his parents death you awake sirius asked harry groaned yeah he grumbled i wanted to go back to sleep though he covered his ears with his pillow and closed his eyes whatever sirius had to say could wait until the next morning ooooooooooooooooooooooo after searching the halls for students out of bed and tripping over mrs norris who promptly threw a fit remus scurried back to his room with filch on the trail glad that his prefect duties were done when he was finally safe he allowed himself to catch his breath and realized that he was exhausted schoolwork playing pranks prefect duties and finding time for brenna had finally caught up to him and he was dead tired after pulling his covers back remus climbed into bed without even bothering to change he fell asleep seconds later when the veritas durmiendi took over two redheaded boys with freckles and impish grins were standing over a cauldron in a room with potions gadgets and other random objects strewn about they were obviously identical twins if he had not seen this by their appearances he would have known by their chatter hey gred do you think we have the weasley colorblast chewing gum ready yet one twin asked the other sure forge let give it to ron no last time we tested a project on ickle ronnikins we got in trouble remember you re right gred let test it on cousin liddy she annoying and she canteven stand wizards do you think mum will care nah especially if she doesntknow i was just about to suggest that myself in fact let floo to their house one of the twins grabbed some floo powder from a jar in the corner of their room grabbed his twin hand and said 1440 abigail lane as they jumped into the nearby unlit fireplace we re here they both whispered they walked out of a different fireplace covered in soot dontthey ever clean this place out forge one asked i guess not gred where liddy room i dunno but i guessing it upstairs after looking and listening for other inhabitation they climbed the steps as quietly as they could it too bad we wonthave a camera or something one twin mused oh phooey the other muttered we d better hope that she home then so we can watch they went around the corner and found several doors open the first room was the bathroom but the second room was their destination sure enough there was a pouting red headed six year old playing with blocks and dolls hey liddy how our favorite cousin a twin asked she glared at them i was playing dollies no wanna clean up you get me pizza and more toys we know we just brought you some bubble gum the other twin answered her face brightened immediately what kind it a special kind here you go he added as he handed a piece of colorblast gum to her she chewed and three chews later she turned blue after chewing three more times her skin was chartreuse after seeing that it worked the twins decided to leave they hurried down the stairs into the living room but just before they made their escape through the fireplace liddy shrieks echoed down the stairs you meanies the two mischievous twins continued however and flooed back to the original room it worked they both shouted i cantbelieve it worked the dream began to fade out as the veritas durmiendi lost control and the dream ended with the twins giving each other high fives remus woke up for a moment but he was too tired to stay awake for long good pranksters he mumbled too bad i didntdiscover the cure for lycanthropy he added before falling asleep again riona was having a good dream where she had won a thousand dollar shopping spree and had three carts full of clothes when her dream suddenly faded and the veritas durmiendi took over saffron saffron runa soleine please get down here runa mother called her runa got up and ran down the stairs yes mum she asked you re supposed to be um dead right she snorted well since you re so stubborn i get to tell you to stop being an idiot and realize it good to see you mum but couldntyou keep from insulting me her mother an older and slightly shorter version of herself sighed and nodded i suppose oh runa it so good to see you again she embraced runa who hugged her back with a surprised expression uh mum why are you calling me runa and hugging me you never regrets honey she replied saffron was your father idea anyway it a nice plant really but anyway that not the reason i came here want some tea and crumpets runa asked sarcastically immediately a table with a tray of hot tea and crumpets appeared that was just too weird even for a magical person she muttered it a dream world and yes tea would be very nice anyway dear there that nice sirius black who been chasing you and i you mean the biggest flirt in hogwarts she interrupted honestly mum i saffron runa soleine she interrupted honestly runa darling cantyou he already stopped dating for two years ignored his fan club and tried to get you to notice him even through pranks nothing seems to be working even the glue trick your friends tried love he had a hard life and he wants to share what he can with you of course he ll end up in the azkaban for twelve years what runa shouted oops i wasntsupposed

this funny time change and that oops i really should shut up why arentyou being talkative let see first of all you re forcing me to see that i supposed to all right i do love sirius black which i was

tasting potion maybe her mother smiled mysteriously i d like to argue some more really but i ve got to leave the silly potion is wearing off and i ll have to well i ll see you some other time here she said handing runa a bracelet and a simple brown leather bound journal that ll keep the death eaters from hurting you it a combination portkey and sheild the journal is for you to write in by saffron runa she added with a smile bye mum runa replied and it runa her mother and the table complete with the tea and crumpets were fading rapidly and runa felt herself waking up that was weird she muttered to herself once she was awake then she realized that she had two things in her hand a bracelet and a leather bound journal that was really weird she added and why wontshe just call me runa sighing she grabbed her wand said the spell for light and searched for a quill among the things by her bed after finding it she opened the journal skipped over the page with words and started writing zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz james was glad that he had a separate sleeping area from the others but he could still hear sirius and ron snoring loud enough to wake the dead or at least incite curiosity from sir nicholas the house ghost who knew where he was anyway he didntreally mind the snoring too much though now that he was head boy quidditch captain and still had to do his schoolwork he could fall asleep easily unless he sensed danger while earlier he thought he would be apprehensive about the veritas durmiendi potion he managed to fall asleep right away partially because it was time for the potion to kick in there were two men and two women in the shadows of a hallway in hogwarts that james could not quite see he slowly stepped closer to observe them as he tiptoed down the hallway he saw various tapestries not paintings as he would have thought he had never seen this hallway before even on the marauders map and had no clue why the marauders had not found this hallway before however somehow he knew he was in the hogwarts castle as he drew closer he saw the outlines of the group more clearlyand could now hear the conversation i sick of this feud godric gryffindor commented salazar old friend there needs to be unity in a school and i for one am brave enough to admit it do not talk to me about courage salazar slytherin grumbled it is wits that will help this school and you know it furthermore please salazar godric stop this bickering we do need unity among our students once they arrive and that will only happen if we can cooperate i dontsee anything wrong with muggle borns either salazar of course there something wrong with them salazar roared they re a disgrace they re they are sometime more intelligent than purebloods rowena ravenclaw inserted honestly salazar i am telling you that every one of us has come from a muggle born family why i have records i did not come from a a mudblood family salazar growled his voice quieter but laced with fury salazar we are all running this school godric reminded him calmly she does have a point i ve seen the records now donttell me that you really have put a basilisk down in that secret chamber of yours he added especially since your mother silence salazar roared you and that strange wife of yours my mother and is honestly we ve gotten better than the muggle borns actually in breeding results in some rather strange birth defects rowena interrupted and where do you think your parseltongue came from salazar do you really think your mother is a pureblood witch he glared at her no and godric your crazy wife had better stop owling evania godric eyes were starting to glow with anger aranya and evania have minds of their own and i sure they d prefer and you think your wife is a witch rowena laughed salazar you really need to study godric you need to tone down your temper and bombastic speeches both salazar and godric were about to sleep but they found themselves surrounded with vines helga and rowena stood dumbstruck as they saw two other figures approaching evania aranya it so good to see you here perhaps you can defer your husbands godric you re right that we wontlisten if salazar tells us not to communicate evania replied calmly she nervously combed her long dark hair with her fingers salazar love there is something i should have told you long ago you re you re a muggle born he gasped astonished not exactly she replied quietly aranya please help me i can t she stopped mid sentence and wrung her hands what she trying to say salazar muggle born are not bad at all i am not either but you are right when you say that i am strange however so is evania in a different way see i ve been theorizing the ways that magic came to humans you arenthuman rowena interrupted shocked i thought you need to do more research rowena evania responded anyway magic came to humans so long ago that it has changed form you need spells and wands we don t although sometimes we use spells besides you have all heard of squibs what else do you think muggles are that does make sense helga interrupted see i knew it no salazar screamed evania stepped forward and knelt down by her fallen husband i love you salazar i didntknow how to tell you but i not human she leaned forward and whispered in his ear salazar face became wan upon hearing her words evania love he whispered weakly his anger and obstinate nature had diffused and now he was simply worn out evania smiled slightly hesitantly as if she could not trust her own senses and feel relieved do you mean that you dontmind she asked quietly you you still love me he nodded but still looked a bit frightened aranya had been quiet but now she spoke up again salazar muggle borns will be allowed into the school that final all right he replied weakly i i agree no rowena dontgloat i know i ve been fighting what you told me about my ancestry godric dontstart on me either he was starting to recover his color friends godric asked quietly i d hold out my hand but yes we are friends godric salazar replied he looked defeated ashamed however i have set a monster loose that will come to light someday please forgive me he whispered a tear falling down his cheek shocked at the sight the other three heads could not speak it will be defeated aranya replied evenly i ll make sure of it one of my heirs can battle it the second time it reappears i suppose centaurs divination skills are good for something salazar godric thank you for setting aside your bullheaded behavior for a moment i know i almost ruined your friendship but both eva and i would prefer you to be the friends you always have been please evania added they both nodded and the vines that entrapped them broke and shriveled to dust godric and salazar got up faced each other and pledged their friendship anew well friend it looks like these women are superwizard salazar commented wryly putting his arm around evania she embraced him kissed him on the cheek and pulled away aranya and i have something to do she replied go on all of you the four founders moved away but she and aranya remained aranya took a normal leather bound book and placed it between them then they muttered a spell a flash of white light enveloped the room then it was over all right now to hide it evania murmured she carefully pulled out a stone then moved her hands along it it became thinner and thinner so that she could fit the book behind it they hid the book before replacing the stone this is for the dreamer and his son aranya murmured his wife too something tells me perhaps especially his wife oh dontyou start divining evania teased how are we supposed to update it rani mentally she replied see the spell will automatically update it from the memory of what we see and hear i er also put spells on godric salazar helga and rowena i am not divining either you know how inaccurate the centaurs can be and they re the best diviners in the world i just know somehow i glad they do not know about the spell evania laughed it so amazing especially that salazar thought he could separate us she smiled i love him i so glad aranya hugged her i as well aranya interrupted i am glad as well then all of the sudden the scene faded out the veritas durmiendi potion had worn off james opened his eyes and stared at the ceiling his dream had been strange too strange hadntsalazar slytherin and godric gryffindor parted on bad terms since salazar had put that snake james supposed it couldnthave been hagrid spider in the secret chamber why couldnthe redo it if he had felt remorse james closed his eyes momentarily and then reopened them what does this have to do with lily and harry anyway he grumbled hoarsely aranya evania must tell lily he murmured sleepily before falling asleep again then he began to dream again muttering in his sleep about lily food pink catapults and strange hallways until morning zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz marianela spent half the night tossing and turning her roommates and friends were sleeping oddly save ginny hermione rarely talked in her sleep but tonight marianela could hear her muttering random things about grades even though newts were many months away eventually she decided to check on runa and brenna through the portal they were acting just as strangely in their sleep as the others brenna appeared to be clawing at someone and runa clenched and unclenched her fists as she dreamt es loco marianela muttered under her breath it crazy todas mis amigas est n durmiendo pero porque all of my friends are asleep but why how should i know ginny whispered behind her she whirled around why did you sneak up on me like that because i felt like it and i wanted to see if bren and runes were acting as strangely as lils and hermione were oh marianela responded when did you wake up five minutes ago do you think they would wake up if we drew moustaches on them maranela rolled her eyes no they wouldn t and dontyou dare let go back and try to get some sleep it not like they re snoring or anything marianela added as she dragged her friend through the portal spoil sport ginny muttered too bad

then came the morning despite their odd dreams the marauders still managed to wake up the next morning remus of course was the first to wake when he found sirius slumped over a book he panicked and started shaking him padfoot are you all right are you grr sirius growled of course i all right now what gives you the right to wake me up like that i was about to say the same thing harry added groggily oh remus replied sorry about that it just that you were reading and i told you i was going to the library last night mates he grumbled is it that surprising he asked yes ron harry and remus replied i haventheard anything from prongs yet ron added then they heard the shower start up the bugger brain he stole the shower remus growled well can we go back to sleep now ron asked no it a hogsmeade day sirius replied so what were you reading harry asked his response was unintelligable what did you say he asked i couldnthear you the history of the house of black sirius repeated speaking louder this time the rest of them gasped what did you say remus asked how can you they werentall bad mates black is a nice enough color you know my great uncle orion was an auror ugh veritas durmiendi is weird ron complained it interesting though hey ron did ginny donteven mention my sister ron grumbled i hungry go to the kitchen or the dining hall remus replied mildly now that he was fully awake and over the shock of seeing sirius reading he was in a good mood all right moony hey moony i know you re a werewolf and all but could you re apply for the dark arts position our seventh year i mean you re still a good teacher and dumbledore shouldntgive a rap about what people think um remus replied not sure of what to say he resigned harry reminded him so he would be better than snape and even you know who would be better than umbridge who sirius asked harry sighed voldemort the rest of them jumped all right voldy wart then harry amended the rest burst out laughing i think you need coffee he observed i hate coffee remus replied hot chocolate or butterbeer perhaps coffee sirius asked what that yeah mate what is it ron reiterated it a muggle drink with lots of caffeine in it oh ron replied disinterestedly i want some sirius announced to no one in particular the shower stopped dibs on the shower remus said second harry added third ron said why do i have to be last sirius asked plaintively trying out a puppy dog face go see if you can visit murzim ron suggested i doubt runa soleine would appreciate it if i woke her up and asked to visit her dog sirius informed ron plus moony probably wants me to let his girlfriend sleep in although how he can spend time in her company when she asleep in her dormitory is beyond me when has runa irritation stopped you before remus asked many times actually maybe it 10 percent of the time harry rolled his eyes and james entered the scene see ya remus replied rushing to claim the shower not even a good morning james commented so what did you dream about sirius asked lily no duh ron remarked actually i didn t sirius mouth flew open but get over it padfoot what were you reading he asked i out of here sirius grumbled stomping toward the door wait padfoot ron called after him you er might not want to leave without changing from your pajamas grr runa grumbled the next morning when she woke i cantbelieve grr my name is runa she screamed waking brenna runes what wrong she asked groggily already holding her wand of course your name is runa runa blushed sorry she replied meekly i just well mother kept going back and forth between runa and saffron runa last night and that drives me insane realizing what she had just said she hoped brenna would understand enough not to send her to st mungo s you saw your mom last night with the veritas durmiendi i mean brenna amended cool i well i got to relive my childhood she admitted i didntknow my father was is a werewolf now runa cocked an eyebrow your father is a werewolf runa asked yeesh that weirder than my dream and now you re dating one she continued incredulously yep brenna replied i ll cure them someday right runa muttered murzim however did not like how the conversation was going or the fact that he was being left out and he leapt onto runa bed murzim she protested he answered with a short bark all right already good morning to you too feather brain and i ll get you a doggy biscuit murzim wagged his tail and then jumped from runa bed to brenna s hey murzy brenna greeted him it a hogsmeade day wanna come he barked translation please runes she asked her friend who was unwillingly getting up from her warm bed to get murzim treat he says there no way we can leave without him she replied unfortunately i mean fortunately he right by now she had reached the magically locked container where she kept the dog treats while murzim claimed that no mtter how many dog treats he ate he would be fine she did not believe him upon seeing the treat however he immediately jumped down from the bed to claim his treat spoiled rotten dog runa muttered as she gave murzim what he wanted he ignored her and immediately gobbled it up since he can understand us why canthe speak our language brenna asked murzim barked a response mainly because he doesntfeel like it runa translated come here you little brute wait it a hogsmeade day i get first dibs on the shower brenna rolled her eyes good you need it she teased playfully hey runa protested watch it or i ll use the hot water up oh no problem brenna replied cheerily i know how to use a warming charm whatever in only minutes i shall emerge clean fragrant and soaking wet brenna suggested runa rolled her eyes i was going to say beautiful but that works too ta ta for now she added and with a wave she disappeared into their bathroom xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx lily was the first to rise on the other side of the girls portal immediately she took a shower to wake herself and then she found her journal and scribbled down everything she remembered from her dream last night for thirty minutes she wrote in peace but after that hermione woke up good morning lily she greeted her you re up early it is seven o clock lily reminded her after glancing at her watch we get up earlier on week days and it a hogwart weekend hermione agreed well i think i will take a shower before anyone else wakes up there are two stalls lily reminded her well i still want one of them hermione replied after grabbing a towel and a few other toiletries she went off to revel in the hot water and cleanse herself of course by now lily had finished writing down her dream so she closed her journal and decided to work on an extra credit transfiguration essay she figured that she needed all the help she could get in that subject hey lils why are you doing homework on a hogsmeade day this time lily looked up to find that marianela had interrupted her work hi nela she said absently you didntanswer my question chica marianela reminded her it for transfiguration that why lily replied she stuck the parchment in the textbook and slammed it shut waking ginny who groaned and pulled the covers over her head come on gin marianela urged her from across the room you already woke up no i didn t ginny replied groggily oh right i did she added she sat up so why were you and hermione sleeping funny last night are you referring to me or nela lily asked you both marianela and ginny answered oh lily replied well our potions teacher made us take a potion that affected our sleep and gave us an odd dream hmph ginny muttered she slowly pushed the covers away and got up from her bed dibs on the shower she added hermione is in one lily replied now will someone let me do my transfiguration essay no replied runa who was coming through the portal i bored brenna is in the shower does anyone want their makeup done or clothes picked out she asked no three voices answered in unison i going to take a shower ginny and marianela spoke simultaneously i woke up first marianela added i dibsed it ginny protested so i was up first and i need to see dumbledore about settling things in spain so what are you doing here ginny asked huh hermione asked as she came out of the shower area with a towel around her marianela is currently a resident of this room and she has every right ginny cleared her throat as i was saying since she lives here i am curious about the reason for which you questioned her presence in this room she hasntasked about spain yet lily replied why dontboth of you take your showers since both are open okay ginny and marianela replied as long as i get a shower i happy ginny added after grabbing a towel and a few other items she ran to the bathroom in search of hot water marianela soon followed so who first runa asked pardon hermione murmured you are runa turned to face her now mione dear you really dontwant to go out wearing denim this time hermione groaned lily might i have a bit of assistance she asked lily bit her lip mmm lily said absently she was buried in her transfiguration essay she not paying attention runa informed hermione now open up the closet xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx the marauders had finally managed to prepare themselves for hogsmeade although there were several pranks played before they could get going sirius had tured remus hair lime green james had found a dead bee in the bathroom and levitated it toward ron and harry had found some never melting ice cubes he and ron levitated them down the original marauders shirts however remus managed to beat them all he had put a hex on their clothing to change color based on their moods and thoughts he especially enjoyed when sirius outfit turned pink when he first saw runa that was when the other marauders knew there was something amiss fortunately for him he had left the hex off of himself so that when he caught a glimpse of brenna across the cafeteria his clothes did not change color unfortunately for remus ron knew the counter hex fred and george had been giving him a few lessons during his sixth year to prepare him for a summer job with them darn he muttered when ron had successfully removed the hex from everyone clothing i was hoping none of you would know about that oh fred and george were experimenting on it for a product ron explained i ve learned a lot from them you re their heroes by the way he added unneccessarily james remus and sirius beamed well they chose good models sirius declared hey why are we taking the open route to hogsmeade again he asked quietly because it relatively warm today and we wanted to see the scenery remus explained you mean that you wanted to see the scenery harry corrected him i dontmind it either though i just wish i had worn a jacket he added use a warming charm james suggested they re too warm harry replied i ve been working on one that it temperature sensitive that easy mate sirius told him just say aestas temporis instead of just aestas and you can mentally control the temperature okay thanks harry said before trying out the charm it works he added i might do that too ron said to no one in particular look there zonko s he added excitedly i need to find more things for fred and george to look over good idea mate harry told him i glad their company is will be was what tense am i supposed to use i just glad that you and the twins are making money me too ron confided these twins sound intriguing remus commented will i ever get to prank them successfully he asked not telling ron and harry both replied hmph james muttered come on let go into zonko s he dragged his friends into the store glad to finally be there again hey marauders the owner greeted them cheerfully i glad you re here again would you like to try some beauty isn t even skin deep cream i ll give it to you for half the price let me guess its name was too long for it to sell remus suggested that and the wfda got on me for selling unsafe products the owner sighed they ve no appreciation for my art you should try ron immediately closed his mouth scuse me zonko owner asked did you say something i was just going to look for candied worms ron replied quickly oh he replied over on the right he added disappointedly whew harry muttered when he had left that was close very ron agreed what this sirius asked did you think of a new product or two remus questioned ron nodded do you have any scrap paper sure james said reaching into his pocket and handing him a scrap of parchment i have a quill too self inking thanks mate ron replied quickly using them to scribble down sleeping powder cream b sleep and improve mood clothing imitate muggle mood rings oh that looks good sirius complimented him fred and george will love those ideas harry added as ron pocketed the paper yep he replied cheerfully now let get some pranking supplies meanwhile runa had managed to drag the rest of the secuestradoras into a shoe shop magic steps emporium they had spent thirty minutes in there and hermione was sick of trying on shoes come on runes let go she pleaded just try on the black heels runa suggested you re buying these three pair she added motioning to several boxes of shoes in a row all right hermione sighed brenna too was irritated with the shoe shopping ginny had managed to hide in a corner and lily had escaped to the bathroom why dontyou wear those out after you buy them she suggested i might as well she grumbled picking up her boxes and walking to the cash register brenna followed she herself being attached to some hot pink heels so you re going to wear those outside the lady asked obviously hermione replied slightly disgruntled look mione there no reason to gripe ginny told her having returned from her hiding spot the cashier said as little as possible and completed hermione transaction quickly soon brenna was done as well then as they were walking out the door runa heard her mutter uh oh what she asked the cashier turning back finite incantem she replied nervously i so sorry it s come on hermione growled dragging runa out of the shop it time to go into another bloody shop lily ginny and runa stared at hermione as they walked and she fumed brenna was a bit dazed and paid no attention look there the guys ginny exclaimed when she saw them approaching hey harry hey ron hi moony padfoot and prongs she shouted ronald billius weasley hermione shouted get your hideous self out of my sight ron looked bewildered hermione are you all right he asked you look a little pale how dare you question my health she screamed as she did so brenna started acting up hey padfoot you got a date tonight remus she giggled throwing her arms around him and staying extremely close how re you doing honey le find ourselves a by now remus had turned bright red from embarrassment brens are you okay runa lily and ginny asked simultaneously hermione was still yelling at everyone and everything and brenna was being very very clingy i fine brenna replied better n ever she giggled again remus stood there bewildered not sure whether or not to shove her away when she was acting this strangely what going on here harry demanded i wonder runa muttered you wonder what ginny demanded now hermione had a terrified ron against the wall and was about to hit him ron was trying his hardest to be chivalrous and not punch her in the stomach finite incantem runa shouted her wand pointed toward hermione shoes then she did the same for brenna what hermione asked ron oh i so sorry she wailed letting go what on earth is going on here brenna was just as confused when she realized how close she was to remus she shot away from him embarrassed what i sorry she muttered weakly i i wondered what the girl in magic steps emporium meant runa interrupted somehow there were mood spells on those shoes you were in quite a hurry pouncer ginny added ron next time just punch her in the stomach hermione blushed i didntknow why didntwe notice anything different about brenna lily questioned oh right it made her flirty and there werentany guys around she realized answering her own question next time you go shopping please check for spells sirius begged soleine your temper is bad enough without you being under a hex where did you go james asked magic steps emporium brenna admitted i i sorry she apologized to remus he blushed again no problem he replied however i think you may need to watch out the other marauders laughed where nela lily asked suddenly she out with sara for a little while ginny replied we re meeting them in fifteen minutes at the three broomsticks remember oh lily responded then they heard a beeping noise coming from ginny backpack what that ron demanded it in morse code whatever it is remus commented brenna however was listening it nela she replied worriedly she needs back up she by honeydukes and the bookshop ok ginny responded her eyes brightened by fury let me at em wands ready everyone and let get going she commanded as she thrust herself through the crowd vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv marianela and sara had found a second hand store the thrifty magician next to sara favorite bookstore she hadntbought a dress for the ball yet and didntwant to spend much money she was saving most of what she had for italy i cantbelieve my luck she enthused as she browsed through the racks this necklace is gorgeous dontyou think she added picking up a slender silver chain with a purplish pendant marianela looked at it carefully it fake she replied disgustedly it not even a good fake she added sarah looked over at her in surprise how do you know she asked well i just have to look at it in the light she replied my father was a jeweler are you muggle born then sara asked surprised no not really marianela replied there can be wizard jewelers my father was one of them can we go look at the clothes she asked sure sara agreed how else am i going to find something to wear at the ball you could just wear school robes marianela replied half joking it would certainly drive annie and rosa nuts true sara admitted she dragged her friend over to the clothing section here they are let see if we can find anything immediately she began flipping through without success after five minutes she was grumbling and ready to leave why dontthey have my size she moaned honestly this is insane because i was expecting you silly a voice behind them explained they turned around and saw a short old looking witch who was smiling with almost toothless mouth oh hi myra sara greeted her cheerfully how did you know i d be coming heard talk of a ball she explained besides you re one of my regulars sara blushed thanks so are there any dresses or robes in my size she asked just one myra apologized it a muggle dress but if i clean it up a little it ll be fine all right sara agreed thanks where is it over here by the way who is your friend marianela perez y prado i d like you to meet myra goldleaf sara introduced them myra this is marianela marianela curtsied and myra peered closer at her through her glasses nice to meet you marianela said stop the pleasantries myra ordered she turned around and probed marianela expression i think you meant that though now let look at the dress she led them to a storage room in the back of the store it was cluttered with various items and there was barely room to walk i get lots of things in from purebloods who are ashamed to wear anything more than once or admit that they ve got a tight budget i ve got everything here from dress robes to crystal balls to trunks to what this marianela asked picking up a cork box covered in ornate leather designs and carvings oh that that a keeping box that the russian wizards liked to make in the 1600 s actually it can store more things than one thinks everything in it is invisible and automatically shrinks there a spell somewhere to take everything out of it to find out what is in there if you dontknow i cantremember it right now it plethora or something like that cool marianela said cheerily how much is it myra tilted her head it outdated you silly persnickety wait you re not silly or persnickety are you she asked not expecting a response anyway i guess it isnt that outdated erm one galleon she said and dontsue me if there something in there that harmful i really dontknow haventhad a chance to look at it or look up the spell okay marianela replied it like ginny handbag only it not a purse no myra agreed but i think you ll find it useful it would be even better if it werentso pretty it still nice though marianela replied i ll take it she added pulling a gold coin from her purse thanks hon myra said as she pocketed the galleon now sara the dress is back here in that corner sara looked in the direction that myra was pointing and saw an old dull yellow dress covered in sequins and brown stains um it got a lot of stains on it sara pointed out i really cantwear something like that to the ball no myra agreed it too bad i a squib i do have a list of spells that will help though i ve seen you do magic before sara protested the proprietress cut her off i ve got a trick wand with a number of useful spells put in it by my daughter all i have to do is say the spell and no one is the wiser she walked to another part of the storage room stepping over various objects on the floor oh here is is she beamed as she picked up a book cleaning spells everything a seamstress needs to know about refurbishing clothing tapestries and etcetera that a long title sara observed are you trying to sell me that too nah myra replied as she flipped through it too useful i have my daughter use it here it is she added pulling out a piece of paper these are the spells you need to use try them here she handed sara the paper sara skimmed it and saw six spells written down that included stain removal fabric strengthening a softening charm a quick dye charm an anti fading and anti stain charm and a color strengthening charm all right she replied cheerily then she performed the first three spll amazingly the dress now looked as good as new but it was still banana yellow with silver sequins on it ugh marianela commented please tell me you plan to change the color she added obviously she replied what do you think nela should i change it to green or pink it depends on the shade how about coral huh what kind of color is that erm nevermind i ll think of something else you think of color in gemstones dontyou myra commented marianela jumped up startled somewhat yes she replied dontjolt like that back here myra grumbled you ll hurt yourself or worse break something it nice to know you re so concerned about your customers health marianela replied sarcastically um my dress sara prodded what color should i make it pink marianela replied a deep pink like oh crud i cantremember the stones that color just make it sunset rose how am i supposed to know myra flipped through the book again and interrupted her here you go see it myra asked this is what you ll say the color as in the spell if it complicated yes thank you marianela replied this says it fe78aa an i used paint and a calculator to find the hex numbers like you use with html r254 g120 b170 all right sara decided that pretty she then used the quick dye charm i like this she decided before doing the remaining charms it old fashioned myra warned no problem sara replied that means that it ll be unique undique myra asked confused that means on all sides in latin unique sara corrected her how much is the dress two galleons myra replied sara bit her lip however since you refurbished it i ll give it to you for one sara smiled thanks myra she said gratefully she got out a gold galleon and handed it to her thank you ms goldleaf marianela echoed myra the squib corrected her myra then how do we get out of here go that way then turn into the second door on the left she replied here let me bag your items she used her trick wand to do so then handed the girls their bags bye myra they called before following her instructions hmph she responded chuckling girls these days she added before inventorying new items only marianela and sara had exited the store however the sight of the outside world was not welcome rosa annie and four boys from slytherin and ravenclaw had surrounded the entrance hello marianela greeted them coolly mind if we pass through as a matter of fact we do spaniard annie replied now give me my necklace is that supposed to be an insult sara asked dontbe an idiot rosa advised hanging out with dirt really doesnthelp your social standing nor does shopping at second hand stores if you wontlet us pass i suppose we ll just have to cut through marianela responded excuse me boys she added pushing the bag up on her arm and pulling out her wand i d rather not have this get messy especially since you re outnumbered annie replied now give me my necklace do you mean my mother necklace marianela smirked as if your mother could own such a necklace annie sneered just give it to her franco one of the slytherin boys demanded marianela eyes flashed franco and his men were responsible for her family death and she did not take that lightly it was all she could do not to start the fight with that provocation if i look like an ugly middle aged man to you then you really need to visit st mungo s you need your vision checked not to mention your hearing what is it like being a nitwit she asked he growled petrificus totalis he shouted protego marianela said coolly putting up the shield just in time by now sara was on the ground under a jelly legs jinx expelliarmus sara gasped gaining one of the ravenclaw boys wands avada annie started expelliarmus marianela interrupted effectively stopping the spell and disarming annie she started casting hexes left and right as well as putting up shields against the other hexes and used the other hand to signal ginny in morse code with her invisible mscd she doesntgive up does she one of the slytherin boys muttered cambio you know she actually looks kind of pretty like that one of the ravenclaws decided rosa why are we rosa shot the full body bind at him marianela knew that she couldnthold out for much longer already she had bloody gashes all over her body and constantly had to put up shields accio butterbeer she shouted when she saw someone behind her attackers holding a glass of the beverage the glass flew straight toward her crashing through annie and rendering her unconscious then just as she was protecting herself from another hex she saw a welcome sight her fellow secuestradoras and the marauders racing down the street ginny was leading them her face was red with rage and her eyes were ablaze she started throwing hexes as soon as she was in firing range the others joined her shortly afterward wait one of the slytherin boys now under the jelly leg jinx himself protested we didntmean any harm silencio brenna shouted effectively silencing him we know exactly what you meant as well as the fact that you are a disgusting pawn who canteven think for himself look we give up all right a ravenclaw snapped you re too many for us what makes you think we ll let you surrender sirius challenged to his surprise none of the girls protested you deserve to be hanging by your toenails in the dungeon james agreed so what do you say shall we call filch marianela just dock points and give detention lily interrupted james you know i dontwant you to be like them the cowards cowards rosa demanded i ll have you know yes cowards lily repeated convincing guys to help you attack innocents whom you outnumbered three to one just because you dontlike their nationality there not much more cowardly than that just let me hex the dung eaters sirius growled come on lils just let us do a few hexes we wontdo anything harmful just alter their appearance a little lily sighed she could tell that all of her companions were excited at the prospect all right she agreed but first let me dock points and assign detention all of you one hundred fifty points off your houses for each of you for attacking and using harmful hexes and detention with filch for three weeks she paused that includes the unconscious ones save sara go ahead she added her friends then proceeded to turn the purpetrators skin green with orange polka dots and their hair purple rosa and annie heads were shaved and runa used a hair growth charm on their legs then hermione ginny brenna remus and lily used all the healing charms they knew on sara and marianela before reviving sara sirius runa james ron and harry put them on stretchers and tied them up it time to take them to the health wing lily decided aw darn marianela muttered sara are you all right yes and so is my dress she replied thanks guys how did you know she asked the others how did you know james reiterated glancing toward ginny what was the beeping coming from brenna and i are the only amateur radio operators at hogwarts remus added call it a stroke of genius brenna replied come on let get the idiots to dumbledore and madame waxley and then return for some butterbeer good idea harry agreed make sure she knows the whole story though so that she ll make them suffer will we have time to do any more shopping runa asked xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx the floating green bodies on stretchers guarded by the marauders and sequestradoras had quite a dramatic effect on the staff at hogwarts staff of all four houses stared at the group even the divinations teacher could not hold back her shock i not even i could have foretold a calamity such as this calamity my foot mrs mcgonagall retorted glaring i presume that ms evans would not allow an unprecidented attack in her presence hmph the divinations teacher grumbled the potions master took a different approach to the students why are you carrying my students on stretchers in such a state he demanded fifty points each from james interrupted him before he could finish i believe we should be asking why your students as well as some ravenclaws ganged up on two students in an unprovoked attack he replied steadily barely holding back his rage as he kept one hand over lily mouth lily bit him ouch he protested pulling away his hand james potter why on earth did you think you could keep me from speaking my mind she yelled i just wanted to keep you out of he started to protest she wouldntlet him finish after all i am closer to nela than you are and if it werentfor the staff members stared with their mouths wide open lily was screaming louder than she ever had at james potter which meant quite a bit ms evans shut up harry interrupted lily and james stared at him in return now i presume that ambushing two students outside of a store from jealousy is incorrect behavior am i correct he did not wait for an answer both of the victims whom we healed were ravenclaw as well as four of the six attackers all of the boys were under the influence of the two girls whom you see on the stretcher mrs mcgonagall finally managed to interrupt him i see mr potter very good she glared at the potions master i am taking 100 points from slytherin both for the students actions and a professor unauthorized erroneous accusations against students now look minerva the potions master protested you know you cantdo that only the headmaster can dock points from houses based on a teacher action and what else should i have thought when i saw my students bound to stretchers injured and hexed green he demanded he right professor flitwick the charms teacher agreed as much as the docked points are deserved i believe they deserve more deducted only dumbledore can punish teachers the potions master gave mrs mcgonagall a smug look we can easily settle this then remus responded to professor flitwick statement eh he asked sirius rolled his eyes remus means that professor dumbledore would be more than happy to sort through this mess and deduct points from slytherin and ravenclaw under these circumstances and that we may as well pay him a visit excuse me the potions master sneered look minerva your little gryffies are all worked up over some poor little defenseless ravenclaws who managed to hold out for several minutes against six attackers and make idiots of a few slimy slytherins sirius interrupted angrily that lady mcgonagall to you mrs mcgonagall added primly now shall we visit albus sure replied everyone but the potions master lady why would i call you lady mcgonagall minerva he demanded simple i helped with the defeat of grindewald and was granted a title you imbecile now let us go get this taken care of some of us would like to enjoy the rest of the day she turned around and briskly led the group to the headmaster office after she said the password the door creaked open and all of them crowded into the office albus she called yes the headmaster asked suddenly appearing right behind her what how did you professor flitwick started to ask you have got to stop doing that albus mrs mcgonagall commented now we have a situation anyone could have heard the yelling down the hallway minerva albus interrupted her his eyes twinkled with amusement nothing but the death eaters or news of his friends in danger could faze him so if you know what happening you would know that minerva wrongly criticized my character and attempted to dock points for my the potions master started to say priggish behavior and idiocy runa interrupted him he glared at her fifteen points to gryffindor for honesty and loyalty lily cut in thirty points quiet dumbledore boomed now i believe that marianela and sara were the ones wronged will you please explain the appearance of four ravenclaws and two slytherins bound to stretchers and hexed green although he was quieter and calmer sara and marianela knew this was not a question it was a command they looked at each other for a moment trying to figure out who should respond before marianela spoke pardon our um problema er problem por favor please you see these six attacked us outside of a store we couldntdefend ourselves forever and thankfully our friends came along to help us they were so angry that lily allowed the rest to turn their skin green before we bound them to stretchers they revived and healed us and we were on our way to see madame waxley when professor plieth so rudely interrupted us with unjust accusations the potions master glowered at her do you have anything to add dumbledore asked sara no she admitted only that rosa and annie have been rude to nela all year and when i sided with her they started picking on me too ah dumbledore said well then i suppose we shall have to dock 400 points from ravenclaw sorry flitwick and two hundred from slytherin for the students actions i am adding 200 points to ravenclaw on your behalf for your actions today furthermore 1000 points go to gryffindor for their bravery and willingness to help out other students what about minnie trying to dock points from me professor plieth demanded oh well first of all i ll have to ask professor mcgonagall to do a bit of research as punishment and professor plieth you will have to entertain us on february thirteenth with a few recitations of romantic muggle poetry professor plieth stared at him everyone else started laughing e excuse me he asked professor dumbledore sir you are er i cantbe off my rocker i donthave a rocking chair yet dumbledore informed him i asked aberforth to get me one for my birthday though professor plieth stared at him horrified m mudblood poetry he whispered hoarsely sappy muggle poetry mrs mcgonagall corrected him now if you ll excuse me and the rest of my gryffindors as well as these two lovely ravenclaws we have things to do on this lovely day i am sure that you do as well of course minnie albus dumbledore replied so i shall see you later professor plieth you are free to go as well after you help me transport these six students to mrs waxley s i will get back to you on the selections you must recite the marauders and secuestradoras were surprised to see a triumphant smile on mrs mcgonagall face serves him right the prat mrs mcgonagall muttered you didnthear that by the way she informed her students before turning around and plodding to her office i cantthink of anything else to say except i hope you enjoyed this i actually ended up splitting chapter 25 up because it was 28 pages long the only problem is that ch 26 is more romance only and i like things to be well rounded i think things will work out though again thanks for your patience i really appreciate reviews including those with constructive criticism comments etc as for flames i donthave many thankfully only one freezing cold one from a random someone on my second fan fiction piece which basically said someone done this before they simply up a person review count well i off to college in a month wow i should update long before then though 73 good luck auramistealia a n thanks so much reviewers sigh i love reviews roguehobbit yes james does deserve what he getting especially since it was fun muahahahaha sorry pleione hmm you re right lily reaction should have been bigger i made it slightly bigger on my computer basically added her thinking no impossible and in chapter 4 you can tell she not resigned to this and yes it is fun to prank a marauder except for the return pranks ehhh gotta take what you give i guess zippiygirl yep i always wanted to do a piece where someone wentback in time too and who better than harry it would suck to have your parents die when you were a baby even if it saved your life thanks again people plot harry ron hermione and ginny go back in time and meet the marauders lily evans and co and what should follow as the time travelers come across the people in their proper time if it isntobvious i e marauders read on disclaimer although j k rowling is kind enough to ignore poor little me fanfiction i still dontown harry potter i do however own my characters finalmente chapter 3 chapter 3 meet the parents part 2 aka p m is go james potter sauntered over to the mirror in his head boy bedroom to see how he looked before he pestered evans and went to quidditch practice good morning world he muttered maybe this will be the day lily finally falls for the matchless prongs james glanced in the mirror then blinked the figure staring back at him in the mirror was not mirroring his motions he looked closer then jumped back the person looked like him except for his green eyes lily eyes what is going on here he muttered did padfoot slip something in my butterbeer last night hi dad harry greeted him a shy potter grin on his face what very funny padfoot james yelled whoa dad i wouldntdo that if i were you look i have no clue what you are doing in my mirror you are one of sirius pranks and it is not funny thanks to padfoot i ll be late to quidditch practice oh yeah well just try and make me disappear challenged harry it not my fault i stuck in this mirror he ran his fingers through his hair revealing his scar what that scar from eh not sure i can tell you until i talk to dumbledore harry mumbled gee this is harder than i thought padfoot moony james yelled get up here right now thirty seconds later the aforementioned marauders pounded on the door which james opened irritatedly yo prongs what with the shouting asked sirius youtake this spell off the mirror i dontwant to see whoever that is my name is harry james potter harry interrupted of course only james heard or saw him okay so your name is harry yeesh why cantyou just i stuck here and i wanted to meet you i came back in time right like you can really do that and end up in a mirror james snapped uh prongs are you all right asked moony you re talking to a mirror dontyou see him james demanded hey everyone prongs has gone loony sirius announced james punched himhard stop pretending padfoot i know you re behind this no i not sirius protested seriously you re never serious just sirius james retorted cantyou see harry though cantyou at least hear him if you didntmake up the spell who did cantsee or hear a thing but your yelling mate sirius drawled who harry well he says he my son he looks like me except for this odd scar and his green eyes like evans s oh have you been daydreaming about the evans too much prongsie i think we should plan another prank harry grinned tell my godfather that i really here challenged harry now you re really going nuts harry james muttered look if you re my son and you re really here why cantanyone else see or hear you oh it part of the spell see i trapped in this mirror well un trap yourself then prongs are you sure you re okay asked remus worried that it i am finding out once and for all who did this charm monstro artis james said pointing his wand toward the mirror immediately he saw some strange mixed up text this is illegible he muttered uh prongsy it not there sirius reminded him capio auctoris james felt some strange feeling come over him but did not know what it was had he been hexed capio auctoris he shouted again this time he felt something growing out of his headprongs dude you ve sprouted horns sirius announced unnecessarily harry was trying to hide his grin well dad it looks like someone got you he commented james just stomped his feet and muttered something about pranking everyone in hogwarts hey prongsie you re late to quidditch practice remus announced maybe when you get back you ll be sane but what about the prongs james asked i cantgo looking like this just pretend it a costume remus told him trying not to laugh too hard at his friend expense so how did potter react to my charms lily asked i heard the shouting but not quite everything else it was wonderful mum sirius and remus thought he was crazy until he sprouted horns it worked ginny squealed even hermione was smiling ron was doubled over in a fit of laughter prongs for a prongs he cackled he only fell for the first two hexes right lily questioned right remus and sirius forced him to go to quidditch practice by the way i ll have to visit him later lily smirked of course he ll have to promise not to tell sirius and remy about this oh it a pity that rat face is visiting his mum for two months dontworry we ll just have to prank the others extra hard to make up for it not to mention guard ourselves from return pranks ginny also smirked ginny that prongs idea was brilliant i never would have thought of it hermione told her she related to fred and george remember ron put in it was great mum but will you get me out of the mirror she laughed sure harry we ve got to see dumbledore about this anyway she undid the charm harry jumped up and down then made one of james robes neon green just to use magic lily snickered let see if dad left the marauder map around here somewhere to keep them from detecting us harry suggested i ve got it ron announced marauders map lily questioned uh nevermind ron muttered lets go visit dumbledore professor dumbledore lily called tentatively leading the others into the office lily what a pleasure to see you as well as your entourage dumbledore greeted her lemon drops anyone everyone especially lily wanted one of this muggle treat yes well i lily shrugged my son and his friends have traveled back in time and i was wondering if they could stay for an extended visit i dontsee why not planning to play a trick on james i take it he inquired his eyes twinkling lily gave him her most innocent smile as she stroked the phoenix fawkes whatever i do he deserves well if you dontmind will you introduce yourselves hermione poked harry indicating that he should start erharry potter professor dumbledore lily and james son and in gryffindor i take it harry nodded i hermione granger professor she now poked ron er i ron weasley and this is my sister ginny ginny glared at him yes i can see that you must be arthur and molly s then however i do not deem it wise to surprise them with a visit his eyes twinkled as for you all it would be best to be in an exchange program s sure harry mumbled i ll ask james to take you and ron in harry lily would you mind finding room for ginny and hermione no problem professor dumbledore although could i give the news to potter dumbledore appeared to think this over for a moment try to be easy on him i hear he sprouted prongs you wouldntknow anything about that would you lily didntanswer instead she led the way out of the office james was trying unsuccessfully to remove his prongs when he heard someone rapping at the door sighing he opened the door only to see lily ho evans what brings you here he asked grinning in the way that somehow annoyed her so much i heard you ve been having trouble with your horns being visible but i just had to see it for myself potter lily smirked james had to cover for himself so you like them will you go out with me lily stomped her foot potter you egotistical prat how many times does it take for me to say no for you to understand it always just one more you know what potter i actually doing you a favor by teaching you that not all girls will just fall into your lap and swoon over you but it not like you actually care about me i just a challenge evans did you come in here just to mock me he demanded you could at least give me a chance why dontyou let me show you that i care about you because you re a git i d rather kiss a slug that could be arranged nevermind anyway i came here because dumbledore wants you to look after a few exchange students i ll consider it if you help me get rid of these horns james told her i cantfigure out the hex used to cast it so i dontknow the antidote hmm let me look at this with my wand james started to be nervous she hated him what is she going to do to me he wondered okay this one should be simple to take off the other one what other one he was really nervous now whack yourself on the head james was horrified when his body did exactly as she ordered ouch evans what did you do to me he complained oh just a little variation of the habenarum hex james groaned embarrassed will you please take it off i will when i feel like it she smirked for now i ll get rid of the horns she waved her wand and spoke the antidote by the way the new students want to meet you come on in boys she called harry and ron walked in james mouth dropped open as he recognized the boy from his mirror but recovered quickly there are times when i wish i had a video camera lily murmered smiling dad harry asked nervously sorry about the hexes it just sounded fun to pull a prank on a marauder this is my friend ron weasley james grinned n nice to finally meet a marauder sir your pranks are bloody awesome ron told him thanks all right evans i can take it from here perhaps but i have a few stipulations number one donttell the others about the hexes number two prank my son and you re dead james groaned knowing he d have to do as she said then brightening mid groan when he realized that if harry was lily son you re cruel evans will you at least go to the next ball with me to make up for it he asked potter grin in place no lily shouted exiting and slamming the door bloody nuisance i dontknow why i haventgiven up on her james muttered oh great i late to dinner he grabbed the nearest robe to put on over his jeans and quidditch t shirt which just so happened to be the one harry turned lime green atra he muttered with his wand changing it to black let go catch sirius and remus harry told him i cantwait to see them again when they can see me how do you know them james asked lupin was a professor at hogwarts and sirius escaped from azkaban i always knew he was a devil james grinned let get going a n sorry it took so long to update anyway i hope you enjoyed this chapter some of the upcoming chapters are more serious especially later ch 12 13 so i may change that later but then again arentthere more serious times in our lives between sugar highs i am having way too much fun writing this though gah must stop typing before readers kill me please read and review i appreciate honesty but dislike flames they re rather useful for making hot chocolate though disclaimer what i just said i own nothing but my oc s etc j k rowling owns all the recognizable characters happy plot harry messes with hermione time turner one too many times hermione ginny and ron go back in time to find him they meet the lily her friends and the marauders friendships are built life is life and pranks are played whattaya expect with the prank kings ships lj hg rhr soc roc please read and review flames are only good for hot chocolate which is hard to heat from the computer reviewers thanks soo much for reading my story and clicking the button pleione yes the serious sirius jokes are mandatory in a time travel fic especially if you like puns as i do siriusly and of course here another in the title i glad james reaction was better than lily s lilazangel123 glad you like the fic so far i sorry if hermione nickname drives you nutty hermione used to hate it but she getting used to it i just cantstand friends not nicknaming each other i odd like that dontget me wrong i think hermione is a gorgeous name and she ll always be referred to as hermione in the narration yay i want to write a fic about hermione hating her nickname now that would be fun that probably why i did the nickname thing i just didntknow it roguehobbit yes it would be wisest for james to leave lily alone but james isntknown for being wise besides lily wants to have fun with the habenarum hex not that i letting her do too much she supposed to be somewhat responsible shrug thanks for reviewing you are my heroes well at least for now chapter four sirius trouble so are we going to prank the boys ginny asked lily hermione sighed ginny we ve got to study while we re here she objected i know but it the weasley in me coming out we ll have to see meanwhile you ll have to meet my friends just to warn you brenna crazy about remus as if on cue lily friends burst through the door lily i heard about the new exchange students can you believe dumbledore put potter in charge of the boys oh hi added runa this is ginny and hermione is over there looking at a charms book oh another over achiever like you lily runa laughed she learning little by little ginny defended her who re you by the way she demanded of the brown eyed blonde with shoulder length hair oh i saffron runa but if you ever call me by my first name i ll hex you this is brenna by the way brenna smiled shyly her hazel eyes probing ginny and hermione she must have liked what she saw since she held out her hand pleased to meet you she told them i hope we can help you find your way around oh we ve already had a pretty good tour but we certainly haventmet any guys ginny laughed brenna blushed oh there plenty of selection here but not all of it good runa interjected you ll understand once you ve met the marauders remus is nice brenna protested yes he the nicest of them potter isntbad despite what lily says runa teased it the git black that i cantstand as for peter she shuddered hermione stomach growled it was her turn to blush sorry about that is it dinnertime yet she asked lily glanced at her wristwatch oh no we re fifteen minutes late she groaned hermione sighed well we could always look for hogwarts kitchen did you just say that runa asked startled what did i tell you ginny retorted she learning it just that her intelligence gets in the way of fun sometimes i dontknow about the rest of you but i hungry lily interjected let find something to eat sirius harry shouted when he caught sight of the marauder across the hallway hey prongs old mate wait you arentprongs are you not exactly harry hedged we do look alike though watch out for evans then she has it in for prongsie i know he grinned she already froze me just because she thought i was d james so how did you know me has my splendid reputation as a prankster gone that far harry rolled his eyes i related to james that all padfoot what are you telling him james scolded him nothing much prongsie ol boy just asking how he knew my name and telling him to avoid evans how harry related to you anyway why haventi met him before distant cousin harry blurted before james could say anything well he not so distant james amended he just wasntaround anyway dontask prongsie about girls he been mooning over evans since year one at least he persistent harry objected defensive arentyou hey watch this he pointed his wand and muttered a spell turning a ravenclaw girl hair bright purple smiling at her outrage it matches your eyes dear he explained to her harry and james both rolled there eyes you re hopeless harry muttered say that again and i ll hex you hex harry and i ll hex you until you re pleading for mercy james told sirius but i your best mate sirius objected both of you have lost it remus interjected having snuck up behind them harry tried not to show that he recognized him james decided to be a good boy and introduce his son hey moony this is harry my cousin harry interrupted grinning why haventi met you before then he been in uh james searched for an answer another part of england a rival school but he decided it sucked so has jamesie recovered from talking to mirrors today remus asked james glared at him yeah whatever i going to find evans good luck you ll need it so shall we take a trip to hogsmeade ginny asked we could use pure spells or we couldvisit zonko s i sure they know all of zonko tricks by now they re zonko prime customers runa commented well i do have one of fred and george gags hermione admitted i was going to use it on malfoy but lucius brenna questioned he certainly deserves it mmm not that malfoy but he just like him i assure you that he deserves it how did you get one of my brothers gags anyway ginny asked what did they do this time she added it will make someone burp repeatedly for around 48 hours hermione explained just put this powder in his food and he ll be belching soon afterwards runa grinned malevolently one problem black wontmind and brenna will object to pranking remus badly lily protested can we use that on potter instead if it one of fred and george gags i bet it will do more than that has that one even been tested before ginny asked only on george rat fred told me it was a beauty potion but i knew better than to believe him i hexed him until he took veraserum and told me what it did ginny laughed evilly i would have given anything to see that lily you dontthink you could modify it do you there a test tomorrow in transfiguration runes sorry but it my worst class i ve got to study sometime oh right ms head girl runa snorted only potter can beat you in that class only because i study come on let make some brownies and ask alice to deliver them hey we can make all of them burp i sure black will eat the most though lily giggled or we could put it in butterbeer and make sure that black has the powder in it hermione suggested brilliant but how to get him the butterbeer i ve got a paper with a note from potter on it we can imitate his handwriting with the zonko pen i bought and if we distract potter that ll do the trick they all giggled or lily could use the habenarum hex that is already on potter hermione suggested then obliviate that memory that way there no problems if they test it like they would runa smirked this will be so much fun brenna giggled and someone will be in sirius trouble ginny quipped instead of groaning at her pun the crowd let out a cheer one problem who gets close enough to black and his butterbeer to uh runa asked all right said lily i can t since i ll be distracting potter so i ll draw a name from a hat everyone quickly wrote their name down on scraps of parchment and threw it in lily hat they waited for the verdict runa being the most nervous lily bit her lip sorry runa you lost the match she groaned all right wonthe suspect something though i never sit next to him i ll do it ginny piped up runa sighed with relief thanks you just saved me from pulling out my hair and screaming sirius was just going to take a nap before the weekly marauders meeting when he noticed a note on his pillow padfoot lily finally agreed to go out with me i ll be busy with her dontworry i brought zonko with me and then i ll meet you all at hogsmeade for some butterbeer tell them to charge it to my account prongs ha i knew she d give in eventually sirius proclaimed hey moony we re going to hogsmeade to celebrate lily finally given in are you sure she isntjust planning to hex him remus asked suspicious aw prongsie will be all right he and lily will have a nice little chat and he brought something from zonko just in case did you hear that harry ron sirius asked prongsie got a date whoa padfoot harry told him i bet everyone in hogwarts could hear you how many galleons it a muggle expression ron told him oh sirius mumbled well any excuse to have butterbeer is good enough for me too bad wormtail is missing all this fun ron and harry glanced at each other say could we drop into zonko s harry asked sure replied padfoot um i dontthink that a good idea remus said even sneaking to hogsmeade is tricky enough there no way everyone can fit under the invisibility cloak sirius just grinned what am i an animagus for then he immediately transformed into an enormous black dog remus rolled his eyes that wontdo it showoff remus told him besides you need to be careful about transforming in front of people harry and ron exchanged glances ron and i will be okay without the cloak harry told them we re new here and can pretend we re lost if anyone comes you still shouldnttransform like that remus scolded sirius why didntyou guys act surprised he asked oh er we already knew about that ron mumbled it a long story sirius gave remus a pointed glance to say see it okay that i transformed remus rolled his eyes well that settled so let go sirius told him slipping under the cloak with remus padfoot you re stepping on my toe moony protested sirius grumbled and moved his foot james brushed off his sleeve surprised to find a note there he unfolded it and looked to see who had written it lily he thought in disbelief grinning potter since harry happens to be our son i suppose we should get together and talk about things anyway meet me at seven in the astronomy tower if you arentafraid of me lily evans james looked at his watch and found that it was five minutes until seven just enough time to get to the astronomy tower he quickly ruffled his hair and dashed off only to bump into mrs mcgonagalll james potter what are you doing why dontyou watch where you re going five sorry professor mcgonagalll i was in a hurry to meet with the head girl on time well she sighed all right just watch where you are going james merely nodded before starting off again he reached the astronomy tower with thirty seconds to spare evans he called tentatively as he messed with his hair again over here by the telescope potter lily said softly so you wanted to see me james asked his casual tone of voice belying his feelings i never want to see you prat lily informed him james lost his cocky grin for a moment however the status quo has changed and we need to talk about harry you say he our son lily nodded unless you rape me i cantsee how on earth that could happen but he claims he is she told him james pulled out his wand so angry that he barely controlled the urge to hex her how dare you say that i d never do that he protested lily drew her own wand how else would it happen she smirked then she suddenly looked shocked did i really just say that i would ever rape you james interrupted yeah you did i sorry i shouldnthave said that you shouldnthave thought that look evans why wontyou give me a chance james pleaded ruffling his hair in his nervousness an awkward silence filled the room lily stared at her shoes ashamed i sorry potter i had no reason why did you then becausebecause i cantimagine ever being attracted to you lily muttered james hid his apprehension behind his customary grin stop that i hate it why should i do everything you want that as bad as being enemies and i still cantbelieve you said i apologized potter she paused so what do you think we should do lily asked trying to express her remorse call a truce stop being enemies at least while harry is here i cantbelieve i saying this but you re right james smiled in relief dontget cocky on me i wasn t lils she sighed this isnteasy for me potter it isnteasy for me either but we can start by using each other first name all right james she held out her hand shall we shake on it he smiled and took her hand as you wish my lady he lifted her hand to his lips and kissed it before he let go lily bit her lip not certain whether or not she liked this gesture then again it amazing i didnteven pull away would you like to go to hogsmeade and have some butterbeer james asked her sure she agreed unable to hide a slight smirk what that about james asked suspiciously you ll find out she told him while lily and james were arguing in the astronomy tower sirius and remus entered hogsmeade look there the girls sirius called hey runa want something to drink prongs will treat uh padfoot i think all the caffeine you ve had has gone to your head moony told him of course not sirius protested caffeine is good for me it helps me think yeah right runa snorted anyway of course bren ginny hermione and i would like something as long as someone else is paying where are harry and ron hermione asked before seeing them come in from the secret entrance oh right i almost forgot about that she muttered to herself so do you want me to order the butterbeer or will you lazy bums do it ginny asked taking a seat by sirius erm i ll do it hey six butterbeers pronto put it on james potter account harry ron and ginny smirked having seen lily order james to write the note right away the waitress told them levitating six glasses to their table to the marauders and guests sirius toasted may we make mischief forevermore they all clinked their glasses together runa and hermione more tentatively before taking a sip oi padfoot drink more slowly or you ll start belching remus told him sirius just ignored him runa stared expectantly at ginny waiting for her to put the powder in sirius is there a way to get some music in here hermione asked to distract him erm there the jukebox over there an old muggle thing that weasley messed withwe miss the old chap hmm why dontyou show her how to use it brenna suggested hoping they did not know hermione was muggle born eh sure sirius replied motioning for hermione to follow him i d better make sure padfoot doesntbreak anything remus told them also getting up as soon as their backs were to the table ginny poured the powder in sirius drink and stirred it thankfully harry and ron were watching them run the jukebox with interest well it better than no music at all ron proclaimed hey should we do anything to sirius butterbeer while they re gone you just want to have more butterbeer harry scolded him honestly wontyou two weasleys stop thinking of pranks it impossible harry ginny informed him after all we re related to fred and george too late ron they re coming back too late for what sirius asked lily and james what else runa snorted covering them in fact we have a proposition for you she paused dramatically considering that he meeting with lily tonight i doubt things are too bad between them oh it just business brenna told them lily still thinks he an egotistical jerk so what the proposition remus asked well as much as i loathe this idea runa continued cooperation is necessary sirius grinning downed the rest of his butterbeer and burped loudly padfoot harry and remus protested runa brenna and hermione rolled their eyes ginny grinned oh scuse me now what do we need to do he belched again that so disgusting runa commented right you are remus added no more butterbeer for you padfoot sirius scowled and belched again aw come on moony he protested burping he was slightly puzzled i surprised you donthave the hiccups after drinking that so fast hermione scolded ron and harry glanced at each other then at ginny who was calmly watching the scene donttell me harry muttered as sirius continued burping anyway ignoring sirius rude emissions let set up a meeting place runa insisted is that even possible ginny inserted he getting louder indeed he was and on top of that sirius was coming off the ground and falling back down with each belch i dontlike this too much he groaned brenna giggled remus stared at her as if looking for an answer did you do something to his drink remus asked her no i didn t brenna answered grinning well one of you must have ginny tried to hide a smirk but harry caught it ginny what did you do oh i just tested out one of fred and george gags she assured him they ll be glad to know it worked you drugged my drink sirius asked between burps not drugged exactly ginny replied it was just a powder see it all gone she held up the empty bag this wasntquite true as she still had some left in the room for testing you deserved it didntyou she added at that moment lily and james walked in oi prongs sirius called out belching yet again thanks for the butterbeer james glanced at him strangely what are you talking about he asked lily smiled innocently we got a note from you saying you were meeting with lily and treating us remus told him remember but i didn t yes you did lily informed him her innocent smile spreading he groaned remembering the hex take it off please he told her i dontwant to become broke treating everyone to drinks and financing shopping sprees now that an idea runa smiled but it so much fun potjames she teased still smiling did you just call him james runa interrupted please take it away james begged ignoring runa lily considered it all right she agreed she pulled out her wand and deactivated the hex whoa said remus does that mean lily had a marauder under a habenarum hex james nodded glumly i cantbelieve you fell for it prongs ol mate evans how about becoming a marauder lily rolled her eyes get lost black james will you please order me some butterbeer she asked sweetly he groaned why does everyone think i have enough money for this because you do mate remus replied ducking out of reach from james fist besides that what friends are for sirius added gleefully whew so that over i hope you enjoyed the chapter well please r r i like reviews it sad i know when i grow up and publish my own books i dreaming i ll get bad reviews and tear them up or write sarcastic

by girls and must regain our honor right whatever prongs sirius belched i still think i just gulped the butterbeer too fast it been three hours padfoot remus reminded him besides these are no ordinary burps remus as usual was right sirius was rising six inches above the ground as he emitted enormous belches and had a look of horror on his face like a puppy whose tail is being pulled it definitely one of fred and george gags ron told them ginny admitted it and what else could be so annoying fred and george the marauders questioned er yes they re his brothers and they run a joke shop harry put in he right about the powder ginny mentioned it to me when were you talking to my sister ron demanded protectively where this joke shop sirius asked between burps er somewhere back around our own school harry added stop acting like an overprotective prat ron remus laughed back to business what can we do to avenge our honor erm somehow change the grade on lily paper to freak her out ron suggested that might work sirius commented hey i bet i can belch the alphabet padfoot stop acting like a moronic puppy aww moony come on he whined i am a puppy and what else can i do with this he added as always between burps hmm wontwork unless of course you want lily to hex you ron gulped if she anything like ginny i dontwant to see that we could transfigure them into raccoons harry suggested what are those james ron remus and sirius asked simultaneously jinks james added effectively keeping the rest of them from talking so he could start a speech now this really is pitiful honestly shouldntmarauders be able to do better than this oh you have an idea ron he added noticing that said weasley was tapping his foot impatiently we could hex their mirror so they thought they had pimples or their hair was messed up ginny always nutty about that sort of thing i thought she just threw something on and didnteven glance in the mirror harry commented well that just when she wakes up late normally she doesntcare about much of anything but acne drives her bonkers for some reason i bet runa is the same way sirius put in all right but how about something more public a howler perhaps james suggested er maybe cantwe come up with anything more creative water balloons or something it almost winter remus objected so if we do it within hogwarts it ll be all right harry insisted i can tell you re marauder material james told him yeah well after all harry caught himself after all what remus asked suspicious harry glanced at james then ron er it too bad i donthave any of fred and george canary creams ooh sounds fun let transfigure them into some kind of animal put animagi potions in their food along with a hex that keeps them from telling anyone other than us about it that would drive lily bonkers but i dontthink runa or brenna would care remus put in besides you would be doing them a favor that not a prank at all but they would still freak out and it would be funny imagine when evans finds out that she has broken a rule worthy of azkaban accidentally sirius insisted ah the joy of torturing the girls there always the secret admirer trick ron suggested timidly what that ridiculous sirius told him remus nodded in agreement no it not it just might work along with everything else james defended his son friend as long as it accompanied by fifteen other pranks that is you just want to tell evans about your undying love for her i love you more than my snitch as it just a non living animate object if i could i would tie you to my broomstick and force you on a wild nightmarish flight across hogwarts grounds under the invisibility cloak just to teach you that flying is fun and i perfect for torturing you for the rest of your life sirius announced between belches aww padfoot i didntknow you had it in you james patted him on the back and rolled his eyes yeah i am great arenti sirius replied with a grin ignoring the blatant sarcasm who will get the secret admirer letters harry asked how about all of them sirius suggested err wontthey suspect something remus pointed out well maybe let cut it down to the redheads then sirius amended as long as i getto use dung bombs in thenear future i happy lily and ginny all right who writes ginny s james asked not me ron insisted that sick writing love letters to your sister draw straws harry suggested nervously all right we ll draw straws and then bring our plans to action all right oh and how can you get the animagi potion harry asked despite the fact that he already knew the answer especially after sirius had transformed in front of them er shall we tell them james asked sure why not sirius agreed we ll make them animagi he announced he immediately transformed into his dog form ey padfoot james scolded him irritated you shouldntdo that you look like the grim remember i dontwant you scaring my son ehh what sirius and remus demanded it all right er dad we already knew anyway harry told him and we know about remus too hermione figured that out wait did you say son dad remus asked bewildered you look the same age and when would prongsie have time to shove it they re from the future that was harry in the mirror that i was talking to by the way prove it remus demanded harry held out his wand expecto patronum the silvery stag appeared and pranced around the room coming to james and sniffing him before circling harry again hey it looks just like you prongsie sirius commented still burping despite being his dog form see he replied smugly good job son patronuses are pretty advanced thanks dad harry responded beaming remus taught me so if jamesie here is a proud daddy who your mum remus asked james and harry glanced amusedly at each other well you can always look at my eyes to find out harry suggested and take away my fun james protested all right you say it then well give me a drumroll sirius still in dog form ran in circles around the room bumping into various quidditch books sugar quills and other objects on the floor of course harry mother is none other than our illustrious lily evans james announced sirius immediately crashed into his bed frame remus fainted uh oh i knew it was too close to the full moon james groaned here let dump water on him ron suggested brilliant aqueus james proclaimed a soaking wet remus shook himself off did you say what i thought you did remus clarified what moony startled that eventually i ll win james smirked how could you doubt you ll never win her if she just a prize harry told him you forgot that she intelligent so do you know what that means remus asked a strangely ominous glint in his eyes james gulped ron and harry grinned manners training they shouted aww he complained let take padfoot to madame waxley he glanced at his watch crud i late for my head meeting james broke off into a run leaving the rest to take care of their belching companion while the marauders and company discussed possible pranks and dealt with sirius eructation the girls were having a meeting of their own so you re arthur and molly weasley daughter lily asked ginny conversationally yup she replied i the youngest and the only girl ickle ronniekins is the youngest boy poor thing she added with a grin do you have a lot of brothers runa asked too many protective prats all of them she added there charlie bill percy the git fred george and ron ugh petunia is bad enough lily muttered at least she took harry in ginny consoled her before biting her lip why would she have to take harry in brenna asked isnthe james cousin er not exactly hermione hedged he my son lily informed them runa and brenna burst out laughing so he another time traveler runa asked couldntthey have brought me a boyfriend lily slapped her playfully no wonder he has your eyes brenna said thoughtfully all right let get to business now hermione interrupted ever since buying those fireworks from fred and george she found pranking mildly addicting and a nice break from homework any ideas freezing their boxers in the snow runa teasingly suggested sure but we need something better than that too ginny told them besides who wants to touch their underwear lily added you have a point runa admitted shuddering at the thought do you have any more gags from fred and george brenna asked erm let me see ginny unlatched her black purse with unlimited storage for which she spent three years saving up money non possessed diary scarf itching powder spell book wand extra clothes shrinking powder you have extra clothes hermione interrupted yes of course i female arenti let see what else i have the makeup that the patils forced me to buy more itching powder a muggle book of celtic legendsah ha she added holding up two small vials what that brenna asked is thatwhere did you get hermione muttered perplexed the blue one is phoenix tears however this one on the right is something else entirely it cantbe a flying potion can it lily asked eagerly i thought you were afraid of heights runa objected come on runes you ve got to be willing to face your fears and if someone actually taught me to fly she smiled dreamily i would love to be able to fly as a human or otherwise is there a way to have that ability permanently ginny asked perhaps there could be a way but i dontknow hermione responded if there were what good would broomsticks be lily sighed i dontknow that was just wishful thinking anyway come on lils dontgive up perhaps there are books in the library ask madam pince she putty in your hands brenna encouraged pranks pranks pranks runa insisted we need to come up with a decent set of pranks you re right so is that a flying potion no sorry ginny replied it still good though one drop of it will make the person talk like the animal he or she is most like for a day and if they have more lily questioned two days and so forth until seven still if you give them too much i ve heard something bad will happen she shrugged ok wontthey suspect something hermione questioned we could pour it in their mouths when they re asleep runa suggested brilliant any more ideas we could pretend to stalk them brenna suggested everyone else stared at the usually timid brenna with letters or something she added or maybe we could pay someone to follow them around all right cheers for pranks and brilliant girls runa shouted we need something to toast this event how about hot chocolate hermione suggested what four voices asked it a muggle drink i grew up with i like it even more than butterbeer well it chocolate so i ll take it runa announced what about you lils sure as long as it later i almost ten minutes late to the head meeting if potter beats me lily ran out of her room and into the common room she and james shared upon finding that he was not there she sighed in relief and sat down to wait for him a n remus was so shocked about harry being james son that he didntnotice what harry said about knowing his secret i know he paranoid

will i even had moony look over the spell remus not wanting to face the wrath of lily evans had opted out of this prank we just put the spell on all of the doorknobs including the closet doors how are we getting in harry asked we dontknow the password no problem mate i overheard evans tell jen or whoever that new girl is it ginny ron and harry corrected him simultaneously the potters must have a thing for redheads sirius smirked harry and james both glared at him i do not like ginny in that way harry responded indignantly good because i d hate to hex my best friend ron told him oh come on stop the prat act you re the one who was angry when she lost that crush on me harry retorted you re unofficial marauders sirius scolded that means pranks come first all right then let try the password sirius swished his wand crackle he announced nothing happened sirius groaned that has to be it the door opened and then slammed shut maybe they changed the password ron suggested mione and gin are nutty about privacy let me try something harry interrupted krackel the door opened but but that what i said sirius protested no it not he replied krackel k r a c k e l is a type of muggle candy sorry padfoot it takes a potter to do it james smirked whatever let just go in and prank krackel once again the door opened and the four pranksters entered lily room the marauders glanced around in awe i never knew a room could be this clean sirius murmered the floor was uncovered lily bed and the two cots were made up nicely a hamper stood in the corner books and random clutter lined the desks and dressers i dunno about that ron replied mum makes me clean out my room twice a year and mione is a neat freak what about ginny stuff questioned harry she could never find anything three years ago hermione taught her a special cleaning spell she refused to tell me though alohomora ginny dresser opened look i thought she would stop keeping a diary after you know who possessed one who that james asked v v ron stuttered voldemort harry supplied sirius and james stared in shock i didntknow he was that powerful sirius commented he gave me my scar harry replied oops he added whacking his head with his hand i shouldnthave said that ron did you grab ginny diary yet no way ginny probably has it spelled to hex me if i pick it up chicken harry mumbled grabbing it immediately his skin turned hot pink argh i guess you were right finite james shouted harry skin turned back to normal er maybe she hasntspelled it to recognize on of you he said tentatively why dontyou try sirius sirius however was charming the various doorknobs to move when a hand was grabbing for it you could only grab the doorknob if your eyes were shut sirius could you grab something for me harry asked oh sure mate he picked up ginny diary all right now that we ve got the evidence wait mates i think there a secret door here james announced i wonder where it goes said ron let me try harry suggested if i end up wherever they are i can just say i was looking for mum that my boy james grinned approvingly and whacked him on the back let get out of here ron suggested they could come back any minute right see ya harry let us know what the door goes to all right is the itching powder in their clothes lily asked as ginny and runa entered their part of the gryffindor girls bedroom suite ginny nodded we decided to leave harry alone though she told her that okay i should have told you to leave remus alone too but he pulled enough pranks with them that he deserves it that he does runa smirked he the brains of the group but runes remy nice brenna protested we all know you re sweet on him bren just for that you should want to prank him well she sighed i ll help with the next one we only put itching powder in one item for each person ginny informed her that way they may not all be itching at once all right already hermione interrupted what the next prank shouldntwe wait until they react to this one lily asked we dontwant to play all our cards at once we have a lot of cards anyway i didntsay we should do the next prank just plan it zonko has some pretty good merchandise runa suggested one problem the marauders are their chief customers lily reminded her they probably have told them to watch out for us let just use polyjuice potion then brenna suggested suddenly they heard a pop right behind them er hello harry said harry what are you doing here hermione demanded how did you get here dontyou know it impolite to just pop in i just wanted to see mum he protested no one was in her room and how did you find out the password ginny asked a dangerous light gleaming in her eyes how did you lily echoed her i certainly didntgive it to you eavesdropping he replied this was safe since he didntsay exactly who eavesdropped well promise you wonttell anyone what it is then runa commanded or else i will hex you until you ll wish there was no tomorrow runa lily scolded her he my son honestly runes isntthat a little drastic brenna added all right all right sorry lils so what did you want to see me about harry lily asked smiling er well i wanted toto talk to you harry stuttered about what runa narrowed her eyes suspiciously n stuff he mumbled aww is ickle harry embarrassed about something ginny crooned harry blushed i dontwant to talk about it with everyone else around he replied with dignity that all well can i meet with you later harry we re a little busy here lily apologized no problem where shall we meet he asked i ll see you at the library after dinner harry dear lily told him smiling she ruffled his messy hair impulsively and hugged him before opening the door for him to leave by mum he said smiling as he left their room see you later well one thing is for certain we ll have to change the password hermione announced as soon as the door shut but to what lilyasked acid pops ginny suggested broomsticks runa suggested atlantis brenna chimed in how about pulchritudinous lily suggested everyone but hermione stared at her ehh what runa asked it means beautiful hermione supplied know it all ginny muttered playfully hermione mock slapped her this insult commonly given to hermione had turned into an inside joke for these two how do you spell that brenna asked p u l c h r i t u d i n o u s lily replied so what do you think she asked methinks something shorter would be better ginny replied short sweet and from the muggle world we ll put this somewhere on the list of future passwords though cocoa puffs hermione suggested you are addicted to chocolate arentyou runa laughed yes hermione replied sheepishly it one of my weaknesses we could shorten it to cocoa or use pretzels or something brenna suggested cocoa i like it lily decided right well let see what the boys have done to our room hermione announced i doubt harry was in there alone ginny smirked whatever they ve done they re in trouble she said the last three words in a sing song voice watch out marauders lily added joyfully thrusting her mug of hot cocoa toward the ceiling come on gang let go ginny and hermione followed lily leaving runa and brenna to themselves upon entering the room through their magical portal they noticed that the room looked completely normal however when hermione tried to open her dresser the knobs moved grr what is going on here i never heard of a spell that did that she fumed and i ve gone through our whole charms book plus three others lily found the same thing happened with her dresser as well as with the closet ginny yawned and blinked as she reached for her dresser drawer knob as she had her eyes closed it opened maybe they forgot to do mine ginny suggested she reached for the knob again but it moved nevermind she added the spell only works when our eyes are open she added well we still need to figure out how to get rid of this lily replied she muttered a short incantation that revealed the spell work wow this is pretty complicated lily murmured finite wontwork i suppose i shouldntbe surprised though there got to be another way to do this hermione thought aloud i just dontknow what it could be i read somewhere that there may be another language out there spoken by mythical creatures that one can do magic with lily inserted oh i remember that that was in the etymology of magic words by gini ferris it just a theory though if there is then no human has heard or learned it in years hermione replied can you please stop talking about books and help me figure out how to get rid of this spell ginny interrupted not everyone has gotten 130 on her charms test well actually it was 143 6 lily admitted but how did you know ginny and hermione both stared at her she was talking about me hermione admitted and ginny not only do you have more agility if you studied more i know i know ginny rolled her eyes so what do we do about the spell lily pulled out a sketchpad well i dontknow a counter spell yet but i can tweak it so that the guys doorknobs do the same thing automatically we ll get used to closing our eyes and the spell will be taken off when they remove it from their doorknobs that sounds good to me ginny replied hermione nodded in agreement and lily flicked her wand while muttering fatuari that ll work as long as we open them before turning the doorknob hermione commented ginny smiled closed her eyes and opened a drawer in her armoire she rooted frantically through it and gasped my diary is missing i going to kill them they must pay for this is it protected by spells lily asked ginny nodded yeah but i didnthave time to add the marauders to the list of hexes that it we ll have to get the diary back as soon as possible hermione determined it payback time call in the gang can it wait runa asked having just entered through the portal in time to hear the last line i dontwant to get in trouble and miss a hogsmeade weekend then we ll have to do things more subtly ginny winked at her we ll do something more drastic later moments later sirius black reached for a doorknob in his room however he grasped at air not metal mooony he shouted at the top of his lungs take the spell off the doors right now remus however was studying in the sound proofed library and did not hear him instead james harry and ron came running toward him followed closely by a mob of students and teachers from all four houses what have you gotten us into now ron asked james sighed and removed the spell a cheer went through the crowd until professor mcgonagall raised her hand for silence ten points from gryffindor for this interruption she announced crisply students please go back to your business she stiffly pushed her way through the crowd careful to hide any hint of amusement that might appear one did not become head of a house by being easy on one students ten points to gryffindor for obedience she whispered i knew you d get the hang of it professor dumbledore spoke from behind where did you come from she demanded then smiled wryly one would think that my cat like senses would notice your approach yes well i ve had a lot of practice he responded his eyes twinkling besides one tires of approaching people in normal ways after so long mrs mcgonagall merely tilted her head to one side you will never cease to amaze me she responded good evening a n i know mrs mcgonagall was a bit out of character for giving their points back but honestly she lived with the marauders in her house for seven years for that reason alone one would have to visit st mungo or enjoy the pranks just a little besides she wants to win the house cup by the way i like the word pulchritudinous it sounds like an insult but it totally not i found it when i was studying for that standardized test which is evil last year so i not all that intellectual just fascinated with words erm chocolate is wonderful happy easter passover and goodnight please r r constructive criticism is welcome flames will be snuffed out and or soaked with water disclaimer j k rowling owns harry potter however i happen to own three o c s brenna marianela and runa a n thanks f thanks reviewers sorry if i confused you when i re loaded chapter 6 roguehobbit oh

7 of sleep talking itchiness and classes harry awoke early ready to face his first day of classes after quietly changing into one of james extra hogwarts uniforms he then realized that with sirius and ron snoring being quiet wasntnecessary dad are you awake he whispered lily evans just give me a chance james mumbled in his sleep before turning over so he does talk about mum in his sleep harry mused i hope i dontdo the same thing about ginny where did that come from he asked himself ev ans james was speaking again no not that hex he moaned this was obviously a nightmare dad wake up harry said nudging him dad james rolled over again groaning harry pushed harder still nothing happened dad harry shouted in his ear james bolted into an upright position ehh what what going on here he asked groggily you were having a nightmare about mum hexing you i wasntsaying anything was i he questioned of course you were how else would i have known all right all right that was a dumb question i shouldnthave asked hey why are you up so early it fifteen minutes before the alarm goes off sirius let out another snore ron soon followed oh he muttered he glanced around and noticed an empty neatly made bed it looks like moony is already up let me get ready and i ll join you for a walk around hogwarts okay harry nodded he was glad to have some time alone with his father after donning his robes and taking a quick glance in the mirror james grabbed his wand the marauder map and his invisibility cloak and dragged harry out of the room so where do you want to go james asked casually would you like to see my broomstick he inquired more excitedly sure what type do you have right now i have a comet 500 but i looking at getting the nimbus 1950 cool i used to have a nimbus 2000 but the whomping willow broke it when i passed out from dementors a few years ago so sirius got me a firebolt sounds like a good broomstick james said proudly couldntyou have brought one back for me sorry no could do harry replied are you on the quidditch team yep i a seeker harry told him that my boy james beamed i a chaser but well i used to be a seeker i just like to be in the action of the game evans lily i mean hates it though no she just hates your inflated head but come on dad if you just deflated your ego and made her actually feel like you cared about her do you james glared at harry i do not have a big ego and of course i do she s yes you do have an inflated head dumbledore told me that in the future or maybe it was remus i forget all right he sighed maybe i do so how do i deflate it he asked well i think it time for you to get lessons maybe moony can come up with something good ol moony can i still play pranks harry grinned i doubt you could survive otherwise i dontsee why not just leave snape alone for the most part i have to live with him as my teacher that slimy git is a teacher james asked enraged he good with potions and the dark arts and dumbledore trusts him for some reason he hates me though what can you say he snivellus yeah hey how many minutes is it til breakfast half an hour let go see if padfoot is up yet sounds good to me aah prongsie i itch sirius shouted running around the gryffindor common room and scratching like crazy literally everyone was laughing at him ginny was doubled over in laughter and runa was gasping for breath youlooksofunny padfoot remus laughed how on earth did that happen he then realized that his feet were extremely itchy my feet itch he cried throwing his shoes off and hopping around while scratching his feet what is going on here harry started scratching too he had borrowed one of james robes and was itching like crazy oh no brenna whispered to lily is harry wearing one of james robes lily groaned i should have known this wouldntwork right she whispered back runes stop laughing so hard you ll start snorting i dontsnort snort runa protested you just did hermione informed her giggling herself at the sight now ron had joined in with the scratching harry mate i think the twins gave ginny some itching powder for her birthday ron shouted above the melee you are going to get it genevra rose weasley no i not and dontuse my middle name ginny shouted back if you even try to get back at me ron weasley i will owl mum and you do not want to see her she smirked we ll see about that ron replied still scratching hey how come i am the only one not scratching james asked harry must have borrowed your robe lily replied harry come over here right now at the moment the itchy boys were loudly doing the hokey pokey as they scratched if they had to be so itchy they might as well make the best of the spotlight harry however left the group immediately lily dragged him into the hallway and making sure that james had not followed used a spell to counter the itching powder sorry about that there was double the powder on this one i wanted to deflate pot i mean james head she told him matter of factly no problem m lily he replied thanks for taking it off when will the others be itch free before lily could answer none other than ginny weasley interrupted them you took the itching spell off harry how could you ginny scolded playfully aw come on gin what have i ever done to you he asked he my son ginny i cantjust let him wallow in itchy embarrassment yet lily added it not what you have done but what you re going to do i worried about ginny replied and dontcall me gin like the prats do speaking of which you wouldnthappen to have seen my diary would you she narrowed her eyes what would make you think that harry evaded looking away for a moment well you re not pink so you must not have taken it yourself however one of the marauders could have taken it i dontknow runa remarked casually as she strolled up to them he looks pretty pink right now obviously harry was blushing he rescued himself by glancing at his watch oh look it time for breakfast i ll race you to the cafeteria he shouted sprinting down the hallway ginny strolled down the halls of hogwarts so familiar yet so unfamiliar she wished that the others would be in her classes instead she would be more alone than ever she was just glad that she had professor mcgonagalll class first as stern as the transfiguration teacher was at least she was a familiar face she walked into the classroom and took a seat near the back setting her books down she dipped her quill in ink and prepared for notes class would start in less than a minute hola est s i mean you are in my seat miss do you mind a girl asked her the girl was slightly on the taller side and she had soft brown eyes and black hair however what surprised ginny the most was her tan skin um i sorry i didntknow anyone else was sitting here she moved to the next seat over i ginny weasley by the way she added marianela she replied surprised i a transfer student from espa a andalucia actually although my mam came from galicia cool i one of the other transfer students from ginny searched desperately for a name boadicea school of magic my parents wanted me to get a taste of the irish way of life because i part irish but after the leprechauns couldntstop chasing me i decided to transfer with my friends i wanted to get away from my brothers but unfortunately i am the invisible one here even though my english is improving brothers i have five oh wait mcgonagalll coming indeed the formidable lady herself was entering the room i see we have a new student mrs mcgonagalll announced why dontyou introduce yourself ginny stood up awkwardly my name is ginny weasley and i am in gryffindor she announced before sitting down again all right now that that is taken care of let us get started today we will be turning our paper into swallows african or american ginny muttered under her breath remembering the monty python movie she watched with hermione over the summer harry followed ron and hermione into the history of magic class they were supposed to meet the others there it had taken them longer than usual due to sir cadogan annoying chatter but they managed to avoid peeves and at least they werentlate hermione come over here lily called hermione took a seat by lily runa and brenna were next in that row and remus was next to brenna surprise surprise james and sirius followed but they had saved seats for harry and ron this is going to be a boring class harry whispered to ron as their ghost of a teacher entered through the chalkboard he immediately set up his note taking quill with lots of paper with carbon paper underneath hermione had introduced him to the muggle wonder of carbon paper and fred and george had given harry the special quill for his birthday as a thanks for the money gift they still felt indebted to him for supplying the money to start their joke shop he didntknow whether or not to be glad when he saw a scrap of paper on his desk thus started a note passing session it a good thing you brought that quill ron yeah i know harry what leaving the marauders out of a note passing session padfoot it just like you to butt in on a conversation prongs well you butted in too prongs harry so you did prongs so nya nya padfoot so what are the plans for

school boadicea and we wanted to see if he was still here harry caught the name and realized that he ron hermione and ginny would all have to say they were from the same school after making a mental note to tell ron about boadicea and smiled at her to let her know that he understood all right well see you later bye he ran off to join the marauders and then proceeded to pile mounds of food on his plate he was starving okay this will seem totally random because it is but i ve finally found a way to remember how to spell weird you see it starts with we as in multiple personality disorders wow i

this chapter is dedicated to mary powell who died on april fools day 2005 just to be contrary i ll see you in heaven thanks reviewers i cantfind the words to say how much i appreciate you i mean it so nice to have reviews especially when they help i would have updated a day sooner but wouldntlet me log in last night besides i was feeling depressed from mary death she my friend mom and decided to

explain but that in a few chapters from now hey that one way to make sure you read it j k iamsiriusgrl thanks for reviewing yeah spring break is great for writing and updating too bad i had only 3 days shrugs at least that more than last year pleione thanks for reviewing and telling me about how you chose your name me well i took syllables that i liked and my friends figured out how to fit them together the best way eventually i added a middle and last name to make it seem more like an identity yep itching powder and deflationg muahaha too bad prednisone has the same effect on me the itching i trying to figure out why i enjoy writing about james even though i dislike arrogance maybe it because he does deflate eventually chapter 8 of hagrid hogsmeade and invisible ink harry sighed as he leafed through a potion book potions was his worst subject but harry was sick of moping around about his parent death now he could find a way to prevent it well perhaps he could if only things werentso confusing worse any solution was probably in the restricted section of the library however hermione had found information about nicholas flamel in the normal section why not this what with the long face harry he heard a voice behind him he turned around quickly oh er hi ginny i just looking at potions books do you have all your homework done she asked surprised he sighed you sound like hermione yes i have my homework done i just looking for well he trained off looking for what a way to save my parents ginny smiled gently a n surprising for a weasley i know everyone has to die sometime harry true but i dontknow it was hard enough having them dead when i never met them it worse now that i have i dontwant to change the future it was good for me to live at the dursley to get some humility i guess but i want to see my parents again ginny patted him reassuringly on the back i ll see what i can do she told him i sure hermione wouldntmind helping either she picked up a potions book and started flipping through it protection potions hey this might work better than my invisible ink charm in protecting my diary that is if i ever find it again she glared at the book as if it were responsible for her missing diary she skimmed through the other protection spells here one for protecting the ones you love when killed protecting someone or in an act against evil the person will turn into his animagi form as a ghost until the murderer dies it only works for animagi and possibly werewolves though we ll just have to turn the rest into animagi then ginny stared at him as if he were crazy i only helping you make one potion honestly harry harry smiled at her thanks gin you re the best obviously she huffed let go find ron and hermione then see if hagrid is around while i dontmiss his cooking she sighed ron i cantbelieve you mucking about when i am trying to get some work done hermione raged unlike some people i know i like to have my homework done early instead of finishing it fifteen minutes before the alarm clock goes off in the morning come on mione we re going to visit hagrid that all and i have my homework done sirius helped me now i know you ll fail hermione grumbled if you want to see hagrid does he know we re coming hermione asked honestly we re going to shock the poor giant i mean he doesntknow us in this time he wontmind really come on we re supposed to meet gin and harry in the library in two minutes unless of course you want to be a spoilsport then i leaving you to your stupid books they re not stupid wait did you say two minutes hermione asked panicking more like one with all your whining ron grumbled fortunately for him hermione was busy rushing around to put herself in order and did not hear his last comment come on ron let go she grabbed his arm and dragged him toward the library girls ron grumbled the foursome marched to hagrid cabin and knocked on the door hagrid are you there harry called a very surprised half giant opened the door er i wasntexpectin company tonight sorry about the mess the nifflers who are you he asked we re time travelers who know you in the future hermione replied harry james potter son these two are ginny and ron weasley and i am hermione granger a muggle born pleased to meet yer i think hagrid said scratching his head oh d ya want to come in and have a cup of tea i dunno ron said cautiously after all the nifflers oh they wontdo nobody harm hagrid interrupted nice creatures really it just that no one understands em with the double negative he correct ginny whispered to hermione who motioned for them to follow her in now mateys be nice to the guests hagrid admonished as two or three tugged on his long beard well um i dontget so many guests here i surprised i still know my own name he added as he put a huge pot of water over the fire so how do i know yer well you ll rescue me from the dursleys and take me to hogwarts harry put in they re my relatives you will be friendly to me even though i muggle born and put up with these two she winked at ron and ginny dontlisten to her she a scoundrel when she needs to be ginny teased she then realized that something was tugging on her hair aack a mouse is eating my hair she tugged at it but the mouse would not let go mione please help since you were so nice expelliarmus hermione replied immediately the mouse flew from her hair sorry about is manners he not so good with visitors my matey pounce hagrid apologized oh it all right ginny said sneaking a glare at pounce the mouse the tea should be hot now hagrid said happily he got up and dished out several cups of watery tea do you think it safe to drink harry whispered to ron doubt it ron whispered back just pretend to drink it hermione advised taking a pretend sip thanks so much for your hospitality hagrid yer welcome miss i haventhad company since dumbledore dropped in last week a mighty good headmaster that dumbledore is hagrid sighed the five chatted off and on for awhile before hagrid realized that he should be making rounds well i guess you d better go past dinnertime and i ve got to make rounds feel free to drop by again he added now be careful getting in you cantrisk ol filch seein ya we ll be fine it a long time until we re supposed to be locked in anyway hermione replied bye hagrid the others echoed her then followed her out of the cabin and towards the main building so lily will you go to hogsmeade with me this weekend james asked casually no no how many times do i have to tell you lily demanded always one more james grinned so who are you going with my friends of course she told him you have one problem they re going with us marauders doubtful runa loathes the ground black walks on true but she enjoys being with the time travelers well they can just stay with us girls not your gang they could but we re too charming he teased her lily merely glared at him is this a head meeting or not she asked pointedly technically any conversation between the two of us is a head meeting no matter what we are talking about simply because we are the heads james replied grinning lily rolled her eyes now you re asking for it pink or purple she asked maybe both i think she was about to wave her wand when ginny walked into the room can you believe what that stupid mouse did she raged upon seeing her chewed up hair lily and james both hid a smile what happened hagrid pet pounce the mouse need i say more oh you poor thing lily sympathized i had detention once cleaning the mouse cages and some of them are so vicious you had detention james asked amazed well let just say a certain slytherin professor couldnthandle my intelligence now this i have to hear james said leaning back in his chair there nothing much to the story i corrected the former potions master about the ingredients in polyjuice potion and he didnttake too kindly to that i dontsuppose so ginny snickered yeesh hermione doesnteven get a chance to correct our potions master who that james asked snape she replied he hates gryffindors especially harry why that git what is he doing there teaching potter lily protested torturing his students in the dungeon ginny replied lily couldnthelp but laugh she could imagine well what severus snape would look like if he was irritated with a student now do you see what i was saying james asked i suppose she sighed but he would be nicer to harry if you werentsuch a git to him james made a face if i werenthe d still hex me lilikins dontcall me that she yelled go to hog shut up ginny interrupted what do we do about my hair she demanded well you could always dye it pink james suggested do you have any useful suggestions she asked lily bit her lip thinking i haventtried a hair growing charm yet she commented i think i could do that though if you want it back badly enough it ll grow pretty quickly when great aunt minny cut my hair i was so angry that it grew overnight james told her smiling at the memory hey the same thing happened to harry ginny said he also exploded his aunt for insulting you guys that my boy james beamed honestly he could have gotten in real trouble for that lily worried hey he was angry ginny smirked he couldnthelp that what time is it eight thirty lily replied uh oh i guess i had better finish my potions essay ginny said i have half a scroll to go i ll catch you later she added running out of the room i still cantbelieve you had a detention lils james laughed you d better believe it lily replied and dontcall me lils pot i mean james i always wondered who made that flaming cauldron follow him around no one will believe you if you tell them lily warned him now we have business to discuss right whether the v day ball aka back to hogwarts ball will have giant snowballs chasing everyone around or inflatable jello lily glared at him and threateningly drew her wand i was kidding james told her however i do think that ice crystals would be a good decoration he responded saying a random wintery item to save himself from possible hexing lucky for you that you came up with a good idea she told him he grinned dontlet that get to your head she added he sighed inwardly but kept smiling at least she had liked my idea he thought maybe moony should train me in manners nothing else seemed to work lily sighed in relief as she hid in the closet near the gryffindor head rooms it had been days since she had time alone and her frayed temperament showed it everything was so confusing having a son with none other than potter showing up and meeting his friends as well even worse potter james himself was acting oddly he was still arrogant but he was also funny and strangely sweet lily wanted to kick herself for saying that she pulled her robes more closely around her the closet was chilly then she remembered that she could use a warming charm calidus she muttered as she swished her wand even though she was warm she still curled up into a ball and tried to relax now that her homework was done she had all the time in the world she ignored her growling stomach and set her mind on the events that had passed soon she gave into her drowsiness and fell asleep hours later james was worried no one knew where lily had been for hours and she wasntasleep he took out the marauder map and tapped it with his wand i solemnly swear i am up to no good he said immediately the formerly blank parchment showed a map of hogwarts he searched for the dot that said lily evans she was in a closet of all places the one near the head rooms i hope she hasntbeen kidnapped or something he thought to himself mischief managed he whispered wiping the map clean before running toward the closet he opened the closet carefully not sure what he would find instead of a figure bound with ropes and a gag he found the redhead curled up into a ball smiling in her sleep lily wake up he whispered gently prodding her she groaned in her sleep not stirred in the least he sighed he wasntabout to leave her there asleep and alone so he picked her up carefully and took her to the head suite he rapped on the door quietly still holding lily hermione cracked the door open she was sleeping in a closet james informed her quietly i just wanted to bring her here she nodded suspiciously but quietly opened the door further ginny already asleep come on in she whispered he followed her to lily bed she pulled the covers back so that james could set her down lily immediately grabbed a pillow and held it close to herself after pulling the blankets over her james leaned down to kiss her cheek goodnight lily he whispered before leaving the room i hope you enjoyed it please r r i ll try to update at least weekly sometimes less i ll post chapter 9 sooner because of the delay for chapter 8 well press the pretty blue button please disclaimer marianela brenna and runa belong to me as for harry potter and the rest well they re rolling along merrily until j k releases 6 in july and puts them through more angsty stuff great that sounded pessimistic i plan to read it i number 100 something on the hold list at my library does anyone else wonder why the old man presumably

maybe they ll start when there are more chapters shrugs yes james is maturing a little mainly because remus and harry are keeping him in line it not fun to have your parents yelling at each other thankfully mine donttoo much besides i dontwant to move this up beyond k roguehobbit 1 hmm i ve actually had cocoa puffs only once right now my chocolate rations consist of hot chocolate and icing on graham crackers mom hid the scant easter candy from me and i resisting the urge to search for it it helped that i found two pieces of candy from the fall which i shared with cathy in music theory evil class 2 i enjoy making arrogance deflating comments so fun i hate arrogance even though i think i have some 3 yes harry trying to change the time line but not completely he grown up enough to understand that his parents had to die for him to be able to defeat moldie voldie sometime in the future anyway i ll move on to chapter 9 much ado about hogsmeade part 1 alias runa finds the perfect sayings mione lily ginny wake up runa voice warbled into their dorm room interrupting their pleasant sleep she had entered through the portal which was now revised to let only certain people pass through huh lily groaned rolling over hermione sat up and rubbed her eyes ginny was still completely out of it what are you doing here this early it a hogsmeade day silly runa replied brenna woke me up when she took a shower so it time for you to get up and ready what time is it lily grumbled sitting up half past six hermione answered ever the know it all couldntyou have let me sleep she grumbled lying down again and pulling the blanket over her head runa walked over to her and pulled the covers away well you re already awake lils so there no use of that at least we can all wake ginny up lily sighed and got out of bed all right what shall i wear today she asked throwing her closet door open nevermind it doesntmatter of course it does runa exclaimed horrified by her friend comment let see how about a miniskirt and no lily barked i will not wear a miniskirt when i have to traipse around hogsmeade all day being stared at by moronic adolescent males she grabbed a pair of jeans and her favorite green t shirt no that wontdo at all runa complained after lily changed i know she flicked her wand and muttered a spell lily could not hear what was that all about she asked before looking in the mirror she groaned when she saw what was now written on her shirt instead of advertising bertie bott all flavor beans it said so i a witch you still fell for me hermione laughed you re next runa told the witch who was also wearing plain casual clothing take this off runes lily pleaded it really not funny it demeaning true runa sighed here how about this one she flicked her wand again now her shirt said geeks make the best girlfriends ugh lily muttered while i agree with that simply because we re too intelligent to fall for the most idiotic males i must ask you to change it to something less flirty ugh this time hermione flicked her wand this time lily was much happier with the results the shirt now said smile it confuses people hmm i could go for that one myself runa mused good job hermione although i still like mine it your turn now she smiled mischievously and flicked her wand hermione mouth opened wide in indignation i prefer redheads she raged albeit in a quiet voice so she didntwake ginny honestly removeo she muttered honestly runes you re messed up thank you she smiled cheekily however if you prefer non flirty stuff like spoilsport evans i ll have to find something else for you lily mock glared and then smiled at hermione she been reading too many muggle magazines she explained runa did not hear that as she was contemplating the perfect saying for hermione shirt slackers unite tomorrow wontwork at all she muttered how about bewitchingly brilliant no that wontdo either she sighed it hard coming up with the right saying for you so don t hermione responded cheekily i ve got it runa said flicking her wand except i ll need to use the back too you ll have to put your hair up sorry mione on the front of her shirt was written how do you entertain an idiot for an hour see back of shirt however the back said how do you entertain an idiot for an hour see front of shirt hermione grinned oh this is perfect thanks runes i wonder how long ron will be entertained by it now let wake up ginny the aforementioned weasley was snoring softly on her cot oblivious to the world around her aqueas she flicked her wand ginny woke up and immediately shot a hex directly across from her fortunately for the others it hit a wall which was now bright purple why did you wake me up like that ginny demanded i wasntgoing to risk pulling the covers off much less touching you i remember what happened the last time i did that hermione replied as it is look what you did to the wall indeed hermione had made the mistake of waking genevra weasley up without magic and had wound up in the infirmary from brutal hexes ginny had apologized when she realized what she had done to hermione but hermione had learned her lesson sorry about that remember that i ve lived with fred and george weasley though she explained runa rubbed her hands in wicked anticipation writing a saying for ginevra weasley shirt would be fun ginny changed quickly throwing on black jeans combat boots and a black t shirt ooh runa squealed flicking her wand and muttering the same incantation this is perfect ginny shirt now sported the saying i not insane it just that the voices in my head are driving me crazy in red ink i like it ginny announced smiling crazily good now for your makeup runa said with a frightening gleam in her eye nooo ginny screamed i too young to die hermione help me runa was about to chase her when brenna walked in immediately she flicked her wand at brenna noo brenna moaned as she looked down at her shirt oh you know you like it runa retorted even if you didn t we need to get makeup on these gals after all it the first hogsmeade weekend of the year harry wake up james shook him everyone else is up well except for ron and padfoot he amended harry groaned w what going on he mumbled hogsmeade weekend the first one of the year even moony is excited he added harry bolted into a seated position and reached for his glasses only to see remus rushing around looking for the right shirt to wear come on moony the last one looked fine you re acting like a girl i bet runa spends much more time picking out her clothes thank you very much remus retorted but he stuck with the shirt james suggested who gets to wake whom he asked james mischievously let wake padfoot together but only after good idea harry grab the shaving cream remus told him all right harry replied rushing into the bathroom to fetch said item here it is shall i do the honors james asked remus nodded harry handed him the shaving cream which james squirted generously all over his face well that covers up the drool quite nicely he quipped remus and harry rolled their eyes now for the water remus said pointing his wand aqueas sirius sat up and screamed waking ron eh what a sleepy ron mumbled where the death eater nowhere sirius just woke up wet harry assured him just sirius protested indignantly i ll have you know that is a most unpleasant sensation whatever padfoot james replied grinning at least you can get right up and shave now it hogsmeade weekend by the way yaaaaaaaaaaaaay sirius shouted bolting out of bed and running around in circles only to trip on one of remus discarded shirts oof watch where you re going padfoot remus told him i only have so many shirts and unlike someone i know i donthave millions of galleons lying around he teased i ll get you for this moony sirius told him save it for the girls okay james suggested we need to play another prank on them let stock up at zonko s oh i ll still have plenty for the girls sirius assured them i still getting you and moony back harry since i forcing james to make me your godfather well i ll let you off save it for the girls harry suggested after all i sure they ve got it in for us that for sure with ginny there ron agreed not to mention hermione we re the marauders sirius replied arrogantly we can beat a bunch of girls no problem pride goes before a fall mate remus told him so it looks like there a mud puddle with your name on it padfoot i ll still get you moony so what are we waiting for james asked hogsmeade here we come so girls do any of you have robes or dresses for the v day ball runa asked erm no hermione told her honestly we didnthave much time to pack you see she was alarmed when she noticed a dangerous glint in runa eyes what have i gotten myself into she thought i sure we ll be fine though ginny added hastily it not like like it that important not important runa raged her eyes flashing dangerously whoa watch it runes brenna warned quietly she hugged her cloak to herself still embarrassed about what runa had put on her shirt dontworry about it bren you re up too you know runa replied you too lils you donthave to make us your personal projects you know lily informed her i know i just like to she smiled i also good at what i do m dears her smile grew as she thought about the struggle to put makeup on ginny as it was she didnteven have foundation on and still looked like herself a n that evil stuff i ve never used no no brenna groaned isntthis embarrassing t shirt enough she complained no let go in now she dragged brenna and ginny into a dress robes shop lily and hermione followed crossing their fingers there were more dress robes and muggle style dresses than any of them other than runa had ever seen before ginny wanted to feel nauseated but then she realized that there were dresses of all styles she even saw a few that she wouldntmind being caught dead in or even perhaps alive however she did not want runa to know that now ladies take ten minutes to browse on your own i ll be going back and forth among you also looking for the perfect outfits for you you sound like a drill sergeant on a reality show hermione commented a what and what a drill sergeant anyway runa asked nevermind hermione and the others dispersed trying to avoid runa who could be obsessed to the point of insanity when it came to fashion while that was sometimes an asset to the troupe it could also be a bit bothersome fifteen minutes later runa had rounded them off to the fitting rooms honestly runes you re insane lily protested as she tried on a slinky yellow number this dress is disgusting i doing you a favor now come out she ordered lily scowled but did so eww that is atrocious next dress lils try something white lily rolled her eyes but knew that this was runa area of expertise at any rate she was glad to be rid of that disgusting scrap of cloth being advertised as a dress ginny came wearing a gothic punk styled black dress i kind of like this she commented all i need is a black leather armband with spikes and some other jewelry get it but you re wearing something else for the valentines day ball runa said curtly it does suit you in a punk ish way though you ll scare ron to death hermione commented that should be reason enough to get it i know he can be soo annoying mione you really need to straighten him up oh believe me gin i ve tried i ve tried teaching harry a thing or two as well hermione come out now no yes no please all right hermione sighed stepping out she wore a silvery blue gown that fit her nicely with sparkles and sequins across the front moonbeams i like it mione hurray no more trying on dresses hermione shouted actually there just one more you need to try on what if there another occasion where you need to dress nicely before we can shop again runa worried all right but we re going to zonko after this after a few appearance altering charms lily added evans weasley o brian come out for inspection definitely a drill sergeant hermione muttered so what do you think please press the pretty purplish blue button you know you want to you know i starting not to care so much what people think about me as a person you see i have many facets to my personality but most people just see my serious side and perhaps my nervous side but today after church i played chase with these little kids i sort of ran slowly spinning around hoping that jackie would tag me anyway eventually i was sick of her not tagging me i knew she i did one of my stage falls and spilled my tea her older brother whom i used to have a crush on and only sorta do now he dating a friend were watching so was their dad my mom wanted to know if i was all right mentally though she apologized later so nice to be appreciated for wackiness auramistealia ps roguehobbit i ll try to beta read your chrono fic first chapter soon really forget about hw evil stuff hope you have a good first week back at school well as good as school
